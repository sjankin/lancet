INNOVATION -DRIVEN GROWTH LOTOS Group Integrated Annual Report 2015 PDF version LOTOS Group Integrated Annual Report 2015 01 2015 at the LOTOS Group 1/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Letter from the President of the Board Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Shareholders it is my pleasure to present the 2015 Integrated Annual Report of LOTOS Group. Last year saw many political and economic developments with a signiﬁcant bearing on the global macroeconomic situation. Despite oversupply, global oil output remains high, resulting in continued pressure on prices. Large oil and gas producers are faced with an unfavourable business environment, with the falling prices making them increase expenditure on production to generate expected revenues. Grupa LOTOS remains a vital element of the national economy, with the overarching goal, as deﬁned in our mission, to enhance Poland’s energy security and foster the country’s stable economic growth. We view this as our duty, which we fulﬁl by delivering the highest-quality fuels, oils and other reﬁning products to the market. In 2015, our LIFO-based EBITDA (operating proﬁt before depreciation and amortisation) was PLN 2,156m (2014: PLN 1,391m), with operating proﬁt (EBIT) at PLN 423m and LIFO-based EBIT at PLN 702m. Over the same period, we generated PLN 1,488m in cash ﬂows from operating activities (2014: PLN 1,381m) – a visible proof of LOTOS’ capability to generate cash on its core business. Despite low oil prices, access to own sources remains fundamental to us. With each tonne of oil produced by our facilities, we become less dependent on imports, sudden price movements, and pressures from suppliers. LOTOS pursues a strategy designed to reduce Poland’s dependence on imports from one source. This approach to national energy security is supported by the gradual increase in oil supplies by sea and expansion of our own upstream segment. Eﬃcient sustainable development of any large oil company is based on two pillars − upstream, which comprises own production of oil and gas, and downstream, with state-of-the-art reﬁning technologies employed to obtain the highest possible amounts of products most valued by the market. Thanks to our consistently pursued investment projects and precisely deﬁned growth programme, as well as our experienced and professional managers and employees, we now operate one of Europe’s most advanced reﬁneries and own growing reserves of hydrocarbons. In 2015, LOTOS launched production from the B8 ﬁeld using the LOTOS Petrobaltic platform. As a result, with the acquisitions in Norway and production from the B8 and B3 ﬁelds in the Baltic Sea and Lithuanian deposits, we have increased our hydrocarbon output to nearly 30 thousand boe/d. 2/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group In 2015, LOTOS also started construction of a delayed coking under the EFRA Project (Eﬃcient Reﬁning). The unit will produce an additional 900 thousand tonnes of fuels a year and will increase our margin by approximately USD 2 per barrel of crude processed. Thus, in line with the Polish government’s current policy, LOTOS will boost its innovativeness and competitiveness on Europe’s challenging reﬁning market. As at the end of 2015, the LOTOS retail network comprised 476 stations, up by 35 year on year. In 2016, we plan to see the network grow to more than 500 sites, gradually approaching the optimum saturation level. This year we will also open the 20th Motorway Service Area, thus becoming the second largest operator of such facilities in Poland. Last year, all LOTOS Optima stations and some premium stations underwent a change of their visual scheme. In 2016, we intend to proceed with standardization of our stores and expand our range of food services. We also plan to signiﬁcantly increase the portfolio of goods oﬀered at the stores and services available at the stations to expand our customer oﬀering. LOTOS employs a modern sports sponsorship model. In February 2015, Grupa LOTOS become the Major Sponsor of the Polish National Football Team. As evidenced by the team’s performance at EURO 2016, this was a sound decision. 2016 will see LOTOS enter a path of new growth. We will prioritize research, development and innovation as part of the ‘Responsible Development Plan’ adopted by the Polish government. We intend to ﬁnish growth-oriented projects currently being implemented across various segments, optimize our operations and enhance our eﬃciency to achieve improved ﬁnancial results and start paying dividends again. Kind regards, Robert Pietryszyn President of the Board Chief Executive Oﬃcer Grupa LOTOS S.A. 3/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Letter from the Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board 2015 was a challenging year for the global oil industry. The largest international players on the oil and gas markets were forced to freeze planned or outright abandon pending investment programmes. In this diﬃcult environment, Grupa LOTOS successfully demonstrated its organisational eﬃciency. Nevertheless, it saw a drop in revenue and total sales, both obvious consequences of plummeting oil prices and product margins. As at the end of 2015, LOTOS operated a chain of 476 service stations, with 35 new facilities added over the year. Last year was marked by stable growth and initiation of optimisation eﬀorts, including measures geared towards increasing sales eﬃciency. Boasting 18 Motorway Service Areas, LOTOS is the second largest operator of such facilities in Poland. 2015 also saw growth in domestic sales of aviation fuel, with LOTOS-Air BP Polska having a presence at ﬁve Polish airports. Another point of praise is the continued improvement of the operating eﬃciency of the Gdańsk reﬁnery units. Leveraging state-of-the-art crude oil processing solutions and technologies, Grupa LOTOS was able to increase yields of high-margin products. The Grupa LOTOS’ consistent eﬀorts to diversify supply sources, particularly focused on growing the share of oil from own deposits, reinforce Poland’s energy security. The main oil and gas deposits held by LOTOS are located under the Baltic and Northern Seas’ bottoms, making their development all the more challenging both in terms of organisational and technical solutions. In 2015, our daily output nearly reached 30,000 boe/d, a notable result on the national economic scale. Coupled with resumed supplies from the Near East, this represents a major step towards building Poland’s new, more independent energy policy. Grupa LOTOS’ model of operating as a ‘corporate citizen’ has proven itself successful. Fostering relations with local communities, supporting worthy cultural and social events, as well as sports sponsorships all go a long way in creating a climate which serves the interests of the Polish economy by establishing a feedback loop between the society and business. Grupa LOTOS’ partnership with the Polish national football team and the latter’s excellent performance during EURO 2016 ﬁnal tournament is a case in point. 4/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group I believe that in 2016, the Company will introduce new, more eﬀective ideas to innovate itself and, in the long-run, the entire Polish economy.

Diversiﬁcation In order to enhance Poland’s security in the ﬁeld of energy and to strengthen LOTOS Group position in the sector of exploration and production, with the opportunities and higher for further growth in subsequent years, we seek to progressively diversify sources of production raw materials and increase the size of our hydrocarbon production areas. In 2015, we exceeded the production target of 24 thousand boe per day, set in the LOTOS Production Group’s Business Strategy for 2011−2015. This was made possible primarily by the acquisition of the Sleipner assets in Norway and launch of production from the B8 capital ﬁeld, which is the largest oil ﬁeld in the Polish part of the Baltic Sea. Also, new ﬁelds in the Norwegian Continental Shelf oﬀer prospective recovery of the capital frozen in the tax asset on the YME project in Norway. Within next years, our production potential may increase materially on the back of e.g. the completion of the development of B8 ﬁeld and development of the gas-rich B4 and B6 ﬁelds on the Baltic Sea, completion of inland projects in Poland, i.e. in Górowo Iławeckie and Kamień Pomorski, as well as the development of the ﬁelds in the portfolio in Norway (Utgard, former Alfa Sentral, and Frigg Gamma Delta), prospective new development projects. Increased The Grupa LOTOS reﬁnery has for a long time ranked among the most energy eﬃcient European reﬁneries, as conﬁrmed by the SOLOMON Associates’ ranking for innovation in 2014 comparing the energy eﬃciency of reﬁneries all over the world. In 2015, the production reﬁnery’s energy intensity remained largely ﬂat on the previous year, which attests to processes Grupa LOTOS’ consistent pursuit of eﬃcient energy management. Our competitiveness is also evidenced by the fact that the Gdańsk plant belongs to the group of 25% of the best world’s reﬁneries in terms of the level of processing margin, Production eﬀectiveness of the plant engineering services, and availability of processing units. capital We owe our market advantages to eﬃcient use of the reﬁnery’s expanded Intellectual processing capacity. A turning point in terms of the capacity growth and improvement in the ﬂexibility of the reﬁnery units was the 10+ Programme, capital completed in 2011. Another milestone is the EFRA Project, commenced in 2015, which is expected to earn Grupa LOTOS a place among the most technologically advanced reﬁneries in the world, with very high yields of high-margin products. 13/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Environmental As an oil business with potential for innovation, in order to improve the competitive edge of our individual business areas and to limit adverse environmental impacts, dimension of our we engage in activities to develop technical and technological innovations based on projects our own research and in cooperation with partners. To this end we have partnered with both scientiﬁc institutions and energy sector companies. Grupa LOTOS is the Natural capital leader of the HESTOR project designed to determine the eﬃciency of storing surplus electricity in the form of hydrogen obtained from electrolysis using renewable energy sources (RES) and then pumped into salt caverns for later use for power supply and technological purposes. The pro-environmental eﬀect of the project will Intellectual be a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This project has been carried out within capital GEKON scheme, i.e. Generator of Ecological Concepts. We also conduct research on replacing fossil fuels. The analyses refer to the opportunities to use vegetable and animal oil in HVO technology, i.e. Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil. Improved The considerable advancement in our operational eﬃciency is a proof that we successfully delivered on the objectives set in the Business Strategy for 2011−2015. creditworthiness Furthermore, the high reﬁning margins allow us to generate robust cash ﬂows from operating activities and to materially reduce the net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA Financial capital ratio. The improved ﬁnancial results, combined with a strong position on the liquid fuels market and stable and safe shareholding structure (with more than 50% of shares held by the State Treasury), have a positive eﬀect on our creditworthiness. This is conﬁrmed by the credit rating BBBwith a stable outlook assigned to Grupa LOTOS by the EuroRating agency. High-quality In our operations, we make every eﬀort to oﬀer the highest quality of services and products. In 2015, we introduced innovative products to the Polish road construction products and market: rubber-modiﬁed bitumens (MODBIT CR) and WMA (Warm Mix Asphalt) road services bitumens. WMA ﬁts in with the world’s most popular technological trends, aimed at minimizing negative environmental impacts and reducing energy consumption. One Manufactured of our strategic objectives was to strengthen our position in the Polish retail fuel market. We closed 2015 with a 10.5% share of sales volumes in Poland, which puts capital us in a good, third place. We are committed to making the use of our service stations satisfying our customers’ expectations. As a socially responsible business, we take steps to build value of not only our Company, but also of its environment. In 2015, Social and we organized the ‘Helping while Refuelling’ campaign, which proved a considerable relationship success. It was the ﬁrst-ever cause-related marketing project in the fuel industry in capital Poland that run on such a large scale. Natural capital 14/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Professional For almost ten years, the LOTOS Group has consistently worked to put corporate social responsibility principles in practice in all areas of its business, seeking to approach to respond in the best way possible to the social challenges of its stakeholders. At corporate social Grupa LOTOS, we have comprehensively managed corporate social responsibility responsibility since 2008. A milestone in the process was the development of a complete long-term Corporate Social Responsibility strategy for the LOTOS Group for 2012−2015, and − further to that − putting in place an end-to-end sustainable development Social and management system. Our commitment to social responsibility gained a further relationship capital professional dimension with the establishment of the LOTOS Foundation in 2015. Its objective is to support initiatives to develop infrastructure and make a positive diﬀerence for local communities, particularly in regions where companies of the LOTOS Group operate. 15/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS Group’s reserves Ample oil and gas resources A well-diversiﬁed portfolio of production licences is what gives us a competitive advantage. Our hydrocarbon exploration, production and sale operations are located in Poland (mainly crude oil and small quantities of associated gas), Norway (gas and condensate, i.e. light crude), and Lithuania (crude oil). At the LOTOS Group, the E&P activities are carried on through LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. and its subsidiaries, LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS and AB LOTOS Geonafta.

Since 1975, we have developed organically by expanding the range of products and services, and grown through acquisitions in Poland and abroad to enhance our production and processing capacities. It has been 40 years in 2015 since the Gdańsk reﬁnery had its tanks ﬁlled with the ﬁrst batch of crude oil to start up the fuel unit. The decision on the reﬁnery construction was made in May 1971. In 1972, an enterprise under the name Raﬁneria Nafty Gdańsk w Budowie (Gdańsk Oil Reﬁnery under Construction) was formed. Within four years, a modern facility occupying an area of 220 ha, with designed annual processing capacity of 3 million tonnes of crude oil (now, after expansion, it is more than three times higher), was built to supply the Polish market with fuel and oils. In 1976, the reﬁnery changed its name to Gdańskie Zakłady Raﬁneryjne and the manufacture of motor gasolines was launched. A year later, the plant started to manufacture motor oils, a ﬂagship product of Grupa LOTOS to this day. In 1980, production of aviation fuel and industrial bitumens began, which is a continuing business as well. A decade later, the name of mineral oil manufactured since 1976 was changed to LOTOS. In 1991, Gdańskie Zakłady Raﬁneryjne was transformed into a joint-stock company under the name Raﬁneria Gdańska S.A. The company changed its name to Grupa LOTOS S.A. in 2003, two years before the debut of its stock on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The initial public oﬀering allowed it to raise more than one billion złoty in proceeds, which were applied towards e.g. the implementation of the Comprehensive Technical Development Programme (10+ Programme) and the acquisition of controlling stakes in reﬁneries in the south of Poland and in Przedsiębiorstwo Poszukiwań i Eksploatacji Złóż Ropy i Gazu PETROBALTIC S.A., an exploration and production company. In the recent decade, one of the key developments driving the dynamic growth of Grupa LOTOS and its competitive edge was the 10+ Programme carried out in 2007−2010. Valued at PLN 5.6bn, it was one of the largest investments in the Polish economy in 2000−2010. The 10+ Programme enabled Grupa LOTOS to increase its annual crude oil processing capacity from 6m to 10.5m tonnes, and the technologies implemented as part of the project enhanced the quality of fuels and reduced negative impact on the environment. In order to increase its production potential, the LOTOS Group made a series of acquisitions abroad. In 2011, it acquired LOTOS Geonafta, the leader of crude oil production from onshore deposits in Lithuania. In 2013, as a result of the acquisition of Heimdal assets, LOTOS Norge secured Grupa LOTOS an interest in 14 exploration and production licences, as well as direct access to one of the key gas hubs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The ﬁeld is a strategic area for exporting natural gas from Norway to Western Europe and United Kingdom. The gas sold through the Heimdal platform represents 15−20% of total natural gas exports from Norway. 19/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Scale of operations International reach The LOTOS Group is one of Central and Eastern Europe’s major and most eﬃcient oil companies and the second largest producer of fuels in Poland. The coastal location of its plants ensures direct access to the sea, resulting in higher ﬂexibility in terms of feedstock supply and lower costs of logistics in maritime transport. Grupa LOTOS is the only producer in Poland with access to hydrocarbons in Poland’s Exclusive Economic Zone of the Baltic Sea. Other regions where we are engaged in petroleum production include the Norwegian Continental Shelf and Lithuania (onshore). As a vertically-integrated organization, the LOTOS Group operates based on two reporting segments: upstream and downstream. Upstream comprises activities related to the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas reserves, and crude oil and natural gas production. segment The downstream comprises production and processing of reﬁned petroleum products and their wholesale and retail sale, as well as auxiliary, transport and service activities. segment 20/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group 28,369 10,2 * million barrels per day* tonnes production of annual oil throughput hydrocarbons * Including average daily output from the acquired Sleipner assets attributable to the LOTOS Group, as of the eﬀective date of the acquisition (January 1st 2015) Geographical presence As at the end of the period, apart from Grupa LOTOS (the Parent with registered oﬃce in Gdańsk, managing the Gdańsk reﬁnery), the LOTOS Group included 15 other companies operating under the LOTOS brand, two of them seated abroad: in Lithuania (AB LOTOS Geonafta) and in Norway (LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS). Geographical reach of the LOTOS Group’s operations Our products and markets 21/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our products and markets Key products oﬀered by the LOTOS Group are: unleaded gasoline, diesel oil and light fuel oil, heavy fuel oil, bitumens, aviation fuel, naphtha, propane-butane LPG, base oils and lubricating oils, i.e. industrial and engine oils. Key markets for our reﬁned petroleum products include Poland and countries in Western and Northern Europe, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, United Kingdom, France, Estonia, Denmark and the Czech Republic. Most of the natural gas accompanying production is sold within the Capital Group.

Strengths of High distillate rate: a large share of fuels in the product mix and focus on light and medium distillates, which enables the Company to successfully adjust its Grupa LOTOS’ output to the domestic demand structure and exports opportunities. reﬁnery: Location: the reﬁnery is located on the coast of the Baltic Sea, which is a strategic advantage given the proximity of and the direct pipeline connection with the handling infrastructure of Port Północny (a part of the Gdańsk Seaport located on the Gdańsk Bay), and gives the Company a major competitive edge in the region in terms of logistics (access to feedstock and product sales channels). Unique combination of supply channels, guaranteeing simultaneous access to feedstock supplies by road (from Russia) and via PERN Przyjaźń S.A.’s pipeline network, as well as by sea, from numerous countries and the LOTOS Group’s own ﬁelds. With access to two supply channels, we are able to use diﬀerent supply sources and respond ﬂexibly to changes in petroleum product and crude oil prices, and can eﬀectively diversify the types of crude processed at the reﬁnery.

The highest increase in sale volumes, just like in previous years, was recorded for diesel oil. Its sale volume was 4,853 thousand tonnes in 2015, reaching 44.1% share in total sale volume.

To address the upcoming changes in the reporting process deﬁned at the European Union level, in 2015 we improved the methods and procedures we apply to create reports, deﬁne key areas for our company and its stakeholders, and present an integrated approach to building value for our stakeholders.

The capitals used to deﬁne the value creation model were chosen by reference to the guidelines of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). They include: Financial capital Manufactured capital Intellectual capital Human capital Social and relationship capital Natural capital Advantages resulting from the adoption of the value creation model for the LOTOS Group We have more knowledge of how to eﬀectively use the capitals and relations between them in order to build value for our company and its stakeholders. This follows from better understanding of the relations between activities focused on the sustainable development of the LOTOS Group and activities undertaken to generate value in such areas as revenue and operating margin growth, asset eﬃciency improvement, or satisfaction of our owners’ and other stakeholders’ expectations.

The responsible ones awarded with inclusion in the RESPECT index In 2015, for the ninth time Grupa LOTOS shares became a constituent of the WSE’s RESPECT Index – Central and Eastern Europe’s ﬁrst index of socially responsible companies. It comprises stocks of companies that show commitment to best management standards in corporate and information governance, as well as investor relations, and that act responsibly on environmental, social, and labour issues. Grupa LOTOS has been present in the RESPECT Index since its inception in 2009. To date, the WSE has announced nine editions of the RESPECT Index. The latest comprises 23 companies and will be valid until December 21st 2015. More information on the RESPECT Index What does it mean to us to be included in the RESPECT Index? For Grupa LOTOS, each of the values represented by the letters making up the word ‘RESPECT’ is reﬂected in its everyday business practices, and as a constituent of the RESPECT Index, we see them as central to our understanding of social responsibility on the capital market. More information 48/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Acting innovatively – ﬁnancially stable The drop in revenue in 2015 was caused primarily by falling prices of crude oil and petroleum products on global markets, driving down revenue in both upstream and downstream segments (average selling prices of petroleum products fell by 26.5%). Sales volumes, however, were up. In Poland, the increase was mainly attributable to rising volumes of diesel oil sold through wholesale and retail channels, higher sales of bunker fuel following changes in the sulfur content requirements in the SECA area, and increased sales of LPG. Export sales grew, supported by very attractive reﬁning margins. As a result, in 2015, it was proﬁtable to maximise production abroad even at prices lower than on the domestic market.

A year-on-year increase of PLN 1,425m in gross proﬁt achieved mainly thanks to higher decrease in the cost of sales than in the revenue In 2015, cost of sales reported by the LOTOS Group stood at PLN 20,249.0m (down 26.3% on 2014). In the same period, the estimated unit cost of sales was PLN 1,803/tonne (down 32.0% on 2014). The unit sales margin in 2015 came in at PLN 219/tonne (up 119.0% on 2014). The LOTOS Group’s consolidated gross proﬁt for 2015 was PLN 2,460.4m (up PLN 1,425.1m on 2014). Higher distribution costs resulting from growing sales volumes and foreign exchange movements Distribution costs grew by PLN 122.8m (up 10.6% on 2014), chieﬂy on the back of 8.4% higher sales volumes and higher average USD/PLN exchange rate during the year (up 19.7% on 2014). Net other expenses 49/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group In 2015, the LOTOS Group reported net other expenses of PLN 293.0m, including chieﬂy PLN 161m in the provisions for the risk related to the challenging of the right to deduct VAT by the tax authorities.1 Net other expenses were also strongly aﬀected by the recognition of impairment losses of approximately PLN 69m on Lithuanian assets related to the AB LOTOS Geonafta Group’s deposits, an impairment loss of approximately PLN 12m on the Sambia E area, and an impairment loss of PLN 8m on service stations. Other factors included the ca. PLN 15m charge to expenses representing the net value of liquidated intangible exploration and evaluation assets – Norwegian licences (PL362, PL035B, PL503), expenditure write-oﬀs and costs related to the B8 project (ca. PLN 41m), and remeasurement of the decommissioning provision as a result of the ca. PLN 10m increase in the estimated cost of decommissioning of the MOPU (Mobile Production Oﬀshore Unit) from the Yme ﬁeld in Norway. 1 Pursuant to the decision of the Tax Audit Oﬃce; see Note 9.4 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for 2015. Operating proﬁt The LOTOS Group’s operating proﬁt for 2015, totalling PLN 423.4m, included a PLN 449.0m operating proﬁt in the downstream segment, oﬀset by a PLN -57.3m operating loss in the upstream segment. In 2015, the LOTOS Group signiﬁcantly reduced operating losses in the upstream segment and at the same time reported a proﬁt in the downstream segment, despite lower revenue earned in both segments.

The impact of non-recurring items was smaller than in 2014, which translated into the LOTOS Group’s lower operating loss of PLN 57.3m. The year-on-year change in EBITDA followed from a PLN 101.2m reduction in depreciation and amortization.

The key factors contributing to the year-on-year change in operating result included PLN 450.9m inventory write-downs recognized in 2014 and the related lower cost of products sold in H1 2015. At the same time, a plunge in crude oil and petroleum products prices in H2 2015, and remeasurement of inventories of raw materials, products, semi-ﬁnished products and merchandise held at the end of 2015, performed to reﬂect the current prices, reduced the operating result by PLN 264.2m (inventory writedown in 2015). LOTOS Group’ net loss reduction In 2015, the LOTOS Group considerably improved its operating performance and reduced the net loss.

In-263.3 2015, the negative eﬀect of ﬁnance costs (mainly exchange diﬀerences and interest-584.1 on debt and commissions) on the net proﬁt/(loss) was ampliﬁed by a decrease in deferred tax assets, following from partial expiry and loss of the right to oﬀset tax losses brought forward. In 2014, the adverse eﬀect of ﬁnance activity totalling PLN 730.7m was partly oﬀset by the positive impact of an increase in deferred tax assets. -1,393 -1,466.4 51/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Consolidated ﬁnancial performance of the LOTOS Group in 2015 (PLNm) 1,000 100.6 500 423.4 -0.6 32.3 -688.2 -31.1 -263.3 0 -195.3 -57.3 449.0 -68.0 U p ow O Co DA Fi st s ur ta x Ta os si the in nan n es x s) se stre se stre ad nso co ne r IT re gm a ju lid EB co c nt /(l en m gm a m ss st at m e nc e ve fo pr t en t bu m io e na nt be oﬁ t D en n Jo Pr ts Fi i oﬁ Net t Eﬃcient debt management Eﬃcient debt management in 2015 translated into a lower rate of debt growth relative to the capital expenditure incurred.

Despite a large oversupply, the global oil production has continued to rise, mainly in non-European countries, adding to the pressure on oil prices. The situation has been further aggravated by the high volatility of US dollar and euro exchange rates. As upstream margins declined relative to those generated downstream, companies signiﬁcantly reduced their exploration and production activity, which is demanding both ﬁnancially (high capital expenditure) and in terms of access to the market (licence requirements). Oil producers were forced to adapt to the persistently low prices of oil. The adaptation measures focused chieﬂy on scaling down the planned investment projects and reducing operating expenses, with capital expenditure cuts in 2015 estimated at 20−30%. These adverse developments are taking place at the time when European companies are facing the problem of their exploration and production work moving to more diﬃcult and less accessible deposits. The uncertain macroeconomic situation may be exacerbated in the near future by continued slow economic growth of China, further appreciation of the US dollar, weak economic recovery in the eurozone, and development of the geopolitical situation. A major challenge for the EU fuel industry is posed by the risks related to carbon (CO2) emission caps, including a possible increase in prices and insuﬃcient allocation of CO2 emission allowances, which will necessitate additional costs to be incurred to purchase allowances on the market to cover the deﬁcit. The measures that have been implemented by the European Commission, aﬀecting the operation of the EU ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme), will have a bearing on the price of allowances. The MSR (market stability reserve) mechanism introduced into the EU law in 2015, which will materially aﬀect the number of allowances available on the market and, consequently, also their price, is to be put in place in 2019 instead of 2021 as originally proposed. As a result of the change of its eﬀective date, rules of trading in the EU ETS will change materially in the course of a trading period (currently the third trading period – 2013−2020) rather than as of the beginning of the next one. At present, proceedings are pending before the European Court of Justice to void the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the establishment and operation of the market stability reserve for the EU greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. The proceedings were instigated as a result of a complaint ﬁled by Poland. Given the complexity of the case, it is expected that it may take as much as a year for the court to issue a judgment. Operating environment of our upstream business According to the ‘BP Statistical Review 2015’, at the end of 2015 47.7% of crude oil reserves were in the Middle East: mainly Saudi Arabia (15.7% of global reserves), Iran (9.3%) and Kuwait (6.0%). The second largest region in terms of oil reserves is the South and Central America (19.4% of global reserves), with the dominant position of Venezuela (17.5% of global reserves). The highest reserves to production ratio (R/P) is recorded for Venezuela (almost 120), followed by Kuwait (89), the United Arab Emirates (72) and Saudi Arabia (63). Norway’s reserves stand at 6.5bn barrels (0.4% of global reserves), with the R/P ratio at 9.5. 55/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Global reserves of natural gas amount to 187 trillion cubic metres. In terms of the quantity of reserves, the Middle East ranks ﬁrst among world regions, with 42.7% of global reserves, including primarily Iran (18.2%) and Qatar (13.1%). Next are Russia (17.4% of global reserves), Turkmenistan (9.3%) and the United States (5.2%). The highest reserves to production ratios (R/P) are recorded for Azerbaijan (68.8), Russia (56.4) and Algeria (54.1). However, this ranking may change after the economic sanctions imposed on gas production in Iran in response to its nuclear programme are lifted. Norway’s natural gas reserves total 1.9 trillion cubic metres (1% of global reserves) and its R/P ratio is 17.7. How to meet the challenges? The LOTOS Group’s overriding priority at all times is to ensure Poland’s security in the energy sector. The challenging and unstable macroeconomic environment does not change the fundamental importance, as we see it, of access to own resources and independence from suppliers. With this in mind, we concentrate our eﬀorts to increase the hydrocarbons production and oil distillate yields, improve Poland’s fuel balance and exploit synergies between the reﬁning industry and other industries in the energy sector. We also attach great importance to improving our eﬃciency and competitiveness by implementing the innovative EFRA Project. We strive to ensure that our sustainable development, translating into shareholder value growth, is pursued with due respect for the environment in which we operate. Through our activities we want to stimulate regional development by putting in practice the principles of economic patriotism. We strongly believe that this innovative and responsible approach to business may make us an important element of the government’s ‘Responsible Development Plan’ prepared by Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Development. How can Grupa LOTOS contribute to the implementation of the ‘Responsible Development Plan’?

We plan to concentrate on our key strategic projects, including further development of the B8 oil ﬁeld and of the B4/B6 gas ﬁelds, as well as on using cash ﬂows from the Heimdal and Sleipner ﬁelds to recover the capital locked in the tax asset related to the YME ﬁeld development project in Norway. (See more) As part of the strategy-driven activities, a number of eﬃciency-improving initiatives are also planned, including: 57/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group 934 Optimization of the operating costs (particularly important should the prolonged oil price crisis scenario materialize), Discipline in project implementation and operational excellence, to be m achieved for instance through fully leveraging the potential of the the LOTOS Group’s capex LOTOS Group’s assets, including both the hydrocarbon reserves (i.e. increasing recovery rates and extending ﬁeld lives) and the technical in the upstream assets (i.e. optimum use of platforms, vessels and other assets); segment in 2015 Possible use of the current market situation and attractive prices to pursue asset acquisition opportunities. 58/263 LOTOS Group Integrated Annual Report 2015 02 Our strategy 59/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our strategy In 2015, we successfully completed implementation of the LOTOS Group’s Business Strategy for 2011−2015. The key objectives we had set for ourselves in that important document were met. We increased our production potential and improved operational eﬃciency. We also consolidated our position in the retail fuels market. All of our development-oriented activities were pursued with due regard to the ideas of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility, the key propositions of which we deﬁned in our CSR strategy for 2012−2015. Proﬁts from the strategy implementation: Improved competitiveness as a result of increased distillate yields, more eﬃcient management of energy, better access to own oil reserves, and implementation of optimization projects. Expansion into new markets. Increased loyalty of customers. Boost to the innovative potential of our organization. Development and constant improvement of the risk management process. Maintained long-term trust of our employees. And we will not stop here. We perceive our achievements to date as the starting point for further development and improvement of our eﬃciency and innovativeness. In response to serious market challenges, we implemented a new segment management model. We have also started working on our new strategy, including the perspective till 2018 and long-term perspective “2018+”. 60/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Business strategy of the LOTOS Group The overriding strategic objective adopted by the LOTOS Group in its Business Strategy for 2011−2015 was to create value for shareholders through optimized deployment of human and material resources and implementation of development programmes in the following areas: exploration and production, crude processing, marketing. As at the end of 2015, we accomplished as many as 10 out of the 11 strategic objectives formulated in the LOTOS Group’s Business Strategy for 2011−2015. They included all development-related objectives for the areas that we consider to be of key importance. Area Strategic objective The accomplishment of the objective Achieve growth of the LOTOS brand equity in 2011−2015, understood as the eﬀect of synergies between image and strength among key target groups for the brand. A measure of success of our eﬀorts in this area Management was the level of the aggregated LOTOS brand equity index as at the end segment of 2015, which stood at 140 pts. Implement the CSR strategy to support achievement of the business strategy objectives. Increase hydrocarbon production to 1.2 million toe in 2015, equivalent to 24 thousand boe per day. As a result of the measures we implemented, as at the end of 2015 daily production capacity on an Upstream annualized basis amounted to 30.3 thousand boe per day. segment Maintain at least 30% share of the domestic fuel market. Marketing segment Achieve 10% share of the domestic retail fuel market by the end of 2015. Increase sales to a level exceeding by 15% the fuel production capacities of the Grupa LOTOS reﬁnery. Maintain leading position in the Polish lubricating oils market. 61/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Maintain high competitiveness of Grupa LOTOS’ reﬁnery. Reﬁning segment Achieve best production standards in the reﬁning industry with respect to energy management, use of the natural environment, and accident rates. Ensure safety of the technological processes at Grupa LOTOS. Increase depth of conversion and distillate yields. objective accomplished objective unaccomplished At the end of 2015, the only item where our performance was slightly below the target was sales volume exceeding by 15% the fuel production capacities of the Grupa LOTOS reﬁnery. We achieved 95% of the target volume, which followed from the Company’s deliberate decisions. As margin levels towards the end of the period covered by the strategy no longer supported a further increase in production and sales volumes, the Company responded by adapting to the new macroeconomic environment. The previous year was an important milestone on the LOTOS Group’s growth path. We exceeded key strategic targets set for 2011−2015 in the upstream segment and the wholesale and retail fuel markets in Poland. 2016 opens a new chapter of growth for LOTOS, where our key goals will be to further enhance Poland’s security in the energy sector, help with the industrialization of the national economy, and deliver substantial growth in company value. Our hydrocarbon production rose to 28.4 thousand boe/d. The wholesale and retail fuel market shares we achieved at the end of 2015 were 31.1% and 10.5%, respectively. Once completed, the deep oil conversion complex built under the EFRA Project will deliver numerous beneﬁts, including an around USD 2/bbl increase in the reﬁning margin. It will also enable LOTOS to produce an additional 900 thousand tonnes of fuels a year, mainly diesel oil, which will be placed on the Polish market. The work on the project launched last year is scheduled for completion in 2018. Solid performance despite external pressures The strong decline in crude prices (nearly 47% year on year) and the downward trend in the prices of petroleum products had an adverse eﬀect on the results reported by the LOTOS Group. Last year, it booked PLN 22.7bn in consolidated revenue, with a net loss of PLN 263m. The reported net loss was primarily driven by ﬁnance costs, including foreign exchange losses of close to PLN 345m, arising from the stronger USD/PLN exchange rate in 2015 at the end of the period, (+11.1% year on year), which aﬀected the valuation of outstanding bank loans denominated in the US dollar. In the reporting period the LOTOS Group generated PLN 1,488m in cash ﬂows from operating activities (2014: PLN 1,381m) – a visible proof of its stable ﬁnancial condition. 62/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Major increase in hydrocarbon production – Sleipner and B8 2015 saw LOTOS Petrobaltic’s combined production in Poland, Norway and Lithuania rise to an all-time high of 28.4 thousand boe/d. Despite the depressed oil and natural gas prices, LOTOS Petrobaltic Group increased the volume of hydrocarbons produced from its assets, which included output from the recently purchased interests in the Sleipner gas ﬁeld in Norway and initial production from the B8 ﬁeld in the Baltic Sea. B8 is now the largest oil extraction facility in the Polish economic zone of the Baltic Sea, with production potential estimated at 3.5m tonnes of crude. LOTOS Petrobaltic will produce up to 5 thousand boe/d from the B8 ﬁeld once target production levels are reached. Upstream EBITDA totalled PLN 185m in 2015, compared with a loss of PLN 280m the year before. Record throughput, rising sales In 2015, the Grupa LOTOS reﬁnery in Gdańsk processed a record volume of 10.2m tonnes of crude (2014: 9.5 million tonnes). The reﬁnery’s annual capacity utilization rate was 97%. In 2015, in the production and sale sector, LOTOS sold a total of 10.9 million tonnes of products, which is approximately 8.1% more than in 2014. The rise in output and sales was an eﬀect of reﬁning margins remaining very strong for the most part of 2015. Clean EBITDA at record highs for LOTOS service stations As at the end of 2015, the LOTOS retail chain comprised 476 stations. A total of 35 new service stations, including 25 sites in the LOTOS Optima economy segment, were added during the year. The ﬁnancial performance of the LOTOS network was improved by successful optimization eﬀorts, with clean 2015 EBITDA in the retail sector reaching PLN 112m, compared with PLN 95m in 2014 and PLN 44m in 2013. New goals for new times 63/263 Clean EBITDA at record highs for LOTOS service stations As at the end of 2015, the LOTOS retail chain comprised 476 stations. A total of 35 new service Integrated stations, Annual including Report 2015 LOTOS Group 25 sites in the LOTOS Optima economy segment, were added during the year.

New goals for new times We started working on the new business structure including the new perspective. We have worked intensely on the short-term strategy up to 2018 and on the strategic development directions after 2018. The key assumptions made for the strategy include: Company’s return to dividend distribution and retained capacities to distribute it in long term Stable and eﬃcient development of complementary activity sectors Continued policy of optimising integrated margin Poland’s security in the energy sector with economic advantages of material source diversiﬁcation In the short term (by 2018), we plan: To identify the strategic growth directions and plan development initiatives To analyse the current assets in terms of their long-term ability to generate value for the Group To include EFRA system into the process line, to achieve full production capacities of B8 ﬁeld and complete the analyse of B4/B6 gas ﬁeld proﬁtability To start the projects related to organisational and saving improvements gradually To strengthen the innovative culture in line with the reindustrialization policy of Poland In the 2018+ perspective we assume: Implementation of further development projects, retaining the ability to distribute dividends Ongoing optimization of the target operating, capital and legal infrastructure 64/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy At the LOTOS Group, we approach CSR as an element of our management and improvement processes within our organization. We believe that business should be conducted according to ethical standards, in harmony with the natural environment and social needs. This is why we have adopted a system of values which we see as a long-term pledge towards all our stakeholders. Development of Back in 2008, the awareness of how relevant social responsibility was to the pursuit of strategic goals prompted the Board of Grupa LOTOS to adopt the comprehensive the strategic LOTOS Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy. In 2011, the document was approach: reviewed in a process of wide-ranging consultations with our stakeholders. The outcome of the review was LOTOS Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy for 2012−2015, whose overriding objective was to support the business strategy by use of the organization’s resources and capabilities to generate economic and social value for the beneﬁt of its environment. Implementation of this objective was made possible through the use of the following mechanism: Our eﬀorts in the social and business spheres, in our relations with key stakeholders and in corporate governance were aimed principally to: Mitigate possible adverse impacts of our operations and the associated risks, Maximize chances for sustainable development over the long term, Ensure compliance with the law and ethical standards, Increase our positive contribution to social development. 65/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group The strategic approach to CSR at the LOTOS Group is manifest in each area of its business. The CSR strategy deﬁned 13 key goals, 39 operational objectives and ca. 100 activities to be undertaken each year in individual business areas. How was the The implementation of key goals and operational objectives and the related activities was supervised by the respective area leaders. One aspect of the concurrent focus implementation on the business and social dimension was regular reporting to the Board of Grupa status measured? LOTOS on the progress of the CSR strategy, together with reports on the implementation of the business strategy. The measure of the CSR strategy implementation was its progress in individual areas, expressed in percentage terms. Implementation At the end of 2015, the strategic objective was achieved in 90%, and 95% of the operational activities were completed. status: Key goals and activities related to the implementation of the CSR strategy in 2012−2015, by area: Investment in human resources Key goals Key activities and selected indicators Ensure availability of highly qualiﬁed We improved the human resource management standards, perfecting HR processes, resources required to successfully e.g. the development of LOTOS Academy, induction programme, recruitment standards, implement our business strategy new functionalities in the self-service employee portal, i.e. HR and SAP HCM Portal. Enhance our corporate culture based on adopted values We conducted an employee satisfaction/engagement survey across the LOTOS Group and performed the plans of improvement activities based on their results. We improved the periodic employee evaluation system – 96% of our employees meet key position-speciﬁc requirements. We increased the number of our 50+ staﬀ members involved in the development of their colleagues. Each year we organized numerous internship and traineeship programmes. We were actively involved in activities designed to increase the quality of secondaryschool education through partnership-based cooperation with schools, universities, students’ associations and research clubs. Each employee was given a copy of the Code of Ethics. We developed a training system dedicated to the LOTOS service station managers and staﬀ. We developed a “Strategy for LOTOS as Employer Brand”. 66/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Improvement of health and safety Key goal Key activities and selected indicators Raise the awareness and degree of In each year covered by the strategy, we organized the Occupational Health and Safety involvement in improving safety Day for the LOTOS Group employees. among the management and employees of all ranks, as well as contractors We organized a number of information and education campaigns and projects promoting workplace safety.

Group With responsibility towards the future At the end of 2015, during the annual ‘CSR Day’ event attended by the management of the LOTOS Group, we commenced work on the new Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy based on the experience gained in the course of the strategy development process in 2011 and will take into account the changes that followed as part of the natural evolution of the LOTOS Group’s CSR activity in connection with its dynamic development in 2012−2015. The strategy development process involved: Internal assessment of the degree of achievement of the objectives set for 2012−2015, External evaluation of the changes that the implementation of the Strategy brought in the perception of the Company’s CSR commitment by its key stakeholder groups, Evaluation of the results of implemented initiatives based on the beneﬁts to the organization; opinions of key external beneﬁciaries, Development of the Strategy in close cooperation with the leaders responsible for implementing strategic CSR objectives in 2012−2015 and with specialists from within the organization indicated by the leaders, as well as with representatives of the team responsible for deﬁning the new business outlook for the LOTOS Group. The LOTOS Group’s CSR Strategy will address the challenges deﬁned in the Sustainable Development Goals until 2030 published by the United Nations in September 2015, the Vision of Sustainable Development of Polish Businesses until 2050, and the 10 Principles of UN Global Compact. Those objectives have already been implemented by us by e.g. long-term programmes focused on employee development at all levels, and by the social and market environment. An example of this activity can be the ﬁrst cause-related marketing campaign in the fuel sector in Poland, called “Helping while refuelling”. The conscious and comprehensive approach to the management of natural resources and energy security are another example of the LOTOS Group’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals. We have constantly been reducing energy eﬃciency ratios and energy consumption in selected systems. By pursuing the goals set in the Strategy, we seek to increase our contribution towards meeting the challenges deﬁned by the UN. 69/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group The Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact: 1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and 2. make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the eﬀective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; 4. the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; 5. the eﬀective abolition of child labour; and 6. the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 7. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; 8. undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and 9. encourage the development and diﬀusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. The Sustainable Development Goals include 17 goals, 169 targets and 304 indicators to achieve by 2030, to ensure better, healthier and safer living conditions, in the social, environmental and economic spheres. In 2015, those goals replaced the previous eight millennium goals. 70/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which LOTOS Group supports by taking actions: Goal 4 – Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all Goal 6 – Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Goal 7 – Ensure access to aﬀordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Goal 8 – Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Goal 9 – Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Goal 10 – Reduce inequality within and among countries Goal 12 – Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Goal 14 – Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development Goal 15 – Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertiﬁcation, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss Goal 17 – Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 71/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Risk management 72/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our approach to risk management Because of the speciﬁc nature of the fuel sector, the LOTOS has a strategic approach to minimizing prospective risks likely to aﬀect performance of our business objectives, as well as the social environment where we operate adversely. By identiﬁcation, constant monitoring and strategic approach to management we reduce hazards day by day. Throughout 2015, as part of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system, we undertook a number of risk mitigation measures reducing the probability that speciﬁc risks may materialize. In the case of risks that did materialize, we applied the action plans prepared in advance, successfully limiting their adverse eﬀects. We also deﬁned new risks, mainly associated with projects of crucial importance to the LOTOS Group (such as EFRA or B8 ﬁeld development). A number of measures were also being implemented to improve the risk management tools and risk identiﬁcation, assessment and monitoring methodologies. At the LOTOS Group, we identify a range of risks in all areas of our business. Many of them are interrelated, so we analyse their interactions and take steps to minimize their impact. Key risk groups for the LOTOS Group Risks are identiﬁed in reference to the strategic and operational objectives pursued by the organization. Risk assessment is performed based on a deﬁned and approved risk matrix, and includes analysis of the likelihood of the risk materialization and possible ﬁnancial and reputational consequences, where the latter are understood as damage to reputation, environment or people’s health. All identiﬁed risks are monitored, and those considered as material are subject to more stringent control requirements. Key elements of risk and opportunity management at the LOTOS Group 73/263 Risks are identiﬁed in reference to the strategic and operational objectives pursued by the organization. Risk assessment is performed based on a deﬁned and approved risk matrix, and includes analysis of the likelihood of Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group the risk materialization and possible ﬁnancial and reputational consequences, where the latter are understood as damage to reputation, environment or people’s health. All identiﬁed risks are monitored, and those considered as material are subject to more stringent control requirements. Key elements of risk and opportunity management at the LOTOS Group Risk identiﬁcation – risks are identiﬁed in reference to the strategic and operational objectives pursued by the organization. Risk assessment – risks are assessed in the annual and long-term perspectives in terms of their potential consequences for the LOTOS Group’s ﬁnancial standing and reputation (including adverse impact on the LOTOS Group’s image, the environment and people’s health). Risk analysis – for each risk, we deﬁne the current management procedure as well as monitoring and protection measures, and if a risk is deemed material, detailed risk management charts are prepared. The charts specify how a given risk should be mitigated and what actions to take should it materialize. Key risk indicators (KRI) are deﬁned, by means of which the risk and the level of exposure can be monitored in accordance with established guidelines. Risk owners are responsible for the above elements of risk analysis. Risk reviews – all identiﬁed risks are periodically reviewed and updated, twice as year as a minimum. Process reporting – appropriate standards have been implemented for communicating and reporting the results at each stage of the process. 74/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Roles in the risk The Supervisory Board − monitors the eﬀectiveness of the risk management system. management process: The Board of Grupa LOTOS − makes key ERM decisions and approves risk maps. Segment heads − are responsible for overall monitoring and supervision of risk management in their segments. Enterprise Risk Management Committee − recommends ERM-related actions and monitors their progress. The Committee consists of representatives of each segment. Enterprise Risk Coordinator − coordinates and supports risk management activities within the LOTOS Group. Risk owners – manage individual risks, deﬁning the course of action with respect to each risk and monitoring its levels. The LOTOS Group employees − implement risk mitigation activities and identify new risks. Internal Audit Oﬃce and Business Process Management Oﬃce − carry out audits at LOTOS Group companies to review the implemented controls and evaluate their eﬀectiveness, identify and assess threats to the organization’s operations, carry out annual evaluations of the risk management system’s eﬀectiveness as part of the organizational maturity assessment, and assess individual risk management procedures. Enterprise risk management activities at the LOTOS Group are supported by a dedicated IT tool, the ERM Portal. The ERM Portal is used to record risks and risk assessment results and prepare risk maps, to monitor current risk indicators and the progress of planned actions, as well as for reporting purposes. Audit results are also recorded in the ERM Portal where the audit involves a review of the risk management procedures. How is the system’s eﬀectiveness evaluated? The ERM system’s eﬀectiveness is evaluated every year, as part of our organizational maturity assessment, the conclusions and recommendations of which are used to further improve the system. A ﬁnal assessment score is expressed as a percentage and reﬂects: The degree to which the system designed at the Company conforms with best practices and standards for a given area, and Conformity of the system’s operation in practice with the system’s design. In the period from 2011 (when the system was launched at the organization) to 2015, the assessment score rose to 96%. Risk is inherent in Grupa LOTOS’ business. The risk management system, being a strategic business process at the organization, is subject to constant improvement. Implementation costs of hedging strategies 75/263 Conformity of the system’s operation in practice with the system’s design. Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group In the period from 2011 (when the system was launched at the organization) to 2015, the assessment score rose to 96%. Risk is inherent in Grupa LOTOS’ business. The risk management system, being a strategic business process at the organization, is subject to constant improvement. Implementation costs of hedging strategies The costs of hedging strategies depend on the materiality of the risk and the potential beneﬁts derived from hedging. Whenever possible, risk is reduced to a level considered economically acceptable. Furthermore, when preparing risk analyses or action plans, potential costs are among the factors considered in making the ﬁnal decision. This approach enables us to deploy the ﬁnancial resources required for risk management in the most eﬃcient manner possible. What are other manifestations of our precautionary approach? The Code of Ethics: sets the standards of conduct in line with the LOTOS Group values. Agreements: include appropriate provisions governing cooperation with partners. Environmental protection and OHS standards: ensure the highest standard of people’s and process safety. Project management: ensures proper project implementation and budget control. Controlling: supervision over the current budgets. 76/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Key risk groups for the LOTOS Group and key risks identiﬁed within individual groups Risk groups Key risks Political and legal Tensions between Ukraine and Russia and the resulting EU sanctions on Moscow. risks Plans to implement new EU legislation, especially related to tighter EU climate policy until 2030. The European Union proposes that the greenhouse gas emissions reduction ratio be doubled to 40%, the share of RES in electricity generation be raised to 27%, and the annual CO2 emissions reduction ratio in the ETS be increased from 1.7% to 2.2%. Lack of comprehensive legal framework for the oil sector. Reputational and Events that may aﬀect the perception of LOTOS and the LOTOS brand value. Factors beyond the Company’s control include impairment of the reputation of social risks our industry. Factors directly related to the Company’s activities include delays in product supplies, deterioration of product quality, and industrial accidents. Risk of misconduct — related e.g. to all corrupt practices. 77/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Exploration and Risks from estimating hydrocarbon resources and reserves discovered by production risks exploration wells. Risk of drilling a dry well (without hydrocarbon ﬂow). Risk of failure of production equipment and facilities due to their limited durability or improper operation. Risks from infrastructure operation, such as the risk of oil spill, sea collision, ﬁre or blowout – which may cause environmental contamination, serious injury or death of an employee, downsizing or stoppage of production, as well as entail signiﬁcant costs to remedy the resulting damage or pay ﬁnes. Risk of limited control of joint ventures as such projects involve at least two partners. Macroeconomic risk − in 2015 relating mainly to plunge in crude oil prices, resulting in deterioration of the economic parameters and proﬁtability of investments in the upstream business, and aﬀecting the availability and terms of external ﬁnancing for such projects. Risk of increased liabilities in relation to the YME project. Reﬁnery-related Technical risks related to possible occurrence of serious industrial accidents or operational risks irreparable damage to infrastructure. Work safety risk − relates to potential occurrence of accidents and other threats involving exposure of employees to dangerous and onerous factors. Risk related to legislative changes with respect to REACH (Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning safe use of chemical substances, which is to be achieved through registration and evaluation, and in some cases through introduction of permits and restrictions on trade). Environmental risks Risks related to CO2 emission allowance limits − include the risk of an increase in prices and insuﬃcient allocation of CO2 emission allowances, which may necessitate additional costs to be incurred to purchase allowances on the market to cover the deﬁcit. Risks related to the need to obtain new or amend existing permits. Risks related to compliance with new regulations on the implementation of Best Available Techniques (BAT). 78/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Financial risks Commodity and petroleum product price risk – operating results are largely dependent on the diﬀerence between the price of petroleum products and the price of crude oil. CO2 allowances price risk − in 2015, Grupa LOTOS managed the risk associated with entire phase III of the EU CO2 Emissions Trading Scheme covering the 2013−2020 trading period (for more details, see the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for 2015). Liquidity risk – the risk relating to the ability to discharge all liabilities in a timely manner. It may result from a mismatch between streams of receivables and payables or inadequate sources of funding. Currency risk − the Polish złoty (PLN) is the reporting and functional currency for the Company and the majority of other LOTOS Group companies, while the trading prices of crude oil and petroleum products are generally denominated in, or tied to, the US dollar (USD). Interest rate risk – Grupa LOTOS is exposed to interest rate risk, with interest rates growth translating into increased costs of servicing debt under ﬂoatingrate borrowings. Counterparty risk in trade transactions – in the course of trading operations, products and services are sold to businesses on a deferred payment basis, which may give rise to a risk of the customer’s default. Risk of limited access to or change in the terms of external ﬁnancing − some of the investment projects pursued by Grupa LOTOS and its subsidiaries as well as their day-to-day operations are or may be ﬁnanced with borrowings. Risk of adverse changes in tax regulations, interpretations or court rulings – this risk may result in higher tax burden (excise duty, property tax, CIT), and give rise to tax risk in transactions where such risk was previously non-existent. Trading risks Risk of crude supply interruptions or shortages − as the output from its own production assets does not fully cover its processing feedstock requirements, the LOTOS Group relies on crude oil purchased from external suppliers. Risk of changes in margins on product sales – the principal risk factors include progressing market consolidation leading to intensiﬁed price competition on the Polish fuel market, and the rapidly changing global macroeconomic environment. Risk of decline in domestic demand − negative trends related to macroeconomic factors (GDP, situation on the labour market, industrial production volume, etc.) may result in lower domestic demand for fuel products. Risk of grey market expansion − in recent years, Poland has seen an increase in illegal trade in fuels, especially in diesel oil. In 2015, the grey market was about 18% of diesel oil consumption in Poland, and in 2014 it was about 20%. In addition, in 2015 the LOTOS Group identiﬁed two new enterprise risks: 79/263 18% of diesel oil consumption in Poland, and in 2014 it was about 20%. Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group In addition, in 2015 the LOTOS Group identiﬁed two new enterprise risks: Risk of potential environmental damage caused in the course of upstream operations The risk was identiﬁed in connection with expansion of production activities in the Baltic Sea and the growing hydrocarbon output. Following a relevant assessment and analysis, the risk was classiﬁed as moderate, i.e. with a low likelihood of occurrence but with potentially severe ﬁnancial and reputational consequences. We have deﬁned a detailed risk management process for this risk and put in place appropriate controls along with methods and schedules of their review. Risk of ﬁnancial losses that may be incurred as a result of trading activities in the event of potential participation in a carousel fraud The risk was included in the risk register following receipt of a decision by the Director of the Tax Audit Oﬃce in Bydgoszcz concerning failure to exercise due care in fuels trading. Grupa LOTOS as a direct seller of fuels has always exercised due care in selecting its partners in fuels trading business and drafting trade contracts. The identiﬁcation of the risk prompted a systemic review of internal procedures and protocols. As a result, the counterparty selection and trading contract execution processes were optimized across the LOTOS Group. The improvements will prevent similar incidents from happening in the future and will contribute to curtailing the black market in fuels in Poland. 80/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Opportunities and strengths of the LOTOS Group In 2015, like other oil companies, we faced a number of challenges and threats: Markedly lower prices of crude oil and gas, Uncertain market situation, Stagnant demand for petroleum products in Europe, Growing competition from the Middle East, the US, and Russia. Value growth and positive long-term ﬁnancial results can be achieved through our competitive advantages, such as: Large technological potential of the reﬁnery, high distillate yields and complexity, Diversiﬁcation of crude supplies and growing access to own sources of crude oil, Developed own sales channel − a service station chain that allows the LOTOS Group to increase its share in the retail market, Growing retail demand for fuels, Consistent pursuit of development strategy, Coastal location of the reﬁnery facilitating imports of crude and exports of petroleum products, Optimum and full use of assets, Generating cash ﬂows along the value chain, Positive image of the LOTOS Group as a socially conscious organization and a leader of sustainable development in Poland.

Adherence to ethical standards improves the comfort and quality of our work, regardless of what responsibilities we hold or what place we occupy within the organization, which also plays an important role in shaping long-term and trust-based business relations, including commercial ones. Adherence to ethical standards + economic eﬃciency = value for the LOTOS Group shareholders The LOTOS Group’s Code of Ethics has been in place since 2013. This document is of key importance to us for the following reasons: It is a set of principles and standards of conduct rooted in the organization’s ethical values. It is intended to govern behaviour within the organization, as well as external relations with key stakeholder groups, capital market participants, customers and trading partners, local communities and competitors. We make every eﬀort to communicate the LOTOS Group’s ethical standards within and outside of our organization. All our existing and newly hired supervisory and management staﬀ as well as employees and trading partners of the LOTOS Group are required to conﬁrm with their signatures that they have read and are familiar with the Code of Ethics. The LOTOS Group’s Code of Ethics has been translated into English and Lithuanian. Additionally, we organize training for all new hires, and the Ethics Oﬃcer holds regular meetings with the employees.

Ethical Conduct Programme – objectives and implementation The LOTOS Group’s Code of Ethics is the cornerstone of our comprehensive Ethical Conduct Programme, designed to make business ethics the highest point of reference in the management of our organization. As part of the Ethical Conduct Programme, in addition to ethics education, communication initiatives and channels for reporting violations of the Code of Ethics, an important role is played by the Ethics Oﬃcer, whose duty is to ensure that the accepted standards of ethical conduct are always upheld. The Ethics Oﬃcer was ﬁrst appointed in 2014. Persons in this role perform their duties without remuneration. 84/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group The voice of Each employee of the LOTOS Group has access to the Ethics Oﬃcer. The management staﬀ members have a special role to play in improving the employees is organization’s ethical culture: they support the employees by setting a good example heard: to follow, and by discussing with them any doubts concerning ethical issues. The Ethics Oﬃce can be contacted by: A meeting, upon earlier phone contact (phone no. 505 050 218) at the time convenient for the interested party; A telephone conversation or recording the message (phone no. +48 58 308 80 70); An e-mail sent to liniaetyki@grupalotos.pl; Filling in a Request form at www.lotos.pl and in LOTOSTRADA, ETHICS PROGRAMME subservice; Sending communication by traditional mail. We listen to what The LOTOS Group’s stakeholders may report any suspected or actual breaches of the Code of Ethics to the persons responsible for their prevention using dedicated others have to channels of communication with the LOTOS Group’s Ethics Oﬃcer. Relevant form is say: available on our website: More information Excellent ethical conduct and how to achieve it − as exempliﬁed by LOTOS Paliwa In 2015, LOTOS Paliwa set up the Ethical Conduct Programme Team responsible for the Programme’s operation throughout the LOTOS service station network, which marked the end of a two-year phase of implementation of ethical standards at the LOTOS stations. The Team promotes the knowledge of the values, standards and rules of conduct deﬁned in the Code of Ethics. One of the communication tools used to that end is the Dynamiczni quarterly, addressed to individuals working for the service stations. In addition to news on recent developments at the service stations, the quarterly also discusses the rules to be followed in their business. It also features articles presenting interpretation of the provisions of the Code of Ethics so that they are fully observed in day-to-day operations. What else did we do? We organized the ‘Monday with Ethics’ competition for the LOTOS Group employees, which aimed to demonstrate that the provisions of the Code of Ethics should be a reference for decisions made in the course of our professional duties. 85/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Misconduct Prevention Policy of the LOTOS Group Our approach to managing the risk of misconduct is deﬁned in the Misconduct Prevention Policy of the LOTOS Group, adopted in 2012. Besides the Code of Ethics, the Policy is the primary source of rules and standards for misconduct prevention in our organization. The adoption of the two documents was in line with the objectives of the LOTOS Group Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy for 2012−2015. We are vigilant: In 2015, the Board of Grupa LOTOS adopted the revised third edition of the Misconduct Prevention Policy – Zero Tolerance for Misconduct, under which each employee is required to immediately report any suspected instance of misconduct to the Head of the Internal Audit Oﬃce: directly or through their superior, by calling: +48 58 308 87 87, by email to:​ audyt@grupalotos.pl, by completing a form available on http://www.lotos.pl or in the Ethical Conduct Programme sub-service on LOTOSTRADA, by post, in a letter addressed to the Internal Audit Oﬃce. Cautious = more knowledgeable Educating employees is the key to preventing misconduct. In September 2015, we began to regularly send emails with educational content to our employees. The initiative, continued in 2016, aimed at raising the employees’ awareness of the risk of misconduct and its prevention. It was also an opportunity for us to distribute the Misconduct Prevention Policy to the LOTOS Group employees. Moreover, each email informed the employees of their obligation to report any instances of suspected misconduct through the channels set out in the Policy. 86/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group 627 1,896 employees hours of training of LOTOS Group took part devoted to misconduct in training devoted to prevention misconduct prevention (some employees attended more than one training session) Titles of emails in 2015 Date sent Number of emails sent Together we create an early warning system (Misconduct Prevention Policy attached to the email) September 7th 2015 1,812 Together we protect our organization’s intellectual property November 26th 2015 1,733 ‘NO’ to misconduct We are committed to increasing the degree of immunity to misconduct within the LOTOS Group, which means: Being aware of real and perceived misconduct threats arising in the course of our operations, Putting in place and using solutions that are best adapted to the scale and nature of the risk, and that are geared towards preventing, detecting and responding to such threats. The purpose of these eﬀorts is to secure the LOTOS Group’s ability to: Mitigate the risk of misconduct, Reduce the harmful eﬀects of misconduct, Gather resources which will accelerate the organization’s return to pre-misconduct state. The threats we face 87/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group At the LOTOS Group, we have identiﬁed the risk of misconduct as one of the enterprise risks. We understand misconduct as an intentional act or omission which constitutes violation of the law or a breach of our organization’s internal regulations, committed to secure an unlawful gain or causing a LOTOS Group company to sustain a loss. Misconduct includes any type of corrupt practices. In 2015, we developed a map of misconduct risk, which shows that at the LOTOS Group companies − with a few exceptions − exposure to the risk is concentrated in the following areas: Investment project preparation and execution, Sales, Logistics, Procurement and inventory management. Misconduct risk was assessed based on the following criteria: Signiﬁcance of the area to the implementation of strategic objectives by a given company. A misconduct review or investigation carried out in a given area. Signiﬁcance of the areas depending on misconduct risk exposure in deﬁned categories. Level of misconduct risk as perceived by the management, based on survey ﬁndings. What else did we do? We published dedicated educational materials in the LOTOSFERA monthly for the LOTOS Group employees. We developed e-learning materials to be used by our new hires. We completed operational work on pilot reviews of misconduct categories related to unlawfully claimed remuneration and employee beneﬁts, data and intellectual property theft as well as computer crime. 100 No instance of corruption was reported at the LOTOS Group in 2015. % At the LOTOS Group we seek to actively counteract computer crime. In 2015, we commenced a training programme under the name ‘Security of the LOTOS Group Awareness’, devoted to the security of IT system users. The eight training companies were sessions were attended by 468 LOTOS Group employees, including 344 management staﬀ. assessed in 2015 in terms of the risk of misconduct 88/263 LOTOS Group Integrated Annual Report 2015 03 Innovation is key to lasting success 89/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Innovation is key to lasting success Development and innovative projects are a core element of investment eﬀorts undertaken by the LOTOS Group. Encoded in our corporate DNA, they allow us to maximize our proﬁts and drive value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Thanks to an innovative and ﬂexible approach to our operations, we are equipped to tackle major challenges facing the oil industry and bolster our competitiveness in a diﬃcult market. Innovation is ingrained in all of our business segments. By being innovative, we are capable of ensuring the superior quality of our products and services. As an organization that embraces new technologies and is very active in research and development eﬀorts, we are also an attractive partner for scientiﬁc institutions. Our key initiatives designed to increase competitiveness in 2015 included: EFRA Project Initiation of the EFRA Project, another important endeavour in the LOTOS Group’s history. The project will improve our ﬁnancial eﬃciency and product margins. After its completion, Grupa LOTOS will become one of the most advanced reﬁnery in the European Union. With the new units within EFRA project, the plants will produce an additional 900,000 tonnes of top quality high-margin fuels and 300,000 tonnes of petrochemical coke, without increasing crude input volumes. B8 ﬁeld We also started production from the B8 ﬁeld using the LOTOS Petrobaltic drilling rig. Thus, LOTOS Petrobaltic has doubled its production of hydrocarbons in the Baltic Sea, and the incremental output generated by the ﬁeld has a positive eﬀect on its ﬁnancial standing. The B8 ﬁeld is situated in Poland’s Exclusive Economic Zone of the Baltic Sea. It is the third largest oil production facility in Poland and the oil ﬁeld holding the largest recoverable oil reserves in the Polish part of the Baltic Sea. Sleipner area LOTOS Norge ﬁnalized the purchase of a portfolio of Sleipner assets located in central part of the North Sea. Being the second largest gas hub in the North Sea, the Sleipner area is of strategic importance to gas exports from Norway to Continental Europe and the United Kingdom. 90/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group How do we create value for investors?

Now, new advanced technologies are being rolled out under our key EFRA Project. By investing in state-of-the-art deep oil processing technologies, we will be in a position to increase output of high-quality fuels and eliminate the products with a negative margin from our production structure, reducing their adverse environmental impact. This is something we ﬁnd very important, as when selecting and implementing modern solutions, we always consider synergies between the needs of the company and beneﬁts to the environment, especially the natural environment. The technologies we use are ahead of increasingly stringent environmental protection standards and regulations. We realize that improving and seeking ever better solutions is a continuous process. Hence, our plans assume investing in new technologies across all business areas, improving our eﬃciency by developing business processes, leveraging advanced technological process optimization techniques, including by promoting innovation among employees, as well as our trading and social partners. 91/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS Group’s key projects in the exploration and production and refining segments 92/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS Group’s key projects in the exploration and production and reﬁning segments Key projects of the LOTOS Group in the exploration and production segment are focused on diversifying sources of raw materials and expanding the production area. This approach oﬀers opportunities to grow further and brings us closers to one of our goals – ensuring Poland’s security in the energy sector. The projects initiated in 2015 in the reﬁning segment are intended to enhance its proﬁtability and eﬃciency and, consequently, improve competitiveness of the entire LOTOS Group in the challenging macroeconomic environment. Furthermore, they will also help us address the challenges imposed on the energy sector, including the petrochemical industry, by the European Union and Polish government. 93/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group EFRA Project – Eﬀective Reﬁning, i.e. innovation of the 21st century Initiated in 2015, the EFRA Project is a groundbreaking endeavour in Grupa LOTOS’ history. The project will improve our ﬁnancial eﬃciency and product margins, as well as reduce our dependence on crude oil price ﬂuctuations. After its completion, Grupa LOTOS will become the most advanced reﬁnery in the European Union and one of the most technologically advanced in the world. With the new units, our Gdańsk reﬁnery will produce an additional 900,000 tonnes of high quality high-margin fuels and 300,000 tonnes of petrochemical coke, without increasing crude input volumes. The EFRA Project will facilitate the pursuit of sustainable development goals, and the cutting-edge technologies it involves will greatly reduce our environmental footprint. EFRA Project’s main beneﬁts for Grupa LOTOS include: More eﬃcient use of heavy residue, which is the heavy end of crude oil used to make heavy fuel oil or bitumens; Shift in the production structure from low-margin products towards increased share of engine fuels, mainly diesel oil and aviation fuel; Increased ﬂexibility of the reﬁnery, which will allow the LOTOS Group to remain competitive also in the event of movements in the prices of feedstock and petroleum products. First results: 94/263 Shift in the production structure from low-margin products towards increased share of engine fuels, mainly diesel oil and aviation fuel; Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Increased ﬂexibility of the reﬁnery, which will allow the LOTOS Group to remain competitive also in the event of movements in the prices of feedstock and petroleum products.

Key events in 2015 January/February The issue of series D shares is completed, with the proceeds of nearly PLN 1bn to be spent on the EFRA Project. The State Treasury subscribed for 53% of the new issue shares, and entered into an assistance agreement with Grupa LOTOS, committing PLN 530m to ﬁnance the investment. May/June Grupa LOTOS launches the EFRA Project together with its subsidiary LOTOS Asfalt, following approval by the Company’s Supervisory Board of the terms of ﬁnancing and collateral, and a share capital increase at LOTOS Asfalt. LOTOS Asfalt signs credit facility agreements to ﬁnance 79% of the EFRA Project investments with a consortium of eight ﬁnancial institutions. 95/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Financing structure of the EFRA Project * * Together with borrowing costs and funds deposited in reserve accounts. July/August As part of the EFRA Project, LOTOS Asfalt signs a PLN 1.26bn EPC contract with Kinetics Technology of Italy for three key project units. The cornerstone is laid for the units to be built as part of the EFRA Project. LOTOS Asfalt signs a coke sale agreement with Oxbow Energy Solutions B.V. of the Netherlands. Oxbow agreed to buy coke from the Delayed Coking Unit, the main component of the process line to be built in the EFRA Project. In this way LOTOS Asfalt has ensured that the entire volume of output coke will be sold. September/October Lotos Asfalt enters into an agreement with Przembud Gdańsk on the construction of a power system facility as part of the EFRA Project. The company also signs a contract with Keller Polska for piling work at the site for a structure that will serve as a ﬂyover linking the new units with the LOTOS reﬁnery units and storage facilities. November At the EFRA Project complex, there has been an unique survey conducted, that allowed the proper preparation of support structures for the new units. The construction site has been thoroughly tested to a depth of approx. 30 meters using seismic studies by the German company Geotomographie. 96/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group How the EFRA units work The EFRA Project is consistent with the LOTOS Group’s strategy for 2011–2015 for the reﬁning segment, whose key objective is to ensure eﬃcient use the reﬁnery’s expanded processing capacities and further increase in distillate yields. The EFRA Project will allow us to fully harness the potential of production units built as part of the 10+ Programme, thus maximizing the use of Grupa LOTOS’ existing assets. The main facilities comprising the new EFRA complex will be the Delayed Coking Unit (DCU), Hydrogen Generation Unit (HGU), Coking Naphtha Hydrotreating Unit (CNHT), LPG Treatment Unit (LPGTU), Coke Logistics and Storage Facility (CS-LF), and Hydrowax Distillation Unit (HVDU). The project is compliant with the Best Available Techniques (BAT) and carried out with respect for the natural and social environment. In some aspects, it even exceeds the BAT requirements, a case in point being the compressor to lower pressure in the coking reactor. Why did we select this solution? Currently, coking units, including the one to be constructed under the EFRA Project, come with numerous enhancements which reduce their environmental impact. An additional advantage in the case of our compressor is that it will be equipped with a Closed Coke Slurry System (CCSS), a cutting-edge innovation designed to completely eliminate dust and hydrocarbon emissions during coke unloading. Furthermore, it will enable us to process hydrocarbon sediments and sludge created during sewage treatment.

Furthermore, it will enable us to process hydrocarbon sediments and sludge created during sewage treatment. EFRA means new jobs As anticipated in the EFRA Staﬀ Programme, staﬀ with specialist qualiﬁcations will need to be recruited and trained to prepare and execute the project, and then, once it is completed, manage its operation and maintenance. This will also require transfer of capabilities and staﬀ within the LOTOS Group. The EFRA Staﬀ Programme is scheduled for gradual implementation in 2014−2019. From 2014 to 2019, we plan to achieve the following goals in our personnel policy: Manning 40 workstations with employees from the LOTOS Group by reallocating them between organizational units and companies; Employing 80 additional staﬀ from the market. The general contractor for the EFRA Project is Kinetics Technology of Italy, a leading international contractor for such projects, but a number of Polish subcontractors are also involved, as the project assumed engaging proven Polish partners and employees in the construction process. We estimate that at the height of activity under the EFRA Project in 2017, the site will see approximately 2,000 workers, predominantly from Polish-owned companies. Already today, such companies as Przembud Gdańsk, P.R.I. Centrum, Mostostal Zabrze and Elektromontaż Gdańsk are involved in the Project activities. What is more, Polish specialists will be assigned to work on electrical systems, road infrastructure and inter-unit connections, with 50 Polish experts from Tebodin Polska performing supervision tasks on behalf of the project sponsor. Design work for auxiliary facilities and connections between the new project and the reﬁnery was entrusted to the Polish branch of Fluor (approximately 80 persons). The construction process will require engaging regional transport, service, catering and hospitality companies. More information on the EFRA Project 98/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Hydrogen Recovery Unit (HRU) Before a new Hydrogen Generation Unit (HGU) is built as part of the EFRA Project, the Hydrogen Recovery Unit currently constructed at the Gdańsk reﬁnery will increase hydrogen output by nearly 1 tonne per hour. The annual production capacity of the new HRU will be: 100 thousand tonnes of LPG; 9 thousand tonnes of hydrogen; 40 thousand tonnes of naphtha. Those valuable products will be obtained from hydrogen gasses that are currently used mostly in the fuel gas network. Additional beneﬁts of the HRU include: Higher output from the hydrocracking and HDS units; Reduced costs of hydrogen production; More stable and secure gas supply to the fuel gas network thanks to replacing hydrogen gasses with natural gas; Reduced CO2 emissions. Construction of the Hydrogen Recovery Unit began in September 2015 and its completion is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2016. Grupa LOTOS’ expenditure on key investment projects in 2015 included PLN 44.4m spent on the HRU. Operation of the HRU: The central component of the unit is a coldbox, where hydrogen gas blend is cooled down to low temperatures and hydrogen is separated from hydrocarbons, which subsequently liquefy. Next to the HRU and the LPG tank, an LPG loading facility and a natural gas pressure reduction station will also be built. 99/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Development of the B8 ﬁeld As planned, on September 30th 2015 we started initial production from the B8 ﬁeld using the LOTOS Petrobaltic drilling rig. Thus, LOTOS Petrobaltic has doubled its production of hydrocarbons in the Baltic Sea, and the incremental output generated by the ﬁeld has a positive eﬀect on its ﬁnancial standing. In mid-November 2015, daily production rate from the B8 ﬁeld exceeded that of the B3 ﬁeld, and on December 4th aggregate daily production from our two ﬁelds operated in the Baltic Sea exceeded 1,000 cubic metres. Importance of the B8 ﬁeld to Grupa LOTOS: B8 is the third largest oil production facility in Poland and the oil ﬁeld holding the largest recoverable oil reserves in the Polish part of the Baltic Sea. The ﬁeld is situated in Poland’s Exclusive Economic Zone of the Baltic Sea. 3.5 million tonnes = 28 million barrels estimate of the 2P production reserves of the B8 oil ﬁeld Once the Petrobaltic rig is converted into a production centre and placed in the B8 ﬁeld, and after the pipeline to Władysławowo is completed, in the second half of 2017 we expect to launch full-scale production from the ﬁeld at a daily rate of some 5 thousand barrels of crude oil (250 thousand tonnes annually). B8 Field development 100/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group In 2015, having carried out detailed technical analyses, LOTOS Petrobaltic resolved to optimize the Petrobaltic rig conversion project by reducing the weight of the hull. This will improve the economics of the B8 ﬁeld development project in the diﬃcult macroeconomic environment, with low oil prices. In 2015, the LOTOS Petrobaltic Group spent PLN 304.3m on the development of the B8 ﬁeld. 101/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Development of the B4/B6 gas ﬁelds The purpose of the project is to develop and produce natural gas from the B4 and B6 ﬁelds in the Baltic Sea together with CalEnergy Resources Poland. In the summer of 2015, we began the third phase of the project, as part of which detailed technical solutions leading to the development of the ﬁelds are to be worked out. Despite the technical complexity of the project and diﬃcult macroeconomic conditions (signiﬁcant decline in oil prices) we expect to complete that phase in 2016. nearly The ﬁelds are planned to be put on stream between 2019 and 2020. The 4.3 mixture of hydrocarbons (raw gas) will be transported via underwater pipelines on shore and processed into commercial products: natural gas, bcm LPG and condensate, to be subsequently delivered to end users. estimated recoverable In 2015, the LOTOS Petrobaltic Group spent PLN 3.9m on activities gas resources of the continued under the B4/B6 gas ﬁeld development project. In accordance with relevant agreement, at this stage the project is mainly ﬁnanced by B4/B6 ﬁelds the partner, CalEnergy Resources Poland. 102/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Acquisition of the Sleipner ﬁeld On December 30th 2015, LOTOS Norge ﬁnalized the acquisition of a portfolio of Sleipner assets located in central part of the North Sea. Being the second largest gas hub in the North Sea, the Sleipner area is of strategic importance to gas exports from Norway to Continental Europe and the United Kingdom. more than 9.5 16 * thousand *thousand boe/d boe/d estimate of the expected production volume average oil and gas output attributable to LOTOS from the Sleipner ﬁelds Norge’s interest in the attributable to LOTOS Sleipner assets towards Norge’s interest in the end of 2015 2016−2018 The base purchase price of the Sleipner portfolio was USD 160m (PLN 587.3m). The acquisition was a non-cash transaction executed by unlocking the tax asset generated from the YME Project. The transaction covered interests in ﬁve licences, including four production ﬁelds and the Alfa Sentral ﬁeld, discovered and scheduled for development. Statoil is the operator of all those licences, and the other consortium partners are Exxon and Total. As at December 31st 2015, following the acquisition of the Sleipner assets, LOTOS Norge held interests in 27 licences for oil exploration and production on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. * Barrels of oil equivalent per day 103/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Recovery of the tax shield related to the YME ﬁeld In view of the persistently macroeconomic environment, including unstable conditions on the commodities market and sharp declines in crude oil prices, the LOTOS Group intends to initiate measures to improve the eﬃciency and ensure ﬁnancial stability of its upstream segment. Apart from focus on the key projects, this will involve using cash ﬂows from the Heimdal and Sleipner ﬁelds to recover the capital locked in the tax asset in Norway based on the cash ﬂows from Heimdal and Sleipner ﬁelds. In June 2015, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE) approved the request not to submit a Revised Development Plan and start the process of planning the ﬁeld liquidation, made by Repsol of Spain, the operator of the YME licence. As at December 31st 2015, a decommissioning plan for the Yme ﬁeld for 2016−2020 was to be provided to MPE for approval by the end of 2016. However, when OKEA, a new player on the Norwegian market, declared its intention to buy an interest in the YME ﬁeld and proceed with its development, the decommissioning process was suspended and a reassessment of the ﬁeld development options was commenced. The Operator has carried out eﬀorts to prepare the Field Development Project (PDO), planned for 1Q 2017. The LOTOS Group supports the Operator in the activities likely to increase the market value of the YME asset by avoiding the ﬁeld liquidation and return to the development. Grupa LOTOS is monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis to choose the best solution for the YME project. 104/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Innovation potential, cooperation and knowledge sharing 105/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Innovation potential, cooperation and knowledge sharing Innovative approach is a crucial element of our business.

One of the four approved specializations was ‘Eco-eﬃcient technologies in production, transmission, distribution and consumption of energy and fuels’ recommended by a consortium whose members include LOTOS Group companies: Grupa LOTOS, LOTOS Asfalt, LOTOS Lab, LOTOS Oil, and LOTOS Petrobaltic. Smart specializations of the Pomerania region cover business activity areas which may prove crucial to the region’s future competitive position, and as such they are to be promoted by easier access to funds allocated as part of the Regional Operational Programme for the Gdańsk Province for 2014 −2020. The project’s Obtain the smart specialization status to facilitate the commencement of innovative projects related to eﬀective crude oil production technologies and objectives: production of state-of-the-art Group 2 base oils; Develop technologies for obtaining high-margin petroleum products, and production technologies for next generation biofuels, i.e. biofuels that do not compete with food production; Develop state-of-the-art building materials and their application technologies. Partners of the Energa; LOTOS Group Silesian University of Technology; companies in the project: University of Gdańsk; Polish Naval Academy; Gdynia Maritime University; Institute of Fluid-Flow Machinery – Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Power Engineering. More information on smart specializations of the Pomerania region Best practices Cooperation with higher education and research institutions: In one of the projects planned for 2015–2016 LOTOS Petrobaltic is a member of a consortium which is among the four consortia that have obtained the status of smart specialization of the Pomerania region (the ‘Oﬀshore and port and logistics technologies’ project). 39 enterprises, 10 academic institutions and 10 business support organizations participate in the programme, run by the Marshal Oﬃce of the Gdańsk Province. 109/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Grupa LOTOS is conducting analyses to prepare a submission for a competition to obtain co-ﬁnancing for R&D projects executed by large enterprises, announced by the National Centre for Research and Development. The project would be the continuation of a study implemented in 2014, focusing on hydrocarbon generation, expulsion, migration and accumulation, performed with the use of technologically advanced tools and techniques for modelling petroleum processes in exploration activity and the state-of-theart methods for analysis of rock and porous media from the Baltic Sea basin. Cooperation with customers and suppliers, experience sharing in the industry: LOTOS Petrobaltic and Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo signed joint operating agreements concerning the Kamień Pomorski (in north-western Poland) and Górowo-Iławeckie (in north-eastern Poland) licences. Together the two companies performed a 3D seismic survey in the Kamień Pomorski licence area (survey area: 134.8 sq. km, area with receiver points: 267.5 sq. km), and processed and interpreted the image against a part of an archive 3D seismic image. The cooperation on the Górowo Iławieckie licence involved the acquisition of a total of 200.4 km of 2D seismic data and processing of archive data. Grupa LOTOS and Honeywell entered into an agreement on supervision of control systems (80% of the systems were developed by Honeywell). The agreement provides for eﬀective management of the life cycle of individual units and ensures the highest level of safety at work. LOTOS-Air BP Polska and the Olsztyn Mazury Airport signed an agreement for the supply of aviation fuels (eﬀective as of January 2016). From the commencement of talks on prospective cooperation, LOTOS-Air BP Polska’s staﬀ actively supported the airport in its work on fuel infrastructure, formal and technical aspects, as well as tax and legal matters, to ensure that the airport is ready to start operations on time. Grupa LOTOS held a meeting with heads of information divisions from more than a dozen companies based in the Pomerania region. The main theme of the meeting was data and system security issues. It was one of the regional meetings of the CIO Club. In May 2015, the LOTOS Group joined the Technology Transfer Platform, which collect the resources of companies willing to share their innovative solutions and information on the needs of entities that look for innovations. The search mechanism helps match technology providers with seekers. It is a helpful tool for inventors, research institutes and businesses. Other participants of the Technology Transfer Platform include: Enea, Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE), KGHM Polska Miedź, and Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa. 110/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Eco-friendly growth 111/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Eco-friendly growth We have taken a strategic approach to minimizing our environmental impacts, which is why the Grupa LOTOS reﬁnery, our major plant, is now one of the most environmentally friendly reﬁneries in Europe. We believe that reducing negative environmental impacts brings beneﬁts to Grupa LOTOS, and thus to its shareholders. In this way, we create additional value for our other stakeholders, who support us as partners in pro-environmental activities. One of the key objectives of our CSR strategy for 2012−2015 was to reduce the environmental risk and seek to continually minimize the environmental impact of the LOTOS Group’s operations. Four operational goals have been assigned to this objective: Promote environmental standards and best practices across the LOTOS Group; Monitor the environmental footprint of the LOTOS Group’s infrastructure beyond mandatory obligations; Reduce the contamination level in the streams of treated wastewater and discharged water; Improve the ERM Portal supporting environmental risk management. Environmental matters are also addressed in the LOTOS Group’s Code of Ethics. The recommended approach is put into practice by: Adhering to internal procedures intended to ensure conformity of our processes with the requirements imposed by applicable environmental laws; Implementing solutions designed to mitigate the LOTOS Group’s environmental impacts; Engaging in educational initiatives to raise environmental awareness within the organization and in a wider social environment; Care for the environment in and outside of the workplace. The business activity of the LOTOS Group may involve signiﬁcant environmental impacts resulting from emissions of pollutants into the air, generation of waste, use of water and discharge of wastewater. The scale and nature of our environmental impacts are regulated under the environmental protection laws. In connection with their activities, companies of the LOTOS Group hold a number of permits, including integrated permits, which govern the operational and environmental aspects of the LOTOS Group’s installations. The most critical source of environmental impact caused by our plants, both for the installations’ immediate environment and areas located further away, are gas emissions. Therefore, we are most concerned to ensure that the processes involving gas emissions are based on Best Available Techniques and best practices reducing the plants’ impact in that respect. Accordingly, when selecting and implementing innovative solutions, we always seek synergies between the needs of the company and beneﬁts to the environment, and especially to the natural world. 112/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Total environmental protection expenditures and investments Waste disposal, emissions treatment, and remediation costs (PLN thousand) 33,523 Prevention and environmental management costs (PLN thousand) 84,839 Eco-friendly projects (PLN thousand) 72,211 The EFRA Project is not only a breakthrough initiative for Grupa LOTOS in terms of eﬃciency and competitiveness, but it also limits our environmental footprint. When implementing the project, we decided to apply solutions that go beyond environmental protection regulations and BAT requirements: In the Delayed Coking Unit, before opening the DCU reactor, the water pressure will be reduced more than it is normally done, in order to achieve a maximum withdrawal of gaseous hydrocarbons still before the coke cutting and removal processes; All the processes related to coke unloading, transfer, storage, loading and transport out of the reﬁnery will be carried out using a system that ensures above-standard environmental safety. EFRA Project Best practice: Key projects and initiatives to minimize the environmental impact In 2015, the LOTOS Group became the Major Partner of the Baltic Programme, carried out by UN Global Compact in Poland. The Baltic Programme is aimed at developing optimised sustainable development directions in the Baltic Sea region by supporting the expansion of sea transport corridors and transport in the region, paying special attention to improved transport security and infrastructure, increased competitive advantage of the Baltic Sea region, and also to protecting its ecosystem. The environmental protection of the Baltic Sea, including prevention of the eutrophication process, were considered one of the key priorities of the Baltic Programme. In pursuance of the objective of reducing the environmental risk and seeking to continually minimize the environmental impact of the LOTOS Group’s operations, in 2012−2015 we carried out a large-area wildlife survey in the vicinity of the reﬁnery in Gdańsk, and revised the environmental documentation of our service stations across Poland. We organized environmental experts’ meetings to discuss best practices in environmental protection and important protective activities. LOTOS Kolej received modern rolling stock, which eliminated leakage of lubricating oils. In 2015, we eliminated the process of gas removal from LPG tanks on the LOTOS Kolej’s site in Gdańsk. The process was relocated to a Grupa LOTOS unit, where gas is recovered by sending to the fuel gas system. 113/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS Asfalt reduced production costs through the introduction of eﬃcient energy management and feedstock optimization. Its products are manufactured with due care for the environment and transported using eco-friendly means. The company promotes tractors that comply with the highest emission standard (minimum Euro 5), reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon oxides (CO) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Transport is preferably arranged on safe, fast-traﬃc express roads and motorways, with non-collision crossroads, which leads to mitigation of social consequences of road accidents. Polskie Centrum Badań i Certyﬁkacji, a Polish certiﬁcation body, awarded LOTOS Serwis the Integrated Management System Certiﬁcate, which covers maintenance activities, overhauls and upgrades, industrial plant construction and commissioning. The certiﬁcate also extends to works carried out on the oil and gas production installations. In order to minimize the risk of environmental disasters, LOTOS Petrobaltic has put in place procedures based on international regulations, and regularly conducts emergency spill response training in the sea. It is organized in cooperation with the Maritime Search and Rescue Service (SAR) and the Maritime Oﬃce in Gdynia. Our employees’ engagement in numerous ecological initiatives testiﬁes to the importance they attach to environmental protection. For instance, LOTOS Asfalt, partner of the ‘Tree for a Tyre’ campaign organized a collection of worn-out tyres in a facility of Grupa LOTOS in the Gdańsk Province. Within just a few hours, employees from our Gdańsk-based companies brought as many as 300 tyres, receiving 300 guelder-rose, bird cherries, dogwood, ﬁr and spindle seedlings in exchange. During the conference ‘TIME OF INNOVATION. OIL AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES 2015, Grupa LOTOS received an award for the development and implementation of a technology that prevents water in the storage reservoir serving as a source of water for the reﬁnery from turning green with algae. With the new technology, the total amount of water abstracted from the environment was reduced by approximately 6%, despite increased volumes of oil processed. This innovative solution is a source of technological beneﬁts (no problems with water treatment), economic beneﬁts (stable production cost) and environmental beneﬁts (improved water quality). 114/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Reduction of energy consumption In 2015, companies of the LOTOS Group engaged in eﬃciency initiatives to reduce energy consumption. At Grupa LOTOS, this goal was pursued as part of the currently implemented Energy Management System based on ISO 50001, and is in line with the Company’s Energy Policy underlying the System. Activities improving energy eﬃciency are part of our constant development eﬀorts and are carried out in compliance with established and documented procedures. They focus primarily on such matters as optimization of technological processes, maintenance of energy-consuming infrastructure in proper technical condition, investments to improve energy eﬃciency, and procurement of services and assets taking into account their energy intensity’s eﬀect on long-term costs of their use. In 2015, projects involving optimization of steam network performance and rotating machinery were conducted, which helped reduce energy consumption by 90,760 when converted GJ/MWh in total. LOTOS Oil completed three initiatives resulting from its ﬁve-year overhaul schedule and consultations with the staﬀ on the possible ways of reducing branch costs. The initiatives involved replacement of pipeline and tank heat insulation as part of ongoing maintenance activities, and employee-targeted information campaign on the importance of heat and energy saving. As for LOTOS Asfalt, the company’s activities under the Energy Management Systems produced eﬃciencies amounting to 63,139 when converted GJ/MWh. Other companies of the LOTOS Group also take steps to minimize their energy and fuel consumption. In 2015, LOTOS Paliwa upgraded lighting of petrol pump canopies at 13 service stations. LOTOS Kolej reduced its fuel consumption − in 2015 it used 0.18 l/km less diesel oil than in 2014.

The 2015 CO2 emissions intensity ratio (per production unit, direct emissions only) was: at Grupa LOTOS: 29.8 kg CO2/CWT at LOTOS Petrobaltic: 0.261 tCO2/toe at LOTOS Asfalt: Gdańsk plant − 0.018 t CO2/t of the product, Jasło plant − 0.11 t CO2/t of the product (various processes run at the Gdańsk plant and the Jasło plant characterised with diﬀerent emission levels) at Energobaltic: 0.06 tonnes/GJ Falling oil prices and the resulting decrease in prices of ﬁnished goods had a bearing on the environmental impact of the Grupa LOTOS reﬁnery in Gdańsk in 2015. In the new price environment, the unit cost of energy generated from the reﬁnery’s ﬁnished goods turned out to be lower than the unit cost of energy from natural gas. This was an opportunity to reduce operating expenses and improve our competitive position. The larger share of crude oil products, the so-called ﬁnished goods in the energy and feedstock mix at our Gdańsk reﬁnery had a marked impact on sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate emissions from our installations. At one of the hydrogen generation units, we used LPG as feedstock on a temporary basis.. It is worth stressing that the quality of ﬁnished goods, and the amount of emissions into the air were within the permitted levels set out in the integrated permit.

Formation water Until recently, formation water separated from the formation ﬂuid as part of LOTOS Petrobaltic’s operations used to be puriﬁed of oil components to a level below 15 ppm (“parts per million”) and discharged into the sea. At present, in line with the requirements of the Baltic Sea Action Plan, developed by the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) and approved in 2007 by the Environmental Protection Ministers of the Baltic States, the ‘zero discharge’ principle applies to oﬀshore activities in the Baltic Sea. Therefore, a special water injection system was installed on the Baltic Beta platform to inject water back into the rock mass. This has a positive eﬀect on the environment and raises the reservoir pressure, improving eﬃciency.

As production from the ﬁeld was launched on September 30th 2015, the content of water in the formation ﬂuid was negligible (1%). Once the Petrobaltic rig (currently undergoing conversion), with the formation water injection system installed, is placed on the B8 ﬁeld, water will be injected back into the ﬁeld. In 2015, LOTOS Geonafta produced 251,741 cubic metres of formation water. The water was injected back into the formation and therefore is not subject to any speciﬁc requirements in terms of hydrocarbon content or salinity. The company intends to maintain the concentration of hydrocarbons in formation water below the level of 40 mg/litre. In 2015, 2,291.5 cubic metres of the produced brine was supplied to municipal utilities. 125/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Waste management The LOTOS Group complies with all national and EU regulations and decisions, making every eﬀort to manage its waste in an environmentally safe manner.

Once carried to the surface, they are directed to the treatment system. Total volume of drilling waste generated by LOTOS Petrobaltic using water-based drilling ﬂuid was 235.76 Mg, of which 73.44 Mg of drill cuttings and 152.96 Mg of drilling mud was transferred for recovery, and 9.36 Mg of drill cuttings was burnt. Total volume of drilling waste generated by AB LOTOS Geonafta using water-based drilling ﬂuid was 2,206.84 Mg. Most of the compounds used in 2015 were biodegradable. All of the drilling waste (drilling mud and drill cuttings) was shipped to the waste treatment plant. The LOTOS Group favours eco-friendly waste management methods, such as recycling and recovery, and takes ﬁrm steps to curb the use of methods that are harmful to the environment, such as burning without energy recovery, landﬁlling and other forms of disposal. 127/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Biodiversity The LOTOS Group operates close to areas of high environmental value and therefore makes every eﬀort to continuously monitor potential hazards to biodiversity that may follow from its business growth. The LOTOS Group’s sites neighbouring areas of environmental value include: The Słupsk E and Słupsk W licence areas (2,160.3 sq. km), owned by LOTOS Petrobaltic, located in the Polish Economic Zone of the Baltic Sea and bordering on a Natura 2000 site. Five sites of AB LOTOS Geonafta in the Kretinga region (with a total area of 0.06 sq. km), in close vicinity to areas of great natural value due to aquatic ecosystems (Natura 2000). Energobaltic’s sites in Władysławowo (0.02 sq. km), bordering on the Coastal Landscape Park protected area (Natura 2000). The reﬁnery in Gdańsk, located 2 km in a straight line from a protected area, unique on a European scale due to its location on a waterbird migration route (Natura 2000). During uninterrupted operation, none of the units at the LOTOS Group companies has a major negative impact on the native species. Technical, organizational and systemic solutions have been put in place to ensure that immediate action is taken in the event of a failure involving, for example, an oil spill, in order to control any possible eruption or spill before it reaches the protected areas. For several years, Grupa LOTOS has been investigating the impact of the Gdańsk reﬁnery, which is its main plant, on biodiversity. As one of environmental protection tasks completed as part of our CSR strategy eﬀective until 2015, in 2014 we carried out a voluntary comprehensive survey of wildlife within the reﬁnery premises and in surrounding areas. The survey report serves as a basis for expanding our knowledge of biodiversity and as a starting point for monitoring sites identiﬁed as most valuable nature conservation areas. Neither the wildlife survey carried out in 2014, nor the initial assessment of the reﬁnery’s impact on biodiversity, showed any negative eﬀects of the reﬁnery’s operations on the surroundings. No investment projects are planned that could change this status. Two endangered species included in the IUCN Red List have been identiﬁed in the vicinity of the Gdańsk reﬁnery. However, the reﬁnery’s operations have been found to have no adverse eﬀect on the protected species living in the surrounding area. Repairs of the CHP plant’s chimney stack are carried out so as not to disrupt the breeding cycle of peregrine falcon nesting there. More information 128/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Process safety 129/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Process safety management The LOTOS Group places a strong focus on ensuring and maintaining a high process safety culture across the organization. The LOTOS Group companies monitor incident rates on an ongoing basis and eliminate all potential threats. Grupa LOTOS has for many years been following best practices in preserving the integrity of its technical infrastructure. The practices include predictive and preventive maintenance, an inspection and supervisory test programme, non-destructive testing programme, risk-based inspection programme, regular repairs of process units, repair quality control, and a corrosion prevention programme. To ensure process safety and thus prevent plant failures and limit their consequences, Grupa LOTOS maintains an Industrial Accident Prevention Programme. In addition, as part of supervision of infrastructure and instrumentation and control systems we apply regulations that deﬁne the procedures for: Selection and purchase of plant and equipment as well as instrumentation and control systems; Oversight of their operation, planning and execution of inspections and repairs; Control and certiﬁcation of instrumentation and control systems and steps to be taken if any damage to the equipment is identiﬁed. Energobaltic holds periodic preventive inspections with a frequency deﬁned in the technical documentation for particular equipment. The operation and parameters of the equipment are constantly monitored by the company’s employees. At its facilities, LOTOS Infrastruktura has deployed CCTV, tank bottom leak tightness monitoring, tank loading monitoring to prevent overﬁlling, as well as monitoring of tank outﬂow trays to prevent soil contamination. LOTOS Asfalt attaches great importance to identifying potential safety hazards. Its employees responsible for process control undergo training courses, and the company incorporates best engineering practices in its technological and job instruction manuals. To ensure quick and eﬀective crisis management, LOTOS Oil has introduced an accident and crisis response procedure. The procedure is designed to mitigate the eﬀect of accidents on human health and life as well as the environment, ensure quick and eﬀective management of the organization during an accident and a smooth return to normal operation, and also to limit and minimize loss of LOTOS Oil assets. 130/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS Petrobaltic holds periodic preventive inspections with a frequency deﬁned in the technical documentation for particular equipment and introduced into the SAP system. This inspection regime facilitates ongoing checks of key system elements and removal of weak links in the units. Platform crews also ensure ongoing supervision of the operating parameters of the units. If the permitted operating limits are exceeded, the system operators take appropriate steps to eliminate pressure overrun. For the purpose of ﬁre prevention, rules to minimize the risk of accidental ﬁre during work and rest time on platforms have been implemented. For example, one of the rules is that works entailing a potential risk of ﬁre are permitted only upon authorization. Such authorizations are issued in accordance with a special procedure. Smoking is prohibited on platforms and in port facilities, outside of designated areas, and use of open ﬁre is prohibited in all buildings. All rules applicable at the facilities are consolidated in the Safety Policy manual for the organization. To mitigate risks related to the activities of subcontractors, each subcontractor agreement includes a Safety Annex, binding on all subcontractor representatives working in the port facilities and on the organization’s platforms. Process safety incidents reported in 2015 In 2015, Grupa LOTOS reported one incident classiﬁed as Tier 1 process safety event and two incidents classiﬁed as Tier 2 process safety event under Standard RP 754 of the American Petroleum Institute (API). Both events occurred in reﬁning operations and had no environmental impact. LOTOS Paliwa reported two Tier 2 safety events. The events were related to an LPG installation damage at the company’s service stations. The following hazardous situations were also reported: 10 customer car ﬁres at or near service stations, 2 ﬁres, and 2 fuel spills. All hazardous situations, and the above cases in particular, are reported by the station operators to the LOTOS Paliwa OHS staﬀ. Next, the risk of similar situations occurring in the future and potential requirement for preventive measures are analysed. In addition, three Tier 2 safety events were also reported at LOTOS Kolej. The events involved railcar and locomotive derailing without any environmental impact. At LOTOS Kolej, an emergency preparedness and response procedure was put in place. It imposes the requirement to report the type of hazard, the place of incident, threat to human life, materials and objects involved in the accident, and their possible eﬀect. The procedure lays down detailed rules to follow in case of emergency. 131/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group RBI methodology – risk under control In 2011, Grupa LOTOS was ﬁrst in Poland to implement the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) methodology, a system for comprehensive management of risk related to the operation of pressure equipment. The system allows us to predict potential equipment failures. In 2015, we completed an analysis of unit 250 (Hydrogen Generation Unit). Currently, we are analysing risks for 12 key units which, if stopped, may have extremely adverse consequences for the operation of the reﬁnery as a whole. Key beneﬁts of full RBI implementation: It results in greater reliability of unit operation; The period of uninterrupted operation of the reﬁnery between maintenance shutdowns should extend from 4 to 5 years; Accident prevention is a source of savings counted in millions; Higher output. Why is RBI so important to Grupa LOTOS? Most of the reﬁnery’s plant is pressure equipment: pipelines, columns, reactors, tanks. They are often subject to high pressures and temperatures and exposed to corrosion and erosion. Even though made of resistant metal alloys, their wear and tear is inevitable as time passes. The equipment is overseen by internal services and the Polish Oﬃce of Technical Inspection (UDT), which deﬁnes its safe operating lives and decides how long the equipment, units and reﬁnery can operate without a maintenance break. By Implementation of the RBI together with the UDT involves a check of nearly 8,500 pieces of equipment and determining which carry the highest risk of damage. By focusing on particular pieces of equipment we limit the risk of breakdown. What are our goals? 2017 will see a maintenance shutdown and our plan is that by that time the RBI methodology should cover as many key units as possible. In this way, during the shutdown we will be able to inspect the instruments and equipment that carry the highest risk of degradation, selected based on an RBI analysis. 132/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group RBI Team The RBI teams assigned to individual units comprise more than 40 staﬀ. In addition to the team leader – a supervision inspector from Grupa LOTOS, each team includes two or three UDT inspectors, scientists from the Gdańsk University of Technology, corrosion engineers, plant engineering and maintenance engineers, as well as process and operations engineers from the production division. Our teams include two engineers who are the only engineers in Poland holding certiﬁcates issued by the American Petroleum Institute (API). 133/263 LOTOS Group Integrated Annual Report 2015 04 Product, customer Commitment to quality, safety and brand image 134/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Product, customer – Commitment to quality, safety and brand image At the LOTOS Group, we believe that commitment to high quality should begin with the supplier and remain a priority along the supply chain, until a product reaches the ﬁnal customer. This belief has led to a strong focus on superior standards in both production and services, with the aim of building the LOTOS Group’s value and enhancing our positive impact. Through a number of initiatives, including development of key innovative technologies and solutions, we have been able to increase productivity and bring down costs. We have also become an increasingly trustworthy and reliable business partner. We stimulate local business. Our eﬀorts have also led to growing market shares and contributed to enhanced perception and value of the LOTOS brand. As at the end of the reporting period, our share in the Polish retail market of liquid fuels reached the target of 10%. Our eﬀectively executed optimization measures led to a marked improvement of the LOTOS chain’s ﬁnancial results. Clean EBITDA (adjusted for one-oﬀ items) in 2015 amounted to PLN 112m, a new record high in the history of our service stations. Drawing on our long-standing experience in sports sponsorship, in 2015 we made a decision, with a full sense of responsibility for what that entails, to become the Main Sponsor of the national football team. For us, it is a grand, ambitious and emotionally signiﬁcant undertaking, because we realize that our national team, its attitude and success engage all Polish people and positively reﬂect on the LOTOS brand. LOTOS is one of the strongest and most recognisable brands in the Polish market. In the 12th List of Poland’s Most Valuable Brands compiled by the Rzeczpospolita daily, the brand ranked 8th, having advanced by one position over the year. However, since 2010 its value has more than doubled. 135/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group How do we create value for investors and customers? Key ﬁnancial indicators Key non-ﬁnancial indicators Share of the Polish fuel market: 31.2% Customer satisfaction: ratio of the relationship and loyalty of the LOTOS 10.5% share of the Polish retail fuel market Group’s customers is 76 points according to TRIM Value of brand: PLN 1.4bn Increased station availability for customers: increased number of stations 2014 441, 2015 476 Presence on 82 markets Safety also remains our key priority, from feedstock procurement and processing to delivery of ﬁnished products to the market. Products of the LOTOS Group meet the applicable quality standards, as conﬁrmed by relevant certiﬁcates required and recognized both on the local and international markets. 136/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Conditions on the Polish fuel market in 2015 Domestic demand for fuels is shaped by the overall economic situation in Poland and the region. In 2015, Poland’s GDP grew by 3.6%, 0.2 percentage point above the government’s forecast. According to the Central Statistics Oﬃce data, the key drivers of growth were internal consumption and exports. Other supportive factors included a favourable business climate in the manufacturing and construction industries. The unemployment rate as at the year’s end was 9.8%. The overall condition of the economy is reﬂected in fuel consumption data, with growth seen across all product categories during the period. Diesel oil: consumption of diesel oil in Poland reached 12.5 million tonnes, up 8.4% on the year before. Despite the growth – the volume of consumption in 2015 was down 800 thousand tonnes on 2011. Analysts attribute the downward trend prevailing until 2014 to the fast expanding shadow economy, which took advantage of the favourable business climate and high retail prices. Gasolines: for the ﬁrst time in six years, the segment returned to a growth path. Demand for gasoline in 2015 grew by 4.3%, to 3.8 million tonnes, stimulated by the stronger business activity, falling unemployment, and lower prices at the pump. LPG: sales went up by 2%, to 2,351 thousand tonnes. The LPG market in Poland may be described as mature, with annual consumption volumes at 2.2-2.3 million tonnes in each of the last ﬁve years. Aviation fuel: demand increased by 3.4%. Thanks to the growing number of airline services, expansion of new airlines and steady increase in the number of passengers, the market is viewed as highly promising and is expected to grow in the coming years. By 2012, the global demand may rise by: 11% for JET fuel, 9% for LPG, 9% for diesel oil, 5% for gasoline. In the coming years, demand for light fuel oil is expected to decline slightly, by 1%. 137/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our products 138/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Sustainable products Adverse climate changes and environmental pollution, as well as growing consumer awareness and expectations, entail a need to expand the range of sustainable products. In the fuel industry, fossil fuels are replaced by renewable energy sources, which contribute to lowering emissions, including CO2 emissions. Energy of the future at Grupa LOTOS Replacement of fossil fuels by other energy sources has long been a subject of strategic analyses at Grupa LOTOS. We see fossil fuel substitution not only as a threat to our principal activities associated with conventional energy, but also as an opportunity to further expand our business by leveraging long-term trends on the global energy market. How do we contribute to fossil fuel substitution? We are engaged in work on possible applications at the Grupa LOTOS reﬁnery of hydrogen generated through electrolysis of water with the use of renewable energy sources, which is part of the GEKON (Generator of Ecological Concepts) programme, a joint initiative of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management and the National Centre for Research and Development http://program-gekon.pl/. We are also looking into the possibility of processing vegetable oils and animal fats into bio-hydrocarbons in the HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) process. Further investments are conditional upon successful completion of EFRA, our strategic project, which will signiﬁcantly improve the competitive position of Grupa LOTOS and complexity of its reﬁnery. High quality standards of Grupa LOTOS fuels All Grupa LOTOS fuel products meet the quality requirements prescribed by law, and in some environmentally relevant respects − even exceed the legally required standards. The sulfur content of our key products, both gasolines and diesel oils manufactured by the Gdańsk reﬁnery, is substantially below the legal limit. The average annual sulfur content in motor gasolines and diesel oils is 2.8 ppm and 6.7 ppm, respectively, considerably below the legal limit 10 ppm. This results in substantially lower sulfur dioxide emissions. Hazardous substances in Grupa LOTOS fuels Unit 2015 volume 2015 volume 2014 volume 2014 volume Substance (average) (average) 139/263 substantially below the legal limit. The average annual sulfur content in motor gasolines and diesel oils is 2.8 ppm and 6.7 ppm, respectively, considerably below the legal limit 10 ppm.

According to the current quality requirements for liquid fuels, the permitted ethanol and ethyl tert-butyl ether content in gasoline is 5% and 15%, respectively. Similarly, the volume of fatty acid methyl esters in diesel oils must not exceed 7%. In 2013, the Council of Ministers issued a Regulation on National Indicative Targets (NIT) for 2013−2018, setting NIT for 2013−2016 at 7.1%, which means that biocomponents must account for 7.1% of the energy content of fuels marketed in Poland (the national blending quota). In 2015, Grupa LOTOS was allowed to meet a lower NIT of 6.035%, having fulﬁlled the statutory requirement whereby at least 70% of the total biocomponent volume used for liquid fuel and biofuel production must be supplied by producers listed in the register of the Agricultural Market Agency. In 2015, Grupa LOTOS produced nearly 102.7 million litres of biocomponents meeting the sustainability criteria set forth in Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, and deﬁned by recognized certiﬁcation systems. They were produced in Czechowice-Dziedzice. We also purchased 397.5 million litres of biocomponents meeting the sustainability criteria. 140/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our products are appreciated by the market Our products are appreciated by the market, as evidenced by the growing sales and strong market position of Grupa LOTOS.

We do that by focusing on understanding customers’ needs and oﬀering them safe quality products. We measure our success in this respect by reference to the level of our customers’ satisfaction with cooperation with the LOTOS Group’s marketing companies. Customer satisfaction survey − approach and results Progress in customer relations is monitored through regular surveys. They focus on such factors as supplier selection process, cooperation with supplier staﬀ, their accessibility and competences, quality and availability of products, time of response to call for oﬀers, prices, and the image. Satisfaction surveys among the LOTOS Group’s customers Company Survey frequency in year Customer segments Grupa LOTOS 1 B2B LOTOS Asfalt 1 B2B bitumen Grupa Kapitałowa LOTOS, forwarding companies, direct LOTOS Kolej 2 customers LOTOS Oil 1 B2B LOTOS Paliwa 1 B2B At most of the marketing segment companies, customer satisfaction surveys are conducted using the CAWI (Computer-Assisted Web Interview) technique. The results are analysed based on the TRI*M method, developed by a research company TNS Polska, the TRI*M Index being a single number score which measures customer satisfaction and loyalty levels. The TRI*M Index questions relate to overall rating, probability of recommendation, likelihood of repeat purchasing of product/service, and competitive advantage. The TRI*M Index is a measure of customer retention levels − the higher it is, the greater the brand loyalty. The TRI*M Index ﬁgures reported for the LOTOS Group companies indicate that the overall satisfaction with their products is high. In 2015, the best result in the survey was achieved by Grupa LOTOS, with the score highest since 2012 (see the table below). Wartości TRI*M Index for the LOTOS Group companies Company 2015 2014 2013 2012 Grupa LOTOS 87 82 86 80 LOTOS Paliwa 78 N/A 76 N/A 145/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS Oil 69 70 67 N/A LOTOS Asfalt 80 77 73 70 Grupa LOTOS: The customer relationship and loyalty score was 87 in 2015, indicating high customer satisfaction. Compared with 2014, TRI*M increased 5 points. Improvement was seen not only in the overall rating of Grupa LOTOS but also in the scores for the probability of recommendation, repeat purchase, and competitive advantage. Grupa LOTOS customers are very loyal and attached to the LOTOS brand. The proportion of unsatisﬁed and disloyal customers declined, whereas the proportion of customers for whom the main selection criterion was the price increased. LOTOS Paliwa: The customer satisfaction survey in 2015 was conducted using the CATI technique. The survey participants were ﬂeet and B2B customers (wholesalers, independent service stations, and partner stations). 2015 results: overall TRI*M rating (synthetic measure of customer satisfaction and loyalty) was 78, up 2pp on the previous wave of the survey. LOTOS Oil: Analysis of the customer satisfaction survey ﬁndings was based on the TRI*M method developed by TNS. The survey was conducted among authorized distributors, large customers operating as trade partners (wholesale channel), and end customers from the industrial and automotive segments, including approved repair shops and service providers, auto parts retailers, as well as businesses from various industries (direct sales channel). 2015 results: overall TRI*M rating − 69, or 1 point down on 2014. The scores for recommendation and competitive advantage remained similar as a year earlier, while the score for probability of repeat purchase decreased slightly. Relative to 2014, LOTOS Oil was more widely recognized as a company that cares for the environment − the score for this aspect improved the most. 146/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS Asfalt: In 2015, the satisfaction survey was carried out among Polish and foreign customers and was based on TNS Polska’s TRI*M methodology. It focused, among other aspects, on relations with sales representatives and distribution teams, but also on product quality, bidding processes, and the company’s image. 2015 score: TRI*M rating − 80, or 3 points up on 2014. Timeliness and reliability of deliveries were the strongest drivers of customer satisfaction − 68% of the respondents said that their orders were always delivered on time. Another strength of LOTOS Asfalt is the product quality − more than a half of all its customers gave the company the highest scores for this aspect. The next major advantage of LOTOS Asfalt is the quality of customer service. And LOTOS Asfalt’s customers are loyal − 94% of the respondents would recommend the company to their trading partners. How is customer satisfaction measured at the other companies of the LOTOS Group? LOTOS Kolej: Satisfaction ratings are obtained primarily through direct interaction with representatives of the customers. Another tool used to measure customer satisfaction is a voluntary questionnaire-based evaluation system. In 2015, the overall score given to the company was 8.51 out of 10. LOTOS Lab: To measure customer satisfaction, in 2015 the company sent questionnaires to its selected customers and to the companies of the LOTOS Group which use LOTOS Lab services. The overall level of customer satisfaction was 94% . 147/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group With customer safety in mind At Grupa LOTOS we take great care to ensure that our products and services meet the customers’ expectations and pose no threat to health and safety. We are aware that our responsibility in this respect is not only to meet the obligatory legal requirements, but also to deliver on the initiatives we undertake and to follow our in-house rules. By taking steps to minimize safety risks, we build up our reputation, a springboard for our steady development and value growth. Our products have no secrets Product Sheets or Safety Data Sheets have been prepared for all products manufactured by the LOTOS Group. The materials are based on applicable international requirements (by law, dangerous substances and mixtures which are supplied without a Safety Data Sheet must not be marketed or used in professional applications). Product Sheets and Safety Data Sheets contain information on the product’s impact on health and environment, hazardous ingredients, substances and chemicals, ﬁre-ﬁghting measures, accidental release measures, disposal, etc. Every customer can access the information on safe use of our products, either online or directly at points of sale. Safety Data Sheets are delivered directly to each wholesale distributor and are available to retail customers at the LOTOS service stations. Where required, Safety Data Sheets for non-fuel products are also made available at LOTOS service stations. More information on Safety Data Sheets for products We assess our impacts to deliver safer products and services To improve the monitored indicators, Grupa LOTOS assesses the health and safety impacts of all its key product and service categories. The impact of fuels on human health and safety is monitored during production (except at LOTOS Paliwa). In 2015, LOTOS Asfalt checked all its products (bitumens, bitumen products and bunker fuel) for health and safety impacts. The same was done by LOTOS Oil with respect to all of its products. All Safety Data Sheets were updated pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council. With the Integrated Management System in place at Grupa LOTOS, LOTOS Oil can review the Safety Data Sheets on an ongoing basis. Introduction of any new product is preceded by the examination of its impact on health and safety. LOTOS Kolej assessed 44.44% of items in its oﬀering for health and safety impacts in 2015 (transport of dangerous goods). We have also taken relevant safety enhancing measures in our transport and distribution processes. Additionally, third-party providers of transport services are assessed for compliance with safety standards. As part of eﬀorts to ensure the highest possible safety of transport processes, LOTOS Kolej concluded a cooperation agreement with railroad safety manager (Eisenbahn Betriebstleiter), who is responsible for ensuring that transport processes are performed properly and that the internal rules in place at LOTOS Kolej are aligned with the applicable laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. 148/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Fuel distribution is subject to special safety supervision. For fuel sales by CODO stations, LOTOS Paliwa has set safety standards and monitors compliance by the station managers. This process is governed by separate agreements and procedures, with the latter being improved on an ongoing basis. As part of our supervision of road transport, delegated employees of LOTOS Paliwa undertake regular ﬁeld inspections to monitor: Loading operations at fuel depots, Safe passage of tank trucks over monitored routes, including correct cargo marking in compliance with the ADR requirements, Safety of unloading sites, Unloading operations, to ensure their compliance with the established procedure, Actions taken in case of spills or failures. What else did we do? Grupa LOTOS has developed a product safety system (the SDS system) to facilitate the ﬂow of information on chemical substances and mixtures present on the reﬁnery premises, and to improve distribution of Safety Data Sheets to customers who buy LOTOS products. All employees have access to the SDS Portal containing all up-to-date Safety Data Sheets. Furthermore, the staﬀ of individual organizational units have assigned to them relevant sets of Safety Data Sheets pertaining to products they come to contact with. 149/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Best practices: for the convenience of service station customers LOTOS Biznes car ﬂeet cards for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises Our business philosophy is to build the best possible oﬀer for each, even the smallest, company. Therefore, we continuously develop our oﬀer for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises. A new type of the LOTOS Biznes car ﬂeet card is an innovative solution designed with this customer group speciﬁcally in mind. It oﬀers modern functionalities, many of which prove more valuable to small businesses than to large corporations. Beneﬁts to customers: LOTOS Biznes car ﬂeet cards for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises oﬀer, among other beneﬁts, simpliﬁed settlements, cost control and discounts on fuel and services; as a result, they help reduce the cost of accounting services as well as other operating costs, and save the time necessary for business development. Beneﬁts to Grupa LOTOS: With LOTOS Biznes cards used by businesses across a variety of industries, we are able to stabilize our fuel sales regardless of business cycles in individual sectors of the economy. Our service stations are the front line of our sales activities, enabling us to reach out to new procurement groups, e.g. taxi ﬁrms. What else do we oﬀer to customers at LOTOS service stations? LOTOS Premium stations are equipped ﬁlling facilities for the disabled and baby changing stations. Many LOTOS service stations have automatic car washes, but we are also developing a network of manual car wash facilities, with a target of reaching more than 20 such locations by the end of 2016, which will represent one-ﬁfth of all car washes in our chain. All our automatic car washes have wastewater treatment facilities and closed water circulation systems reducing water consumption to approximately 15 litres of clean water per cycle. LOTOS Paliwa joined the eMobility project run by Energa to create a network of charging stations for electric vehicles in the Gdańsk-Gdynia-Sopot agglomeration. Our stations use the CHAdeMO charging standard. With 39 kW of power, the system takes 25 to 45 minutes to charge the most popular electric and hybrid cars. In 2015, two quick charge points were opened in Gdańsk. By opening the ﬁrst SUBWAY restaurant at our service station (in Rumia in the Gdańsk Province) in December 2015, we teamed up with this largest fast food chain in the world. We intend to develop the cooperation to support our food and beverage brand Cafe Punkt. Motorcyclists are an important and growing group of LOTOS customers. In 2015, we removed the lower limit on the amount of fuel motorists must buy to earn points in the LOTOS Navigator loyalty programme. Holders of Navigator Motorcycle Rider Cards can collect points also when buying fuel for cars, a feature appreciated particularly by those motorcyclists who in autumn and winter prefer to travel by car. 150/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS service stations are equipped with various facilities for the disabled: access ramps and lowered kerbs at the entrance to station buildings, designated parking spaces, toilets with disabled facilities, convenient spaces with ramps at new Premium stations, special posts with buttons to press to ask station staﬀ for assistance, suﬃcient space to use wheelchair at station shops, wide spaces between shelving units with easy access to cash desk. To meet the needs of customers travelling with pets, from April to September we provide bowls of fresh water at selected LOTOS service stations. Additionally, throughout the year at each LOTOS station motorists can receive free plastic bowls for their animals. 2015 was the third year when we ran the campaign. In 2015, mobile charging points were installed at some of LOTOS service stations. In response to our customers’ needs, we oﬀered the possibility of free charging of most popular types of mobile phones and tablets. When waiting for their device to charge, customers have an opportunity to enjoy Café Punkt services. 151/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Grupa LOTOS service station chain 152/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Grupa LOTOS service station chain A growing chain of service stations operating in two segments: premium (LOTOS) and economy (LOTOS Optima) is an important part of our business.

We LOTOS Premium and standardized the visual identiﬁcation of a large number of the service LOTOS Optima service stations, both in the premium and the economy segments. stations were standardized in 2015 Our achievements so far: As part of the standardization eﬀort, we uniﬁed and improved the look of our service stations. We have also placed strong emphasis on the customer service quality. Having deﬁned the standards, we make every eﬀort to ensure that they are observed by the staﬀ. Thanks to the commitment of our sales personnel and the attractive oﬀering, we have also been highly successful in expanding our ﬂeet customer base. Our plans: 2016 will see further optimization of the service station chain, with an even stronger focus on stable expansion, improvement of customer service quality, and enhancing of sales eﬃciency. We intend to proceed with the standardization of our stores and to expand our range of food services. We also plan to signiﬁcantly diversify the stores’ oﬀering and to markedly increase the range of services available at the stations. 155/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Management of the service station chain − best practicesd Our stations are more eco-friendly In 2015, at 28 LOTOS DOFO service stations we carried out the Ecoacademy project, implemented as part of the European Social Fund: Human capital – the best investment, with the objective to improve competences of the staﬀ of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises with respect to environmental protection. Following the execution of environmental reviews (April−June 2015), each participant received an audit report specifying the scope of legal requirements for service stations related to environmental protection, and containing assessment of their implementation, and recommendations to take corrective measures, if any. In addition, in June 2015, six training sessions were organized for service station personnel, devoted to environmental protection at service stations. Over 100 staﬀ participated in the training held as part of meetings of regional LOTOS partner stations in Tarnów, Tychy, Uniejów, Opalenica, Majdan and Olsztyn. Safe refuelling Safety at the LOTOS service stations is our priority, which we ensure with the help of qualiﬁed staﬀ using modern technologies and procedures. OSH trainings, which are regularly attended by our employees, serve to enhance their knowledge and skills in responding to dangerous situations, ﬁres, and other hazards. Modern technological solutions employed at the LOTOS service stations not only promote safety, but also generate savings. The fuel pumps are equipped with vapour recovery nozzles capturing fuel vapours from cars’ tanks. With this technology we protect the environment by preventing hydrocarbon emissions, and also recover fuel vapours, directing them to an underground tank. 156/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Efficient distribution and logistics 157/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Eﬃcient distribution and logistics At the LOTOS Group, we are consistently adapting logistics solutions to the changing requirements of our trading business. We also develop an eﬃcient distribution system that meets the expectations of customers, but also helps reduce costs. To build an optimum logistics chain that would eﬃciently operate in the constantly changing external and internal environments, in 2015: The LOTOS Group continued consolidation of its assets. On April 1st 2015, Grupa LOTOS sold its fuel terminal in Poznań to LOTOS Terminale. The structure of mandatory stocks was optimized to minimize the cost of holding the stocks. We derived additional revenue from the provision of logistics services to third-party customers. The scope of the marine cargo terminal project on the Martwa Wisła river, in the immediate vicinity of the Gdańsk reﬁnery, was regularly reviewed in the context of the planned volumes and structure of Grupa LOTOS’ products following completion of the EFRA project. The logistics services market was being monitored to identify any alternative low-tonnage sea cargo handling solutions. 158/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Rail transport Rail transport of products from the Gdańsk reﬁnery is a mainstay of the LOTOS Group’s production security. LOTOS Kolej, a specialist rail freight operator, provides comprehensive rail logistics services to the entire Group. One of the elements of the company’s strategy is to develop both domestic and international transport activities. In 2015, LOTOS Kolej provided the following railway services: Rail freight transport in Poland, Eco-friendly cleaning of rail tank cars, Freight transport services in Germany (from International rail freight and forwarding services, November), Management of railway sidings for the LOTOS Trainload and non-trainload services, Group and maintenance of railway infrastructure. Maintenance of rolling stock, LOTOS Kolej’s transported volumes rose by 2m tonnes, from 10.6m over 12.6 tonnes in 2014 to 12.6m tonnes in 2015. The increase was mainly driven by larger volumes transported for clients from outside the LOTOS Group − up by 1.8m tonnes, from 5.6m to 7.4m. The transport volumes within the m LOTOS Group also grew, from 5m to 5.2m tonnes. tonnes amount of cargo transported by LOTOS Kolej in 2015 In 2015, LOTOS Kolej increased its share in the Polish rail freight market from 8.87% to 9.92%, thus maintaining the second position among rail cargo operators. The company also increased its share in the intermodal transport segment − from 19.17% to 23.17%.*​ * In terms of tonne-kilometres, according to the Oﬃce of Rail Transport data for 2014 and 2015 159/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group In 2015, LOTOS Kolej obtained the safety certiﬁcate, part B, for Germany, and started transport services in that country. The German market is the largest transport market in the European Union, with high share of the railway transport (above 20%). This is also the one with the highest potential resulting from the economy size and its stability. Until recently, the Company transported within the former Federal Republic of Germany only in the border traﬃc, i.e. to the ﬁrst German station where the train was handed over to the subcontractor. Since 2015, the Company has been allowed to provide own transport services in the territory of Germany, thus being able to compete with other carriers oﬀering international rail transport, and to strengthen its relations with the existing customers looking for fast rail connections between Poland and Germany. Year on year, LOTOS Kolej has been steadily increasing the number of services for external customers, from outside the LOTOS Group, with the number of transport for external customers exceeding the numbers recorded for LOTOS Group in 2015. 160/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Sea transport Transport by sea is a vital component of the LOTOS Group’s logistics over 8.5 chain. Having direct access to the product pipelines linking our reﬁnery in Gdańsk to the liquid fuel handling facilities at Port Północny, we enjoy a considerable advantage of lower transport costs. million Transport by the Baltic Sea is oﬀered by the companies belonging to tonnes Miliana Shipholding Company Ltd. Group. The services consist in crude oil collection and warehousing in the production area its transport from the volume of crude oil, ﬁeld to the harbour and rescue assistance for the oil platforms. petroleum products and fuel components 2015 was yet another record year for Grupa LOTOS both in terms of the handled by Grupa LOTOS volume of cargo handled at sea ports and the number of tankers handled at sea ports in 2015 at the ports. More than Maritime transport is Grupa LOTOS’ main mode of exporting petroleum 400 products and also accounts for a signiﬁcant portion of deliveries of feedstock, raw materials and components. The coastal location allows Grupa LOTOS to respond to changing market conditions in a quick and ﬂexible manner. number of tankers handled by Grupa LOTOS in 2015 The liquid fuel terminal, owned by Naftoport, has the capacity to handle tankers with a maximum draught of 15 metres and a freight capacity up to 150,000 tonnes of crude oil or petroleum products. This allows Grupa LOTOS to export surplus products and sell them mainly on the markets of Scandinavia, northern and western Europe and the Baltic states. The direct connection to the port also facilitates imports of additional feedstock, including intermediate products for further, deep processing at the Gdańsk reﬁnery, as well as fuel components. We also use the Maritime Bulk Terminal in Gdynia and the Siarkopol terminal in Gdańsk to handle smaller cargoes. With its reﬁnery’s close proximity to the cargo handling terminal, Grupa LOTOS is able to diversify its supply sources and to receive shipments of crude oil from the Company’s own ﬁelds under the Baltic Sea and in Lithuania, and − in the future − from the North Sea. 161/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS brand and image 162/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS brand and image A strong brand is a valuable component of Grupa LOTOS’ assets, playing an important role in building our market advantage and enhancing our value to the Shareholders and other Stakeholders. We believe that strong brands, such as ours, are associated with a good oﬀering for customers, fair treatment of employees, and positive CSR performance. LOTOS is one of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the Polish market. In the 12th List of Poland’s Most Valuable Brands compiled and published in December 2015 by the Rzeczpospolita daily, the brand ranked 8th, having advanced by one position over the year. Since 2010, the value of LOTOS brand has more than doubled.

The system deﬁnes uniform standards and the permitted ways to use its elements. Consistent application of the established rules ensures that a coherent and desirable image of the LOTOS brand is disseminated. In 2015, the LOTOS Group commenced implementation of the e-VIS platform, a modern and innovative solution that has so far remained unmatched in Poland. Our priorities for the project were to ensure that all relevant data is collected in a centralized location, that it is always up to date, and that it is accessible online to the users. The key advantages of and beneﬁts oﬀered by e-VIS: The rules of use of the LOTOS brand are now available to all users of our visual identity system more easily and more quickly. Traditional paper copies of documents were replaced with their digital versions and their printing is no longer necessary, which reduces costs and makes us more eco-friendly. In a single application e-VIS combines the best practice of visual identity system with group work solutions. By properly using modern technologies we can now further develop the system and be prepared to perform new tasks in the future. 164/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group New look of the LOTOS service stations With a view to modernizing and harmonizing our image, in 2015 we gave the LOTOS service stations a new look. All of the LOTOS Optima economy stations and some of the premium locations underwent visual transformation. This involved primarily changes to the colour scheme and to the manner of presenting the LOTOS logotype. The applied solutions will reduce costs of constructing new and renovating the existing service stations. The standardization made it possible to extend the Cafe Punkt food and beverage oﬀering and adjust the stations to meet customer needs, which had a positive impact on sales. These measures were a part of the programme of operational optimization of our service station chain which we embarked upon in 2014. 165/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Image and advertising campaigns ‘Everything you need’ was the title of an image campaign conducted in 2015 and featuring the Polish national football team and racing driver Robert Kubica, with whom we also cooperated as part of our sports sponsorship activities. The campaign demonstrated how LOTOS supports travellers by oﬀering them numerous services and amenities available at our service stations. ‘Everything you need’ is not only a pledge we make to our customers, but also our business motto. See on our youtube channel 166/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Sponsorship activities We conduct our sponsorship activities in accordance with the sponsorship rules and directions adopted by the LOTOS Group, and in line with the Group’s corporate social responsibility strategy. Cooperation with beneﬁciaries is pursued primarily in Poland, in towns and provinces where the LOTOS Group companies are headquartered or trade. We provide sponsorship support to various initiatives and events, primarily in the area of sports, culture, and art.​ LOTOS as the major sponsor of the Polish national football team Drawing on our long-standing experience in sports sponsorship, in 2015 we made a decision, with a full sense of responsibility for what that entails, to become the Main Sponsor of the national football team. For us, it is a grand, ambitious and emotionally signiﬁcant undertaking, because we realize that our national team, its attitude and success engage all Polish people and positively reﬂect on the LOTOS brand. We are very proud that in June this year, the Polish football team achieved a historical result during the European Football Championship 2016, entering the top eight of the European teams. Grupa LOTOS signed a sponsorship contract with the Polish Football Association on at the National Stadium in Warsaw, on February 17th 2015. The contract will continue in force until December 31st 2018, with priority given to Grupa LOTOS after its expiry. As part of our cooperation with the Polish Football Association, we obtained the right to use the title of the Main Sponsor of the Polish National Football Team and to use the oﬃcial logotype of the Polish national football team in our marketing materials. The contract guarantees display of the LOTOS logotype on the team’ training kits. The LOTOS logo will also be displayed on advertising boards during the national team’s home matches. The Grupa LOTOS logotype will also appear in the central place of sponsorship boards during press conferences, on the Polish Football Association’s website, on tickets, and in football programmes.

All the business processes comprising the supply chain make up the core of our organization’s value chain. In accordance with the strategy for 2011–2015, in order to maximize our integrated margin, the LOTOS Group focused on the optimum use of its assets and on coordination of activities along the entire supply chain. Given the scale of our business, our network of relationships with suppliers and customers is a complex structure spanning various aspects, both at the operational level and, in the case of certain partners, the strategic level. When engaging in long-term business relationships, Grupa LOTOS pays attention to the market position and CSR record of its prospective partners. Many of our partners are international oil companies which have pioneered the industry’s commitment to corporate social responsibility and business ethics. As a vertically-integrated oil company, we take active steps to control the ﬂow of raw materials, products, information, and cash within the organization, from the moment a raw material is extracted, through production and distribution, to consumption of the ﬁnal product by its end user. Crude oil supply 10.9 In 2015, crude oil was the key feedstock in the LOTOS Group’s procurement mix. m REBCO (Russian Export Blend Crude Oil) accounted for 77% of the total tonnes crude procurement volume, while in 2014 it was 92.5%. The remainder of the oil procurement volume was made up of other varieties, including the amount of crude oil Kirkuk or Arab Light crudes. In addition, the LOTOS Group processed purchased by the LOTOS crude produced in Poland by LOTOS Petrobaltic and B8 sp. z o.o. Baltic Group in 2015, up 15% s.k.a, as well as crude produced in Lithuania by AB LOTOS Geonafta. Besides oil supplied by sea and by pipeline, the Grupa LOTOS reﬁnery also relative to 2014 processed oil produced by PGNiG, which was supplied by rail. 169/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our objective: to optimize and diversify the directions and sources of crude supply As the output from its own producing assets does not fully cover feedstock requirements, the LOTOS Group relies on crude oil purchased from external suppliers. Crude oil is supplied mainly from the Russian Federation via the network of pipelines operated by PERN (the Druzhba and Pomorski pipelines), by sea through the Naftoport oil terminal, and by rail. Possible causes of disruptions in crude oil supplies to the reﬁnery include: Technical failures, including technical failures of the pipeline system used to supply crude oil, terrorist acts, acts of sabotage, riots, revolutions, war, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, and other events of force majeure, Irregular crude oil deliveries leading to a temporary reduction in work-in-process inventory, which in turn is likely to aﬀect the reﬁnery’s throughput volumes. In response to the risk of supply disruptions, we consistently pursue our policy to diversify the directions and sources of crude oil supplies by focusing on the following aspects: ensuring security of supplies − through progressive expansion of our presence on the international oil markets, regular contracting of various crudes transported by sea, creating conditions to increase the share of such crudes in total supplies to the reﬁnery in case of any disruption of supplies from the main import market. expanding the share of own production in total feedstock volumes. improving competitive position − by fully capitalizing on the coastal location of the Gdańsk reﬁnery and the possibility of sourcing crude supplies through two independent channels: Russian oil through the Druzhba Pipeline and various types of crudes through the Naftoport oil terminal. regular use of crude oil transport by rail, with crude oil rail unloading facilities available at the reﬁnery. The appropriate selection of crude types and supply directions is a result of continuous eﬀorts to maximize the integrated margin. What else did we do? Following the launch of delivery by rail, in early 2015, of crude oil produced by Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo (PGNiG), the Gdańsk reﬁnery operated by Grupa LOTOS now processes crudes delivered using three modes of transport: 170/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group by pipeline, nearly by sea, by rail. 275 thousand tonnes The crude oil supplied by PGNiG comes from its production facilities in annually Lubiatów (estimated reserves of 7.25 million tonnes), Wierzbno and Barnówko. The crude is transported to Gdańsk by LOTOS Kolej from amount of crude to be PGNiG’s rail terminals in Barnówko and Wierzbno. delivered to the Gdańsk reﬁnery under a ﬁveyear contract with PGNiG 171/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Cooperation with suppliers In its relations with trading partners, Grupa LOTOS adheres to the principles of honest competition, openness to their expectations, and appreciation of people’s intellectual capital and competences. The LOTOS Group’s mission and system of values incorporate the principles of ethical, responsible and transparent business. By trading with due respect for the law and a sense of responsibility for the consequences of its actions, the LOTOS Group: Promotes attitudes based on a strong ethical culture and seeks to continuously improve of that culture, both internally and in relations with its external trading partners, Makes sure that employee rights are respected and that the employees are guaranteed safe and healthy working conditions, Seeks to reduce its adverse environmental impact through rational use of resources and use of environmentally friendly technological solutions, Remains objective and impartial in business relations, trying to avoid conﬂicts of interest and prevent malpractice. In 2015, our key suppliers whose supplies accounted for more than 10% of the Group’s total revenue were VITOL SA of Switzerland, Rosneft Oil Company of Russia, and Tatneft Europe AG of Switzerland. Their shares in Grupa LOTOS’ purchases were 26.00%, 18.33%, and 15.79%, respectively. Supplier selection and evaluation criteria In 2015, as in the previous years, the LOTOS Group sought to ensure that calls for oﬀer in every contractor selection process, and all contracts entered into with the existing or new suppliers, contained CSR clauses pertaining to: OHS, Rules and standards of conduct, Ethics, Conﬂicts of interests, Anti-bribery and corruption, Environmental protection, Respect for human rights, Social impacts (social integration measures). All LOTOS Group companies must obligatorily use these clauses in contracts with suppliers. Aware of the importance of working with a local supplier base, we strive to partner with companies which oﬀer the competencies we expect and meet our standards of cooperation. We seek to minimize the negative impact of fossil fuels in transport by sourcing 72% of the biocomponents (bioethanol and FAME) we use to produce our fuels from local suppliers.

Grupa LOTOS’ domestic spending includes purchases from related entities (e.g. LOTOS Petrobaltic, LOTOS Kolej, LOTOS Serwis, LOTOS Straż, LOTOS Ochrona, LOTOS Lab, etc.) It needs to be emphasized, though, that the products which are essential to the Group’s operations and represent the largest proportion of its procurement costs are not available in suﬃcient quantities in the local market understood as the whole of Poland (crude oil, petroleum products and specialist equipment), this being the reason for the low share of local spending in total spending. Our procurement practices The LOTOS Group companies (excluding LOTOS Petrobaltic) are not required to conduct their tenders in accordance with the provisions of the Public Procurement Act. Nevertheless, we have decided to internally impose a certain order in this respect and to internally regulate our procurement processes. We have put in place certain instructions, procedures and directives the purpose of which is to enhance the legal security and eﬃciency of our procurement processes. Furthermore, we have introduced standardized contract forms to facilitate and optimize the process of entering into and pursuing business relationships. In accordance with our internal procedure, each contract must contain corporate social responsibility clauses. The obligation to include such clauses in their contracts has also been imposed on other LOTOS Group companies by way of a relevant directive. Environment It is important to us to make every supplier of goods or services aware of our priorities with respect to minimizing the adverse impact of our business on the environment. As part of the Integrated Management System (IMS) we have implemented and certiﬁed, we have in place a formalized procedure (applied at every stage of the procurement process) to analyse energy eﬃciency of solutions we select for our new projects or upgrades and of goods we intend to purchase (e.g. white appliances, car leases). Our service providers are contractually obligated to ensure proper management of waste generated during the work they perform for us. This also applies to contractors and service providers in our key EFRA Project. 173/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Employee-related issues As part of its trading partner selection processes, Grupa LOTOS requires that all potential suppliers involved provide documents certifying that they pay the required social insurance contributions for their employees. In 2015, 100% of our trading partners met this requirement. Contracts signed by the LOTOS Group contain OHS clauses whereby employees are guaranteed appropriate working and resting conditions, clauses concerning rules and standards of conduct, ethics-related clauses, and clauses concerning respect for human rights. How we evaluate our suppliers Supplier audits provide us with information on the degree to which our suppliers meet the quality requirements, as well as occupational safety and environmental protection standards, which are high on our list of priorities. With these audits we can be sure that all work is conducted in a safe manner, and we are also able to identify areas where improvement is needed. We realize that satisfying our expectations may be a demanding task for suppliers, and therefore we provide them with detailed and accurate information on all audited areas. Supplier audits 30 28 28 20 18 18 15 15 14 14 10 0 2014 2015 28 At Grupa LOTOS At the other LOTOS Group companies 18 15 14 Plans for the future At Grupa LOTOS, we are currently embarking on an analysis of the organization’s indirect environmental impact; the analysis will also cover our suppliers. We hope that the methodology we develop and the analysis we will carry out will provide us with a useful insight into our suppliers’ environmental impacts. As a result of these eﬀorts, we should be able to more eﬀectively manage the environmental impact across our entire supply chain. In 2016, we intend to ask every new supplier to ﬁll out a survey containing questions on human rights, employment policies, and responsible business management. In this way we want to check whether our new contractors’ value systems and business conduct vision are consistent with the LOTOS Group’s vision and CSR principles. Rules of cooperation that are clear for all We make every eﬀort to ensure that the standards and rules of conduct we impose are comprehensible to the trading partners we work or want to work with. This is why we have published a catalogue of CSR clauses and other documents on our website for stakeholders. The published documents include a Declaration of Cooperation with Trading Partners, an electronic version of the Code of Ethics, the Catalogue of CSR Clauses, the Policy for Counteracting Malpractice, and the current Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy. Other materials published on the website include standard contract forms most frequently used by the LOTOS Group that suppliers may use in their business. 174/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Activities undertaken by the LOTOS Group as part of the eﬀorts to evaluate suppliers’ employment practices, respect for human rights, or impacts on local communities also include regular meetings with the trading partners. During such meetings we present our principles and standards; by exchanging experience we improve their knowledge on responsible business management, thus also contributing to the consolidation of good practice in the market. We want to work only with partners who make every eﬀort to ensure compliance with the law, and therefore we communicate our requirements to potential suppliers already at the stage of announcing a call for oﬀers. Good practice: Grupa LOTOS operates an electronic Procurement Platform. The platform is an innovative tool supporting the procurement process in its vital aspects where great precision and the necessity to document taken steps are needed. With the Procurement Platform we are able to shorten the time needed to announce calls for oﬀers and reduce costs of tenders. The system also helps considerably speed up the preparation of various types of reports. 175/263 LOTOS Group Integrated Annual Report 2015 05 176/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Eﬃcient and stable organization The LOTOS Group is one of the largest enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe. We are also a leading employer in the Gdańsk Province, which allows numerous residents of the region and their families to earn a good living. We conduct our business with a great sense of responsibility, having in mind also the need to create value for other stakeholders of the organization. Responsible recruitment + professional development of employees + high security standards = competitive advantage The employees are the most important capital of the LOTOS Group. Qualiﬁed staﬀ are a source of competitive advantage on the market. Because of that, as a modern and dynamically growing business, we take proper care to ensure continuous professional development of employees. One of our priorities is the safety and health of our employees and those employed by our subcontractors who work for the LOTOS Group. Our key initiatives and achievements in building an eﬃcient and stable organization in 2015: In response to the market challenges (oil price movements, risk of growing competition from outside Europe, and expected decline in fuel consumption), in 2015 we introduced a new organizational structure to the LOTOS Group. It was the most extensive change in the structure of our organization in many years. By the end of 2015, the LOTOS Group had achieved all its organizational security targets set for 2012-2015. We developed a ‘Strategy for LOTOS as Employer Brand’, together with an ‘Operational Plan’ and a set of eﬃciency measures. Our activities in this area are to help us ﬁnd, hire and retain competent employees who will support us in the delivery of the LOTOS business strategy. The strategy is centered on the creation of an engaging and friendly workplace based on communication, positive relations and values. 177/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group How do we create value for investors, employees and other stakeholders?

We value open communication, teamwork, and partnership between the management and employees. In the area of safety, we attach particular importance to maintaining high safety standards, minimizing potential risks, and promoting a safe working culture. What we gain through such approach: 178/263 At the LOTOS Group, we combine eﬀorts to improve employees’ knowledge, skills and competences with eﬀorts to create a friendly and stable workplace. We value open communication, teamwork, and partnership Integrated Annual Report between theGroup 2015 LOTOS management and employees. In the area of safety, we attach particular importance to maintaining high safety standards, minimizing potential risks, and promoting a safe working culture. What we gain through such approach: Those activities have helped Grupa LOTOS to earn the reputation of an employer oﬀering a safe, well-appointed, and well-organized workplace, with career development opportunities. As an attractive employer, we are able to retain valuable specialists and hire best professionals both in Poland and on foreign markets. Thus the organization’s staﬀ stability is guaranteed, which in turn ensures business stability and reduces operating expenses. It is also beneﬁcial to our trading partners who, in their dealings with LOTOS, work with the best experts in their respective ﬁelds. 179/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Employees – human capital 180/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our specialists make us more competitive and innovative LOTOS Group employees in 2015 The strategic objective of our HR policy is to ensure optimum employment adjusted to the LOTOS Group’s business objectives. We believe that having highly-qualiﬁed, motivated, and committed employees improves productivity and is a source of our organization’s competitive advantage. LOTOS Group’s HR policy is based on internal procedures governing various aspects of the recruitment and employee management processes: Our standards of conduct at work and in business relationships are described in the LOTOS Group’s Code of Ethics. In our relations with employees and other stakeholders we are also guided by the ten corporate responsibility principles of the United Nations Global Compact, which cover the areas of human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption. Our priority is to build a sense of trust between the management and the rest of the employees, and to treat fairly everyone regardless of their position, length of service, trade union membership, physical appearance, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, or political views. Additional tools which support building good relations between the employees and the management are the Collective Bargaining Agreement and internal procedures which standardize the HR management processes. 181/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, we provide all our employees – regardless of the form of employment and length of service – with the same social beneﬁt package (the package is also guaranteed under the Rules of Participation in the Company Social Beneﬁts Fund). In 2015, 98% of the LOTOS Group’s employees were covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement. In case of redundancies resulting from operational changes at the LOTOS Group the minimum notice period is 30 days. This period is not speciﬁed in the Collective Bargaining Agreements; it is prescribed in the labour law. In the case of women employed at the LOTOS Group, the ratio of the lowest pay at the lowest pay to statutory minimum pay in Poland in 2015 was 1.14 . In the case of men, it was slightly above 1 . How do we create organizational culture which improves productivity? We undertake initiatives aimed at building the desired corporate culture, which include cooperation with the Ethics Oﬃcer as part of the Ethical Conduct Programme. We promote ethical values which are in line with the Code of Ethics; we also conduct communication activities aimed at improving the awareness of employees and management. Examples include e-learning training on how to avoid conﬂicts of interest in the workplace. We use annual employee evaluation for open communication between managers and employees, and for joint setting and evaluating of professional and development objectives. We build an employee engagement culture and improvement activities by conducting surveys of employee satisfaction. They provide an insight into our employees’ attitudes and help us monitor employee satisfaction, engagement, and opinions. We try to use the information to create a friendly environment at the organization and to achieve business objectives. We maintain good relations and we cooperate with trade unions and Employee Councils. Number of employees In 2015, the LOTOS Group employed 4,850 people, which puts us among the largest employers in the Gdańsk Province.

In our case, the competencies include cooperation, commitment, and openness to change. We believe that all our employees should have them, regardless of their role or position. What do key competencies mean to us? Cooperation: Relationship building, e.g. through respect for others, kindness, support, and positive attitude towards cooperation, Teamwork, Good manners. Commitment: Initiative, Focusing on goals and tasks, Improving the way the organization operates, e.g. through reporting diﬃculties and searching for solutions, suggesting improvements, improving one’s productivity and the productivity in one’s area of responsibility, Identifying with the organization, e.g. acting in line with its values and promoting its image, Complying with the rules, procedures, and standards. Openness to change: Accepting and showing positive attitude towards change, Showing interest in new solutions, Adapting to changes, Signalling the need for changes within one’s area of responsibility and actively participating in change implementation. 186/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group The key competencies of LOTOS Group employees are assessed during periodic employee evaluations. The management staﬀ is additionally evaluated for their managerial skills in such areas as teamwork management, leadership, team potential building, strategic thinking, and decision making. Non-management staﬀ are evaluated for their functional competencies required by a given position, e.g. work discipline, resistance to stress, negotiation skills, and project work. Successors to take over In 2015, the LOTOS Group continued its Succession Programme. As part of the programme, we coordinated the process of selecting the forms and methods of successors’ development in line with the awarded development vouchers. We also monitored and updated their individual development plans. The following were most often chosen by the successors covered by the programme: the Management programme run by the ICAN Institute, in partnership with the Harvard Business Review, language seminars, individual coaching, and post-graduate programmes. Also popular were specialist courses (e.g. HR Business Partner Academy, Gas and Renewable Energy Technologies, Summer Leader School, Art of Negotiation, Interpersonal Training, Assertiveness and Communication, Logistics Forum and Project Management) and foreign training courses and conferences (such as the Water Technology Conference, Price Risk Management in the Oil Industry, or Advanced Project Management for Oil & Gas Industry). Eﬀects of the Succession Programme within three years from selecting the programme participants, six out of the twenty successors took up senior managerial positions at the LOTOS Group. 187/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group At LOTOS, we develop together The training and development policy of the LOTOS Group is focused on creating the best conditions for professional development of its employees, which involves learning and updating knowledge necessary to eﬃciently perform the current and future tasks. Objectives of our training policy: Increase the company value through a continuous drive towards excellence and leveraging the potential of our employees; Secure resources necessary to perform the key tasks deﬁned in our strategy; Focus on the current and future requirements for individual positions; Seek organizational excellence through productivity improvements and knowledge sharing; Identify and analyse training needs, plan new training and assess its eﬀectiveness;• Improve the tools used in the training management process. Features of the LOTOS Group’s training policy: Availability – training is intended for all employee groups; Cohesion – the training system takes into account the mission and strategy of the LOTOS Group; Responsibility – all participants are responsible for training results and development; Continuity – training course planning takes into account results of the Periodic Employee Evaluation System (PEES), career paths, succession plans, and development programmes for particular employee groups; • Flexibility – training courses are planned and organized to respond to the evolving external conditions and changes in employees’ qualiﬁcations. 188/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group The way to achieve the goal: how do we motivate and develop our staﬀ? The LOTOS Group has in place a standardized Periodic Employee Evaluation System (PEES) to ensure objectivity and comparability of employee evaluation results. In 2015, PEES reviews covered 97% of qualifying employees of the LOTOS Group. Among the reviewed employees, there was 21% of women and 76% of men. The lower proportion of women reﬂects the employment structure at the LOTOS Group: most of our employees are men. The evaluated women amounted to close to 29% of eligible employees, and the share of men was 67% . Other advantages of PEES: Meetings between managers and employees are an opportunity to receive feedback on employees’ competencies and achievement of professional and development goals. The data thus collected helps the managers to better plan future steps (such as division of tasks or deﬁnition of employee development paths) and to motivate staﬀ to pursue their professional goals. 89.4% 6.1% percentage of LOTOS percentage of employees Group employees meeting whose qualiﬁcations all requirements for their exceed the requirements respective positions in for their positions in 2015* 2015* * Source: PEES, 2015 Results of periodic employee evaluation are also a valuable source of information for the HR department.

OSH-related initiatives are central to our CSR strategy. In order to achieve the OSH objectives, not only do we abide by the generally applicable regulations, but we also implement our own standards of conduct. At the LOTOS Group we believe in consistent and continued building of awareness of the importance of occupational safety across the organization. Therefore, we make sure that each employee − irrespective of their position − understands that they are responsible for their own safety as well as the safety of their environment. We stress the importance of situational awareness, knowledge of risks and relevant mitigation measures, compliance with procedures, appropriate use of protection systems and measures, and timely reporting of any observations and conclusions related to hazardous situations. We achieve our OSH objectives through: Eﬀective internal communication; Gaining and promoting knowledge about potential hazards; Sharing experience with our partners; Programmes and initiatives, special reviews and audits in the OHS area. 192/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Personnel safety management at the LOTOS Group Every year, goals and targets are set for the LOTOS Group companies aimed at improving safety at work, adopting uniform standards across the LOTOS Group, and sharing expertise and experience between the OSH specialists. The key objective of our OSH policy is to raise the awareness and degree of involvement in improving safety among the management and employees of all ranks, as well as contractors. Good measures of our achievements in this area are: Absence of fatalities; Lost Time Injury Frequency LTIF – number of occurrences resulting in inability to work x 106/number of manhours worked; Number of implemented projects to improve safety at work and protect health; and Number of information and education campaigns promoting workplace safety. Operational objectives with regard to safety, deﬁned in the LOTOS Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy for 2012−2015: Implement projects improving safety at work and health protection; Increase employees’ ability to inﬂuence the safety and ergonomics of their working environment; Reduce the accident rate; Build a safety-at-work culture at the LOTOS Group, based on the management’s increased involvement in promoting proper attitudes. By the end of 2015, the LOTOS Group had achieved all its safety targets set for 2012-2015. 193/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Plans for the We have taken steps to build a process safety management system which combines the engineering practice with the best management techniques. Its purpose is to future: prevent any process incidents, in particular those resulting in leakage of dangerous substances to the environment. In an organization such as the LOTOS Group, the appropriate process safety management is a standard and a necessity, both in the upstream segment and at the reﬁnery. Working conditions under control At the LOTOS Group, we have in place an integrated quality, environment and occupational safety management system. Our Integrated Management System policy addresses issues related to fostering an occupational safety culture through clear leadership, responsibility and engagement of all employees, preventing accidents at work, occupational diseases and hazards. There are a number of internal procedures in this respect applicable within the organization. Using modern technologies also adds to improved safety. To protect humans and the environment from an accidental release of energy from machinery and production units, we have implemented the Lockout-Tagout system, also called the LOTO system, for hazardous power lockout and labelling. The system is used during maintenance shutdowns, maintenance works and capex projects and to prevent an accidental start-up of machinery by unauthorized persons. In 2015, the Lockout-Tagout system was implemented at all the production plants of the LOTOS Group reﬁnery in Gdańsk. In our opinion, the occupational safety and health is strictly correlated with respect for human rights. In 2015, as part of quarterly trainings, 81% of the 136 employees of LOTOS Ochrona attended a lecture devoted to human rights. They also participated in classes devoted to intervention techniques and use of physical force. What else do we We run regular educational programmes focusing on: stress management, healthy eating habits, quitting smoking, safety when handling heavy objects, physical do? exercise and activity, oﬃce ergonomics, organization of work at the workstation, safe use of chemicals, and noise protection. Taking care of our employees’ health, we provide them with a wide range of medical services. Cooperation obliges At the LOTOS Group, we attach great importance to maintaining a high level of occupational safety also at our cooperating partners. An example of initiatives we have undertaken in this respect is the ‘LOTOS Serwis Declaration of Safety’, prepared by LOTOS Serwis for investment and upgrade projects, ad-hoc repairs and plant engineering in the mechanical, electrical, and automatics sectors. By reading this document, prospective business partners may familiarize themselves with a system developed at the company to ensure occupational safety and health while work is performed. 194/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Best OSH practices In 2015, LOTOS Asfalt organized three training sessions to educate its clients about safe work with bitumen products and to encourage them to observe the safety rules promoted by LOTOS Asfalt in their everyday work. The training session at the company’s head oﬃce in Gdańsk (combined with the possibility of visiting the reﬁnery) was attended by about 30 people. LOTOS Asfalt was represented by members of its distribution, sales and OHS teams. The company also continued a best practice project with its clients (originally launched in 2014), consisting in displaying information boards at bitumen mastic production plants. In total, 80 information boards were put up in 2014–2015. The OSH staﬀ hold regular meetings as part of Programme for Work Safety System Standardization at the LOTOS Group, which serves as an opportunity for experience sharing and discussing plans for the future. The key issues addressed in 2015 include: the new CSR strategy regarding improvement in health and safety, application of the ‘Golden Rules for Occupational Safety to be Followed by the LOTOS Group Employees’, new indicators for measuring safety at work across the organization, and further development of the electronic OSH Portal. OSH trainings and drills − in our actions, we place emphasis on education, employee engagement and stimulating the involvement of our management, who are responsible for ensuring safe working conditions to all employees and for encouraging their commitment to building a safe work culture. The Grupa LOTOS reﬁnery, as an upper tier establishment in terms of risk, is obliged to implement a process safety management system. Therefore, in December 2015, a two-day training devoted to explosion prevention was organized at the Company, attended by, among others, OSH staﬀ, engineers and oﬃces whose daily operations involve the implementation of safety systems. They learnt about explosion prevention techniques, appropriate labelling and operation of electrical and non-electrical apparatuses in explosive atmospheres. In 2015, the Grupa LOTOS Health & Safety Oﬃce was engaged in the preparation of periodic OSH e–learning trainings for employees holding managerial positions, engineers, technicians, as well as administration and oﬃce staﬀ members. Following the completion of the theoretical part of the training, its participants are required to take a test and, having passed it, they have a practical training related to giving ﬁrst aid and ﬁre safety. In 2015, the Grupa LOTOS Health & Safety Oﬃce, in partnership with Robod, organized workshops focusing on personal protective equipment and (appropriate selection of) protective clothing. Every three months, the employees of LOTOS Lab undergo training on correct responding to failures and ﬁres. They need to be familiar with evacuation routes and know what to do in emergency situations. On January 1st 2015, as part of modifying the structure of LOTOS Serwis, 79 specialists that had worked as technical coordinators were oﬃcially nominated as foremen, who represent the company vis-a-vis customers and partners. This change is to streamline work organization and improve occupational safety and health. Before commencing work, the foremen must assess work safety risk, brief the crew on their ﬁndings and optimally divide tasks among them. The psychological aspect is also important − creating the position of a foreman in an organization’s structure helps build the authority of a leader managing the team’s day-to-day work. To facilitate communication between the company and its employees, LOTOS Serwis has put in place ‘Hazardous Situation Reporting Logs’ with self-copy paper sheets allowing the employee to keep a proof of report. Each such report is analysed and the reporting party is sure to receive feedback on any actions taken. 195/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Employees of LOTOS Straż received new specialist uniforms, which, in view of the safety they oﬀer, their unique qualities and special way in which they are made, are used in all operations in which the rescue and ﬁre-ﬁghting unit is involved. What else do we do to improve safety? The LOTOS Group key project which we strive to carry out with zero accidents at work is the EFRA project. Therefore, the preparation and implementation of relevant safety procedures during the project execution are high on our agenda. Our OSH-related achievements under the EFRA Project so far: We have agreed on the key safety rules to be followed by us and all the contractors working on our premises. The rules have been compiled and are available at the www.kontrahenci.lotos.pl portal. We have launched a HSE Portal for a system-based approach to managing issues related to safety and health at work. It is an innovative IT tool which will support our safety management eﬀorts. We have prepared an OSH newsletter. We provide the key information on safety at the sites where new production units are being constructed. We issue opinions on Occupational Health and Safety plans and instructions for safety at work. We are working on the implementation of an incentive programme for employees involved in promoting safety issues. Other safety measures we take as part of the EFRA Project: Each contractor is obligated to organize weekly meetings devoted solely to OSH issues, and to perform weekly inspections at a given construction site, attended by its site manager. Before employees enter the construction site, they undergo a special induction training (lasting at least four hours) into the EFRA Project. Additionally, each day before starting their shift, they are briefed on the most vital matters pertaining to safety at work. Other examples of best practices: To improve the safety of employees of and visitors to the LOTOS Group, deﬁbrillators have been installed at the head oﬃces of selected companies. Some of the companies where these additional rescue tools are available include LOTOS Lab, LOTOS Ochrona and LOTOS Kolej. Employees of those companies were trained to use deﬁbrillators. Caring for our employees’ health, each year at Grupa LOTOS we organize the Occupational Health and Safety Day. Each staﬀ member can undergo medical check-ups, join workshops to enhance their knowledge and skills in health protection, and take part in OSH and health protection related contests. 196/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group At Grupa LOTOS, there is an Occupational Safety and Health Committee (OSH Committee), serving as an advisory and consultative body to the employer. The Committee is composed of employer representatives, an occupational physician and workforce representatives selected by trade unions active at the Company. It reviews working conditions, evaluates the status of occupational safety and advises on measures to be taken by the employer to prevent accidents at work and occupational diseases. 197/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Results – number of accidents In 2015, no fatal, severe or group accidents were reported at the LOTOS Group. The recorded minor injuries were mostly related to moving on foot. We have already taken actions to minimize their number in the future, by, for instance, implementing technical solutions to improve safety. 2015 Women Men Total workplace accidents 5 28 Fatalities 0 0 Severe injuries 0 0 Minor injuries 5 28 Total accident victims 33 WLTIF incidence rate (per 1 million hours worked)1) 3.4 LDR incidence rate (per 200 thousand hours worked)2) 0.7 1) LTIF rate — number of occurrences resulting in inability to work x106/number of manhours worked. 2) LDR rate — number of occurrences resulting in inability to work x2*105/number of manhours.

Heads of the organizational units where the accidents had occurred discussed them in detail with all the subordinates In places where it was feasible and justiﬁed, technical solutions were implemented to improve safety, for example, the condensate drainage 12 system over which the employee tripped and sustained injury, was Moving on foot revamped; stairs in selected buildings were covered with anti-slip paint; employees working in the vicinity of railway tracks can only wear sturdy boots with ankle support The cleaning staﬀ were trained on how to properly mark slippery ﬂoors Cutting machine tools were checked for swarf removal equipment All the Group company employees were informed, in monthly reports, about the circumstances of the accidents The choice/eﬃciency of personal protective equipment was analysed in Use of machinery and terms of preventing the risk of capture at the equipment operator equipment 7 workplace at the Railcars Loading Complex 198/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Uniform guidelines for the entire production area were developed, concerning: methods of work and procedures for all operations involving the use of rubber hoses (steaming, drainage, blowdown, rinsing, cleaning) as well as places for and manner of rubber hose storage All the Group company employees were informed, in monthly reports, about the circumstances of the accidents Heads of the organizational units where the accidents had occurred discussed them in detail with all the subordinates Driving, using means of 5 Employees responsible for vehicle ﬂeet management attended an transport additional safe driving course to learn more about the rules and factors for safe driving, as well as identifying, predicting and avoiding dangerous situations Metal cases were checked for the ﬁrmness of their sides All the Group company employees were informed, in monthly reports, about the circumstances of the accidents Handling, storage, 4 transportation work An OSH manual for engine oil low-tonnage loading was updated Incidence rate (total accident victims/headcount x 1,000) 2015 Women Men Total 4.6 7.7 7.0 Severity rate (days lost/number of accidents) 2015 Women Men Total 53.6 46.2 47.4 Reported cases of occupational disease (ODR, calculated as * 200,000) 199/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group 2015 Women Men Total 0 0.064 0.049 200/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group We are an attractive employer 201/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group We are building a strong employer brand Recruitment and employment processes at the LOTOS Group are carried out in a responsible and fair manner, with due respect for the applicants. We care for a good atmosphere during job interviews and provide feedback. We guarantee conﬁdentiality and information security to all candidates applying for a job at our organization. In 2015, we commenced work on a new strategy of building employer brand. The eﬀect is a ‘Strategy for LOTOS as Employer Brand’, together with an ‘Operational Plan’ and a set of eﬃciency measures. Strategic objectives behind the LOTOS employer brand: Ensure availability of highly qualiﬁed resources required to successfully implement the business strategy; Create an engaging workplace based on communication, positive relations and values. The steps taken to develop a strategy for LOTOS as an employer brand came in response to the following needs: Ensure continuity in the implementation of business goals, where employees and their expertise are the most valuable assets; Recruit best talent on the Polish market, which requires communication of the LOTOS employee brand to a wider audience; Thanks to the actions taken, LOTOS intends to build an employer brand with the following features: Nationwide reach What are the beneﬁts? Broader range of competent candidates to acquire. Well-deﬁned What are the beneﬁts? identity We will establish a lasting relationship with the brand’s target group. Transparent What are the beneﬁts? communication More suitable candidates will be recruited. of job oﬀers 202/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group High engagement What are the beneﬁts? potential Lower risk of employee turnover in case of strong competition on the local labour market. Clear referral What are the beneﬁts? rules It will be easier to reach valuable candidates. Employees will become active ambassadors of the LOTOS brand outside the organization. The employer brand is important to all: We engaged our employees in eﬀorts to develop the employer branding strategy for LOTOS. We invited employees from all segments of the LOTOS Group’s operations to workshops, in which we learnt, among other things, which positive features are common for all areas of our activity and what are the distinctive qualities that represent the unique strength of LOTOS. In the case of women employed at the LOTOS Group, the ratio of the lowest pay at the lowest pay to statutory minimum pay in Poland in 2015 was 1.14. In the case of men, it was slightly above 1. Our eﬀorts to build employer brand We seek to create the image of an attractive and reliable employer through: Pursuing the adopted HR policy and implementing the improvement action plan following an employee opinion survey; Creating an engaging workplace and communicating with our employees through the LOTOSFERA monthly magazine and the LOTOSTRADA website; Actively communicating our values and the beneﬁts we oﬀer to potential job candidates, using various communication channels, e.g. a website (www.kariera.lotos.pl), advertising on recruitment websites Pracuj.pl and LinkedIn., running a Facebook fanpage ‘Start with LOTOS’, participating in job fairs, appointing the LOTOS ambassador from among students to promote our corporate values and liaise with the student community. More information Cooperation with schools and universities, student organizations, research clubs and circles, and central and local government authorities, aimed to promote vocational training, support education and create jobs. 203/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group What else did we do? The LOTOS Group has provided opportunities for both horizontal and vertical promotions and has ensured transfer of knowledge and skills between its companies. Moving an employee to another department, company or position creates a chance for continuous professional advancement and learning new skills. In terms of internal recruitment, the EFRA Project is a key initiative. We have developed a dedicated EFRA Staﬀ Programme to select, recruit, train, prepare and retain properly qualiﬁed employees to complete the objectives of the EFRA (Eﬀective Reﬁning) operational excellence project, implemented as part of Grupa LOTOS’s wider Eﬃciency and Growth programme. Implementation of the EFRA Staﬀ Programme has been planned for the years 2014–2019. The Programme is based on reallocation of approximately 40 employees and provides for the additional employment from outside. 204/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Recruiting qualiﬁed staﬀ At the LOTOS Group, we believe that education is an asset worth investing in, and that by doing so we not only support our local communities, but also improve our chances for sourcing talented staﬀ willing to develop together with us. In 2015, as part of eﬀorts to standardize and raise recruitment standards at the LOTOS Group, we implemented ‘Standards of the Recruitment and Selection Process at the LOTOS Group − Guidelines for Managers Requesting Staﬀ Recruitment’ and ‘Standards of the Recruitment and Selection Process at the LOTOS Group − Guidelines for Recruitment Specialists’. Certiﬁed recruitment practices Having audited our recruitment practices, the Polish Human Resources Management Association awarded us the Top-Quality Human Resources Certiﬁcate, thus acknowledging the top quality standards of our human resources management processes. Grupa LOTOS is a member of the Coalition for Friendly Recruitment, established in 2013. The Code of Good Recruitment Practices developed by the organization is used as guidance for our HR oﬃcers on the principles that should be applied in recruitment processes across the LOTOS Group, and its application in practice has been conﬁrmed by the ‘Friendly Recruitment Zone’ certiﬁcate awarded to Grupa LOTOS. It earned us reputation of a reliable and highly valued employer propagating the principles of corporate social responsibility. Education − a proﬁtable investment We engage in promoting education, with special emphasis on engineering and technical disciplines, by supporting vocational schools, including through our active participation in the Gdańsk Professionals’ Week. In recognition of outstanding achievements in the promotion and sponsorship of vocational education and successful cooperation in the ﬁeld of education to the beneﬁt of the local labour market, Grupa LOTOS was awarded the ‘Gdańsk Vocational School-Friendly Employer’ title, and LOTOS Serwis received a distinction. We oﬀer a range of internships and traineeships and, as far as possible, we provide access to data that may be useful in writing university dissertations. 205/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group 234 Grupa LOTOS employees share their knowledge with students and teachers during workshops and classes they give at schools (e.g. LOTOS Serwis’s activity at the Communications School Complex in Gdańsk, or LOTOS Kolej’s at Technical Secondary School No. 3 of the K. Kałużewski and J. Sylla School Complex in Zduńska Wola). We have appointed a number of internships LOTOS ambassador for students, who helps them access educational and industry-related information and liaises with the Company as an and traineeships employer through a Facebook fanpage ‘Start with LOTOS’. organized by Grupa LOTOS in 2015 In line with our business proﬁle, we focus on partnerships with technical schools such as Gdańsk University of Technology, the AGH University of Science and Technology, Cracow University of Economics, and Faculty of Chemistry of the University of Gdańsk. We have engaged in cooperation with the largest global student organization AIESEC and the international organization of technology students BEST, under which we organized meetings with experts who shared with students practical knowledge on their ﬁeld of study; also, we promoted jobs and internships at LOTOS. We also work with HR organizations, sharing our expertise and teaching HR standards, for example we cooperated with the Polish Human Resources Management Association by organizing and administering a HR Executive Meeting at LOTOS to discuss cooperation with universities and schools. What else did we do in 2015? It was for the thirteenth time that the LOTOS Group joined ‘Summer Internship’, a local project initiated by the Mayor of Gdańsk to support students and graduates in acquiring new skills and ﬁnding their place on the labour market. In 2015, Grupa LOTOS, LOTOS Kolej and LOTOS Petrobaltic ﬁnanced 16 internship placements. We became one of Internship Founders as part of the ‘We Build the Value of the Polish Economy. Work for Us’ contest organized by the Ministry of State Treasury and we oﬀered students ﬁve internship placements with our organization. The key objective of the internships was to help the contest winners gain experience and enable them to use their knowledge and skills in practice. We were a partner to the ‘Go4Poland. Wybierz Polskę’ internship programme of the Warsaw Stock Exchange Foundation. We organized meetings of our practising specialists with students representing numerous associations, including the Brevi Manu Student Scientiﬁc Association of Organization and Management Psychology, Scientiﬁc Association of Chemistry Students of the Gdańsk University of Technology, Euro-Initiative Student Scientiﬁc Association and Scientiﬁc Association of Electrical Engineering Students of the Gdańsk University of Technology. LOTOS Serwis has under its auspices the industrial automatics class at the Communication School Complex of Gdańsk. Its lecturers include heads of the I&C Maintenance and Repairs Departments. We continued cooperation with Vocational and Lifelong Learning Centre No. 2 in Gdańsk, the agreement on which has been renewed every three years since 2009. So far, 58 students completed their traineeships at Grupa LOTOS, and more than 30 best ones were awarded grants. 206/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group LOTOS for kids It was the third time we became the patron of the E(x)plory programme supporting young scientists. Its 2015 winners represent Poland in international scientiﬁc competitions in the US, the Netherlands, Romania and France. In 2015, we also continued the ‘Talent with LOTOS’ project, including the ‘Pomeranian Talent’ programme implemented jointly with the Teacher Education Centre in Gdańsk, and ‘Jasło Science League with LOTOS’ run with the town of Jasło. For more information on the ‘Talent with LOTOS’ project, visit: ‘Talent with LOTOS’ website 207/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Efficient organization management 208/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Robust structure It is our strong opinion that strategic business objectives cannot be met without eﬃcient organization, assessment of risks inherent in the business, and productive processes supported by eﬀective management systems. New organizational structure of the LOTOS Group In response to the market challenges (oil price movements, risk of growing competition from outside Europe, and expected decline in fuel consumption), in 2015 we introduced a new organizational structure to the LOTOS Group. It was the most extensive change in the structure of our organization in many years. The new organizational structure will help implement our business strategy. Thanks to its new organizational structure the LOTOS Group will: Improve the eﬃciency and ﬂexibility of its operations by, among other things, accelerating the decision-making processes and simplifying procedures; Integrate the most important areas of its operations; Reduce operating costs, for instance by identifying the areas with overlapping responsibilities and scopes of activity; In the long term − achieve synergies as a result of greater integration and improved coordination of activities in the operational, management and support areas. What else will we do? As part of the organizational changes, we will review the scope of activity of individual divisions and organizational units at the LOTOS Group companies. In this way we intend to optimize processes and interactions between Grupa LOTOS and its subsidiaries, and centralize certain functions. As a result, best practices will be transferred between LOTOS Group companies and uniform corporate standards will be introduced without building additional capabilities at each company. 209/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Diversity Nearly every ﬁfth person employed at the LOTOS Group is a member of the management staﬀ.

Key changes in the process management systems and structures that had a bearing on the LOTOS Group’s performance in 2015 In 2015, we worked to ﬁnd innovative solutions for the processes and systems supporting the LOTOS Group’s operations. Our activities in that area included performing analyses and holding benchmark meetings to discuss deployment of selected management models and process tools. Additionally, we engaged in the following process management activities: We upgraded our web application supporting process monitoring so that it can be more eﬀectively used, for instance in reviews of the Integrated Management System, or as a tool facilitating process management at other LOTOS Group companies. 212/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group We continued regular meetings with heads of organizational units and the LOTOS Group companies to discuss selected regulations and processes. We implemented an optimum model for the Company, based on a matrix structure with Grupa LOTOS divided into functional areas, which is consistent with the Grupa LOTOS process map. We implemented an Integrated Management System web application to facilitate circulation of documents at the LOTOS Group companies, and an electronic system for circulation of corrective action instructions (using the SharePoint platform). We began work to optimize the reporting system. Energy Management System (EnMS) We performed energy consumption reviews at production plants based on Grupa LOTOS’ internal regulations. We continued activities towards meeting the assumed environmental and energy goals. We monitored progress of the legislation process related to amendments to the Energy Eﬃciency Act and its potential eﬀect on the environment and energy management system at Grupa LOTOS. Planned activities in relation to the Integrated Management System: Adjust the existing systems to amended international standards, including ISO 9001 and ISO 14001; Adjust the energy management system to the new requirements of the Energy Eﬃciency Act; Make an explicit allocation of duties to units responsible for corporate tasks within the LOTOS Group structure – development and implementation of a new internal cooperation model (going beyond reporting); Foster the image of an organization with management culture that meets global standards by knowledge sharing (at industry meetings); Monitor key management indicators – determine and select unique and innovative indicators, based on which relevant measures will be taken to ensure improved performance. Audits at the LOTOS Group over Audits of the LOTOS Group’s Integrated Management System provide valuable and objective feedback on the operation of individual areas of the organization. 500 number of audits performed at the LOTOS Group in 2014–2015 213/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Audits carried out at LOTOS Group 250 195 195 199 199 200 150 100 71 71 55 55 50 0 2014 195 2015 199 At Grupa LOTOS At the other LOTOS Group companies More information on the management system 71 55 VPN solution improving safety and supporting communication with LOTOS Petrobaltic’s platforms To improve safety on the platforms operated by LOTOS Petrobaltic in the Baltic Sea and to facilitate communication, the company – in cooperation with Orange Polska – created an IP VPN network with a capacity of 10 Mbps. The key objectives of this project were to implement security standards for the network, servers and workstations, and to ensure continuity of operation by using redundant radio and satellite links. The project standardized the applied solutions and made it possible to use the systems and applications on platforms online, just like at Grupa LOTOS’ oﬃces. Importantly, the new network allows employees on platforms to keep in contact with their families and friends on land. 214/263 LOTOS Group Integrated Annual Report 2015 06 Our social impact 215/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our social impact We are responsible for our impact on the environment and for the way we build our relations with key community groups in that environment. With a CSR strategy in place, from 2012 we consistently monitored progress towards our key objective in the area of integration with the local environment set for the period until 2015, namely ensuring favourable attitudes among local communities and strengthening the Company’s image as a business committed to CSR practices involving a wide range of programmes, long-term initiatives, social dialogue, and research designed to eliminate and provide lasting solutions to locally relevant social and environmental problems. In the process of strategy development and implementation, local environment was deﬁned as the areas located in the vicinity of the LOTOS Group’s production plants, including the local communities, employees, customers and the natural environment within those areas. Although many of our projects extended beyond the local sphere, the local eﬀect was an important factor during the assessment and selection of new CSR projects completed in the last few years. Our social impact is not limited to creating jobs and the environmental footprint of our operations, but it also involves programmes, initiatives, public consultations and activities undertaken to address the expectations of speciﬁc target beneﬁciary groups of the newly established LOTOS Foundation. We strive to manage each of those areas eﬀectively. That is why, as in the previous years, in early 2016 we carried out an assessment of the impact of our CSR activities, as well as of the awareness of and attitudes towards our activities intended to limit our environmental impacts in the immediate neighbourhood, being the key target of our initiatives, as well in the wider group of inhabitants of the Gdańsk Province and the Bielsko-Biała and Jasło Counties, who beneﬁt from our broader social and environmental projects. Our key social activities in 2015: We completed major multi-aspect social projects in each of our commitment areas – road traﬃc safety (‘LOTOS Safety Belt Champions’), environmental protection and education (‘Headed for the Baltic’), and ensuring equal opportunities (‘Talent with LOTOS’, ‘E(x)plory’); We also furthered cross-sectoral cooperation. Apart from participating in working groups appointed to develop strategies for the Gdańsk Province and the metropolitan area concept, we continued our involvement with the Development Initiation Forum, and we held meetings with representatives of local governments, SMEs and NGOs as part of workshop and networking groups organized under the Forum; We provided funds to support cross-sectoral partnership programmes in the Gdańsk Province; We provided further support to entities in the social economy sector. In 2015, social enterprises, which are often beneﬁciaries of our grants, completed ﬁve interesting social initiatives undertaken in response to the identiﬁed needs of local communities. In 2015, we established the LOTOS Foundation. Its overriding objective is to support initiatives to develop infrastructure and make a positive diﬀerence for local communities, particularly in regions where companies of the LOTOS Group operate. In 2015, the Foundation’s charitable donations totalled PLN 762 thousand, of which nearly PLN 320 thousand was spent on charity and support to non-governmental organizations operating in the closest neighbourhood of Grupa LOTOS. 216/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group We successfully completed the ﬁrst edition of the ‘Helping while Refuelling’ campaign as the Foundation’s ﬁrst major project. It was the ﬁrst-ever cause-related marketing project in the fuel industry in Poland run on such a large scale. The campaign proceeds of PLN 318,388 were used to meet the infrastructural needs and fulﬁl the passions and dreams of persons under the care of the LOTOS Foundation’s social partners. We initiated a systematic employee volunteering programme. We carried out a number of initiatives started by our employees, such as ‘LOTOS Collects Screw Caps’, consisting in collection and sale of plastic bottle caps, with the proceeds transferred as ﬁnancial support to a grandson of one of the LOTOS Group’s employees, who suﬀers from a chronic disease of muscular atrophy and requires constant rehabilitation and medical equipment. Moreover, in the Easter and Christmas periods we sell cakes baked by the ‘JA TEŻ’ Foundation for Development to our employees and use the proceeds to support the Foundation’s activities carried out for the beneﬁt of people with the Down’s syndrome. As part of employee volunteer work, one of our teams erected a fence and performed repairs at a foster care home in cooperation with the Gdańsk Social Innovation Foundation. How do we create value for the environment in which we operate? Key ﬁnancial indicators Key non-ﬁnancial indicators Expenditure on social programmes: over Number of cross-sectoral social PLN 5m programmes and initiatives delivered by Grupa LOTOS: 23 Value of donations handed over by the LOTOS Foundation: PLN 762 thousand Awareness of Grupa LOTOS social and environmental projects: 40% of all The amount collected during the “Helping respondents while refuelling” campaign: PLN 318 thousand Assessment of our social and environmental impacts by Grupa LOTOS social partners: 80% At the LOTOS Group, we believe that the main purpose of CSR activities is to translate the success of the company into beneﬁts for the society in general. That is why in our business we take into account the needs of local communities and environmental challenges in the areas aﬀected by our operations. As we are responsible for the quality of life in the vicinity of our production plants, we make every eﬀort to ensure that it is as high as possible. Our capabilities are a function of our knowledge on various social and environmental aspects related to our business, as well as of the available human, technological and organizational potential. These factors largely shape our decisions on the direction and nature of our social impacts. 217/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group In annual surveys carried out in our environment, covering both the closest neighbourhood of our production plants and a wider area of the Gdańsk Province and the Bielsko-Biała and Jasło Counties, as well as 200 businesses operating in those three areas, we place a particular focus on the positive and negative aspects of living near Grupa LOTOS’s facilities. We check the eﬀectiveness of our communication activities related to CSR initiatives in educating and rising environmental and social awareness of the target groups. We analyse the degree of interest in our operations, including the business, sponsorship and social activities. Last but not least, we ask whether the directions followed by the LOTOS Group are correct and what other issues we should address, and the answers to those questions serve as the basis for modiﬁcations and a discussion of the usefulness of our activities. The survey results, part 1 The level of awareness, and the resulting self-assessment of our CSR activities improved compared with the 2013 and 2015 surveys. Particularly important data is that pertaining to the social activities addressed to the communities living close to Grupa LOTOS’ facilities, as well as the awareness of our initiatives designed to mitigate adverse environmental impacts (up from 2% to 17% of inhabitants in the areas located in the vicinity of our production plants). 218/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group The survey results, part 2 In other important areas, the awareness of our activities, including promotion of the CSR concept, support to social economy entities and education, improved by at least 10 percentage points among respondents living near the reﬁnery and our key companies in southern Poland. We also hold consultations to verify if the directions of our activities are correct. Asked about what activities the LOTOS Group should engage in, the respondents most often pointed to the areas on which we have consistently focused under our CSR strategy since 2011. 219/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group The survey results, part 3 220/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our indirect economic impacts 221/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group How do we aﬀect the environment? The impact of our business and the programmes we implement extends to: The labour market We create new jobs and opportunities for employment and professional advancement, a case in point being the EFRA Staﬀ Programme. We facilitate ﬁrst steps on the labour market by organizing internships and traineeships as well as workshops for students. We support state and local government administration bodies in developing the labour market by sharing best practices related to the employment process. We establish recruitment and selection standards and we share our knowledge with third parties, for example by being a member of the Coalition for Friendly Recruitment. More information: [ 1, 2 ] Quality of education We promote and support vocational education and we cooperate with technical schools by granting scholarships for the most talented students, oﬀering traineeship programmes at the LOTOS Group companies, purchasing equipment for research labs, knowledge sharing, and support of our specialists of various ﬁelds in educational activities. Last year, we closely cooperated with Vocational Education Centre No. 2 in Gdańsk that teaches mainly future chemical engineering technicians and laboratory staﬀ. LOTOS Serwis has partnered with the Communications School Complex in Gdańsk, where its employees give classes for the students and a dedicated class has been created with a curriculum focusing on skills and subjects relevant to work at LOTOS Serwis. We are a partner in programmes aimed at discovering talented youth and supporting their development, such as ‘Talent with LOTOS’, including three projects run concurrently in the Gdańsk Province (‘Pomeranian Talent’), in Jasło (‘Jasło Science League with LOTOS’) and, since 2016, in Czechowice-Dziedzice, the home town of a few LOTOS Group companies (‘Talent from Czechowice-Dziedzice, a Town of Fiery Enthusiasm). 222/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group For several years now, we have been involved in the E(x)plory programme, which seeks to identify and reward innovative interdisciplinary projects focusing on medicine, IT or design of services. The projects are carried out by junior-high and high school students. The winners are awarded for the best ideas with scholarships of PLN 10,000, PLN 8,000 and PLN 5,000. We undertake activities to present the Gdańsk reﬁnery, our management systems, and potential future workplaces to those young people who are interested in crude oil processing or who study in related ﬁelds. We organize guided tours on the plant’s premises, our employees attend conferences, our product companies, such as LOTOS Lab, regularly take part in outdoor events for local communities, where they demonstrate the nature of their work. More information: [ 1 ] Business growth We cooperate with local contractors and dealers operating LOTOS service stations, and organize training programmes for them. We cooperate with social economy entities that oﬀer services involving the provision of advertising products, which we give to our customers and partners during holidays, or event and catering services. More information: [ 1, 2 ] The area where we identify a particularly strong impact is the development of the local labour market. LOTOS Petrobaltic has more than 380 employees, over 70% of whom are residents of the Gdańsk Province. Moreover, the company runs a programme of unpaid traineeships, undertaken mainly by young people studying disciplines related to the company’s core business, including from the Faculty of Drilling, Oil and Gas of the AGH University of Science and Technology of Kraków, students of mechanical engineering at the Gdańsk University of Technology, as well as students from the Faculty of Oceanography and Geography of the University of Gdańsk. The experience they gain during such traineeships may be helpful in their further professional careers. By increasing the number of service stations in 2015 LOTOS Paliwa contributed to a rise in employment. At CODO stations, the staﬀ are employed by the station manager, whereas at DOFO stations they are employed by the franchisee running the station. The average headcount is 11 persons for a LOTOS premium station and 8 persons for an economy station. In 2015, 248 new staﬀ were hired at CODO stations; at the year end, the total headcount was 2,844. The service station staﬀ are oﬀered training opportunities to improve their qualiﬁcations. A deﬁnite majority of LOTOS Kolej’s employees were recruited from the local labour market, i.e. Poland. Senior management staﬀ are all local residents. In 2015, LOTOS Kolej employed 139 new staﬀ members. Also, 20 persons completed internships at the company, 6 participated in the Graduate Programme, and 2 in summer internships. Five of those persons were later employed at the company. 223/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Our CSR strategy The LOTOS Group’s responsible approach to activities undertaken in various spheres brings measurable eﬀects. Our achievements in this area are possible thanks to the clear long-term objectives deﬁned in our CSR strategy, which is closely related to our business strategy. The eﬀorts undertaken by the LOTOS Group in the social and business spheres, in our relations with key stakeholders and in corporate governance are aimed principally to: Ensure compliance with the law and ethical standards; Increase our positive contribution to social development; Mitigate possible adverse impacts of our operations and the associated risks; Maximize our chances for sustainable development over the long term. Key CSR activities: Ensuring equal opportunities and supporting the education and development of children and young people − who are the target group of our social and educational programmes and various sports and social projects focusing on the support of both talented and underprivileged youth; Road traﬃc safety − to which the LOTOS Group contributes through the quality of its products and comprehensive educational campaigns; Environmental protection and ecology − with special focus on the biodiversity of the Baltic Sea (given the seaboard location of the Gdańsk reﬁnery), as well as other areas of outstanding natural value, including NATURA 2000 sites, located in the Company’s immediate vicinity. In 2015 we commenced work on the new Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy whose overriding objective will be supporting the new business perspective. More information about LOTOS Group’s Business Strategy More information about LOTOS Group’s CSR Strategy 224/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Eﬀective support LOTOS Group’s CSR programmes and initiatives are a response to identiﬁed needs of local communities, and many of them are implemented within the framework of cross-sectoral partnerships. We monitor the eﬀects of our eﬀorts by running surveys of a group of over 1,000 respondents living in the regions where we operate, and, more speciﬁcally, in the vicinity of the LOTOS Group’s production plants. Each year, we prepare surveys for our long-term social partners so they can evaluate us in terms of dialogue, the quality of cooperation, and openness to communicate. In addition to questions about the quality of cooperation with Grupa LOTOS and the LOTOS Foundation (where more than 90% of the surveyed responded with ‘good’ or ‘very good’), we also ask about the implementation of the objective underlying our CSR strategy. In answer to the following question: ‘In your opinion, does Grupa LOTOS, through its initiatives, contribute to providing lasting solutions to the locally relevant social and environmental issues?’, 81% of the respondents answered ‘deﬁnitely yes’ and ‘yes’. Social diagnosis is based on meetings with our social partners and on participation in consultations, working groups and conferences attended by various entities from the local government, business and NGO sectors. A ﬂagship project under which new partnerships are forged and projects are implemented, including those focusing on social entrepreneurship or supporting local initiatives, is the Development Initiation Forum. As part of activities undertaken in 2012−2015 under the CSR strategy in the area of integration with local communities, we focused on ensuring favourable attitudes among local communities and fostering our reputation as a socially conscious business. We achieved our goals by undertaking initiatives that address and successfully solve social and environmental problems. The positive eﬀects of our eﬀorts can be seen across Poland and in the particular regions where we operate, i.e. mainly in the Gdańsk Province, and in the counties of Bielsko-Biała and Jasło. Grupa LOTOS’ lucky thirteen As the strategic partner of the Responsible Business Forum, Grupa LOTOS submits its projects to the ‘Responsible Business in Poland. Best Practices’ report. The 2015 report included as many as 13 best practices submitted by Grupa LOTOS. 225/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group How do we measure the eﬀectiveness of our support? For each initiative, whether it is a long-term project or a single-occasion event addressed to a speciﬁc social group, we carry out an assessment of the impact on local communities. In this way we verify whether a given project positively contributes to resolving social and environmental issues. In the case of educational projects for children and young people, we verify the number of students joining the projects and the number of winners of external competitions. As part of many of our initiatives we carry out evaluation surveys that gauge the participants’ satisfaction with the proposed oﬀer and provide comments on future assumptions and objectives which we then take into account. Apart from the information on the turnout in all of our projects and programmes, some of our partners provide us with information on further educational careers of the participants of a given programme, or the results of nationwide surveys on the usefulness of a social programme, e.g. the National Road Traﬃc Safety Centre sends us results of research on the number of accidents caused by failure to use seat belts and child safety seats or by their incorrect fastening and use. The ﬁndings serve as a basis for carrying out inspections among drivers and stepping up educational campaigns. Apart from the impact on local communities, we measure the reach of media or information campaigns executed as part of the programmes, and how successful they are in getting across to potential recipients of our message, who through our ads, articles, or posters can broaden their knowledge about, for instance, the Baltic’s biodiversity and its active preservation. One of the indicators of the our CSR activities’ is the number of site visits by unique visitors (individual IP addresses) at the websites of our projects and programmes. Number of page views at websites dedicated the LOTOS Group’s projects in 2015: www.kierunekbaltyk.pl – 152 thousand users and 514 thousand page views; the ‘Kierunek Bałtyk’ proﬁle (Headed for the Baltic) on Facebook – 56 thousand users; the „Emocje do pełna” proﬁle (Emotions to the Full) on Facebook – 130 thousand users; www.sledzfoki.pl – 90 thousand users and 271 thousand page views; www.sokoly.lotos.pl – 40 thousand users and 150 thousand page views; www.pilkalotos.pl – 17 thousand users and 43 thousand page views; www.lotoscup.pl – 2 thousand users and 4 thousand page views. 226/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Key areas of the LOTOS Group’s CSR activities 227/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Fostering equal opportunities One of the areas of focus for our CSR initiatives is creating equal opportunities for children and young people by supporting their education. The projects we engage in are selected based on the assessment of their eﬀectiveness and of how adequately they address the needs and actual problems. What enables us to make informed decisions about which projects to choose is the close and good relations with the local communities and social partners in the areas where our plants are located. Our ﬂagship projects We engage our clients in the ‘Helping while Refuelling’ programme In November 2015, LOTOS Paliwa launched the company’s and the fuel industry’s ﬁrst ever sales support project combining charity with image building, under the name ‘Helping while Refuelling’. The joint initiative of LOTOS Paliwa, Grupa LOTOS and the LOTOS Foundation was the ﬁrst cause-related marketing scheme organized on such a large scale in the fuel sector in Poland. The main objective of the campaign was to encourage motorists to buy fuel at LOTOS and LOTOS Optima service stations as each litre of fuel they purchased meant funds transferred to the LOTOS Foundation’s account. Our cooperation in the venture demonstrated that business eﬀorts can be eﬀectively combined with marketing and social activities to help those who need it the most. This landmark event opened a new stage in the LOTOS Group’s long-term Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy. The goal we set ourselves In addition to improving sales performance, we wanted to oﬀer tangible support to the beneﬁciaries of the LOTOS Foundation’s long-term social partners in the pursuit of their passions and dreams. Who received our help? Gdańsk Social Innovation Foundation (Gdańska Fundacja Innowacji Społecznej) The campaign proceeds totalling PLN 218,388 were used to organize winter holidays for 20 children and refurbish ﬁve supported ﬂats for former residents of children’s homes who begin independent living. The ‘Osiedle Sitowie’ (Sitowie Housing Estate) project run by the Municipal Centre for Family Support in Gdańsk (Miejski Ośrodek Pomocy Rodzinie w Gdańsku) PLN 100 thousand helped fulﬁl the dreams of 14 residents of the ‘Osiedle Sitowie’ project. We bought toys, bikes, computers and vouchers for clothes and books. The collected funds were also spent on driving courses as well as judo and dancing classes for the older youth. Further, we helped ﬁnance purchases of various ﬁttings and equipment for the ﬂats occupied by the ‘Osiedle Sitowie’ beneﬁciaries. How was the money collected? 228/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group From November 16th to December 5th 2015, the LOTOS Foundation’s account was credited with PLN 0.01 for each litre of ON Dynamic and PB98 Dynamic fuels purchased at LOTOS and LOTOS Optima service stations. Each litre of diesel oil, PB95, PB98 and LPG sold at the stations meant another PLN 0.005 transferred to the account. The project’s ambassador was Robert Kubica, a rally driver. Other famous athletes who encouraged motorists to help while refuelling included Kamil Stoch, Piotr Żyła, Kajetan Kajetanowicz, Sebastian Mila, Piotr Gacek, Mateusz Mika, and Robert Lewandowski. The programme was accompanied by radio and television campaigns and distribution of BTL sales support materials at the LOTOS service stations. What made this campaign unique was the use of non-standard communications media at all LOTOS and LOTOS Optima service stations, that is dedicated meters showing the amount collected since the beginning of the campaign. What else did we do? The second phase of the campaign was the ‘Winning while Refuelling’ lottery started on December 7th 2015. It was a way for LOTOS Paliwa to thank its clients for contributing to the pool of funds for children. They were oﬀered a chance to win PLN 500 in a draw held every hour as part of a special lottery on RMF FM radio. Business eﬀect Apart from helping our social partners to carry out valuable social projects, the ‘Helping while Refuelling’ and ‘Winning while Refuelling’ projects vastly enhanced our sales. We saw a double-digit year-on-year growth in the volumes of fuels sold: (1, 2) Support for the talented ones ‘Talent with LOTOS’ is an initiative by which we seek to contribute to the development and education of children and youth in the regions where LOTOS Group companies are present. It is our response to the need for increased support to talented students in the Polish education system. We have implemented the ‘Pomeranian Talent’ programme in the Gdańsk Province and, in cooperation with the town of Jasło, the ‘Jasło Science League with LOTOS’ in the Jasło region. ‘Talent with LOTOS’ is targeted at elementary and junior-high schools as well as kindergartens. In the 2014/2015 school year, 131 league teams were set up as part of Jasło Science League with LOTOS, including 500 children and 60 teachers. Within the framework of the ‘Pomeranian Talent’ project, 1,332 students from the Gdańsk Province took part in education and development activities. In 2016, another initiative was incorporated in the ‘Talent with LOTOS’ scheme, this time targeted at talented children and youth from the region of CzechowiceDziedzice, a third location of key importance to the LOTOS Group’s engagement with local communities. ‘Talent from Czechowice-Dziedzice, a Town of Fiery Enthusiasm’. This project is to enhance systematic patronage of talented students from elementary and junior-high schools, and in particular identify the most promising talent and support their teachers, shaping scientiﬁc thinking and promoting project-based methods in education. It will see 92 students from elementary and junior-high schools work under supervision of 18 teachers on scientiﬁc and research projects, which will be then assessed by experts and rewarded with prizes sponsored by the Mayor of the Czechowice-Dziedzice Municipality and Grupa LOTOS. The project will be implemented under direct patronage of LOTOS Terminale.

The guiding idea of E(x)plory is to support talented scientists in the pursuance of innovative projects, develop businesses’, organizations’ and institutions’ best practices in the areas of innovation and modern technologies, expand cooperation with talented young people, and encourage curiosity and interest in science among local communities. The E(x)plory programme consists of a number of modules: The E(x)plory scientiﬁc competition, joined by ca. two million students each year, who submit approximately 150−200 projects. The competition consists of the regional stage and the nationwide ﬁnals, which ends the programme in a given year. The projects are evaluated by more than 50 jury members (academics and managers), representing the most prestigious universities and scientiﬁc institutions as well as innovative companies from across Poland. Regional Science Festivals, attended each year by more than two thousand participants, mainly junior-high and high school students. The festivals are the venue of open workshops and shows for children and the youth. The closing event – Gdynia E(x)plory Week – a great celebration of science and innovation for more than three thousand students. The Nationwide Finals of the E(x)plory Science Competition and the E(x)plory and Innovations Congress for representatives of business and science are held during the closing event. The winners’ participation in international competitions, such as Intel ISEF in the US and INESPO in the Netherlands. 2015 saw 11 programme winners participate in international competitions. Internship programme for the youth: the Foundation organizes internships at prestigious universities in Poland, attended by 18 students in 2015. More information about E(x)plory Good Neighbour programme The programme comprises numerous activities, which are sometimes area-speciﬁc and dispersed but which share one basic feature: they are addressed to communities living in the immediate vicinity of Grupa LOTOS. Most of the activities are centred around the objectives deﬁned in our strategy, that is equal opportunities, road traﬃc safety, ecology and environmental protection. The programme involves the following activities: Supporting picnics, sports events, summer camps, etc., Supporting educational activities in the area of environmental protection and road traﬃc safety, Developing the residents’ understanding of our reﬁnery’s operation and assuring them that it has state-of-theart environmental security controls, Providing assistance to public beneﬁt institutions and organizations, especially those helping children and young people, Organizing Children’s Day and Santa Claus gift-giving events for local community children, Supporting social initiatives, capital investments or repair works at educational institutions. 230/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Children’s Day at LOTOS Kolej In 2015, the Children’s Day was celebrated with the Rail Technology Day, co-organised by the LOTOS Group and LOTOS Kolej. In previous years, LOTOS Kolej organised the Rail Technology Days in cooperation with SKM Trójmiasto, and with PKP Energetyka and PKP Intercity. The event attracted railway lovers, company employees and the local community. The LOTOS Group organised the event alone to celebrate the Children’s Day as the initiative for the local community in a selected district nearby, in accordance with the assumptions of the “Good Neighbour” programme. Having analysed the facts, both LOTOS Kolej and the LOTOS Group decided it was possible to organise a single event addressed to all the addressees of the two events. , The event attracted more than three thousand people, including the LOTOS Group’s employees and their families as well as children living in the nearby districts, i.e. Olszynka, Rudnik, Przejazdów, children from LEONARDO school and nursery school, and children from the parish of Our Lady of Sorrows in Gdańsk. The event was to present the LOTOS Group as a socially responsible company in line with the CSR strategy assumed, and LOTOS Kolej as an eco-friendly one, meeting the highest standards, i.e. high-tech locomotives, tight cleaning of rail tankers, taking care of the environmental protection. The assumption was to give children an insight into everyday work of a modern company such as LOTOS Kolej and present it in an understandable and attractive manner, to show places which are usually not accessible, e.g. Traﬃc Management Center, Signalling Center, Depot, Rail Tanker Cleaning Station. There were many attractions prepared for the participants, e.g. the opportunity to take a handcar or locomotive ride, competitions on the stage. There were also games related to the areas supported by the LOTOS Group, e.g. football matches on a professional pitch and traﬃc safety. . We also used the opportunity to ask those present for their opinions on the event. 91% of the respondents were very happy with the way the event was run and the attractions it oﬀered. 70% of the respondents were able to spontaneously enumerate a few areas and names of CSR programmes carried out by the LOTOS Group, such as ‘Safety Belt Champions’, ‘Headed for the Baltic’ or granting scholarships for students. Good climate for cooperation Grupa LOTOS and the UP Foundation for Initiating Development have partnered in a ﬂagship cross-sector programme, Development Initiation Forum (FIR). The organization was created on the initiative of individuals who are aware of the need for social and economic changes in the Pomerania region, and has a mission of initiating and supporting social and economic development using the potential created by cross-sector partnerships. Since 2014, Grupa LOTOS has also been the general partner of the FIR’s Grant Fund, which helps partnerships that bring together the public, private and NGO sectors. In 2015, PLN 240 thousand was spent on grants for nine crosssector projects aimed at promoting social entrepreneurship, employment of individuals at risk of social exclusion, physical activity and healthy diet. The co-ﬁnancing grant was up to PLN 25 thousand. The judging panel composed of representatives of business circles, local governments and non-government organizations selected ﬁve initiatives in the ﬁrst round of the competition, and four initiatives in its second edition. More information about FIR Grants go to the responsible ones In 2015, Grupa LOTOS selected the winners of the second edition of the ‘Responsibly with LOTOS’ grant contest addressed to student organizations – members of ENACTUS Poland. The contest is designed to support interesting projects that correspond to the objectives of Grupa LOTOS’ CSR strategy in the area of society, natural environment or road traﬃc safety. Its second edition was open to student societies and organizations registered in Poland and there was no requirement for the submitted projects to be conﬁned to the regions where Grupa LOTOS is implementing its CSR strategy. The participants competed for a grant of PLN 10,000. More information about ‘Responsibly with LOTOS’ 231/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group More information about ENACTUS Involvement of LOTOS Straż ﬁre brigades in rescue operations in the city of Gdańsk At the request of the State Fire Service, the LOTOS Straż rescue and ﬁre-ﬁghting brigade takes part in rescue operations outside the LOTOS Group’s reﬁnery. In 2015, the ﬁreﬁghters were involved in an operation in Gdańsk Śródmieście where an injured crane operator required assistance. They also responded to an accident involving two passenger cars on the S7 national road near the entrance to the premises of the LOTOS Group. The LOTOS Straż rescue and ﬁre-ﬁghting brigade engages in promoting ﬁre safety among the local community during the ‘Żuławski Tulipan’ event in Pruszcz Gdański, and each year, the brigade divers take part in cleaning up the Baltic. Other initiatives for the beneﬁt of local communities 232/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Road traﬃc safety The high degree of danger in road traﬃc is a serious social issue both in Poland and globally. Aware of the social importance of the problem, for more than a decade we have been pursuing internally-developed social and educational programmes, supporting numerous initiatives aimed at promoting road safety in Poland. Safe with the seat belt In 2015, Grupa LOTOS and the National Road Traﬃc Safety Centre held the second, nationwide edition of the ‘LOTOS Safety Belt Champions’ programme. The project’s ambassador is a LOTOS Rally Team racing driver who won the European Rally Championship in 2015. ‘LOTOS Safety Belt Champions’ is a prevention and awareness programme focusing on the proper fastening of seat belts, and selection and correct use of child safety seats. During special PIT STOP sessions, most of which were held at LOTOS service stations, more than 3,500 motorists took part in individual tutorials provided by experts. Our activities also included three ‘Stay Safe – It’s Good to Be Alive!’ seminars and safety training at three elementary schools. For more information about the programme: ‘LOTOS Safety Belt Champions’. LOTOS Geonafta: the company repaired 11.3 km of local roads between its facilities. The project cost was nearly EUR 4.2 thousand. 233/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Environmental protection and ecology The key area where our environmental protection capabilities are put to use is the preservation of the Baltic Sea’s biodiversity, which follows primarily from the coastal location of the Grupa LOTOS’ reﬁnery. We are also strongly committed to raising the environmental awareness of our employees. The ﬂagship project in this area is ‘Headed for the Baltic’, an initiative bringing together organizations involved in research on environmental protection, nature conservation activities and environmental education. Our joint eﬀorts focus on the areas in direct proximity to the Gdańsk reﬁnery, which are of great natural value, the local animal species, and the biodiversity of the marine fauna and ﬂora. ‘Headed for the Baltic’ Since 2009, Grupa LOTOS has worked with the Foundation for the Development of the University of Gdańsk and the Marine Station of the University’s Oceanography Institute in Hel as part of a programme which until 2014 was conducted as ‘LOTOS Protects the Baltic Sea Wildlife’, and in 2015 was renamed as ‘Headed for the Baltic’. Our joint goal is to halt the extinction of the most endangered sea animal species in the Baltic waters, with our eﬀorts focused on porpoises, which are often referred to as the ‘Baltic cousin’ of the dolphin (currently their population is estimated at 100). Apart from measures designed to protect the endangered species, other projects pursued jointly by the programme partners include awareness raising initiatives and promotion of the knowledge of the Baltic’s biodiversity. ‘Protect the Wildlife of the Sobieszewo Island’ Initiated in 2010, the programme ‘Protect the Wildlife of the Sobieszewo Island’ is run together with the Ornithology Station of the Museum and Institute of Zoology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the KULING Waterbird Research Group, and the Association of Sobieszewo Island Lovers. The project provides for comprehensive initiatives on the Sobieszewo Island, especially in the Mewia Łacha Reserve, with the key goal of preserving the island’s natural riches and pro-environmental education aimed to promote the respect for and understanding of the natural environment. The programme contributed to building new tourist infrastructure, including an educational trail across the Mewia Łacha Reserve, which minimizes the threats to the local avian population. 234/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Grupa LOTOS has initiated the ‘Buy the Seal a Herring’ campaign. The project participants can ﬁnance a meal for one or more seals by contributing any amount through the ‘Headed for Baltic’ platform.

A signiﬁcant part of our eﬀorts is devoted to initiatives intended to promote active and healthy lifestyles among children and youth. We attach great importance to supporting young sports talent. Our ﬂagship projects ‘In Search for the Champion’s Successors’ Ski jump to the top With the assistance of the Polish Skiing Association, in 2004 we initiated the National Ski Jumping Development Programme ‘In Search for the Champion’s Successors’ to support the most promising young ski jumpers. As part of this largest social and sports project in the history of Polish skiing, since 2005 we have held LOTOS Cup ski jumping tournaments in Zagórz, Zakopane, Wisła and Szczyrk. We also ﬁnance sports equipment for clubs that train young ski jumpers. Since 2004, the most talented jumpers from 19 clubs in diﬀerent parts of Poland received, among other things, 261 sets of skis and bindings, 237 skiing suits, 100 helmets, and 210 pairs of ski jumping shoes. By providing the clubs with professional sports equipment, we enable them to oﬀer full training to children from the youngest age groups. Each year, after the end of the LOTOS Cup competition, the programme funds scholarships and awards for the best young jumpers who top the general classiﬁcation of the tournament. ‘Football Future with LOTOS’ Football in a fair-play environment ‘Football Future with LOTOS’ (renamed ‘White and Green Future with LOTOS’ as of the end of 2015) is a programme we run with the New Lechia Gdańsk Football Academy to promote football among the youngest inhabitants of the Pomerania region. There are 14 centres cooperating with the New Lechia Gdańsk Football Academy as partner clubs or aﬃliated clubs within the framework of the project, which includes a common training programme for all the centres, training courses for the coaches, purchases of training and sports equipment, jointly organized football camps, and sports scholarships for the most promising players and for those in a diﬃcult ﬁnancial situation. Currently, the systematic long-term training programme covers more than 3,000 children, who train for and regularly take part in football games organized by the Regional Football Associations. The New Lechia Gdańsk Football Academy is expected to be a pool of talent for junior national teams and professional sports clubs. 236/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Sponsorship of cultural events Our commitment to the development of arts and culture is manifest in the support we oﬀer primarily to the institutions of culture and cultural events in the regions where we are present − in the Gdańsk Province, and in the administrative districts of Bielsko-Biała and Jasło. We contribute to long-term projects that have a social dimension. We also support those initiatives which build the regions’ potential and attractiveness in terms of cultural events in the national scale. Flagship projects pursued by Grupa LOTOS in the area of patronage of culture in 2015 Jazz ﬂavours 2015 saw the 17th edition of LOTOS Jazz Festival − Bielska Zadymka Jazzowa, Grupa LOTOS holds naming rights for this event, representing the most important jazz festival in the south of Poland and attracting music lovers from Poland and other countries alike. For nearly 10 years, it has been accompanied by a competition for young jazz musicians, where the main prize is an opportunity to record, release and promote their debut albums. On the big stage Grupa LOTOS lends support to the Gdańsk Shakespeare Festival organized since 1997 and counting among the largest international theatrical festivals in Europe.

That is why in June 2015 we established the LOTOS Foundation to manage our philanthropic policy. This was done to ensure professionalism in our charity and social activities, development of our philanthropic initiatives, support to our CSR strategy and business, as well as greater involvement of our staﬀ in social work. LOTOS Foundation’s mission: wide-ranging social activity to make a positive contribution to the social and natural environment. LOTOS Foundation’s aims: to support initiatives that help develop infrastructure and make a positive diﬀerence for local communities, particularly in regions where companies of the LOTOS Group operate. To meet the expectations concerning the directions of our philanthropic activities, the Foundation focuses on the environment and its protection (particularly in the Baltic Sea) and reduction of social inequalities, especially among children and teenagers, for example by supporting education, science etc. During the ﬁrst six months of its operation, the Foundation spent more than PLN 760,000, providing support to 47 entities. Area Amount spent (PLN) Number of entities Social and charity activity 329,388.13* 9 Science and education 151,885.00 3 Sport 110,200.00 17 Environmental protection and ecology 109,300.00 5 Health protection and promotion 30,000.00 5 Culture and art 21,000.00 5 Preservation of tradition 10,500.00 3 Total 762,273.13 47 * Including support provided to social partners under the ‘Helping while Refuelling’ programme Owing to the funds provided by the LOTOS Foundation, more than 170 children from low-income families participated in leisure activities organized for them and received Christmas gifts. 239/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group As regards science and education, the Foundation supported several initiatives with exceptional social contribution and reach. Caring for Poles living in countries east of Poland, the Foundation co-ﬁnanced the purchase of four school buses for Polish schools in the Vilnius region in Lithuania, bought equipment for selected schools and awarded grants to the best students. The Foundation co-ﬁnanced summer holidays for more than 320 children and teenagers. Those initiatives were mainly addressed at low-income families living in the vicinity of the LOTOS Group reﬁnery in Gdańsk as well as at children from children’s homes and childcare facilities. In addition, the LOTOS Foundation supported several initiatives promoting physical culture and sport among children and the youth, including with disabilities. With a view to preserving the natural riches around the LOTOS reﬁnery in Gdańsk and oﬀering pro-environmental education aimed to promote the respect for and understanding of the natural environment, the LOTOS Foundation ensured ﬁnancial support to the ‘Protect the WILDLIFE of the Sobieszewo Island’ programme, executed in cooperation with the Ornithology Station of the Museum and Institute of Zoology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Biologic Station of the Gdańsk University Development Foundation, the KULING Waterbird Research Group and the Association of Sobieszewo Island Lovers. The project provides for comprehensive initiatives on the Sobieszewo Island, especially in the Mewia Łacha Reserve. The LOTOS Foundation also cares for endangered species of marine fauna of the Baltic Sea, notably the harbour porpoise and seal − it made a donation to the Gdańsk University Development Foundation to ﬁnance the purchase of specialist research equipment to be used in the scientiﬁc and research operations of the Marine Station of the Gdańsk University’s Institute of Oceanography in Hel. Furthermore, the Foundation supported initiatives for health promotion and protection, culture and art, as well as preservation of tradition. In 2015, the LOTOS Foundation co-organized the ‘Helping while Refuelling’ campaign − funds raised from fuel sales at LOTOS service stations were used to help beneﬁciaries of the support provided by the LOTOS Foundation’s social partners fulﬁl their dreams and needs. We make sure the LOTOS Foundation is a transparent organization which openly communicates its operations and their eﬀects.

The previous integrated annual report was released in 2015. As part of the new reporting process, the 2014 report was reviewed for its adherence to the IIRC guidelines. Based on the review, recommendations were produced to improve the process. This 2015 report is the seventh integrated report of the LOTOS Group. What sets it The LOTOS Group’s non-ﬁnancial report participated in eight of the nine editions of the CSR Reports contests held so far. apart? In 2008, Grupa LOTOS was the winner of the CSR Reports competition, and in 2009, 2010 and 2015 its reports were awarded distinctions. Grupa LOTOS was one of the ﬁrst companies (both in the industry and among the contest participants) to adopt integrated approach to reporting. In the nine editions of the CSR Reports competition, from 2007 to 2015, 13 integrated reports were presented, including three from Grupa LOTOS. The 2015 Report is the ﬁrst to cover all direct subsidiaries, where it is relevant, of Grupa LOTOS S.A.: LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. LOTOS Infrastruktura S.A. LOTOS Oil Sp. z o.o. LOTOS Terminale S.A. LOTOS Asfalt Sp. z o.o. LOTOS Kolej Sp. z o.o. LOTOS Serwis Sp. z o.o. LOTOS Ochrona Sp. z o.o. LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. LOTOS Straż Sp. z o.o. LOTOS Lab Sp. z o.o. 242/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Additionally, the following indirect subsidiaries were included in the reporting of certain indicators because of their special role, nature of business, and scale of environmental impacts: AB LOTOS Geonafta Energobaltic Sp. z o.o. LOTOS Biopaliwa Sp. z o.o. LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS. RCEkoenergia Sp. z o.o. However, the scope of reported data for LOTOS E&P Norge AS is limited compared with other companies as LOTOS E&P Norge is a licensee, so all environmental (and operational) matters are reported by the licence operators. A consequence of these changes are diﬀerences in presentation of certain indicators and their limited comparability. 243/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Stakeholders’ say − important element of reporting process Why are stakeholders important to us and how do we identify them? Our strategic approach to corporate social responsibility is best expressed in building positive relations with all stakeholders, which − to our satisfaction − leads to their growing engagement. We want decision-making processes concerning economic, social and environmental matters to take into account the interests of various stakeholder groups, which are important to our business. We also make sure that our stakeholders have access to timely information that meets their various needs. We are aware of how important relations with stakeholders are in building company value. By working together with them and being open to communication, we gain valuable understanding of how to develop our organization and build its positive corporate image. Our key stakeholders are identiﬁed based on: their inﬂuence on the organization, the organization’s inﬂuence on them, our key business regions: Gdańsk Province in the north of Poland, and Czechowice-Dziedzice and Jasło regions in the south. Our stakeholders Internal stakeholders External stakeholders Market environment Employees Local communities Contractors and subcontractors LOTOS Group companies Non-governmental organizations Suppliers Trade unions Local government institutions Customers Works Council Government administration Trading partners Scientiﬁc and research institutions, education centres Competitive companies Industry organizations and international Employer associations institutions The media Regulatory and monitoring organizations Natural environment Capital market participants Potential employees The group marked in blue has been deﬁned in this year's process 244/263 as a priority. The group marked in blue has been deﬁned in this year's process as a priority. Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group How do we engage our stakeholders? Discussions with the stakeholders about our organization’s inﬂuence on the community and environment give us valuable hints on how to improve our performance and better understand the needs of our environment. To gain extensive knowledge of these matters, we conduct surveys among our stakeholders, both internal (employees) and external. In late 2015 and early 2016, we carried out an opinion survey among the key stakeholder groups of the LOTOS Group. Its ultimate goal was to provide information which would help prepare the new Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy of the LOTOS Group. In addition, we gained information on how our CSR approach and initiatives were received and assessed. We also learned what our stakeholders expect and need from the LOTOS Group’s business. This qualitative study used in-depth interviews with representatives of the following key stakeholders of the LOTOS Group: Public administration and local governments Employer associations Non-governmental organizations Entrepreneurs Consultancy ﬁrms Non-proﬁt public organizations. The qualitative study complemented the quantitative one carried out in 2015 and 2016 among: Inhabitants of Jasło, Czechowice-Dziedzice, and the Gdańsk Province Entrepreneurs in the Gdańsk Province Residents of districts located in the vicinity of the LOTOS Group’s plants in Gdańsk, Jasło and CzechowiceDziedzice Employees of the LOTOS Group companies. Furthermore, during the ‘CSR Day’, we talked with representatives of the management staﬀ about the LOTOS Group’s approach to CSR issues and other matters signiﬁcant to our sustainable development. 245/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Process of deﬁning the Report content This year’s report is based on the Global Reporting Initiative’s Sustainability Reporting Framework and Guidelines (GRI G4, core level), together with the Oil and Gas Sector Supplement. This represents a change in Grupa LOTOS’s approach to reporting − the previous report was based on the GRI G3.1 guidelines at application level A+ (so all GRI indicators were reported, including 43 proﬁle indicators and 98 subjects). Currently, in accordance with the GRI G4 framework, we report only signiﬁcant topics ( 39 proﬁle indicators and 42 subjects). In the process of deﬁning the content of the 2015 Integrated Annual Report of the LOTOS Group, we consulted many key stakeholder groups, internal and external, and thoroughly analysed the external sources. This helped draw up the ﬁnal list of GRI aspects to be included in this Integrated Report. In accordance with GRI guidelines, the process had three steps: 1. Identiﬁcation − determination of key topics in corporate social responsibility and business. Internal documents and materials of the LOTOS Group were analysed, including in particular reports from opinion surveys conducted among employees. We also reviewed many external publications and media information about our company. We took into account the trends and guidelines of international standards for corporate social responsibility and non-ﬁnancial reporting and made an in-depth analysis of the challenges, opportunities and risks facing the industry and its players. We analysed: GRI Sustainability topics for sectors Sustainability Yearbook 2016 Findings of CSR survey carried out among local communities and entrepreneurs Comparison of fuel companies. 2. Prioritization − in a dialogue with internal stakeholders, the materiality of key aspects for the organization was identiﬁed. 3. Validation − during validation workshops with management staﬀ, we deﬁned the ﬁnal list of material aspects to be included in the 2015 report. 49 persons representing 11 companies participated in the workshops. The following matrix shows the signiﬁcance of these issues divided into aspects (economic, social and environmental) and simultaneously leads directly to the chapter describing our approach and activities coonected with the subject. The size of the tile indicates whether a subject has been deﬁned as an important or very important.

One of the objectives of the workshops was to identify the value drivers at the LOTOS Group under the six capitals deﬁned by IIRC, and to determine what beneﬁts to the LOTOS Group and its stakeholders can be derived from the adopted business model. Moreover, last year, we decided to supplement our business model with indicators which allow us to reliably measure our impact on the environment. The choice of indicators was subject to internal consultations. We want to use the experience gained this year while developing the model in the future, presenting our impacts in the most transparent and measurable manner possible. Beneﬁts to both the LOTOS Group and its stakeholders are presented on the basis of six capitals. We are aware that some of the beneﬁts are generated as part of more than one capital. For the sake of transparency of our model, we have decided to present such beneﬁts only once and attribute them to the capital to which they are most speciﬁc. 248/263 Integrated Annual Report 2015 LOTOS Group Assurance letter To ensure appropriate transparency and reliability of the non-ﬁnancial data, independent limited-scope external assurance was carried out. The 2015 Integrated Annual Report is our ﬁfth report to undergo independent assurance of CSR data.
