most senior decision maker of the organization Dear Readers, FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft is among the leading providers of air ambulance and VIP charter services worldwide and still improves every year in economic, social and environmental fields. FAI stands for individual mobility for its customers and sustainable solutions at the same time. FAI is one of the 10 largest operators in General Aviation in Europe and the largest business jet operator in Germany. FAI’s 20 jet aircraft include three Bombardier Global Express, five Bombardier Challenger 604, nine Learjet 60, two Learjet 55 and one Learjet 35. 4 aircraft of FAI’s fleet are providing Special Mission Services for the world’s largest NGO. In 2015 FAI recorded an operational income of approximately € 80 Mio. That’s € 6.5 Mio more than in FAI’s previous record year 2014. After a seven year CoShareholdership with Marfin Investment Group from Greece, Axtmann Holding AG again owns 100% of FAI. Besides the headquarters at Albrecht Dürer Airport Nuremberg (EDDN) FAI operates satellite offices in Dubai and Miami, as well as bases in Baghdad, Bamako and Dakar. For July 2016 breaking ground is scheduled for FAI’s third hangar at Albrecht Dürer Airport. The new hangar, known as Hangar 8, represents an investment of € 6 Mio. and will increase FAI’s hangar floor by another 4.500m², bringing the total usable space of the facility to 13.500m², representing one of the largest carbon neutral FBO’s in Europe. Hangar 8 should be fully operational by spring of 2017. Since 2005 FAI is an active member of the United Nation’s Global Compact. This membership shows FAI’s efforts in economic, social efforts and ecological areas. In July 2015, FAI received the award for being one of the “Bavarian Best 50”-Enterprises of the year for its outstanding increase in sales and employees in recent years. Later that year FAI has been nominated again as one of the finalists of the ITIJ (International Travel & Health Insurance Journal) Air Ambulance Company of the Year awards 2015, after FAI has won this prestigious award in 2012 already. Corporate responsibility and the reporting of corporate responsibility strategies and programs at FAI continue to be a work in progress. While initiatives and programs, as well as progress from year to year are discussed, we recognize the need to report quantifiable metrics and targets, in particular as they relate to our social performance and economic impact. These are a lot of goals to reach for FAI and we are willing to reach and improve them every year. Please follow us on our way. With kind regards Dr. Siegfried Axtmann Chairman and CEO ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2015 FAI Sustainability Report 2016 3 UN Global Compact statement of continued support UN Global Compact Statement of Continuous Support Since July 2005 we are an active member of the UN Global Compact and make a continuous efforts towards sustainable development of our Company.

G4-11 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements Our organization has no employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2015 FAI Sustainability Report 2016 9 G4-12 Organization's supply chain Our organization does not have a supply chain. We are an air carrier, licensed by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) according to EU-OPS1, our Maintenance Organization (MRO) is certified according to EASA Part 145. Our air ambulance operations are certified by EURAMI (European Medical Institute). As a certified airline, we obtain parts only from suppliers providing us with a certificate of origin. During the reporting period of 2015 we received parts from approximately 740 suppliers, of those 85% came from companies in the United States of America, 7.5% of parts came from Germany, and 2,5% each, came from Holland, France and the United Kingdom. G4-13 Significant changes regarding size, structure ownership or supply chain During the reporting period there were significant changes in terms of the size, structure or ownership of the organization. After an investment of approximately € 4.3 m and the completion of Hangar 7 in 2014, with a total created space was increased to well over 9.000m². Based already at EDDN airport and their variety of available aircraft for short distance charter flights, made the acquisition a perfect fit for all parties involved. As the trend evolves in Europe towards charter of small Jets, we are looking forward to serving our loyal customers with never before seen availability and accessibility to such services. 2015 ended with plans for Hangar 8 with a completion date in spring of 2017, adding an additional 4.500 m² of hangar space, along with a customer departure lounge representing an investment of € 6.0 m net. In July Axtmann Holding AG gained back 100% ownership of FAI after acquisition of a 51 % stake from MIG Aviation Holdings Ltd. Axtmann Holding purchased a 51 % stake in Fly Alpha GmbH in the summer of 2015.

These are published in the Federal Gazette “Bundesanzeiger” (www.bundesanzeiger.de). Please Enter “FAI” as a search term. The Company is managed by the Executive Board, consisting of four (4) executive members. The Executive Board is responsible for all decisions regarding economic, environmental and social impacts. G4-18 Method for defining report content and differentiation of aspects Process for defining the report contents and aspect boundaries: In order to define the material aspects and boundaries of the report, we used as a foundation the quick check of the sustainability software 360report. In the first step, we evaluated the data base in the GRI stakeholder survey of the sector air transportation (primarily passenger air transportation), in order to take the size of FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft into account. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2015 FAI Sustainability Report 2016 11 In the second step, we adapted the materiality matrix using an initial selection of indicators and aspects. This adaptation as well as the selection of relevant indicators are based on the contribution of the Executive Assistant to Chairman and were carried out in consultation with Members of the Board. Once the materiality was defined, 360report answered and worked on the questionnaires. This was done in close collaboration with departments of Human Resources, Operations, Accounting as well as other staff members and the experts from 360report. Aspects and indicators, whose materiality was classified as low or very low and were not taken into consideration in this report. G4-19 Identified material aspects G4-20/21 Essential aspects and delineation of aspects within and outside the organization Significant aspects and boundaries of the aspects within and outside the Company: The first analysis is based on the assumption that all “material” classified aspects for the entire company located in Nuremberg are of importance. Regarding the communication with the stakeholders it is important to us to continuously improve our annual Communication on Progress. In addition, we have been reporting to our shareholder for many years pursuant with the IFRS financial reporting standards. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2015 FAI Sustainability Report 2016 12 G4-22 Effect of any restatements of information provided Our organization has previously reported on sustainability issues. Compared to the previous Sustainability Report there are changes in the presentation of information. FAI-rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft has published a sustainability report in previous years. As this report becomes more detailed, 360report software gave us the opportunity to comply with this. G4-23 Changes from previous reporting periods In comparison to the previous Sustainability Report there have been no changes in scope and aspect boundaries. Please also refer to G4-22. Stakeholder Engagement G4-24 Stakeholder groups engaged During the reporting period the organization's stakeholders were involved in sustainability issues. The following table shows the stakeholders involved.

According to our conviction to act responsible and the combined social acceptance this creates increasingly the condition for each enterprise to be economically successful, now and in the future. Thus, we understand sustainable management as an investment in our future capabilities. This requires that solutions for social and entrepreneurial challenges are identified at an early stage. Economic Performance G4-EC1 Direct economic value generated and distributed Direct economic value generated and distributed (EVG&D) For determining taxable income our Company uses accruals based accounting method recorded as revenue and expenditures in the income statement. As a result of the internal data management system previously used, the economic business figures required by GRI G4 were not yet available in this format. We will adjust the system to be able to generate these business figures in the near future in the appropriate format. The EVG&D cannot be allocated by national, regional or market level. The reason being that the percentage of local supply options depend on routes flown in the air and therefore fluctuates significantly in order to be able to report fixed percentages. G4-EC2 Chances and risks due to climate change Financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organization's activities due to climate change We have not yet verified the risks of natural disasters due to climate change for our business activities. We assume no strong hazard due to our geographical location. FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft does not operate in the classic energy-intensive industries, however, ranks among a growing sector with raising greenhouse gas emissions: Air-transport CO²-regulations apply for all aircraft operators according to European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) for intra-European Economic Area (EEA) flights. Due to the “Stopping the Clock”decision for international flights from/to the EEA, the EU-ETS is temporarily suspended until the international Civil Aviation Organization ICAO shall have developed and adopted a global model for the regulation of international aviation emissions. However, we are affected indirectly by climate changes, as we have to pay for higher energy and raw material prices, which in turn result in higher demands on energy management. Nevertheless, we have a CO² strategy, which is explained in more depth in the environment section of this report. We are unable to provide information on a systematic and database-supported analysis of the financial consequences of climate change. Market Presence G4-EC5 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage at significant business locations ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2015 FAI Sustainability Report 2016 16 FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft wages are based on the employee´s ability, engagement, job performance and commitment. There is no gender bias regarding pay scale, and everyone is paid above minimum wage. Indirect Economic Impacts G4-EC7 Infrastructure investments and services supported Development and impact of infrastructure investments and services supported We have made the following investments in infrastructure or services during the reporting period. Table 19: Investments in infrastructure or services supported Description Previous needs analysis performed Type of investment Cost in Euro Duration Universitätsklinikum Schleswig Holstein yes Monetary donation 9,650 one time Kinder in Not yes Monetary donation 30,000 one time Alexander v.Humboldt Stiftung yes Monetary donation 3,000 one time Nürnberger Tafel yes Monetary donation 5,000 one time Bayrisches Rotes Kreuz yes Monetary donation 5,000 one time One of the Foundation close to our heart, here at FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft is “Kinder in Not”. The foundation is committed to making the world a better place for girls and young woman alike. Not only does the foundation provide shelter, schools and medical services for children and woman in need, but also teaches them how important education and vaccinations are. It provides this new generation of girls with a save heaven away from mental as well as physical abuse, takes them away from child labor and arranged marriages. It teaches these moms, sisters, and daughters that a world full of chances is available to them and their future generations. Other donation were made in 2015 as well, including the “Tafel Nürnberg” a service organized by the city of Nuremberg for the ever growing population of low income households. The “Tafel Nürnberg” allows families in need to collect perishable and non-perishable foods in order to provide healthy food choices to their families. The sum of all investments and grants made during the reporting period is approximately 0.7 % of our organization's turnover during the same period. . Procurement Practices G4-EC9 Spending on local suppliers Proportion of spending on local suppliers at significant locations of operations Our company does not have a specific policy determining that locally-based suppliers shall be given preference. It is currently not planning to introduce such a policy either. Even with such policy in place the main suppliers for aircraft parts and services are the United States, France and the UK. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2015 FAI Sustainability Report 2016 17 EN (ENVIRONMENT) G4-DMA Disclosures on Management Approach „EN (Environment)“ Sustainability has many facets. From environmental protection to aid for people in need, social commitment is firmly anchored in the philosophy of FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft. We contribute our part and consider ourselves proactive corporate citizens. We are especially engaged in regions which are relevant to us and our business activities. For example our annual CO² emissions project aims to be a reliable partner for that particular community for years to come. Due to the CO² emissions offset-project, our headquarters in Nuremberg will be carbon neutral. This important step is our contribution to environmental protection. Following our “Code of Conduct”, we commit ourselves to act responsible towards our environment for generations to come.

The wind turbines with a hub height of 79 meters were purchased from India’s largest wind turbine manufacturer and will generate an electricity output of 2100 kW and are the first of its kind in Turkey. The initial project included the construction of 2.7 km of new transmission line to establish a connection between the project and the national grid. Being a renewable electricity project not only will there be a reduction of CO² but also of greenhouse gasses (GHG). The expected operational lifetime on this project which was initiated in 2008 is approx. 50 years. Akbük Wind Farm generates approx. 105 Gwh per annum to the Turkish national grit with an emission reduction of approx. 67.570 tons of CO² per year. The Estimated reduction in the last eight years was 472.999 tCO². Previously a project in Mali and Turkey both Gold Standards as well, were chosen for our contribution for 2013 and 2014. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2015 FAI Sustainability Report 2016 26 G4-EN21 NOx, SOx and other significant air emissions Our organization emits significant air emissions.

There is unfortunately no limitation of transport to be expected with regard to travel of the crew. The main work of the company is, however, in the field of air ambulance operations avoiding empty leg flights. We try, in terms of ambulance flight operations, to achieve a continuous fulfilment of tasks per aircraft through optimal aircraft planning. The aim is, when arriving at the destination of a patient, to enable the admission of another patient at the same destination in order to minimize the environmental and economic impacts of potential additional flights. Criteria to determine the significance of environmental effects are: On the one hand capacity utilization of ambulance aircraft with the analysis of the transport routes of the patients and on the other hand the compliance with standards during take-off and departure of all aircrafts according to the “Noise Abatement Procedures” to reduce noise pollution. Supplier Environmental Assessment G4-EN32 New suppliers screened on the basis of ecological criteria Percentage of new suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria Due to the wide scope of the supply chain and the associated complex data we are not able to estimate the impact other supplies have on the environment at this point of reporting. Our hope for the future is that all suppliers we are using will conform to the Global Compact list of requirements. Environmental Grievance Mechanisms G4-EN34 Formal grievance about environmental impacts Number of complaints about environmental impacts filed, addressed, and resolved through formal grievance mechanisms We respect and observe environmental protection requirements pursuant to legal guidelines. Our employees are trained regarding the urgency of these tasks. In our company, there is a formal complaint procedure concerning environmental impact. This is possible via an anonymous complaint box next to the human resource department. During the reporting period no formal complaints were filed.

G4-LA7 Diseases related to occupation Workers with high incidence or high risk of diseases related to their occupation There are no activities that have a high rate of disease or risk in our organization. There are no known cases of work related illnesses to report. The most common reason for sick days are the common cold/flu and stomach issues that simply happen to be viral infections passed from person to person. Vaccinations are offered to all of the FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft employees free of charge. Special insulation and special window panes make the headquarters building not susceptible to high noise levels.

FAI renta-jet Aktiengesellschaft and its employees strive for the utmost professionalism and relay on experts in their field to train our employees to our highest standards. The continuous training program, available to all employees, guarantees to FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft and its employees that all professional requirements are not only met but exceeded. The extreme difference in training hours between male and female employees can be explained with the fact that out of 93 pilots employed by FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft only 3 of them are female. Equal Remuneration for Women and Men G4-LA13 Ratio of remuneration of women to men Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men by employee category, by significant locations of operation There is no difference between the salaries and remuneration of men and women in our organization. Remuneration is, at FAI rentajet Aktiengesellschaft, not based on gender but on educational level, experience, job performance and by time and service provided to the company. Labor Practices Grievance Mechanisms G4-LA16 Grievances about labor practices Number of grievances about labor practices filed, addressed, and resolved through formal grievance mechanisms In our organization, there is an opportunity for formal complaint procedures in relation to labor practices. In the reporting period no formal complaint procedures in relation to labor practices were submitted, processed or resolved. Personnel, who seek advice or uncover grievances on labor practices, may do so by a formal complaint procedure which is integrated in our organization. This ensures the integration of labor standards. For this purpose, our staff can submit their grievances in writing and drop it into the letter box which is next to the human resources department. No incidents of non-compliance with labor standards were notified during the reporting period through our formal complaint process. Any kind of problem reported is taken seriously. Firstly the employees concerned must be given an opportunity to comment, followed by finding a solution together with all involved parties. The supervisor is consulted to search for a solution only when the staff member gives his/her explicit approval. Human resources department takes up the role of the mediator. HR (HUMAN RIGHTS) G4-DMA Disclosures on Management Approach “HR (Human Rights)” Some historically maintained that human rights standards were only applicable to the government but not the private sector. We, at FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft believe this not to be true. Human rights belong to everyone and affect all aspects of our lives. The right to be treated with dignity, respect and fairness. In the workplace human rights include, the right to a safe work environment and the right to fair and equal remuneration. Human rights obligation is particularly evident in our investment decisions and the selection of business locations. Our employees have the possibility to anonymously and confidentially communicate on violations of human rights via our Human Resource Department, which then ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2015 FAI Sustainability Report 2016 36 investigates these accusations and takes the necessary measures to counter any and all abuse.

We operate in many different markets, which are characterized by diversity. Due to our multiannual local presence in these markets we are able to perceive an overview of the population`s social situation. However, due to our international operations the support is not only important to us beyond the German. We are committed to local projects in Nuremberg as well as other projects throughout Germany. The basis of fair competition is to comply with legal standards also and especially in view of human resources. Corruption distorts competition and causes damage to the company. The corporate image is the basis for a healthy but growing corporate development and is essential for further development. Our employee’s remuneration is above the regional benchmark. The exploitation and the abuse of our staff will never be tolerated nor have they ever been part of our business philosophy. Due to the fair remuneration the susceptibility of the individual employee to corruption is minimized. Our Code of Conduct, which is published on our website (www.fai.ag) underlines our commitment to zero tolerance on corruption. Local Communities G4-SO2 Impacts on local communities Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts on local communities In our organization there are no business activities in some locations that have a significant potential to cause adverse effects on local communities and municipalities or that already have a negative effect.
