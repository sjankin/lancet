Two maturity levels have been defined to encourage emulation among sites: the Silver and Gold Awards. 15 criteria are used on four themes: energy management (including personnel awareness raising) – change in key performance indicators (KPIs) between the present and previous year – compliance with regulations – protection of the planet and initiatives 2013 2014 2015 for prevention (including the use of renewable energy). In 2016, the Award attribution criteria will be reviewed to adapt to changes in sites Automotive Electricity Consumption (MWh) and in their results.

The same applies during the launch of products that use up a lot of energy at the beginning of production to make the necessary settings. The many launches made in 2015 combined with plant openings explain the stability of ratios of energy consumption per kilo of processed material.

Responsibility of the Company The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing a management report including the CSR information required under article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code, in accordance with the CSR reporting protocol used by the Company (hereinafter the “Reporting Criteria”), a summary of which is given in the management report and is available on request from the Company’s head office. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the profession’s Code of Ethics and by the provisions of article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code. Furthermore, we have set up a quality control system that includes documented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with deontological rules, professional standards and applicable legal texts and regulations. Responsibility of the independent third-party Based on our work, our role is to: • attest that the required CSR information is disclosed in the management report or that an explanation has been provided, if any information has been omitted, in accordance with the third paragraph of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation of completeness of the CSR information); • provide limited assurance that, on the whole, the CSR information is fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the adopted Reporting Criteria (Fairness report regarding CSR information). Our work was carried out by a team of six people during a nine-week period between October 2015 and February 2016. We conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France and the legal order dated May 13, 2013 determining the methodology according to which the independent third-party body conducts its mission and, on the reasoned opinion, in accordance with ISAE 3000(2). I – Attestation of completeness of the CSR Information We got acquainted with the direction that the Group is taking, in terms of sustainability, with regard to the social and environmental consequences of the Company’s business and its societal commitments and, where appropriate, the actions or programs that stemmed from it. We compared the CSR Information presented in the management report to the list set forth in article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. In the event of omission of some consolidated information, we checked that explanations were provided in accordance with the third paragraph of the article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code. We checked that the CSR information covers the consolidated scope, which includes the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code and the companies that it controls within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, subject to the limits set forth in the methodological Note presented in the Registration Document (Chapter 3 “Sustainable Development”), which includes the management report. Based on our work, and taking into account the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR information has been disclosed in the management report. (1) The scope of which is available on the website www.cofrac.fr. (2) ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical information. 38 PLASTIC OMNIUM 2015 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT Sustainable development Independent Third-Party Report II – Fairness report with respect to CSR Information Nature and scope of procedures We conducted 20 or so interviews with those responsible for the preparation of CSR information from the departments in charge of the processed of gathering information and, where appropriate, those responsible for internal control and risk management to: • assess the appropriateness of the Reporting Criteria in terms of relevance, completeness, neutrality, clarity and reliability, by taking into consideration, when relevant, the sector’s best practices; • verify the set-up within the Group of a process to collect, compile, process and check the CSR information with regard to its completeness and consistency. We familiarized ourselves with the internal control and risk management procedures relating to the compilation of the CSR information. We determined the nature and extent of tests and controls depending on the nature and importance of CSR information in relation to the characteristics of the Company, the social and environmental issues of its operations, its strategic priorities in relation to sustainable development, and the industry best practices. Concerning the CSR information that we considered to be most significant(3): • at Group level (Human Resources Development and HSE Departments), we consulted source documents and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions); we used analytical procedures and sampling techniques for the quantitative information and verified the calculations and consolidation of the information, as well as its consistency and correspondence with the other information contained in the management report; • at the level of a representative sample of sites and departments selected(4) based on their activity, their contribution to consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify the proper application of procedures and conducted substantive tests, using sampling techniques, to verify the calculations performed and reconcile the data with the supporting documentation. The selected sites contribution to Group data equals to 24% of headcount and between 15% to 55% of the quantitative environmental information tested. Regarding the other CSR consolidated information, we assessed its fairness and consistency based on our knowledge of the Group. Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations relating to, where necessary, the omission of certain information. We deem that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have learned by exercising our professional judgment allow us to formulate a conclusion providing limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required more extensive work. Because of the use of sampling techniques, and because of other limits inherent to any information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be completely eliminated. Conclusion Based on our work, we did not identify any material misstatements that would lead us to believe that the CSR information, taken as a whole, has not been fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
