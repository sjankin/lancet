Over the past years, each one of us has seen the formidable acceleration of these changes, which have made recent societal and technological 02 megatrends — environmental protection, the extension of the life expectancy, rapid increase in the flow of data and more generally the digitalization — major levers for the transformation of man’s relationship with his environment. These developments are also changing users’ relationship with our products. 03 We are therefore convinced that new technologies, especially digital ones, significantly increase the value-in-use of our products for users. This is why we have decided to speed up our investments in this area: innovation, acquisitions, signing of strategic partnerships, and many technological alliances. 04 This positioning of Legrand, responsive to the major global developments, makes not only legitimate, but natural the Group’s social responsibility approach, initiated many years ago within our teams across the world. 05 Given that our development can only be sustainable if it respects all of our stakeholders, I am convinced that the full ability of our operations to create value results from a combination of financial and non financial performance. The purpose of this first integrated report is thus to present our strategy, our 06 governance and our performance, as well as the environment in which we operate, with a view to creating value in the short, medium and long term. Also, this first integrated report is part of a proactive approach that draws on 07 the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). Our wish is that this document, as a complement to our other publications, provides information on our Group’s capacity to fully seize opportunities in its business in a sustainable, responsible and profitable manner. 08 Gilles Schnepp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 09 T A 4 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 LEGRAND 7 CONTENTS 3 Integrated report 1.

For the year ended December 31st, 2015 04 To the Shareholders, In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Legrand SA, (the “Company”), appointed as independent third party and certified by COFRAC under number 3-1048(1), we hereby report to you on the consolidated human resources, environmental and social information for the year ended December 31st, 2015 included in the management report (hereinafter named «CSR Information»), pursuant to article L.225-102-1 of the 05 04 06 French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). RR COMPANY’S RESPONSIBILITY The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing a company’s management report including the CSR Information required by article R.225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code in accordance with the reporting protocols and guidelines used by the Company (hereinafter the «Guidelines»), summarised in the management report and available on request from the Sustainable Development & Strategic Processes Team. 07 RR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) of our profession and the requirements 08 of article L.822-11 of the French Commercial Code.

Our work involved six persons and was conducted between November 2015 and March 2016 during a fourteen-week period. We were assisted in our work by our sustainability experts.

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 LEGRAND 125 04 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Statutory Auditors’ report 7 CONTENTS 3 1. Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work On the basis of interviews with the individuals in charge of the relevant departments, we obtained an understanding of the Company’s 01 sustainability strategy regarding human resources and environmental impacts of its activities and its social commitments and, where applicable, any actions or programmes arising from them. We compared the CSR Information presented in the management report with the list provided in article R.225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. 02 For any consolidated information that is not disclosed, we verified that explanations were provided in accordance with article R.225-105, paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code. We verified that the CSR Information covers the scope of consolidation, i.e., the Company, its subsidiaries as defined by article L.233-1 and 03 the controlled entities as defined by article L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the methodological elements presented in the management report. Conclusion 04 Based on the work performed and given the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. 2. Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information 05 Nature and scope of our work We conducted around thirty interviews with the persons responsible for preparing the CSR Information in the departments in charge of collecting the information and, where appropriate, responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to: 06 WWassess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, and taking into account industry best practices where appropriate; WWverify the implementation of data-collection, compilation, processing and control process to reach completeness and consistency of 07 the CSR Information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the human resources and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainability strategy and 08 industry best practices. Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important (presented in Appendix 1): WWat parent entity and sites level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information 09 (organisation, policies, actions), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with the other information in the management report; T WWat the level of a representative sample of entities and sites selected by us (presented in Appendix 2) on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied, and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents on average 33% of headcount and between 17% and 32% of quantitative environmental data. A For the remaining consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the company. We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part. We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgement, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated. Conclusion Based on the work performed, no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines. 126 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 LEGRAND 7 CONTENTS 3 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Statutory Auditors’ report 3.

We consider that this work allows us to express a limited assurance conclusion on the 2015 achievement rates of the 2014-2018 Roadmap. 02 Conclusion Based on the work performed, no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 2015 achievement rates of the 2014-2018 Roadmap, taken as a whole, are not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines. 03 Neuilly-sur-Seine, March 17 2016 One of the Statutory Auditors, 04 Deloitte & Associés Jean-Marc Lumet Olivier Jan Partner Partner, Sustainability Services 05 04 06 07 08 09 T A REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 LEGRAND 127 04 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Statutory Auditors’ report 7 CONTENTS 3 Appendix 1 The CSR Information that we considered to be the most important, Quantitative environmental information 01 on which we conducted detailed tests, are the following: WWWater consumption (m3) Important information WWDirect and indirect energy consumption (GWh) WWQuantitative health and safety information WWTotal CO2 emissions for scopes 1 and 2 of the carbon assessment 02 WWFrequency of workplace accidents leading to absence (t of C02 equivalent) WWSeverity of workplace accidents WWVolatile Organic Compounds (VOC) (metric t) WWNumber of recognized work-related illnesses WWWaste produced (metric t) 03 Other quantitative social information WWWaste recovered (%) WWTotal registered workforce on 31/12/2015 Quantitative societal information WWHirings (Share of open-ended contracts in hiring of employees WWThe total budget allocated to charitable activities in monetary 04 on open-ended and fixed-term contracts) or material donations in 2015 WWDepartures (of which resignations, retirements and other Qualitative information departures) WWOccupational health and safety conditions 05 WWNumber of training hours per employee (Worldwide) WWUnion representation and social dialogue WWPercentage of the Group’s workforce receiving training during WWRaw materials consumption and resource efficiency the year WWGreenhouse gas emissions (scope 3) 06 WWAbsenteeism (all job categories) WWClimate change and mitigation strategy WWResponsible purchasing policy, supplier relations WWData protection 07 WWThreats to Human Rights mapping 08 Appendix 2 09 The sample of selected entities and sites is presented below: Other quantitative social information Quantitative health and safety information: Firelec (Russia), Kontaktor (Russia), Diadema SMS (Brazil), Firelec (Russia), Kontaktor (Russia), Diadema SMS (Brazil), Haridwar IndoAsian (India), Murthal IndoAsian (India), France, T Italy Haridwar IndoAsian (India), Murthal IndoAsian (India), Limousin (France), BTicino (Italy) Quantitative environmental information: Firelec (Russia), Kontaktor (Russia), Diadema SMS (Brazil), A Haridwar IndoAsian (India), Murthal IndoAsian (India), Varese (Italy), Magré 123 (France) 128 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 LEGRAND 7 CONTENTS 3 01 05 IDENTITÉ MANAGEMENT DES PERSONNES REPORT ON RESPONSABLES THE CONSOLIDATED DU DOCUMENT FINANCIAL 01 DE RÉFÉRENCE STATEMENTS FORETTHE DU FINANCIAL CONTRÔLE 02 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER DES COMPTES 31, 2015 5.1 PRELIMINARY DISCLAIMER 130 03 5.2 2015 HIGHLIGHTS 130 5.3 OPERATING INCOME 131 04 5.3.1 Introduction 131 5.3.2 Factors affecting Group results 131 5.4 YEAR-ON-YEAR COMPARISON: 2015 AND 2014 135 05 5.4.1 Net sales 136 5.4.2 Cost of sales 137 5.4.3 Administrative and selling expense 137 06 5.4.4 Research and development expense 137 5.4.5 Other operating income and expense 138 5.4.6 5.4.7 Operating income Adjusted operating income 138 139 07 5.4.8 Net financial expense 139 5.4.9 Exchange gains and losses 139 5.4.10 Income taxes 139 08 5.4.11 Net income 140 5.5 CASH FLOWS AND BORROWING 140 5.5.1 Cash flows 140 09 5.5.2 Debt 141 5.6 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE 141 5.7 OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS 142 T 5.8 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 142 5.9 VARIATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES 142 A 5.10 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES RELATING TO FINANCIAL RISKS 143 5.11 SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 144 5.12 NEW IFRS PRONOUNCEMENTS 144 5.13 TRENDS AND PROSPECTS 144 5.14 TABLE OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS 145 5.15 SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 145 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 LEGRAND 129 05 7 CONTENTS 3 Management report on the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2015 Preliminary disclaimer 5.1 PRELIMINARY DISCLAIMER 01 This selected financial data of the Company should be read includes forward-looking statements based on estimates relating together with the consolidated financial statements and their to the future activity of Legrand, which may differ materially from related notes in chapter 8 of this Registration Document.

OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the 07 audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 08 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. 09 RR II.

We have reviewed the methods by which the impairment tests are performed as well as the projected cash flow and A assumptions used for these impairment tests and verified that information disclosed in notes 3.1 and 3.2 of the consolidated financial statements is appropriate. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 07 financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of financial position of the Company as at 08 December 31, 2015 and the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.
