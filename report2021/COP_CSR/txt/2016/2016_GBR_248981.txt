28/06/2016 UN Global Compact 2016 ­ British Land UN Global Compact 2016 We have been a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2009, and continue to support its principles through our sustainability programme. We continue to advance the ten UN Global Compact Principles on human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti­corruption across our sphere of influence. We do so through our sustainability programme, which is at the heart of our business strategy. Close all The Ten UN Global Compact Principles Human rights 1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and 2. Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labour 3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; 4. The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; http://www.britishland.com/sustainability/targets­and­performance/un­global­compact­2016.aspx 1/7 28/06/2016 UN Global Compact 2016 ­ British Land 5. The effective abolition of child labour; and 6. The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Environment 7. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; 8. Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and 9. Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Anti­corruption 10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Statement of Continued Support By Lucinda Bell, Chief Financial Officer at British Land We continue to advance the UN Global Compact core values on human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti­corruption across our sphere of influence. We do so through our sustainability strategy, which is integrated into our placemaking strategy, governance and business operations. Our sustainability strategy Wellbeing: creating places that nurture wellbeing and productivity. Community: building trust by supporting successful local communities. Future proofing: generating cost efficiency and income from future­proofed assets. Skills and opportunity: helping local people and businesses grow. Our sustainability strategy continues to help us address major trends, including a changing environment, technology transforming the way people work, shop and live, and growing expectations that governments should use policy to promote sustainable and ethical practices. This year, COP 21 Paris 2015 marked a milestone in recognition of climate change as a global issue, with 195 countries agreeing to keep global warming below 2˚C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5˚C. Our performance http://www.britishland.com/sustainability/targets­and­performance/un­global­compact­2016.aspx 2/7 28/06/2016 UN Global Compact 2016 ­ British Land In the first year of our 2020 sustainability strategy, I am delighted at the strong progress on our targets, thanks to the efforts of people across our entire business and supply chain. Achievements include: 1/3 of electricity in common areas at St Stephen’s, Hull, now comes from photovoltaic panels installed this year – generating income and cutting carbon. 29,500 people benefited from our community programme, including apprentices, jobseekers and schoolchildren. World’s first BREEAM Outstanding Fit Out achieved by Broadgate Estates at The Hub, Paddington Central, helping attract and retain the best talent. £30.4 million invested in public realm improvements, with wellbeing innovations embedded, including community artworks, trees, lighting, walkways and children’s play areas. 120 apprentices supported at our properties and developments by us and our suppliers, helping create the skilled workforce needed for the future. 2016 Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Sustainable Development for continuous achievement over five years, bringing major economic, social and environmental benefits to the UK. Key challenges in the year included gathering robust, comprehensive data for some of our new focus areas. We continue to work with occupiers and partners on meaningful measures for wellbeing and productivity in offices. We are also piloting surveys to measure community trust at our places, as well as how engaged and understood local communities feel. Whilst we achieved some great results on local procurement in the year, notably on our Meadowhall refurbishment, it remains challenging to deliver consistently strong performance across our portfolio. We continue to work with our property teams and development partners to support local procurement, fuelling regional economies where we operate. I am excited about what we can achieve over the next five years, as we further integrate sustainability through placemaking. Sustainability is a powerful tool to deliver lasting value and positive outcomes for us and our stakeholders, creating Places People Prefer.
