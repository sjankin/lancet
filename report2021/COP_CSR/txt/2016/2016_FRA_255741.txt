Presentation of the Global Compact Launched in July 2000 by the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Global Compact calls on businesses to voluntarily commit to implementing ten universally recognized principles. By monitoring respect for these ten principles that lay the foundation for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), the Global Compact promotes a more stable and inclusive global economy benefiting individuals, local communities and the markets. The Compact takes into account the societal, political and economic challenges affecting businesses worldwide. It calls on businesses that, like bioMérieux, recognize the need to collaborate with governments, civil society, workers, trade unions and the United Nations. Through the involvement of business leaders, the Global Compact provides a practical framework for the development, implementation and diffusion of CSR strategies. By joining the Global Compact, bioMérieux and other companies like it have responded positively to the call from the United Nations, making a commitment to embed the ten principles into their strategy, to progress each year in integrating these principles, and to communicate annually about their good practices in the following document. The Global Compact in figures in 2015: 8,400 businesses in more than 160 countries 4,500 organizations (associations, universities, trade unions, etc.) More than 1,000 business and 100 non-profit organizations in France 4 2. The ten principles of the Global Compact Principles related to human rights 1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. 2. Businesses should make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Principles related to labour 3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. 4. Businesses should contribute to the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. 5. Businesses should contribute to the effective abolition of child labour. 6. Businesses should contribute to the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Principles related to the environment 7. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. 8. Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. 9. Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Principle related to anti-corruption 10. Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 5 3. Presentation of bioMérieux bioMérieux’s responsibility as a corporate citizen is closely tied to the very nature of its business. Each day, across the globe, the quality of its diagnostic tests makes it possible for patients to receive care under the best conditions while consumers’ health is protected by ensuring the microbiological quality of food and pharmaceutical products. A world leader in the field of in vitro diagnostics for 50 years, bioMérieux is present in more than 150 countries through 42 subsidiaries and a large network of distributors. bioMérieux provides diagnostic solutions (reagents, instruments, software), which determine the source of disease and contamination to improve patient health and ensure consumer safety. Its products are used for diagnosing infectious diseases and providing high medical value results for cancer screening and monitoring and cardiovascular emergencies. They are also used for detecting microorganisms in agri-food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. Key figures: 9,375 employees at the end of 2015 net sales of €1.965 billion in 2015, with 90% of sales outside of France present in more than 150 countries 6 4. Principles related to human rights Principle 1: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to supporting and respecting the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to making sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 4.1. Policy and objective As a global public health player, bioMérieux places the patient and, more broadly, people, at the center of its actions. In accordance with Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and mindful of its social responsibility, the Company conducts initiatives to promote access to quality diagnostics for the most disadvantaged patients. 4.2. Implementation 4.2.1. Promoting access to diagnostics By supporting the work of the Mérieux Foundations The Fondation Mérieux and the Fondation Christophe and Rodolphe Mérieux, two independent family foundations, fight infectious diseases affecting developing countries by helping them improve their clinical laboratory capabilities. Through the support of bioMérieux and other partners, the Mérieux Foundations successfully carried out a number of initiatives:  The foundations are active today in 9 countries: Haiti, Mali, Madagascar, Lebanon, Tajikistan, China, Laos, Cambodia and Bangladesh. Projects are underway in Brazil, Iran and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Nine laboratories of excellence, the Rodolphe Mérieux Laboratories, have been created. These labs are dedicated to training biologists, diagnosing diseases specific to these countries and conducting applied research. A number of hospital laboratories have also been renovated and their personnel have been trained.  Through the Christophe Mérieux Prize, worth €500,000, the Fondation Christophe and Rodolphe Mérieux encourages research in developing countries. Since it was created in 2007, this prize has been awarded to nine scientists who work at the grassroots level to combat diseases devastating their countries. Beyond supporting local biological capacity building, the foundations also seek to protect the most vulnerable individuals, in particular mothers and children. 7 By taking part in the fight against epidemics Ebola Since March 2014, the Ebola virus has been at the center of international attention. In response to this threat, bioMérieux designed the FilmArray® clinical test for the detection of the Ebola virus (FilmArray® BioThreat-E test). It was the first commercial test to receive fasttrack authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. MERS CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) In 2015, the Company convened an in-house team called “DO-IT” (Diagnostic Outbreak Intervention Team), which is in charge of evaluating the needs of healthcare professionals facing an epidemic, deciding what action the Company should take and if necessary, accelerating the development of appropriate diagnostic tests. By organizing training and awareness initiatives When it comes to the different techniques and technologies used for in vitro diagnostics of infectious diseases, bioMérieux is committed to building awareness and providing training for doctors, nurses and laboratory technicians, as well as hospital administrators. Since 2013, the Company has been collaborating with the association Santé En Entreprise (SEE), which is active in France, Africa and the Caribbean region to develop public health programs that benefit employees, their families and their communities. By designing tailored solutions for resource-limited countries bioMérieux carries out Research & Development programs with the aim of building an innovative offering of diagnostic tests to meet the needs of resource-limited countries. Studies are underway to develop solutions adapted to the specific constraints of isolated and vulnerable communities that have inadequate access to health infrastructure. These projects aim to provide low-cost, quality diagnostic tests that are extremely simple to use and do not require specialized equipment or electricity. Several patents have been filed based on this research. 4.2.2. Combatting bacterial resistance The leading international organizations have recognized that antimicrobial resistance is one of the foremost public health challenges of the 21st century. Combatting bacterial resistance is one of bioMérieux’s priorities, and constitutes the core of its expertise. To respond to this widespread, serious global threat that affects people and animals and the environment, coordinated action in the fields of human and animal medicine is necessary. 8 Targeted awareness initiatives In 2015, bioMérieux stepped up initiatives to increase awareness about the proper use of antibiotics, in particular among the Company’s customers. An awareness campaign was launched in the United States among bioMérieux employees and health professionals in the medical and veterinary fields. In addition, two webinars dedicated to antimicrobial resistance in human and animal health were made available with free access via the Internet. Critical Path to TB Drugs Regimen In 2015, bioMérieux continued to be involved in the international consortium “Critical Path to TB Drugs Regimen” (CPTR), which aims to develop tools for the management of resistant and multidrug resistant forms of tuberculosis. 4.2.3. Protecting maternal and infant health in Africa A dedicated program bioMérieux launched a program to promote maternal and infant health in Africa in 2015 in line with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. The program focuses on four types of diseases that especially affect young children and their mothers: respiratory infections, diarrhea, sepsis and meningitis. It provides for practical initiatives concerning education and training for healthcare professionals, innovation, access to diagnostics and partnerships. Clinical field studies The BioFire Gastro-Intestinal FilmArray® Panel was also the focus of two clinical studies in Africa in 2015, concerning diagnostics of acute diarrhea among children suffering from malnutrition: In Chad, bioMérieux launched a study in 2015, along with the NGO ALIMA, on the causes of acute, persistent infectious diarrhea in children suffering from severe malnutrition with the aim of improving the care they receive. The ambition of this study is to describe seasonal variations in the prevalence of three enteric pathogens in these children. A partnership was forged between bioMérieux and McMaster University (Canada) to conduct a clinical study in Botswana, which also focuses on optimizing care for young children suffering from acute diarrheal disease. 9 4.3. Measurement of outcomes in 2015 4.3.1. Promoting access to diagnostics In 2015, the Company’s total contributions to corporate sponsorship funding amounted to €2.659 million, of which €1.798 million for the Fondation Mérieux and the Fondation Christophe et Rodolphe Mérieux. In 2015, two additional Rodolphe Mérieux laboratories were opened in Chittagong (Bangladesh) and Rio Branco (Brazil). They will be inaugurated in 2016. In 2015, the Christophe Mérieux Prize was awarded to Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, Director of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, for his research on the Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Virus. In 2015, the Foundations’ support made it possible to build housing and a school for 250 refugee families in Erbil (Iraqi Kurdistan). Through the partnership with Santé En Entreprise (SEE), mobile units were set up for HIV testing and training was provided for healthcare staff in company medical centers in Africa. In 2015, this initiative was expanded to include hepatitis screening in France as well as training for healthcare staff to carry out the screening. In February 2015, the FilmArray® BioThreat-E test™ for the detection of Ebola virus receive the Global New Product Innovation Award from Frost & Sullivan. In September 2015, this test was also subject to an emergency use procedure so that it would be eligible for World Health Organization (WHO) procurement in countries affected by the epidemic. In Conakry, Guinea, within the scope of a partnership with the Donka Hospital (which houses the treatment center of the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, a reference center for arboviruses and viral hemorrhagic fevers), bioMérieux supported a clinical study on the FilmArray® BioThreat-E for the detection of Ebola virus. In 2015 the Company launched the ARGENE MERS-HCoV r-gene® test, a new RUO (research use only) kit for laboratories working to develop a diagnostic tool for the emerging coronavirus MERS CoV. Opening date of a Center of Excellence in Brazil dedicated to neglected tropical diseases and emerging pathogens. In 2015, for its NucliSENS® HIV product range, bioMérieux was selected by the Global Fund from among 7 diagnostic companies as part of a new approach for the monitoring 10 of viral load in patients living with HIV. The agreement, covering a period of three years, aims to reduce costs in order to facilitate access to diagnostics in resource-limited countries. 4.3.2. Combatting antimicrobial resistance In June 2015, bioMérieux organized the fifth World HAI/Resistance Forum, which took as its theme “One World, One Fight!” During this event devoted to combatting antimicrobial resistance, bioMérieux made a commitment to support the implementation of training tools that are easily accessible and tailored to different types of users, also making it possible to monitor progress. Several examples of training campaigns conducted by experts taking part in the World HAI/Resistance Forum demonstrate the effectiveness and the importance of initiatives of this type, developed globally and adapted locally. In 2014 and 2015, bioMérieux was the sole sponsor of the Global Point Prevalence Survey, a study of unprecedented scope to assess the use of antibiotics and the scope of resistance phenomena in hospital settings. Conducted in 53 countries, this survey was coordinated by Professor Herman Goossens of the University of Antwerp (Belgium). bioMérieux was invited to participate as an expert in a forum hosted by the White House in June 2015 at the initiative of President Obama to address the responsible use of antibiotics. The forum was organized to determine the changes that must be enacted to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria, avoid their transmission and ensure that antibiotics remain efficacious. A campaign about the proper use of antibiotics was organized for the Company’s customers in Indonesia. Eleven sessions featuring workshops and round tables were led by experts from bioMérieux. The “My Role Matters” campaign – launched in the United States among bioMérieux employees and health professionals working in the medical and veterinary fields – collected 537 signatures between Spring 2015 and late November 2015. Educational presentations organized in seven U.S. states were attended by more than 200 participants, primarily laboratory personnel. Two webinars dedicated to antimicrobial resistance in human and animal health were made available with free access via the Internet as part of World Antibiotic Awareness Week in November 2015. 11 4.3.3. Protecting maternal and infant health in Africa Launch of a program dedicated to maternal and infant health in Africa, focused on 4 target diseases. The hiring process has been initiated in Africa to support these initiatives. Donation of two FilmArray® systems to conduct a clinical study of the FilmArray® BioThreat-E test for the detection of the Ebola virus. bioMérieux provided, at no cost, FilmArray ® Gastro-Intestinal Panel tests to the ChadChina Friendship Hospital in N’Djamena. These tests were needed to conduct a study launched with the NGO ALIMA about the causes of acute, persistent infectious diarrhea in children suffering from severe malnutrition. bioMérieux donated a FilmArray® system and FilmArray® Gastro-Intestinal panels to conduct a clinical study in Botswana on optimizing care for young children suffering from acute diarrheal disease. 12 5. Principles related to labour Principle 3: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to upholding the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to contributing to the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to contributing to the effective abolition of child labour. Principle 6: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to contributing to the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 5.1. Policy and objective “Give priority to employees” captures the bioMérieux spirit, a philosophy that is closely tied to the very mission of the Company, which is to serve public health. It is also a tradition rooted in the history and the entrepreneurial spirit conveyed by the Mérieux family. Year after year, this mindset inspires labour policies focused on the talents of our workforce as bioMérieux’s most valuable asset. 5.2. Implementation 5.2.1. Maintaining social dialogue The Company has a tradition of open and meaningful social dialogue, which is primarily focused on two central works councils, one for France and one for Europe. In 2015, several company-wide agreements were signed in France:  On the status of employee representatives;  On adapting opening hours for customer service offices while respecting the work-life balance of impacted employees;  On electronic voting in elections for works councils and employee representatives and on pre-electoral protocols concerning the Company’s five French entities;  On the constitution and the composition of the Central Works Council following elections. 5.2.2. Investing in training Mérieux University The Group’s dynamic training policy addresses several objectives. It is designed to adapt to a changing professional environment, enhance a culture of performance within the Company, 13 and allow managers and their employees to develop new skills while also recognizing and promoting talent. As a pillar of this strategy, Mérieux University is open to all employees of the companies that are part of Institut Mérieux, which founded the university in 2012. Mérieux University ensures the transmission of a strong, specific entrepreneurial culture and helps build bridges within the Group. It is organized around four regional hubs based in France, the United States, China and Brazil. Opening new fields of competency Through the Targeted Auditors Program (TAP), each year around ten employees from different sectors undergo training in audit techniques. With the support of internal audit teams, these talented individuals discover new areas of competency by conducting audits of Group subsidiaries and functions. Fostering talent Several programs have been introduced in recent years to identify talented employees and offer them career development opportunities within the Company. Each year, for one week, the “Fit for the Future” program brings together some 20 highpotential executives from the different subsidiaries that make up the Institut Mérieux Group. This stimulating seminar combines training workshops, experience sharing, brainstorming and working in groups to develop recommendations for the Management Committee. 5.2.3. Promoting gender equality day to day With women representing 55% of the bioMérieux workforce in France, nearly 50% worldwide, and nearly 50% of managers, the Company devotes considerable attention to gender equality. Similarly, the number of women in leadership positions is also progressing and today women account for 25% of the Company's Global Leaders. This is the focus of the inhouse network WOmen Ready for Leadership Diversity” (WoRLD), created in 2013 to foster the development of women's careers. The priorities established by the WoRLD program are intended to: develop women’s careers, build awareness among teams and adapt talent management processes, remain open to good practices applied in other companies. In addition, bioMérieux participates in the French national business network “Alliance pour la Mixité en Entreprise” (AME) to encourage women’s access to leadership roles. 14 5.2.4. Supporting work-life balance A program to support work-life balance has continued with the implementation of tools so that employees may work from home, which facilitates flexibility in organizing working time for the benefit of men as well as women employees. The gender equality agreements, renegotiated every three years, also help to improve worklife balance. Special attention is given to pregnant women, who receive paid leave every other Wednesday immediately after declaring their pregnancy and every Wednesday starting from the sixth month of pregnancy. They are also provided with the tools needed to work from home. Moreover, optional part-time work has grown in popularity. 5.2.5. Formalizing an active disability policy As part of initiatives since 2008 aiming to improve the integration of employees with disabilities into the workforce, awareness-raising days were held in 2015 at the Company's French sites. 5.2.6. Efforts to ensure health and safety in the workplace A structured and formalized HSE approach The year 2015 was devoted to improving the structure of the Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) approach, which concerns health and safety in the workplace as well as respect for the environment: defining rules and monitoring indicators, providing training, and structuring processes. Managers are empowered and accountable for the implementation of prevention programs that fall within the scope of their responsibility. Lastly, thanks to an internal participatory tool, each individual employee may point out improvements to make in order to improve safety. The Company has chosen to organize its Health, Safety and Environment approach on the principle of continuous improvement. It is based on the ISO OHSAS 18001 standard regarding health and safety in the workplace. Giving priority to prevention A number of programs to prevent risk and improve health and safety conditions in the workplace were deployed in 2015 across the Group’s entities worldwide. Priority topics included: working at heights or alone, ergonomics and handling materials, machinery and equipment safety, fire prevention, noise reduction and setting up emergency intervention units. At the North American sites, the Company rolled out a pilot access to healthcare and education program for employees and their families. 15 5.3. Measurement of outcomes in 2015 5.3.1. Maintaining social dialogue Company-wide agreements were signed in France, in particular regarding the status of employee representatives and the adaptation of customer service opening hours to respect the work-life balance of impacted employees. Introduction of an individual annual statement to be sent to each employee summarizing the compensation and benefits the employee has received. 1,726 new hires (fixed-term + permanent contracts), including 439 jobs created in 2015: 36% of vacancies were filled internally and 8.5% of vacancies were filled by hiring temporary employees. 5.3.2. Investing in training In 2015, the average number of hours of training per employee amounted to 24 hours in France, 43 hours in China, and 20 hours on average worldwide. Devoted to managers, the Mérieux Manager Essentials program provided 16,948 hours of training in 2015. In 2015, 33 newly-hired managers attended New Leader Induction, a program to develop a common managerial culture. In 2015, 80 teams took part in programs on change management and processes to optimize collaboration, which were taught by in-house coaches. For the 2nd year, 20 bioMérieux employees took part in the “Fit For the Future” program designed for talented individuals from the different companies within the Institut Mérieux Group. 5.3.3. Promoting gender equality day to day 48% of the Company’s total workforce are women and 48% of managers are women. 55% of employees in France (where Company headquarters are located) are women. 16 5.3.4. Formalizing an active disability policy The percentage of jobs held by employees with disabilities reached 4.4% in France and 4% in North America. Three Handibio days were held in 2015 at the Company's French sites to raise employee awareness about disability. 5.3.5. Efforts to ensure health and safety in the workplace 5 sites in France and Spain have received OHSAS 18001 (health and safety in the workplace) certification At the North American sites, specific days devoted to health are organized so that employees may receive medical check-ups, early screening, and medical and nutrition advice. A medical center for employees and their families was created in 2015 at the St. Louis, Missouri, site in the United States. 17 6. Principles related to the environment Principle 7: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 6.1. Policy and objective bioMérieux is committed to reducing the environmental impact of the Company’s activities. The initiatives undertaken within the scope of our environmental policy are based on reducing consumption and using resources and energy responsibly. These initiatives are cascaded across the Company’s various sites and subsidiaries through a network of 50 Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) correspondents. 6.2. Implementation 6.2.1. Controlling wastewater discharge Wastewater is monitored and tested on a regular basis at the Company’s main production sites. In 2015, processes to separate rainwater and wastewater effluents were improved at several sites. 6.2.2. Optimizing waste management To optimize the management of waste generated by their activities, all sites have created storage areas. Schemes for sorting waste at the source and developing recycling options are gradually being adopted across our sites, with the aim of increasing the portion of recycled, composted, regenerated and incinerated waste with energy recovery. bioMérieux sites at Marcy l'Étoile, Grenoble, La Balme and Saint-Vulbas (France) and Durham (United States), as well as the UK and German subsidiaries, have become “zerolandfill sites,” meaning that all waste produced at the site is recycled, reused or transformed into energy. The management of hazardous waste is governed by a rigorous policy based on sorting at the source and elimination by approved contractors in appropriate treatment facilities. 18 6.2.3. Ensuring the sustainable use of resources Water Water is used by bioMérieux in formulating its products as well as in refrigerating facilities and controlled-atmosphere areas. When using water for these different purposes, the Company gives preference to closed circuit systems and seeks to replace open cooling circuits: cooling towers, open loop cooling systems, etc. For water consumed during manufacturing, the Company does not extract the water directly from the natural environment except for the cooling requirements of its logistics platform in Saint-Vulbas (France). Water extracted locally from the groundwater is returned after heat exchange, and has no direct contact with contaminants. Raw materials Since 2011, the implementation of the Six Sigma method in manufacturing operations has led to a reduction in the variability of production processes and a decrease in raw material losses, while complying with the Company’s quality standards. Paper Efforts to reduce paper consumption across the Company include incentives to adopt greener printing practices. We are implementing a new printing solution to better manage paper consumption. At the same time, the use of recycled paper is increasingly widespread. Since 2010, electronic document management has made it possible to replace paper documents with documents in the electronic format. Printed product instruction leaflets are gradually being replaced with electronic instructions, which can be downloaded from the Company’s on-line technical library. 6.2.4. Reducing energy consumption Prior to the construction and renovation of buildings, preliminary simulations are performed to assess the energy efficiency of lighting, heating, ventilation and climate control. Low or very low levels of energy consumption are targeted by adopting LED lighting systems. bioMérieux sites undergo energy audits conducted by independent, certified auditing firms. 19 6.2.5. Optimizing the Group’s carbon footprint Carbon assessment The Group is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2013, we have conducted an annual assessment of our carbon footprint. The emissions that are taken into account correspond to direct and indirect emissions as defined by the 2014 Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Business travel The Company continues to pursue initiatives in connection with deliveries to customers, business travel and employee commuting as a way to further reduce bioMérieux’s carbon footprint. To limit business travel, telepresence equipment has been installed at bioMérieux sites (a total of 12 sites are now equipped). Remote maintenance and software updates With the VILINK™ IT solution, bioMérieux customers have access to remote interventions for incident resolution as well as maintenance operations and software updates. The VILINK™ solution helps limit travel by engineers working in the field, and at the same time contributes to faster customer service. Contributing to the Greater Lyon Energy Climate Plan Two of the Company’s largest production sites are located in the Lyon (France) area. By joining the Greater Lyon Energy Climate Plan in 2013, bioMérieux committed to work towards the goal of reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in this region by 20%. To support this objective, the Company subsidizes employees who use public transport, encourages carpooling and develops a work from home policy. 6.2.6. Training In addition to specific environmental training for all new employees, several training initiatives focus on environmental protection. In preparation for ISO 14001 certification, we provide training programs at our sites to address different topics: raising awareness of environmental impacts and good prevention practices, internal environmental audits, etc. Similarly, as part of projects to reduce waste from manufacturing operations and limit energy consumption in line with the Six Sigma method, production and packaging operators receive environmental training. 20 6.3. Measurement of outcomes in 2015 6.3.1. Controlling wastewater discharge In 2015, processes to separate rainwater and wastewater effluents were improved at several sites: Marcy and Craponne, France; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Florence, Italy. These sites invested in facilities for the pre-treatment of wastewater prior to its release into the system feeding local treatment plants. 6.3.2. Optimizing waste management A project to reduce manufacturing waste was undertaken at the Shanghai (-25%) and Durham plants. 22% decrease in the volume of waste in relation to 2015 sales. 6.3.3. Ensuring the sustainable use of resources 4% reduction in water consumption in relation to 2015 sales. 100% of the electricity purchased by the Austrian, Brazilian and Canadian subsidiaries is hydroelectricity, and this figure reached 90% for the Colombian subsidiary. 6.3.4. Reducing energy consumption 7% decrease in total energy consumption in relation to global sales between 2013 and 2015, compared to 4% between 2012 and 2014. Independent certified auditing firms conduct energy audits of bioMérieux sites. In 2015, this approach concerned the French sites of Marcy l'Étoile, Craponne, La Balme, and Combourg, as well as the Florence (Italy) site and our German subsidiary and it led to the drafting of action plans to decrease energy consumption. 7 sites and subsidiaries had received ISO 14001 certification by late 2015: Marcy l'Étoile, Craponne, La Balme and Saint-Vulbas (France), Tres Cantos and Madrid (Spain), Basingstoke (UK). Campus de l’Étoile, a new facility being built at Marcy l’Étoile (France) complies with the criteria for BREEAM1 certification, having obtained a “very good” rating. Insulation work was carried out at the Verniolle and Saint-Vulbas (France) sites. 1 A sustainability assessment method developed by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in the UK. 21 LED lighting systems were adopted in Craponne (France), Tres Cantos (Spain), Florence (Italy) and in St. Louis and Salt Lake City (United States) in 2015.

Principle related to anti-corruption Principle 10: bioMérieux and its employees are committed to working against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 7.1. Policy and objective bioMérieux operates within a framework of principles, policies and procedures that reflect the highest ethical standards. The Company is committed to ethical conduct in its business activities in compliance with applicable laws and expects its partners to respect these laws and principles. 7.2. Implementation 7.2.1. Providing training on ethics and compliance In 2015, the Ethics and Compliance training program was strengthened. Through training, the Company ensures employees are aware of in-house international rules and procedures so they can perform their jobs with respect for applicable laws and regulations as well as the Company’s values and culture. In 2015, the key priorities of the Program remained: stepping up anticorruption measures; safeguarding the distribution network; conflicts of interest with healthcare professionals; rules concerning exports; the protection of patient data. The Company has established reference documents for all employees and for its suppliers: the Global Code of Conduct, Corruption Prevention Manuel, Conflict of Interest Policy, Responsible Purchasing Charter, Principles of Business Conduct for Third Parties, etc. The Company’s Global Code of Conduct, which was established in 2009, is central to this program. It was updated in 2012 and translated into six languages. In addition, outside partners are made aware of the Code, and the Group requests that they comply with the principles of business ethics. In 2015, remote training about the rules of business ethics addressed the Global Code of Conduct as well as managing conflicts of interest and fighting corruption, in particular. To complement these offerings, a program about the protection of patient data was established in 2013 based on regulations concerning security requirements applicable to patient data. 23 7.2.2. Establishing alert systems For ethics questions, a dedicated contact person is available by email or telephone. This role was created within the Company and rolled out in most countries where the Group operates. In the Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas Regions, employees are thus able to contact Compliance Officers, who can answer their questions and process reports. The Company's Ethics and Compliance policy is part of a global risk management approach. 7.2.3. Acting to fight corruption In addition to the Group's Code of Conduct, the Company has compiled an anti-corruption manual that informs employees of their responsibilities. Training and communication programs are also provided to employees who work with government representatives, intermediaries and other players in the healthcare market. 7.3. Measurement of outcomes in 2015 In 2015, 10,893 hours of training were provided as part of the Ethics and Compliance training program, compared to 7,473 in 2014. In 2015, all employees as well as new hires received remote training on the rules of business ethics. The Company renewed its communication campaign about the Global Code of Conduct in 2015. As part of the program to raise awareness about protecting patient data, employees who may have access to this type of data also took an online course on this topic. In 2015, the Company organized specific initiatives targeting raw materials suppliers to ensure compliance with the European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of CHemicals) regulation and to anticipate any additional obligations. 24
