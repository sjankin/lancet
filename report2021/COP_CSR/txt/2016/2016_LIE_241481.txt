UN Global Compact LGT progress report for 2015 June 2016 How we implement the ten principles of the UN Global Compact Human rights Principle 1: Recognition and compliance with human rights set out at international level Principle 2: Ensure non-complicity with violations of human rights LGT complies with the applicable social legislation at all its locations worldwide and makes a positive contribution to the welfare of the community in the countries in which the Group operates. In its core business, LGT exclude companies associated with human rights violations from LGT Sustainable Investing products. All LGT employees attend regular training on the LGT Code of Conduct. This defines the minimum standards for ethical and professional conduct. These standards must be complied with even if local requirements go less far. Local laws take precedence if they are more stringent. LGT’s suppliers have been required to sign a supplier agreement since 2013. The agreements contain environmental, sustainability and social standards, but also require compliance with human rights and labor principles defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Under the supplier agreement, suppliers agree to impose the same provisions on their own suppliers. LGT has regular meetings with suppliers to review compliance. LGT held its third Supplier Day in 2015. The event included presentations on suppliers’ social and environmental responsibilities, and on the principles of the UN Global Compact. Labor standards Principle 3: Freedom of association and recognition of the right to collective negotiations LGT’s employees are not subject to collective bargaining agreements. They have the right to organize themselves collectively. There is an employee representation committee in Liechtenstein, where about two-thirds of its employees work. The committee consists of five members, who are elected once every three years by all LGT employees in Liechtenstein. The last election took place in November 2013. In 2015, LGT was not fined or found guilty in any legal proceedings relating to labor standards. Principle 4: Elimination of all forms of forced labor Principle 5: Abolition of child labor LGT does not tolerate forced or child labor in any form. It only operates in countries that prohibit such practices. In signing the supplier agreement, suppliers undertake not to allow forced or child labor. They specifically agree not to employ any children. The agreement complies with the International Labour Organization standards, notably on the minimum working age. In the core business, LGT’s Sustainable Investing products exclude any companies with links to forced or child labor. LGT was awarded highly commended for sustainable investing in the Global Private Banking Awards 2015 run by Professional Wealth Magazine – part of the Financial Times Group – and The Banker.
