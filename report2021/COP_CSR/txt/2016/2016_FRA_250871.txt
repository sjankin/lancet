We have teamed up with the specialists to now offer an eco-conscious solution for dealing with food waste on site. The dehydrator implements a process whereby organic waste is reduced to a fifth of its volume, offensive smells are eliminated, and new life is given to organic matter through a solution that addresses our customers’ environmental and regulatory concerns. The dehydrator is interesting in many of its aspects, such as reduced CO2 emissions and reduced storage costs and collection requirements è è Evolution range: a elegant choice born out of environmental concern Reward already includes 162 eco-friendly products in its range.

The free training courses are aimed at people in difficult situations: job seekers, youths without academic qualifications, people changing trades, people under guard and unable to follow a normal course, and other similar profiles. The course programme, ending with a certificate of professional qualification and based on instilling motivation, revolves around “80 basic moves and 90 recipes”. At the end of the 12 weeks course, trainees can start seeking a position in catering with assistance from one of the centre’s partners. 2013 saw the launch of bakery training, and in 2014, restaurant service/customer relations training. Following the success of his Paris initiative, Thierry MARX inaugurated a second centre on 27th May, 2016, in Besançon. The E.CF Group, acting through its Chomette company, was one of the very first partners of Cuisine Mode d’Emploi(s) in 2012. Since then, we have provided financial as well as material backing, the latter through the donation of professional products suitable for use in training courses related to our core business. 2015 report 11 ECODD-01-16-2015_Anglais.indd 5 04/07/2016 10:48 3 More effective control of our impact on the environment • Our actions to reduce our carbon footprint: On a daily basis Optimising our transport and packaging (order grouping, Making constant progress in all areas transport pooling, reduction of breakage and useless returns). of our work: Paying special attention to the vehicle fleet, placing • Waste recycling is fully integrated into our process. environmental notions in the “Car Policy”, using hybrid The logistics chain is designed to facilitate continuous vehicles. removal of cardboard boxes and plastic film.

The first 150 LED tubes were thus , installed on the ground floor of the logistics building. Over 100 tubes were also changed in the display windows of both showrooms in order to solve the problems of difficult access and poor reliability of the old lighting. Thierry POLARD In the springtime 2016, 250 new tubes were installed in Maintenance Manager the building. The electricity consumption for these areas consequently dropped from 15,000Wh to 6,000Wh. The migration should continue year by year and also What are the advantages of LED lighting? includes the orange sodium lighting at logistics level 1, r whose days are numbered just like those of incandescent LED lighting use is gathering pace and offers many lamps. advantages: - Energy saving of over 50% compared with traditional fluorescent tubes Theoretical lifespan of 50.000 hours against an average of 15.000 for fluorescent tubes Less maintenance Very little heat output and reduced carbon footprint Why have you chosen to invest in the LED lighting at the Grigny site? The cost of LED is relatively high but the advantages and lifespan of this type of lighting easily outweigh this. That’s why the Grigny site is gradually changing over, in line with the Group’s Sustainable Development initiative. We have counted roughly 4500 fluorescent tubes at the E.CF Group’s Grigny headquarters. These account for roughly 1/3 of the site’s electricity consumption. The first LED tubes installed go back to 2011, which means we have had plenty of time to test their reliability. How do you go about fitting out the whole site? The choice of priority areas for the changeover was based mainly on usage times, accessibility of the areas for maintenance, and the nature of the equipment to be 2015 report 13 ECODD-01-16-2015_Anglais.indd 7 04/07/2016 10:48 Promoting of greater responsibility in 4 environmental matters On a daily basis Environmental responsibility is promoted essentially by invaluable operations that enable us to stimulate innovate strengthening communication with the interested parties. actions, replicate good working practices, and remind people of the interest of everyday eco-gestures. • Since 2008, we have implemented meaningful actions The Sustainable Development policy is also presented to within the Group to inform our employees and increase all our new employees, whose induction path is tailored their awareness.

Feature Internal mobility, or making the most of our talents! In a context where organization and skills are constantly evolving, internal mobility is an important issue for most companies for a variety of reasons. Internal mobility helps secure employee loyalty and is also a factor in employee motivation, deepening their involvement in the job. This takes on its full implication when seen as a key indicator to an organization’s health and Frédérique LEMAY well-being. Human Resources Preserving talent is one way of maintaining a company’s competitiveness and Director performance levels. On a finishing note, the results of the Quality of Life at Work survey carried out in 2014 showed the extent of employees’ expectations from the E.CF Group on their ability to evolve internally. This has led the company to increase its in-house communication on job vacancies. The list of positions to be filled is now announced every month at the management-employee committee as well as individually through e-mails. All vacancies are published on the company intranet and on the notice boards so that everyone is aware of them and can apply for relevant positions. During the last operating period, out of 70 recruitments, more than 20 were filled via internal mobility. Some movements were from office to field-based jobs or vice versa, others were inter-departmental or promotions, resulting in almost 1 out of 3 vacancies being filled internally. This figure puts the E.CF Group among the 46% of French companies whose internal recruitment represents over 30% of jobs filled. 2015 report 16 ECODD-01-16-2015_Anglais.indd 10 04/07/2016 10:48 Telecommuting, more than just a way of organizing work; a solution for staying in a job!
