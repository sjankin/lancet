The same goes for issued debt with a fixed rate, measured at amortized cost. Insurance contracts with a guaranteed return does not change the accounting value when interest rates change. Changes in interest rate has no impact on the guaranteed return, but will have an impact on the achieved returns to cover the return guarantee. This is because insurance funds partly invests in debt instruments whose cash flows contribute to cover the customers return guarantee. 176 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 5 NOT ES TO T H E ACCOU N TS 177 Note 10 Currency risk 31.12.2015 Fin.l pos. statement items Currency derivatives Translation Total 31.12.2014 Fin.l pos. statement items Currency derivatives Translation Total NOK million/ excl. currency derivatives rate NetNOK million/ excl. currency derivatives rate Netforeign currency¹ Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Currency/NOK Assets Liabilities position foreign currency¹ Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Currency/NOK Assets Liabilities position US dollar 8 367 -610 103 -7 414 8,85 8 470 -8 024 3 951 US dollar 8 993 -582 688 -9 469 7,50 9 682 -10 050 -2 763 Australian dollar 406 0 13 -396 6,44 419 -396 150 Australian dollar 433 0 79 -479 6,14 512 -479 202 Brazilian real 146 0 0 0 2,24 146 0 327 Brazilian real 181 0 0 0 2,82 181 0 509 British pound 1 217 0 17 -1 195 13,05 1 234 -1 195 509 British pound 1 013 0 49 -1 038 11,69 1 062 -1 038 278 Canadian dollar 623 0 18 -600 6,37 641 -600 260 Canadian dollar 671 0 133 -756 6,47 805 -757 310 Chilean peso 5 530 0 0 0 0,01 5 530 0 69 Chilean peso 6 559 0 0 0 0,01 6 559 0 81 Colombian peso 8 751 0 0 0 0,00 8 751 0 24 Colombian peso 14 716 0 0 0 0,00 14 716 0 46 Danish krone 3 950 -53 7 -3 896 1,29 3 958 -3 950 10 Danish krone 3 870 0 345 -3 836 1,22 4 215 -3 836 462 Egyptian pound 14 0 0 0 1,05 14 0 15 Egyptian pound 10 0 0 0 1,13 10 0 11 UAE dirham AED 18 0 0 0 2,04 18 0 37 UAE dirham AED 20 0 0 0 2,41 20 0 49 Euro 3 134 -58 196 -3 050 9,07 3 330 -3 108 2 010 Euro 2 680 -8 125 -2 706 9,62 2 804 -2 715 860 Philippines peso 425 0 0 0 0,17 425 0 71 Philippines peso 438 0 0 0 0,19 438 0 82 Hong Kong dollar 1 735 0 183 -619 0,97 1 918 -619 1 255 Hong Kong dollar 1 674 -30 18 -457 1,14 1 692 -486 1 377 Indian rupee 3 112 0 0 0 0,12 3 112 0 370 Indian rupee 3 516 0 0 0 0,13 3 516 0 470 Indonesian rupiah 247 090 0 0 0 0,00 247 090 0 149 Indonesian rupiah 222 243 0 0 0 0,00 222 243 0 143 Israeli shekel 99 0 18 -107 1,93 117 -107 20 Israeli shekel 194 0 0 -175 2,27 194 -175 42 Japanese yen 65 644 0 13 302 -76 664 0,06 78 946 -76 664 143 Japanese yen 68 497 -690 1 069 -63 441 0,07 69 567 -64 131 400 Korean won 119 470 0 0 0 0,01 119 470 0 815 Korean won 114 377 0 0 0 0,01 114 377 0 863 Malaysian ringgit 95 0 0 0 2,14 95 0 203 Malaysian ringgit 87 0 0 0 2,06 87 0 179 Mexican peso 520 0 0 0 0,51 520 0 265 Mexican peso 455 0 0 0 0,51 455 0 233 New Zealand dollar 3 0 1 -4 5,86 4 -4 2 New Zealand dollar 3 0 0 -3 6,06 3 -3 2 Peruvian nuevo sol 0 0 0 0 2,52 0 0 1 Peruvian nuevo sol 0 0 0 0 2,59 0 0 1 Polish zloty 43 0 0 0 2,11 43 0 91 Polish zloty 34 0 0 0 2,24 34 0 77 Qatari rial 26 0 0 0 2,06 26 0 53 Qatari rial 25 0 0 0 2,43 25 0 61 Singapore dollar 82 0 13 -87 5,66 95 -87 45 Singapore dollar 90 0 19 -100 6,24 109 -100 55 Swiss franc 238 0 65 -279 7,55 302 -279 175 Swiss franc 265 0 2 -237 8,84 267 -237 270 Swedish krone 9 511 -1 1 182 -10 055 0,96 10 694 -10 056 610 Swedish krone 11 779 -1 100 -11 834 1,05 11 879 -11 834 47 South African rand 767 0 0 0 0,65 767 0 497 South African rand 694 0 0 0 0,57 694 0 396 Taiwan new dollar 3 057 0 0 0 0,24 3 057 0 725 Taiwan new dollar 2 604 0 0 0 0,27 2 604 0 702 Thai baht 621 0 0 0 0,23 621 0 142 Thai baht 469 0 0 0 0,25 469 0 115 Czech koruna 37 0 0 0 0,33 37 0 12 Czech koruna 32 0 0 0 0,36 32 0 11 Turkish lira 32 0 0 0 3,21 32 0 103 Turkish lira 26 0 0 0 3,03 26 0 79 Hungarian forint 364 0 0 0 0,03 364 0 10 Hungarian forint 517 0 0 0 0,03 517 0 16 Total short-term foreign currency positions 6 944 Total short-term foreign currency positions 11 844 US dollar 995 -113 0 0 7,50 995 -113 6 614 Euro 315 -312 0 0 9,07 315 -312 27 US dollar 1 012 -109 0 -874 8,85 1 012 -983 260 Japanese yen 33 917 -26 110 0 0 0,06 33 917 -26 110 488 British pound 0 0 0 -10 13,05 0 -10 -128 Total long-term foreign currency positions 7 129 Danish krone 307 0 0 0 1,29 307 0 395 Euro 906 -926 0 -27 9,62 906 -953 -449 Total pre-tax currency positions 14 073 Japanese yen 33 843 -27 778 0 0 0,07 33 843 -27 778 446 Total long-term foreign currency positions 524 Total currency positions after tax 10 273 Total pre-tax currency positions 12 367 ¹ The table shows total financial position statement items for each individual currency, divided between short and long-term positions.

Fair value hedging means that the hedged value development of the hedged object is recognized through profit or loss. Correspondingly the value change on the hedging instrument is recognized through profit or loss.The aim of the hedging arrangement above is to hedge EUR 300 : The interest on the loan is fixed at 5.25 per cent p.a. until 11 April 2016 after which it changes to a variable rate set at the hedged object with a hedging instrument in which the hedging instrument’s terms give negative correlation in relation to the hedged 2.27 per cent above three months’ EURIBOR.

Kommunal Landspensjonskasse is a mutually owned life insurance company whose principal aim is to administer the capital the members have placed in the Company, either as owners (owners’ equity) or as pension customers (pension funds), as well as possible within the business’s ability to bear risk. Life insurance companies are subject to special regulations that set requirements for capital management and that provide investment limitations in the management of the pension customers’ funds. The Company’s strategy for management of its pension customers’ funds is formulated within the scope allowed by the regulations. The investment areas (asset classes) in which the capital is to be placed are defined. The different asset classes have different characteristics and risk profiles and the proportion invested in the different asset classes is continuously adjusted on the basis of the business’s ability to bear, and appetite for, risk. This is monitored and reported on a daily basis. KLP’s financial goal is to achieve a competitive and stable return, at the same time as solvency satisfies external and internal requirements. Besides fundamental diversification of its customers’ assets, the Company has a long-term investment strategy in which risk-taking is continuously matched to the Company’s ability to bear risk. That risk-bearing ability is based on the risk being correlated with the Company’s financial buffers and its ability to tolerate unexpected negative movements.
