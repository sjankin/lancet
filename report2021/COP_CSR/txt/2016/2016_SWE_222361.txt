SSAB 2015 BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT GRI REPORT FINANCIAL REPORTS 2015 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 2015 BOARD OF DIRECTORS GROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 16 Risk assessment Internal control process SSAB’s organization is exposed to both internal and external risks. To reasonably ensure sound internal control, the risks which may affect financial reporting are identified and weighed up, and measures are taken accordingly. This constitutes an integrated part of the regular reporting to the Group Executive Committee and to the Board of Directors, and also constitutes the basis for assessing the risk of error in financial reporting. SSAB’s operations are characterized by Control environment processes involving well-established routines and systems. Risk assessment therefore takes place largely within these processes. Only general risk assessments take place at the Group level. The persons responsible identify, monitor and follow up risks. This creates the conditions for wellfounded, correct business decisions at all levels. Financial risks, such as currency, re-financing and counterparty, interest rate and credit risks are dealt with primarily by the parent company’s treasury Information and Follow-up function in accordance with the Group’s Finance Policy (See Note 29 in Financial reports). For an communication overview of the Group’s commercial risk exposure, see also the section “Internal control and risk management” above and the Report of the Board of Directors. Control activities The primary purpose of control activities is to prevent and identify at an early stage significant financial reporting errors so that they can be addressed and rectified. Control activities, both manual and automated, take place both at general and more detailed levels within the Group. Routines Control activities Risk assessment and activities have been designed to manage and rectify significant risks associated with financial reporting as identified in the risk analysis. Corrective measures, implementation, documentation and quality assurance take place at a Group, subsidiary or process level, depending on the nature and affiliation of the control activity. As with other processes, the relevant head is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of control activities. Recent years have seen an in-depth analysis carried out of the processes and control structures in Group companies. This has resulted in a more systematic approach to identifying financial risks and financial reporting risks, as well as documentation of controls as to how such risks are to be prevented and identified. The controls are adapted to each unit’s work processes and systems structure, and these are evaluated through self-assessment supplemented with monitoring and review by internal audit. This way working has been implemented in a system covering the entire Group which is used when verifying the reliability of financial reporting.

CO2 emissions are The process of producing steel from iron ore is carbon-intensive and the raw materials used in substantially lower than the emissions generated in conjunction with iron ore-based steel production production are the main source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, along with CO2 emissions since less coal is used in the production process. Additionally, much of the coal used in production generated from energy usage. In addition to CO2, there are also other emissions into the air being is derived from recycled coal residual. In scrap-based production, improving energy and material formed during the steel making process and in other processing operations (rolling, coating, etc.). efficiency is the key to reducing emissions. As a result of the continuous development of processes, SSAB´s blast furnaces in Sweden and Industry-wide cooperation is important to identify new technical solutions that can further decrease Finland are among the most efficient in the world in terms of minimizing CO2 emissions from steel the impacts of steelmaking processes. In the Nordics, SSAB is collaborating with KTH Royal Institute production. SSAB’s use of coke and coal as reducing agents is close to the theoretical minimum for a of Technology in Stockholm, Luleå University of Technology, Dalarna University, Swerea, Oulu blast furnace. There is no technology available today that can replace coal as raw material for blast University, Aalto University, Åbo Akademi University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. furnace steel production, which means technology breakthroughs would be needed in order to In SSAB Americas, the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Association for Iron and Steel achieve significant emission reductions. Technology are important partners. CO2 emissions from blast furnace-based steel production can be controlled and reduced to some extent by improving efficiency in the production processes. The production of iron and steel gives rise to a range of residuals and recirculating material back into the steelmaking process, as well as maximizing the use of recycled scrap as raw material, reduces CO2 emissions and waste. Material that cannot be recirculated internally can be processed into by-products and sold externally, which also reduces CO2 emissions by substituting natural resources in other industries. Emissions related to energy consumption in production can be reduced by improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy sources. Systematic energy efficiency management and energy recovery, as well as production of electricity from process gases at steel mills, improves energy efficiency and decreases emissions. However, as CO2 emissions from energy usage are only a small share of SSAB´s total CO2 emissions, the total effect of energy efficiency improvements has a relatively small impact on SSAB´s total CO2 emissions.

Correctly managing risks can create opportunities and add value, while incorrectly managed risks can potentially result in damage and losses. Risks and opportunities SSAB’s earnings and financial position are affected by many factors, several of which are beyond the company’s control. These include general political and economic conditions affecting the steel markets. Many of these factors can impact SSAB positively or negatively. Positive development, or proper management, of a risk can lead to opportunities and value creation. Overall risk management SSAB has prioritized identifying and analyzing risks, as well as deciding how they are to be addressed. Responsibility for the long-term, overall management of strategic risks is dictated by the company’s delegation policy, namely from the Board to the CEO and from the CEO to the leaders of each division. Consequently, most of the Group’s operational risks are managed by each respective division, but coordinated across divisions when necessary. The Group Legal function is responsible for global risk management, assessing insurable risks. The Group risk manager is functionally responsible for the Group’s risk management work and works with each divisional risk manager to optimize the work from a group-wide perspective. The Group’s treasury function is responsible for managing financial risks. For many years, SSAB has had an internal audit unit which, among other tasks, identifies risk areas and, based on a risk analysis, conducts internal controls followed by recommendations for improvements within these areas. The internal audit unit reports directly to the Audit Committee. For full information about the Group’s internal audit function, see the Corporate governance report.

A cycle, such as in products and raw materials. The sensitivity to business continuous focus on developing niche products will enable SSAB to maintain and strengthen its position in cycle fluctuations is also influenced by the high percentage of fixed costs relation to its competitors. due to the large capital expenditures that characterize the steel industry. Another way SSAB reduces sensitivity to the business cycle is by focusing on the company’s home markets, namely North America and the Nordic region. In these markets, SSAB strives to be the customers’ supplier of choice by offering short delivery times, superior quality and close, long-term relationships. SSAB also offers value-added services based on its industry-leading know-how in the field of high-strength steels, offering customers the ability to create innovative solutions. SSAB works closely with customers or at one of its many research facilities to develop these innovative solutions. SSAB also works to cut costs and increase flexibility in its operations in order to lessen the effects of downturns in the business cycle. With the acquisition of Rautaruukki, SSAB is exploring even more possibilities to cut costs across the company. POLITICAL DECISIONS SSAB operates in many countries and is therefore affected by both SSAB participates in national and international industry organizations in which the monitoring of relevant events country-specific and international regulations related to general tax and plays an important role. In the USA, the Group has a separate function for this purpose, based in Washington, DC. financial reporting rules, as well as more specific rules concerning trade barriers, the environment and energy policy. One focus area for SSAB is environmental and energy legislation, with the EU’s emissions trading system being of critical importance for SSAB’s operations. In this area, SSAB acts via industry organizations and directly in explaining the importance of emissions allowances regulations and their impact on SSAB. Since steel production takes place in both Europe and USA, exposure to various trade barriers has been reduced.

There is also great diversity in the company’s suppliers. However, this is not the case with SSAB’s most important raw materials, namely coal and iron ore, where the number of potential suppliers is limited. Coal is purchased from a small number of major suppliers around the world, and iron ore is currently purchased from LKAB in Sweden and from Severstal in Russia. However, since the price of iron ore is set on the world market, it is in principle the same regardless of supplier. SSAB has signed long-term supply agreements with both LKAB and Severstal in order to ensure physical supplies, while proximity to iron ore reduces the risk of long-term delivery problems.

Currency ﬂow 2015 SEK m Currency risks: SSAB’s currency exposure largely relates to the translation risk regarding net assets of foreign subsidiaries. This exposure is hedged through borrowing in foreign currency, so-called equity hedge. Exceptions are made in the case of small amounts, e.g. for equity in foreign sales companies. The objective with the equity USD hedge is to minimize the translation impact on the net debt/equity ratio. The Swedish krona (SEK) is the base currency. In order to manage the transaction risk, most of the commercial currency flows which qualify for hedge EUR accounting (at present purchases of coal and iron ore in USD and sales in EUR) are hedged. Major investments decided upon in foreign currency are hedged in their entirety. Other commercial currency flows that arise in CAD connection with purchases and sales in foreign currency are short term in nature and thus no hedging takes GBP place; instead, they are exchanged on the spot market.

Assessment of fair value of financial instruments Management of capital The classification takes place hierarchically on three levels based on the input data used in valuing instruments. The Company’s capital management is aimed at ensuring that the operations can continue to be conducted and On level 1, listed prices on an active market are used, e.g. stock exchange prices. On level 2, observable market generate good return for the shareholders. Since the Group’s operations are dependent on the business cycle, data regarding assets and liabilities, other than listed prices, is used, e.g. interest rates and return curves. On the target is to maintain a long-term net debt/equity ratio of around 30%. level 3, the fair value is determined based on an assessment technique which is based on assumptions that are not based on prices or data that are directly observable. The fair value assessment of the financial instruments In order to maintain or adapt the capital structure, dividends may be adjusted, share buybacks or redemption in SSAB is based on data in accordance with level 2 except electricity derivatives, which fair values are based on may take place, or new issues or divestments of assets may take place in order to reduce liabilities. listed market values and thus classified on level 1. The net debt/equity ratio decreased somewhat during the year. At year-end, the net debt/equity ratio was 52 Financial assets consist largely of other non-current receivables and are valued at the amount which is expected (56)%. to be received following an assessment of bad debts. Derivative instruments are valued at fair value, calculated with established valuation models based on observable market data. At year-end, the derivatives were valued at SEK 285 (370) million as financial assets and SEK -753 (-918) million as financial liabilities. If full netting had been applied the derivatives had been booked at SEK 60 (71) million as financial assets and SEK -528 (-619) million as financial liabilities. Accounts receivable are reported in the amount which is expected to be received following an individual assessment of bad debts. There is no concentration of credit risks since the Group has a large number of customers spread throughout the world. Other current interest-bearing receivables consist of restricted cash with a term to maturity of less than 12 months. Fair value is estimated at the acquisition value. Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and bank deposits with short terms to maturity, and the fair value is estimated at acquisition value. Non-current interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of loans that are not subject to hedge accounting and are valued at amortized cost. Loans subject to hedge accounting are valued and reported at fair value. Fair value has been calculated based on the interest rate for outstanding terms to maturity as applicable at the end of the year. Current interest-bearing liabilities are valued at amortized cost. Fair value has been calculated based on the rate of interest for outstanding terms to maturity as applicable at the end of the year. Accounts payable are reported in the amount which is expected to be paid and are valued at acquisition value.

The assessment is, however, that there is still room for deterioration in the estimates without this leading to any impairment. The room before any impairment would occur amounted to ALABAMA TAX CREDIT approximately SEK 2.5 billion.

The assessment the assessment made in the calculation or if the long-term forecasted gross margins were to be 1.4 (5.1) led to a recording of a deferred tax asset of SEK 268 (300) million. percentage points lower than the assessment made in the forecast. The impairment test was conducted based on the average risk-free long-term rate in the USA for the period of September to November. At year-end this The received grant will increase or decrease if the taxable result in Alabama is higher or lower than estimated. In interest rate has risen by less than 0.05 percentage points.
