UN GLOBAL COMPACT DIETSMANN COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 www.dietsmann.com LEADERS IN OIL, GAS, POWER AND MINING PLANT OPERATION & MAINTENANCE INDEX STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT & CEO This is Dietsmann’s fourth annual Communication on Progress since the Company became a signatory to the UNGC at the end of 2011. Since then we have worked continuously on the further development of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy by formulating our global approach, structuring our responsibility-oriented actions and integrating the Global Compact’s ten principles in the areas of human rights, labor rights, environment and anti-corruption into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. Dietsmann complies with the legislation of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the principles and best practices of good Corporate Governance, the ethics and anti-corruption legislation and regulations, and all applicable legislation in every country in which we operate. This compliance, as well as all the measures that have been included in Dietsmann’s overall strategy in order to ensure we achieve the highest standards of corporate responsibility and integrate the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact into our day-to-day work, play an intrinsic role in Dietsmann’s long-term vision and strategy. Together this vision and strategy form the basis of Dietsmann’s single corporate culture that includes the ethics values of integrity, respect, loyalty, efficiency and transparency. Dietsmann’s Corporate Social Responsibility approach promotes these ethics values as well as mutual respect and correct behavior. During 2015 we have once again developed our operations to include new sites and expanded in a new geographical region. Despite the business context becoming more and more challenging, the downward slide of the oil price and the pressure on costs reduction, Dietsmann is vigilant and will not compromise the high quality of safety, security and training it has built up throughout nearly 40 years. The importance of clearly formulating our CSR approach and sharing this information with our stakeholders has, therefore, continued to increase. The primary channels of communication we use to keep our stakeholders up-to-date with Dietsmann’s progress with the integration of the Global Compact’s principles into its structure, culture and everyday operation are listed in Section X of this Report. Dietsmann’s employees, by the way they carry out their daily work, are themselves one of the most important channels for communicating the Company’s values and ethics to everyone with whom they come into contact. This is why, as Dietsmann’s founder, President and CEO, I feel a personal responsibility for upholding Dietsmann’s long term vision and strategy and am personally involved in communicating this strategy to all our employees in all the countries in which we operate.

Dietsmann’s core business is planning and managing the O&M of oil, gas and power plants in a way that optimizes safe operational performance, maximizes availability and minimizes costs. The planning, engineering and ongoing execution of maintenance is a complex task in which experienced professionals analyze the requirements, engineer the maintenance, plan the operations and manage continuous plant optimization. Major international and national oil and gas companies entrust Dietsmann with the O&M of their production facilities. Professional maintenance not only increases operating revenue, it also extends the productive life of the assets and, as a result, contributes towards a more sustainable use of equipment and premises. Dietsmann’s core management has always focused on delivering safe and efficient Operation & Maintenance by working closely with its clients at all levels. The Company has accumulated a wealth of experience in operating and maintaining hundreds of production installations around the world. Currently the Company maintains a database of tens of thousands of different pieces of equipment as well as spare parts for all the production facility components of multiple configurations. Dietsmann remains independent and, therefore, free of conflicts of interest with regard to construction companies or original equipment manufacturers and this important principle will not change. As well as being the largest independent provider of specialized Operation & Maintenance services, Dietsmann is also the market leader in maintenance engineering and inspection (MEI). The Company’s worldwide Operation & Maintenance activities are supported by Dietsmann Technologies a Dietsmann subsidiary that provides a wide range of electrical, instrumentation, engineering and construction services. As a substantial employer in the countries in which it operates Dietsmann takes its social responsibilities extremely seriously. The company has been active in Nigeria, Angola, the Republic of Congo and Gabon for more than 25 years and in Kazakhstan and Russia since the early 1990s. In the countries in which it operates Dietsmann strives for 100 percent local employment in its maintenance organization. In 2014 Dietsmann opened an office in Bolivia. In December 2014 Dietsmann’s quality system management processes were audited by the ISO 9001:2008 certification organization, LRQA (Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance), and the certification was renewed. 6 I PROFILE DISCLOSURE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES 6,000 4,500 3,000 1,500 0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 COMMITMENTS TO DIETSMANN’S MAIN STAKEHOLDERS We strive to take our stakeholders’ expectations into account in our business decisions and overall strategy.

Group data included in this report does not take into account data related to Dietsmann Technologies Russia (formerly REP Engineering) as the integration of this Russian Global Maintenance Services Company with over 1,800 employees into the Dietsmann organization is still too recent (May 2013). This Communication On Progress (COP) describes Dietsmann’s strategy and progress in respect of the implementation of the ten UNGC principles. The information is arranged in accordance with the four main topics of the principles: Human Rights, Labor Rights, Environment, and Ethics. Dietsmann’s sustainability management approach and the Company’s involvement in local communities are detailed in separate sections. To facilitate monitoring of the progress of Dietsmann’s social, ethics, local content and environmental performance an overview table has been included in Section IX. The contacts for questions regarding this Report or its contents are: n T he Operations Director; n T he Group Communications Officer; n T he Group HSE Manager. 8 II SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT APPROACH Compliance with its human rights, labor rights, environment protection and ethics commitments is monitored by Dietsmann’s Management Board and the Company’s performance is regularly assessed by the Executive Committee (EXCO). The Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy has been published on Dietsmann’s website and forms the basis of the Company’s Sustainable Development approach. In line with the Company’s commitment to integrating the UNGC principles into its operations and business strategy, an overview table has been compiled to assess the development of the Sustainability Project (see Section IX). Dietsmann also works closely with its clients on the development of its approach to ensure it is in-line with the contractor’s objectives and expectations. For instance, during the year a strategic meeting on Quallity was held with TOTAL during which local content was discussed in respect of the progress of nationalization programs. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM A Dietsmann Sustainable Management System has been developed with the aim of ensuring the consistent implementation of the sustainability project. The system includes: n Guidelines for the progressive development of the project in the pilot subsidiary (in the Republic of Congo) under the guidance of a designated focal person. n Guidelines for the other subsidiaries that will be involved in the following phase of the project and a “search mode” in which contacts with and in local communities are sought pro-actively. n Rules applicable at a Group level for the systematic accountability of all operating sites regarding actions developed within the sustainability project framework. A Local Content Management plan has also been issued. The aim of this document is to support Sustainable Focal Points and Country Managers with the development and monitoring of local content plans that take the local context of each country into account. It should be noted that since 2013 the sustainable development process has been included and monitored within the Group Quality Management System. During 2015, a report based on information available on international databases (World Health Organization, Amnesty International, Transparency International, Doing business, Human Rights Watch, etc.) in screened countries was carried out. 9 INDEX II SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT APPROACH SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE The structure implemented in 2013 remains unchanged as it has proven to be efficient, thanks to the involvement of the Sustainability Project focal points in the development of the project and monitoring of the indicators. Sustainability Project development Sustainability project focal points Coordination / Monaco Dietsmann Kazakhstan (pilot country) Sonadiets Angola Dietsmann Congo Dietsmann Gabon Dietsmann France DIETSMANN SUSTAINABILITY PROJECT As the revised Code forms a basis for the development of the sustainable development approach and must, therefore, be clearly understood by all employees, the Sustainability Project focused on the implementation of Corporate Shared Responsibility video training. In 2015, after Monaco, Kazakhstan and France, training courses took place in West African Countries. 90% of the employees who were scheduled to participate in 2015 successfully completed the training course and related test. The consultation with subsidiaries conducted in 2013 will be repeated in 2016. By then six countries will have implemented the specified follow-up of four items listed in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table: social, local content, ethics and environment. The overview table is included and explained in Section IX (see page 58). It enables Dietsmann to assess its continuous improvement. In line with the main strategic axis of “knowledge sharing”, CORPORATE SPIRIT which was identified in 2013, the overview table includes ENVIRONMENT BUSINESS a specific indicator for the Dietsmann Initiative related to PROTECTION PARTNERS communities. This indicator assesses the number of SHARED training days provided to non-Dietsmann employees KNOWLEDGE at the various Company training centers. SOCIAL HEALTH AT COHESION WORK . CITIZENSHIP INITIATIVES 10 III HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES UNGC Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally-proclaimed human rights. UNGC Principle 2: Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. OVERALL STRATEGY Dietsmann actively supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights through updated relevant published and publically available documents. Dietsmann is committed to ensuring that all employees are treated fairly and with respect. Dietsmann does not tolerate victimization, bullying or harassment. The Company also encourages its business partners to respect human rights and expects them to observe its “Business Partners Policy”. Dietsmann’s human rights practices are fully in line with UNGC expectations and include an involvement in local communities that focuses on knowledge sharing. IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES EMPLOYEES’ PROTECTION Dietsmann Corporate Shared Responsibility Dietsmann has always been deeply concerned about the well-being of its employees and the mutual respect which is a constituent component of its corporate culture. The Company’s core values are encapsulated in the Dietsmann Business Code of Conduct & Ethics Policy. This reference document provides practical examples to explain the implications of these commitments in the day-to-day working environment. To ensure all employees understand the content of the Code, during 2013 a training module – Corporate Shared Responsibility – was issued. This video-based training module explains on the one hand Dietsmann’s corporate responsibility commitments and, on the other hand, how employees are required to comply with these commitments and be personally involved. The first training courses took place during 2014. In addition, an abridged version of the Business Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy has been produced in the seven languages commonly used within Dietsmann and has been distributed at each training session together with a short test that enables the employee’s understanding of the Code to be checked. Employees are required to sign and return a declaration slip confirming they have read and understood the document, which includes the UNGC principles and Dietsmann’s commitment to these principles. The abridged version of the Code is retained by each employee. The acceptance of the Code by each employee is monitored through the Employee Data Base in order to ensure a progressive increase of the awareness of all employees is achieved. 11 INDEX III HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Dietsmann Upline email To protect its employees Dietsmann is progressively implementing a Grievance Mechanism, the “Upline email”, which can be used to obtain advice regarding, or report any sensitive concern related to, Human Rights and any deviance from the Code. The responsibility for this mechanism rests with the Ethics Committee. To ensure the confidentiality and reliability of the Upline email a dedicated and customized IT tool has been developed by Dietsmann’s IT department. This tool also enables the Ethics Committee to identify and analyze recurring issues and implement appropriate preventive actions. The procedure to be followed when using the Upline email is explained in the Upstream Communication procedure. HELP HR or HSE Officer Written statement upon your request. Ethics Committee HELP! upline@dietsmann.com investigation 10 DAYS 60 DAYS CONFIDENTIALITY ACKNOWLEDGMENT FEEDBACK The Upline email is introduced and explained to employees as part of the Corporate Shared Responsibility training.

UNGC Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor. UNGC Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labor. UNGC Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. OVERALL STRATEGY Dietsmann respects the labor rights stated in the International Labor Organization’s Declaration as well as all relevant legislation and regulations, including the local content of the countries in which it operates. Dietsmann expects its business partners to do the same. As stated in its Business Code of Conduct & Ethics Policy, Dietsmann: n R espects freedom of association and supports collective bargaining. n D oes not tolerate forced or child labor and discrimination. n H as always been committed to maintaining the highest level of HSE standards. n V alues the personal development of its employees and focuses on dynamic career management, supports internal promotion, invests in training and strives to take employees’ expectations into account. IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES Dietsmann’s Business Code of Conduct & Ethics Policy publically states its commitment to supporting labor rights, including safe and healthy working conditions, freedom of association, non-discrimination in human resources management and access to basic health care and education. Dietsmann is developing tools and processes to implement these commitments. HSE performances are strictly monitored. HR performances are also monitored in terms of individual development, equal opportunities, diversity and training. Dietsmann also works continuously to improve welfare schemes for all its employees. As a global company Dietsmann relies heavily on mutual respect and individual dignity and believes that diversity enhances shared knowledge. 14 IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES COMPLIANCE WITH LABOR RIGHTS: CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT All Dietsmann’s employees are issued with a contract of employment which clearly defines their terms and conditions including pay rates, working hours and overtime compensation arrangements. All contracts specify employees are free to resign after a notice period defined according to the type of contact. Dietsmann does not have any employees under 18 years old. Information about standard terms and conditions of employment, company benefits, company rules, and grievance and disciplinary procedures is handed to all employees when they join the Company. All expatriate employees receive a country information sheet before taking up their duties. Dietsmann promotes and develops talent and encourages long-lasting relations with employees. Dietsmann is proud that, despite the fluctuating level of activity consummate with the nature of its operations, more than 216 of its current employees have worked for the Group for more than 15 years and nearly 64 of these employees have, in fact, been with the Company for more than 25 years. Dietsmann’s fluctuating level of activity results in a fluctuating, but overall relatively high, outflow rate. In 2015 the outflow rate decreased slightly to 4.75% from 5.28% in 2014. It should be noted that, in all the countries in which it operates, when a contract is completed Dietsmann’s policy is to offer employees work on new contracts whenever possible. Related indicators in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 58) 11 New hirings of national employees 12 New hirings of expatriates 13 Outflow rate ENSURING NOT BEING COMPLICIT IN LABOR RIGHTS ABUSE BUSINESS PARTNERS SCREENING As specified in Dietsmann’s Business Partners Policy, business partners are expected to respect labor rights. Dietsmann is committed to applying UNGC principles at all its operating sites and to striving to assess its business partners’ compliance with these principles and encouraging them to implement good practices. As described in Section III, a Group procedure for the selection of suppliers and subcontractors is being implemented in phases. Related indicator in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 59) 35 Percentage of suppliers and subcontractors screened and followed-up 15 INDEX IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES HEALTH & SAFETY HSE The eight HSE policies are Safety & Security, Health & Industrial Hygiene, Decent Working Conditions, Vehicle Driving, Substance Abuse, HIV/AIDS, Sustainable Development and Environment Protection. The essence of these policies is contained within the HSE Charter included in the Dietsmann Business Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy. The full text of each policy can also be read in the Corporate section of Dietsmann’s website www.dietsmann.com. Dietsmann issues an annual HSE risks assessment in an HRA report (Health Risks Assessment) for the main operating sites and monitors risk management progress through regular HSE audits. It should be noted that Dietsmann Technologies’ Salies-du-Salat site, which has been ISO 14001 certificated since 2007, achieved OSHAS 18001 certification in April 2014. Dietsmann ensures employees are aware of the Company’s rules and HSE procedures by giving all new employees a copy of the Safety Handbook. Every employee arriving for his/her first day of working at a site must follow a safety induction path during which the HSE Officer covers all the relevant HSE guidelines, general rules and site-specific operational rules. At the end of the induction path every employee is given a copy of the Safety Handbook, which must be signed by both the employee and the HSE Officer. The safety handbook was last revised in 2011 and was fully reviewed in 2015.

The HSE Management System provides a framework for all teams at operating sites. Continuous consultation with employees regarding HSE issues contributes towards the improvement of safety and security at all sites. Dietsmann complies with all relevant health and safety legislation and the HSE knowledge of every employee is improved through regular training and presentations geared to their function and activities. Dietsmann’s HSE management is also continuously improving its policies. Every employee is expected to comply with all Dietsmann’s HSE policies and to make an active contribution towards their improvement by: n T aking all necessary precautions. n R eporting any witnessed near-misses, incidents or accidents. n C ontributing towards the identification and assessment of risks. n P articipating in HSE training courses. Although Dietsmann always applies the client’s rules on site, to maintain the highest HSE standards Dietsmann wanted to have its own set of rules that are directly related to its core WORK SAFELY business. The ‘Dietsmann 12 Safe Maintenance Rules’ address FOR EVERYONE’S SAFETY the essential issues related to the key risks employees face during their day-to-day operations. The ‘Dietsmann 12 Safe Maintenance Rules’ campaign is promoted in seven languages. A specific campaign highlighting the Dietsmann 12 Safe Maintenance Rules started in June 2014 and continued until the end of 2015. Training sessions focused on one rule per month. This campaign explained that a rule is an appropriate principle regulating the practice or procedure of a specific activity and Rules to follow foR pRofessional Hse beHavioR emphasizes that following the rules is compulsory.

In 2014 and 2015 the focus was on the 12 Safe Maintenance Rules. Previous health & safety campaigns do, however, remain available in the HSE section of Dietsmann’s website. In addition to safety and security, employees’ good health is also a major concern for Dietsmann. This is why regular medical check-ups are provided to employees; in 2015, 88% of employees benefited from a medical check-up (2014: 90%; 2013: 92%). The check-ups are carried out every one or two years depending on the local context and the individual context (the employee’s age and type of work).

An automatic defibrillator is also available in the Pointe-Noire office. Related indicators in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 58) 27 Percentage of employees who benefited from a medical check-up 28 Total awareness-raising campaigns on health issues 29 Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) per million man-hours worked 30 Total recordable incident rate (TRIR) per million man-hours worked 20 IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES SOCIAL DIALOGUE AND COHESION COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND DIALOGUE WITH EMPLOYEES The Company endorses collective bargaining: employees’ representatives are active at all operating sites and are also provided with the necessary meeting facilities and appropriate time off duty to organize work sessions with the managers concerned. At all sites Dietsmann promotes an open dialogue between employees and managers. In April 2015, a tri-annual agreement related to improved salary conditions was signed. In Monaco a specific anonymous email allows employees to send any question they may have to the employees’ representatives. Dietsmann Gabon’s dialogue box system, which allows open dialogue (open topics /nominative or not) is still ongoing. So far no significant request has been received, which could mean that direct dialogue prevails. To strengthen corporate cohesion and promote a good working atmosphere, events that bring employees together are organized at Dietsmann. The end of year is a regular opportunity for such an informal get-together. Some special events are also organized, for instance on May Day. Dialogue box in Gabon 21 INDEX IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES IDENTIFYING EMPLOYEES’ EXPECTATIONS: ICMS “INTEGRATED CAREER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” Dietsmann operates an annual review process for employees; the number of scheduled interviews is increasing each year. The process identifies the employee’s personal development needs and training requirements for his/her current job position and expected career path. In 2015 90% of the scheduled ICMS interviews were conducted. This rate shows a 23% increase of the ICMS conducted in 2015.

Towards this end the Human Resources department has developed several successful tools: TACT, KMP and PARS. The management and coordination of training courses and course participation are supported by the Employee Data Base (EDB) Dietsmann’s in-house HR management software which includes a training module. The aim of this module is to assist training managers throughout the Company by automating many tasks, such as training plan editing, training request management and training processing and reporting. The investment in training remained at a high level with 17,956 training days between January and December 2015. This is a significant increase compared with the previous year (2014: 11,127 training days). The opportunity to follow training courses appropriate to their specific job needs or projected career path is available to all employees. Training can cover technical, administration, languages or management courses and training sessions are also provided for mandatory HSE and IT topics. The focus is on transferring know-how and enhancing national employees’ skills. Globally, Dietsmann committed to BREAKDOWN OF TRAINING DAYS PER COUNTRY IN 2015 having provided job and career path training to 661 employees by 2014 and Angola 21.44% 699 employees by 2015. These targets The Republic of Congo 19.22% have been exceeded as by the end of France 3.27% 2015 814 employees worldwide had Gabon 4.70% been trained. Ivory Coast 0.19% Kazakhstan 1.23% Dietsmann has also continued its Libya 0.45% nationalization program. Since 2013 Monaco 1.17% a total of 27 positions have been Nigeria 7.68% successfully nationalized. Dietsmann will Russia 40.64% continue its ongoing process of know-how transfer and local workforce training. 23 INDEX IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES TACT: “Technical Assessment Campaign and Training” The aim of this training program is to align the skills of national employees with the technical and safety requirements of their positions. This tool takes into account the assessment, training, mentoring and acquired knowledge measurement. TACT is applicable to four disciplines mechanics, instrumentation, electricity and HVACand differentiates three levels of skill junior technician, senior technician and foreman. The program is aimed at both national and expatriate employees. A personalized training & tutoring program is implemented based on the results of the assessment and lasts for approximately two years. The two Tact local sessions conducted to date involved 596 participants. Between 2013 and 2015 29 trainers were hired in the 7 countries in which the program is in place (Angola, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Libya, Mozambique, Nigeria and South Sudan). Currently 26 technical corporate trainers specialized in Dietsmann’s core competencies have been assigned to some of these locations. Political issues in Libya and South Sudan resulted to an adjustment of Dietsmann’s intentions. As operations have yet to start in Mozambique training efforts are currently on hold, but will be resumed as soon as operations commence. In Ivory Coast eight new members have joined the training team. KMP: “Key Managers Path” The objective of this project management training program is to prepare the key managers Dietsmann needs for its future operational development. This program is spread over several years and divided into two parts: n A  training program focused primarily on management, finance, communication and specific group modules provided by managers. n A  n individual professional path which allows each candidate to gain the necessary competencies step by step. The candidates fulfill different positions involving an increasing level of responsibility. To date 24 employees have participated in the KMP training program. PARS: “Pro Active Recruitment System” The PARS has been implemented since 2006 and is aimed at talented potential candidates not necessarily experienced in the oil & gas sector. The main purpose of the PARS is to hire young technicians with a minimum of five years’ experience in the industrial sector and train them to meet the Company’s projected future needs. The recruits spend one month in the maintenance engineering department in order to gain a general overview of oil and gas projects before being assigned to one of Dietsmann’s subsidiaries for on-the-job training in different positions by experienced technicians. During periods of training in France or abroad, Dietsmann covers the costs and PARS participants agree not to benefit from expatriation premiums. This recruiting process enables regular needs for technicians (mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, automation, turbines) to be met and also represents an effort by the Company to train candidates who may not necessarily be hired at the end of the training. Since its launch the PARS has attracted 38 potential employees all of whom have since been hired. This program is available to only a limited number of candidates as it involves experienced employees’ contributing by transferring their knowledge. 24 IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Related indicators in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 58) 21 Total training days 22 Training expenses in millions of Euros 23 Number of employees who have benefited from Human Resources career development tools (TACT, PARS, KMP) COMBATING DISCRIMINATION Dietsmann’s non-discrimination principle includes any explicit or implicit distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of color, gender, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin, which has the effect of nullifying or spoiling equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation, including access to vocational training. Dietsmann’s recruitment criteria are based solely on skills and are not related to ethnic or religious origins, age, gender or any other form of discrimination. DIETSMANN CORPORATE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY The Corporate Shared Responsibility video training module that explains Dietsmann Business Code of Conduct & Ethics Policy includes a section on the discrimination issue. The aim is to ensure all employees are aware of the varied and subtle forms that discrimination can take. To check the employees have clearly understood the message the test at the end of the training includes an item on the topic. The course participants must also sign and return a declaration slip confirming they have read and understood the abridged version of the Code handled to them after having seen the video. Employees are instructed to prevent any discriminatory situation and to report any such situation that they become aware of whether it involves them or a colleague. Reporting a discriminatory situation is mandatory and must be done in accordance with the Upstream communication procedure described in Section III. UPLINE EMAIL The ongoing implementation of the Upline email grievance mechanism allows employees to request advice on labor rights matters and report any deviance from the Code including, of course, any violation of fundamental rights and non-compliant behavior. The responsibility for carrying out investigations rests with the Ethics Committee. Confidentiality is ensured and all the members of the Ethics Committee are subject to a stringent privacy commitment. Potential requests are recorded and analyzed in order to attempt to avoid the situation recurring in the future and to gain an insight into the topics concerned with a view to implementing any preventive actions deemed necessary. Since the implementation of the Upline no labor rights violations have been reported. 25 INDEX IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Related indicators in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 59) 31 Percentage of employees trained in discrimination prevention and use of the Upline assistance and protection tool 32 Number of Upline requests for advice related to social issues in countries in which the Upline tool has been implemented VALORIZATION OF DIVERSITY Whenever possible the Company promotes national employment. As a result the Company is continuously increasing the diversity of its employees. A total of 58 different nationalities were represented in 2012, in 2015 59 different nationalities were represented. Dietsmann is present in 17 countries and in every one of these countries recruits employees by publishing vacancies worldwide on its website. The diversity of Dietsmann’s workforce reflects its rejection of any form of discrimination.

Office positions obviously do not involve the same constraints as operational positions and the gender ratio is significant for these positions: women represent 49% of employees working in office positions. This percentage has increased by 5% since 2014 (44%).

Gender diversity is, however, effective in Monaco and at an encouraging level in France and Kazakhstan. As far as administrative positions are concerned, the best in class are France and Kazakhstan. 27 INDEX IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Related indicators in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 58) 14 Gender percentage administrative positions 15 Gender percentage all positions GENDER BREAKDOWN ALL POSITIONS DEC. 2015 (by country of work in main countries of operation) 60% 40% 20% 0% Angola Congo France Gabon Iraq Italy Kazakhstan Libya Monaco Nigeria Other Russia South Sudan GENERATION EQUITY The breakdown of employees by age is well balanced: the average age is 41. The percentage of young (under the age of 35) employees is 30%. This high percentage highlights Dietsmann’s ambition to recruit and give opportunities to young talent. At the other end of the age spectrum, 11% of employees are over 55 years old. This is a quite significant percentage and it should be noted that 64 employees have worked for Dietsmann for more than 25 years (see details in Section III). Compared to last year, the trend is towards a slight ageing: the average age has risen from 40 to 41 and the number of employees over 55 remains steady. 28 IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES BREAKDOWN BY AGE GROUP (2014 2015 comparison) 20% 2014 2015 15% 10% 5% 0% -20 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65-69 70+ Related indicators in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 58) 16 Average age 17 Percentage of employees over 55 18 Percentage of employees under 25 LOCAL EMPLOYMENT The nationalization of expatriate positions is a priority in terms of career management. Typically, over 99% of administrative staff positions and over 74% of management positions are filled by nationals of the countries in which Dietsmann operates. The Company remains focused on increasing the proportion of nationals employed in all categories. Dietsmann’s HR policy is reflected in the proportion of national employees across the Company overall, which is now of 83%.

In fact, 90% of participations in training courses benefited national employees. As a result, Dietsmann is proud to work with thousands of highly motivated and well-trained local staff, some of whom have been promoted to senior management positions including in Nigeria, Angola, the Republic of Congo and Gabon where the Company has been present for more than 25 years.

This benefits the economy and local communities in the countries in which it operates. Nationalization is, however, one of Dietsmann’s greatest HR challenges because the success of nationalization plans depends on a whole range of parameters, such as the level of education of the local staff, the quality of the local training centers and the mix of specific Human Resources skills required to manage this kind of project. Generally the nationalization of a position involves a substantial financial investment. To support the implementation of an increasing number of nationalization plans and to make these plans more successful, in 2012 Dietsmann developed a Nationalization Tool Box (NaTB). This tool box comprises a set of training courses, tests and support material that enables the local HR department to formulate and implement a nationalization plan fitted and adapted to the specific local situation. The NaTB recommends a step-by-step nationalization process and includes support materials, such as technical, reasoning and psychological tests, general, technical and management training course support and cost evaluation software for each step as well as all the additional information that will enable the Country HR Manager to set up and implement a training plan. The NaTB has been used successfully by several subsidiaries and resulted in efficient nationalization plans, including in Sonadiets Angola as shown in the following graph. Globally, the process of nationalization has resulted in 36 positions previously held by expatriates being nationalized in 2015. 31 INDEX IV LABOR RIGHTS PRINCIPLES RECRUITMENT PLAN AND REINFORCEMENT OF ANGOLANIZATION 20 Reinforcement with Supervisors 16 Reinforcement with Clov Initial program 12 8 4 0 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 In addition, Dietsmann is developing or expanding training centers in its countries of operation. The aim is to address the lack of some specific training courses. Detailed information about the training centers can be found in Section VII as these centers are also a component of Dietsmann’s contribution towards the development of local infrastructures.

UNGC Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. UNGC Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. OVERALL STRATEGY Protection of the environment is supported by a specific HSE policy based on ISO 14001 standards and is included in the HSE charter. As Dietsmann’s main activity involves the provision of services, its impacts on the environment are more indirect than direct. Even so, to strengthen its approach to environment protection the Company is working on defining good-practices related to resource consumption, waste management and global environmentfriendly behavior. When operating on a client’s premises Dietsmann complies with that client’s environmental standards. Dietsmann also focuses on preventive maintenance to increase equipment lifetime and avoid spills. Furthermore, the Company encourages its business partners’ active protection of the environment through the Business Partners Policy. IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES Dietsmann complies with all relevant environmental legislation and regulations, and official documents publically state the Company’s precautionary approach in terms of the environment. In order to remain fully compliant the HSE department maintains an up to date legislation and regulations database. Remaining objectives related to environment are to draw up a series of environmental good practices that should help reduce the environmental impact (resource consumption, waste and pollution), increase employee training in respect of environmental matters, implement a more accurate internal impactassessment system and improve Dietsmann’s ability to respond effectively to any issues that could arise. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT Care of the environment is a priority for Dietsmann in all of its activities. According to its HSE Environment Protection Policy, Dietsmann undertakes to ensure that regulatory requirements and Group standards are respected by carrying out regular environmental reviews and by deploying environment management systems based on the ISO 14001 standard at all sites. The Dietsmann Technologies SA site in France (Salies-du-Salat) has been ISO 14001 certificated since 2007. 33 INDEX V ENVIRONMENT PRINCIPLES Related indicator in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 60) 50 Percentage of permanent facilities (offices) in which an environmental risk assessment has been carried out In line with its HSE Environment Protection Policy, Dietsmann assesses specific risks and formulates a crisis management plan for emergency pollution situations. This plan is reviewed and improved on a regular basis. WASTE MANAGEMENT WASTE SORTING Dietsmann develops and implements training and education programs on environmental protection good practices for all employees. To date these programs have focused primarily Waste sorting at on raising awareness regarding reducing waste production, Morro Bento Training promoting and maximizing recycling and the traceability of Center Angola ultimate waste products. As a result, Dietsmann employs licensed waste companies to dispose of waste wherever available. Waste is sorted at 100% of the Company’s sites and this waste management is supported by specific procedures. At those sites the sorted waste is transferred to waste collection companies or, in the case of industrial waste, to the client. Where available local facilities are used for the separate disposal of obsolete electrical and electronic equipment and for batteries and the weight of waste material is monitored and measured on a regular basis. Related indicator in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 59) 46 Percentage of permanent facilities with a waste storage and sorting area In 2015 100% of the sites of operations in the six screened countries included a waste storage and sorting area. 34 V ENVIRONMENT PRINCIPLES ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING & PROMOTION The HSE inductions of all employees include environment protection. The subsidiary in Gabon goes further. The job description of every employee includes the requirement to respect and implement the HSE guidelines related to the environment in accordance with the ISO 14001 standard. TOWARDS CONSUMPTION REDUCTION Dietsmann has been campaigning for switching off lights and computers. “Reducing Energy Usage” messages are displayed in almost all subsidiaries. To reduce water consumption at Dietsmann Congo, rainwater is harvested and used for the equipment cleaning activities. The local climate allows the tank to be filled for 60% of the year. Related indicator in the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 59) 49 Percentage of countries in which environment awareness raising campaigns have been provided to employees Developing and implementing training and education programs on the environmental protection good practices for all employees is part of the HSE Environment Protection Policy. Developing campaigns that will raise employees’ awareness of the need to use water carefully and to use renewable energy sources whenever feasible is a component of this policy. CARBON FOOTPRINT REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT NetcoDietsmann in Nigeria is pursuing its effort to plant grass, flowers and trees on the Afam VI operation site. This local approach called “beautification” continued during 2015 and is implemented on sites where it is possible. The gas turbines at Afam and Okpai have CEMS (Continuous Environmental Monitoring System) which ensures that emissions are Beautification in inline with currently applicable Afam VI 2015 Nigerian guidelines. 35 INDEX V ENVIRONMENT PRINCIPLES CONSUMPTION MONITORING Dietsmann Gabon has been monitoring power consumption in the Port-Gentil office since January 2013. As the diagram shows, during 2015 measurement, control and optimization of the consumption was achieved. Dietsmann is committed to communicating environmental impact assessment and reporting to its main stakeholders. Towards this end Dietsmann is working on the issuing of a carbon footprint assessment tool that could be used in all subsidiaries. In the meantime, Dietsmann Congo has implemented a specific assessment of its carbon emissions. Carbon emissions have decreased from 0.43 to 0.23 T/employee. The carbon footprint tool will be based on the regular measurement of various types of emissions including electricity consumption as it is already assessed on a monthly basis in Gabon. Monitoring the carbon footprint data will enable the Company to reduce its energy consumption in accordance with regularly updated targets.

OVERALL STRATEGY Dietsmann endorses the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and is committed to combating all forms of corruption. The Company has a long-term commitment to ethics and transparency and uses the stipulations of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code as a basis for the development and implementation of good Corporate Governance for Dietsmann’s overall management. Although the Dutch Corporate Governance Code only applies to Dutch companies listed on a stock exchange recognized by the government, Dietsmann voluntarily complies with the Dutch Code’s stipulations and best practices including audits, disclosure, compliance and enforcement standards and the Management Board and Supervisory Board use the Code as a management framework. Dietsmann‘s ethics principles and guidelines are encapsulated in Dietsmann’s Business Code of Conduct & Ethics Policy, the first version of which was published in 2004. Dietsmann also encourages its business partners to respect its Ethics commitments through the Business Partners Policy and the Business Ethics Charter. IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES Dietsmann complies with applicable legislation and regulations related to ethics, Corporate Governance and anti-corruption. Dietsmann’s Ethics standards are explained to employees through the Corporate Shared Responsibility training. Dietsmann takes every opportunity to promote ethics commitments among its business partners. ANTI-CORRUPTION PROCESSES Corporate Shared Responsibility training and Upline email The Upline email which is being implemented enables employees to seek further advice should they have concerns regarding sensitive situations. The Ethics Committee is responsible for answering, analyzing and recording requests for advice and reports of grievances and concerns. The Upline email, the terms of use of which are explained in the Upstream procedure, enables any deviations from the Business Code of Conduct & Ethics Policy to be recorded and analyzed so attempts can be made to prevent similar deviations recurring in the future. Both the Upline email and the Upstream communication procedure are accurately explained to all employees in the Corporate Shared Responsibility training as described in Section III. 37 INDEX VI ANTI-CORRUPTION PRINCIPLE Ensuring business partners’ compliance Dietsmann is committed to applying UNGC principles at all operating sites and striving to assess its business partners’ compliance with these principles and encourage them to implement good practices. As stated in Section III, a Group procedure provides all subsidiaries with an evaluation form for current and potential main suppliers or sub-contractors. The form includes ethics compliance items. Promotion of ethics commitments In 2015 Dietsmann’s Angolan joint-venture, Sonadiets, reaffirmed its commitment in a letter of information, enclosed with the UNGC COP report, sent to clients.

Dietsmann’s audited financial statements are published in the Company’s annual report. Compliance with all relevant legislation and regulations is monitored by internal and external auditors. Dietsmann has neither experienced any reportable environmental incidents during Dietsmann Business the past year nor has been subject to any Ethics Charter statutory notice or prosecution. 38 VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES Dietsmann has built-up close relations with the communities that host its operations through long-term local initiatives and actions involving knowledge sharing. DIETSMANN SUPPORT & COORDINATION OFFICE MONACO In Monaco Dietsmann has a long-standing involvement in the activities of local and neighboring municipalities, mainly through sponsoring or contributions to local organizations. NO FINISH LINE In 2015 Dietsmann was once again proud to be one of the official third-level sponsors of the 16th ‘No Finish Line’ eight-days run organized by The Children & Future Association to help disadvantaged and sick children. Dietsmann and the other companies involved sponsor this event by donating one euro per kilometer run or walked by each employee. As a third-level sponsor Dietsmann donated over € 10,000 to this significant event. During the 16th ‘No Finish Line’ held at the Fontvieille circuit in Monaco in November 2015 the Dietsmann team of 217 participants completed a total of 7,299 kilometers and ended 9th out of 335 teams involved. The total of € 383,000 they raised will be used by the Association to fund major projects, such as the provision of comprehensive support to foreign sick children undergoing humanitarian surgery in the Monaco Cardio-Thoracic Center, or the continuous support of initiatives dedicated to helping children suffering from HIV/AIDS led by the Fight Aids Association chaired by H.S.H. Princess Stéphanie. This sponsorship gives Monaco employees the opportunity to be involved collectively in a humanitarian activity in the name of Dietsmann. As usual the initiative is led by Dietsmann’s Tendering Department Manager who, every year, voluntarily, takes on the recruiting, organization and coaching of the Dietsmann team. 2015: 11,726 participants and 383,179 kms run Amount raised: over € 383,000 Dietsmann participants in NFL 2015 39 INDEX VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES UNAKIDS Dietsmann makes an annual donation to UNAkids, which focuses on the plight of young children in war torn countries in which the Company is active. This private charity, which is registered as an international non-profit organization, arranges for individuals to sponsor needy orphans and children in single parent families and raises funds to provide the children with access to full-time education. By providing this financial support Diesmann is endorsing UNAkids’ values and policies including implementing community-related actions that have a positive social effect. LES ENFANTS DE FRANKIE In line with the Company’s concerns regarding Human Rights, Dietsmann continues to make an annual donation to “Les Enfants de Frankie”. Since its creation this Association, supported by 150 volunteers, has assisted more than 100,000 children in great difficulty in Monaco and the PACA region by working closely with hospitals, social services, orphanages and over 200 associations dedicated to children. “Les Enfants de Frankie” organizes sports and cultural events, festivals, holidays, workshops and, thanks to these activities, finances several projects a year. CAP D’AIL TRIATHLON For the third year running Dietsmann was an official sponsor of Cap d’Ail Triathlon (neighboring municipality of Monaco) which consists of a 600 meters swim, a 17 km cycle ride and a 6 km run. On 6 September 2015 the 15th edition of this triathlon attracted 250 participants. FEDERATION MONEGASQUE DE VOLLEYBALL (FMVB) Dietsmann has extended its € 15,000 per annum financial partnership with the Federation Monegasque de Volley-ball (FMVB) for a further two years. As a component of this partnership Dietsmann teams participated in two inter-company tournaments organized at Larvotto Beach in Monaco: the 12th Albert II Beach Volley Trophy tournament from 16 March to 8 June 2015, and the BVT Albert II Cup in September and October 2015. The two Dietsmann teams that took up the challenge each comprised six employees drawn from various departments within the Company. This sport initiative once again demonstrates both the solidarity and cohesion within the Company and Dietsmann’s commitment to being an active citizen of the Principality and a contributor towards the harmonious development of social and sporting life within the Principality. 40 VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES MONACO IMPACT Dietsmann, as a dynamic and responsible citizen of Monaco, has undertaken to support the Monaco Impact Association. The mission of this non-profit organization is to encourage, facilitate and federate charitable initiatives, organizations and institutes in Monaco in order to put the Principality on the map as a World Center of Philanthropy and by so doing contribute towards a positive perception of Monaco throughout the world. On a more concrete level, the Association strives to identify best practices for and promising solutions to global challenges within its action domains of health care, clean water, agriculture, education, gender equality, post-conflict development and income generation (micro-credit). Dietsmann shares Monaco Impact’s vision and mission and provides the Association with both financial support and in-kind contributions as part of a skills-based patronage operation. The in-kind contributions Dietsmann has already provided Monaco Impact are office accommodation and the creation and management of the Association’s website. FEDERATION MONEGASQUE DE BADMINTON As part of its Corporate Shared Responsibility approach Dietsmann has once again shown its commitment to the development of sports and social life in the Principality of Monaco by participating in the first intercompany badminton tournament organized by the Monegasque Badminton Federation, and providing a € 700 donation. This new sporting challenge, which took place from January to April 2015, was open to all employees working in Monaco. Following this invitation, Dietsmann quickly set up a team of six employees to compete against teams from seven other companies and administrations including SBM, SBM Offshore, SMEG, The Monaco Fire Service, Monaco Public Administration and the Monaco Hotel High School. The tournament gave the participants an opportunity to meet and, in terms of the competition, put more emphasis on the value of team spirit than on individual results. From a business perspective it gave Dietsmann a new opportunity to increase local awareness of its activities and involvement with the local community. 41 INDEX VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES ‘LEGACY SPONSOR’ OF DELFT TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY’S MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MUSEUM (MGM) Due to financial and space restraints, in 2013 the TU Delft Foundation was faced with the complete dismantling of the Museum’s collection of 140,000 unique specimens of crystals, minerals, ores and fossils and the irreversible closure of its doors. In the light of this alarming fact, in 2014 Dietsmann stepped in as the MGM’s ‘legacy sponsor’ with a pledge of sponsorship for the next 10 years. In April 2014 Dietsmann’s President & CEO handed the MGM Foundation’s Chairman a cheque for € 1 million the total amount of sponsorship money collected by four main sponsors for the reopening of the MGM. Dietsmann’s 10-year financial partnership has enabled the core of the collection, including 25 antique, handcrafted, showcases and mineral displays, to be relocated to the second floor of the TU Delft’s Science Centre in the city of Delft. The central area, where over 4,000 different, special and highly valuable specimens are displayed, has been named the “Dietsmann Hall”. The “new” MGM was opened officially in April 2015. This sustained initiative is very significant for Dietsmann, and holds a special place in the heart of its (Dutch) President & CEO, Peter Kütemann. SOCIAL & EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS IN NYANG’OMA, KENYA A donation from Dietsmann has enabled two volunteers to carry out social and educational projects in Nyang’oma, a village a few kilometers from the shores of Lake Victoria in the southwest of Kenya and two hours away from the city of Kisumu. Nyang’oma has a mission-station comprising a primary school, a technical school, boarding schools for girls and boys, orphans’ and widows’ houses, and religious institutions. The aim of the initiative is to promote improved education for all of the children by teaching them English, mathematics and computer science as well as playing games and sports. Particular attention is being paid to facilitating the social integration of the physically disadvantaged children attending the school for both deaf and hearing people through a sensitive approach. In broader terms, by ensuring that significant projects can be realized in Nyang’oma Dietsmann’s support will make a tangible contribution towards intercultural dialogue and understanding between people. 42 VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES RALLYE AÏCHA DES GAZELLES, MOROCCO Dietsmann is sponsoring a team called ‘Fée Carabosse’ that will take part in the 26th Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles in 2016. The Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles is a unique event the only 100% female, off-road motorsport competition with an environmental and social initiative. The world-famous Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles is more than a competition, it is also a symbol of courage and commitment, as well as the noble values of adventure: self-improvement, sharing, loyalty and solidarity. This is also a clean and eco-responsible event that includes environmental and humanitarian commitments. In fact, since 2010 the Aïcha des Gazelles Rally has been officially ISO 14001 certificated for its environmental record, waste treatment and CO2 neutrality the Rally compensates all CO2 impact. To preserve the local environment the Rallye des Gazelles organization provides support to local communities, participates in the development of local infrastructure and initiates actions recognized by governmental authorities, such as medical, sustainable development, education and humanitarian actions. This fully CSR-oriented event will allow Dietsmann to increase awareness of its activities through the local, national and international media coverage of this sustainable rally. FUNDING OF HOSPITAL RENOVATION PROJECT IN REFTINSKYA RUSSIA In September 2015 Dietsmann was presented with two Certificates of Gratitude for its funding of the restoration of the intensive care unit in Reftinskya Hospital. Dietsmann’s top management believed supporting this initiative to renovate the Hospital was important because by securing the health of its employees and their families Dietsmann is safeguarding the delivery of the high quality its clients expect and, as a consequence, a positive development of the Company’s business. FINTA FINTA BOOK MOZAMBIQUE Dietsmann sponsored the Finta Finta book about Mozambican soccer players and coaches who have contributed towards helping Mozambique achieve international fame since the 1950s. The money from the book’s sales will go towards the “Finta-Finta Mabilibili” project promoted by Time For Africa. The aim of the project is to build a track field for children to participate in sport at the Mabibibili community school in Mozambique’s Matutuine district. 43 INDEX VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES SONADIETS ANGOLA In Angola Dietsmann, through its joint venture Sonadiets, is focusing on transferring know-how to communities through the Morro Bento Training Center. KNOW-HOW TRANSFER TO COMMUNITIES, MORRO BENTO TRAINING CENTER Sonadiets runs a training center dedicated to potential future employees. In line with clients’ requirements the training center offers several job-skills related modules (electricity, mechanics, instrumentation & HVAC) as well as general courses (mathematics, physics and English language) and HSE certification courses. Around 30% of the courses are theoretical and the remainder involve practical workshops in real working conditions. During 2015 the training center provided a total of 6,200 days of training to 60 trainees. As often as possible training courses are offered to potential future employees from the community. During 2015, for example, 14 non-employees benefitted from around 1,225 days of training. It should be mentioned that the Training Center operates in accordance with ISO 9001 standards. CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS COMMUNITIES’ INFRASTRUCTURE Sonadiets focuses its involvement with local communities on developing the training center in Morro Bento, a growing suburb a few miles outside Luanda. The training center is in a 1000m² field. Its two training buildings, which can host 50 trainees, include six fully-equipped classrooms, a rest area (kitchen and Wi-Fi), a large workshop containing the same technical equipment as is used on operating sites (instrumentation, mechanics, electricity) and an e-learning room (11 computers and monitored internet access), sanitary facilities and the training center administrative offices. All classrooms and workshops are equipped with air-conditioning & video projection equipment. TRAINING CENTER A class room Practical training equipment 44 VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES DIETSMANN CONGO THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO In the Republic of Congo Dietsmann’s long-term focus has been on sharing knowledge, including via its training center. It is worth highlighting that since 2004 when Dietsmann Congo started the nationalization process, 38 positions have been successfully nationalized. SHARING KNOWLEDGE WITH COMMUNITIES During 2015 Dietsmann Congo also improved the range of equipment in its training center. TRAINING CENTER A class room Practical training equipment Optalign smart Fixtur laser 45 INDEX VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES SUPPORTING LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS Dietsmann Congo is a regular sponsor of the local Rotary organization, which supports several local organizations, and each year Dietsmann Congo makes donations to other associations. A contribution was also provided to Unicongo, the Interprofessional Employers’ Union of Congo, for the world day for occupational health and safety. This union undertakes actions and projects aimed at supporting the development of local businesses. It also participates in the economic and social development of the country DIETSMANN GABON GABON Dietsmann is also focusing on knowledge sharing in Gabon through partnerships with several local training institutions. Dietsmann Gabon has also renovated and extended its own training center. KNOWLEDGE SHARING The Port-Gentil training center has existed for several years. It started with a single classroom with space for 20 trainees. In 2013 a second classroom for 10 trainees was added and an area in the workshop was set aside for the organization of practical sessions (mainly mechanics) and in 2014 a 60m2 workshop dedicated to instrumentation, mechanics and electricity and equipped with all the machinery and tools necessary for practical training was constructed. Training courses are conducted by Dietsmann Gabon’s own trainers instrumentation, mechanics and electricity who share their teaching time between Dietsmann Gabon and Dietsmann Congo. A dedicated space (workshop) containing the equipment for the three modules is being set up. As the three trainers are also in charge of carrying out know-how audits on the different operating sites they are aware of the actual working conditions on site. In addition, through an agreement with the local “Lycée Technique”, Dietsmann Gabon hosts at least three trainees per year and the Dietsmann Gabon HR Manager is involved in the end of year examination. Depending on the available work load Dietsmann also hosts one or two trainees from the local business school. On average 10 short-term placement trainees (less than two months) are hosted each year. When the opportunity is available some of the trainees hosted are hired. In 2015 five trainees were hired. Dietsmann Gabon is also deeply involved in a partnership with the CSP (Centre de Spécialisation Professionnelle of PortGentil). Each year a dozen students are selected for this training. The diploma they receive if they successfully complete the courses ensures them a good opportunity to start a career in the local industry. In order to support the education sector in Port Gentil, Dietsmann Gabon sponsors “L’ECOLE MIXTE”. This multi-cultural school includes 80% of nationals and delivers a high quality standard education. In 2015 Dietsmann Gabon also allocated a substantial amount for equipment to Port Gentil Raponda secondary school association. The aim is to renovate the water distribution network. 46 VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES TRAINING CENTER New workshop New classroom Small turbine for training mechanics Practical training equipment Donation for the Raponda College 47 INDEX VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES NETCODIETSMANN NIGERIA In Nigeria relations with local communities are formalized through tools implemented by the clients. For example, at the Afam VI operating site, NetcoDietsmann – Dietsmann’s Nigerian JV – follows the Shell Production Development Company’s (SPDC) system: consultation with local communities is handled by SPDC which operates a GMOU (General Memo Of Understanding) with communities affected by operations. NetcoDietsmann refers to this analysis to focus its contributions on identified needs. At the Okpai operating sites NetcoDietsmann follows the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) system: relations with local communities are conducted by a Public Affairs Coordinator. NetcoDietsmann refers to the recommendations of the Public Affairs Coordinator to focus its contributions on identified needs. In addition, regular meetings with local authorities ensure a continuous dialogue and frequent “Social Performance Workshops” are held with SPDC in order to improve social performances. This system allows the support to be focused on relevant needs. SUPPORTING AGRICULTURAL TRANING IN NIGERIA In addition to its initiatives focused on knowledge sharing, Dietsmann strengthens its involvement with local communities in Nigeria by providing financial support to Dadtco (Dutch Agricultural Development & Trading Company BV), a social organization which has considerable experience of working with cassava farmers in the developing world, providing them with agricultural input and selling their optimized produce in domestic and international markets. In line with its Corporate Social Responsibility policy, in 2015 Dietsmann assisted Dadtco with an application process for a European Union financial grant that will enable about 13,500 Nigerian cassava farmers to increase their production and the quality of their crop. PARTNERSHIP WITH A TRAINING CENTER NetcoDietsmann is supporting a capacity-building project through material contributions, such as classroom equipment, supplies and training modules, to a local technical school called Don Bosco. This contribution is especially meaningful because NetcoDietsmann is reliant on this training center for the provision of several technical training modules (primarily electricity, mechanics, instrumentation and general knowledge). TRANSFERRING KNOW-HOW TO COMMUNITIES In addition to its support of the Don Bosco training center NetcoDietsmann also regularly provides local young people with on-the-job training and theoretical knowledge courses. Every year NetcoDietsmann donates 1% of its revenue to the Nigerian Contents and Development Monitoring Board, whose mandate is to build local Capacity and competencies. 48 VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES DIETSMANN LIBYA LIBYA Although activities in Libya were limited during 2015 due to events that occurred during the year and the general unrest in the country, the Dietsmann joint-venture is still planning to continue the ongoing investments in know-how transfer and local workforce training. TRANSFERRING KNOW-HOW TO COMMUNITIES The training center was opened at the end of 2013. Dedicated infrastructures have been provided by Dietsmann and the classrooms have been equipped. The first intake of 20 young graduates, some of whom have since been hired, followed technical training courses related to oil & gas. The training center is open to any community member fitting the defined criteria. Due to the current security situation the Training Center is closed at present. The commitment is, however, still being kept and Libyan engineers are being sent to Toulouse for advanced training. The normal training courses have also been replaced with on-the-job training. Dietsmann aims to develop and support employment opportunities for its employees even if the business situation changes. The facilities are, however, available to Dietsmann’s clients, for example to provide specific training to their personnel. DIETSMANN BOLIVIA / PERU Dietsmann is contributing towards innovative initiatives that reflect its commitment to improving the wellbeing of local communities in the countries in which it operates. SUPPORTING HUMANITARIAN ASSOCIATION In line with the Company’s concerns regarding environment protection and solidarity, Dietsmann is providing financial support to “Rue des Enfants ESCP Europe” an internationally-oriented humanitarian association that undertakes actions to improve economic and social development in several countries. The two-year partnership, which started in 2015, will help with the implementation of two main projects: n T he creation of a pilot plant that will prepare breakfasts from local produce for the 56 students at the “Nuevo Amanecer” technical high school in Mecapaca, Bolivia. n T he development of the first network of guest houses in the Southeast of Peru, including renovations to the houses and media coverage to increase international awareness of “Casas del Peru”. DIETSMANN TECHNOLOGIES FRANCE In France relations with local communities are also focused on knowledge sharing. Every year Dietsmann Technologies France hosts trainees and apprentices, and also regularly trains employees from foreign offices/sites. In this context, during 2014 a training center was opened in Boussens. Dietsmann Technologies France also supports numerous local organizations and events organized by local communities including non-professional sports events and festive events. 49 INDEX VII DIETSMANN’S INVOLVEMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES KNOWLEDGE SHARING BOUSSENS QUALIFICATION COLLEGE Dietsmann Technologies France has increased its involvement in student and employment forums and participated in four events during the year. In 2014 Dietsmann Technologies France also opened a new training center focused on the certification process of Dietsmann employees from any of the subsidiaries. The primary aim of this center is to certificate Dietsmann technicians for specific operations, such as regular visits, controls, adjustments and tests. This certification process will improve the mobility of Dietsmann employees. The Boussens Qualification College In 2015, Boussens Qualification College trained a number of people in order to improve their skills in the administration, technical management, electrical habilitation and maintenance certifications on alternative compressors. This year, 14 of Dietsmann’s specialists from around the world were involved, for example in the qualification program for the alternative compressor. At the same time, the electrical qualification program for low and high voltage was developed. After carrying out an audit Total approved Dietsmann’s qualification methodology, which means the College can be used to train all the employees working on Total projects. New qualifications will be developed in the coming years. A total of 106 certificates have been awarded. The training sessions held in this training center also benefit local employees (Gabonese, Angolese, Portuguese, Libyan). Dietsmann’s willingness to develop its employees’ skills is reflected in its investment in and approach to training activities. The Group has continued to strengthen its training team. In 2015 the number of trainers rose to 26.

The company also focuses its efforts on implementing all the processes needed to guarantee this high level of efficiency and continuous improvement. This is processed through the ISO 9001 certification awarded to Group subsidiaries and is also based on the measurement of its Corporate Social Responsibility progress, which enables areas with scope for improvement to be identified. WORKING TOWARDS EXCELLENCE The Dietsmann Group (Support and Coordination Office in Monaco) has been ISO 9001:2008 certificated by the LRQA International Certification organization since 1996. Dietsmann Technologies SA in France and Dietsmann Technologies SrL in Italy have also been ISO 9001 certificated for a long time. The aim is to achieve quality certification in all the countries in which Dietsmann has operating sites. The Dietsmann Group certification was successfully renewed in 2014. Dietsmann Congo achieved ISO 9001 certification in November 2013. Quality certification achieved in Nigeria In NetcoDietsmann a Quality Manager is dedicated to the implementation of a quality system. As a result, NetcoDietsmann achieved ISO 9001 certification in 2014. Quality certification achieved in Gabon A dedicated person has been handling the development and implementation of a specific Quality Management System. In December 2014 Dietsmann Gabon successfully completed its ISO 9001 certification. Towards quality certification: Angola Sonadiets has allocated a dedicated employee, supported by a consultant, to implement a specific Quality Management System. The Quality Management System is being developed and will be supported by an additional, experienced, person in order to achieve ISO 9001 certification in 2015. 54 IX CONTINUOUS PROGRESS Corporate Social Responsibility overview table (see page 58) The aim of the Corporate Social Responsibility overview table is to enable Dietsmann’s performance to be assessed in respect of four main topics: n I ts responsibility regarding employees: “Social” section n I ts commitment to fighting against corruption: “Ethics” section n I ts initiatives to contribute towards local businesses and local development: “Local content” section n I ts involvement in protecting the environment: “Environment” section SOCIAL In this section, Dietsmann’s performance is assessed on the basis of several indicators. General indicators: n T otal workforce n W orkforce by job category ‘Position: world’ Specific indicators assessing Dietsmann’s ability to: n G enerate loyalty through attractive employment conditions > Employment n E nsure equal working conditions and career management for every employee whatever their gender, age or nationality > Diversity n P ropose dynamic career opportunities through skill enhancement > Training and career opportunities n F acilitate social dialogue with management and take employees’ expectations into account > Social dialogue and cohesion n P rotect employees’ physical integrity > Health and safety n P revent any form of discrimination or psychological maltreatment > Employee protection and fight against discrimination ETHICS The Ethics section includes three indicators relating to Dietsmann’s efforts to fight against corruption. The two “Anti-corruption” indicators monitor the implementation of ethics training and the number of related grievances received. The “Business partner screening” indicator enables the extent to which Dietsmann ensures it is not complicit in ethical deviation through its partners’ potential non-compliance to be assessed. 55 INDEX IX CONTINUOUS PROGRESS LOCAL CONTENT The term ‘local content’ describes the positive effects a foreign company or industry can have on the areas in which it operates. Companies can provide measurable benefits by: n B uying supplies and services locally. n E mploying and training local people. n S upporting community development. Community development support includes social investment programs involving companies making voluntary contributions towards the positive development of the communities and societies in the region and/or country in which they are operating. Such programs typically donate to, or develop skills and resources in, local communities and local or national institutions. The assessment of Dietsmann’s level of performance in terms of local content is divided into three related sub-sections: n L ocal purchases Dietsmann’s policy is to maximize purchasing from local suppliers and to help these suppliers achieve the required performance standards. As a result, in most of the countries in which it operates Dietsmann exceeds local regulations related to local purchase. In countries in which high technology equipment is not manufactured locally the required equipment is purchased through Dietsmann’s French procurement department. n L ocal employment This subsection assesses the level of career opportunity offered to national employees through nationalization plans and through the training courses provided to local residents. n L ocal community initiatives In line with Dietsmann’s sustainability project development axis, the Company’s local community initiatives focus on knowledge sharing. The indicators include the number of days of training provided to nationals not on the payroll and the efforts dedicated to building and equipping Dietsmann’s own training centers as these centers are long-lasting infrastructure. The partnerships with technical schools, schools and universities reflect the Company’s involvement in supporting the future of local communities. Another indicator sums up the total amount dedicated to the socio-economic development of local communities. Dietsmann believes that investing in local content could also mitigate some of the risks of doing business in foreign countries by creating healthy and sustainable relations with local communities. 56 IX CONTINUOUS PROGRESS ENVIRONMENT The Environment section assesses Dietsmann level of performance in protecting the environment. As the Company’s activities are primarily the provision of services, the key factors for Dietsmann are ensuring proper waste management, the implementation of a global environmental management system and the training of employees in respect of environment-related issues. Although the Company’s CO2 emissions are very low due to the nature of its activities, the trend is to monitor emissions so as to ensure the level never exceeds the legal limit, gain an insight into areas with scope for improvement and implement measures to achieve improvement.
