Growing global competition directly affects all companies. Innovations emerging in one country spread throughout the world in a blink of an eye. A faster pace of life and continuous pursuit of better results throws us into never-ending vortex of work and very often a thought that we spend too little time with our families and people we care about crosses our mind. And yet, no matter how high company or personal achievements are, we must always bear in mind that we remain members of the society. Thus, we should always remember it is important to find and devote time to people and organisations, communities we are part of. Noticing and helping to meet the needs of adjacent towns or schools makes our activities so much more meaningful. I personally find development and activities of companies, which pay a lot of attention to the environment, communities around them, and mutual assistance, more sustainable. So why don’t we devote more time and attention to those around us and make our life even more fulfilling.
