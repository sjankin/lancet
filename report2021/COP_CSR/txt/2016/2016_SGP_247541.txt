Annual water use in our Annual office paper use properties per square metre per staff kg/FTE/year We estimate that lighting consumes around 20 per cent of kL/m2/year a building’s energy. To lessen our demand on electricity and other imported power sources, we are replacing our existing lighting with energy efficient lighting such as LED lighting 23.4 with motion sensor controls. LED lights use around 72% 17.7 57% 80 per cent less energy than conventional lighting. 1.8 In 2015, eight markets upgraded their lighting systems 0.9 10.0 to LEDs, which saved us over $250,000 in operating costs. 0.5 In Singapore, we opened a new office that uses LED lighting and provides us with greater control over our energy use.

We work closely with local partners and our employee volunteers to deliver programmes focused on health and education. Our global community programmes include Seeing is Believing to address avoidable blindness; Goal to help empower adolescent girls and young women through sports and life skills training; and financial education to build the financial capability of youth and entrepreneurs.

Clients: we engage with our clients to ensure that the products and services we offer meet their personal and business needs. Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys across our markets measure client satisfaction with our products and services. In 2015, our relative global NPS was four points above the market average. Employees: we have ongoing dialogue with our employees for feedback on our role as an employer. To measure staff engagement related to employee volunteering, we conduct an annual survey through True Impact, an independent organisation. In 2015, we found that 97 per cent of employees surveyed indicated that volunteering was a positive contributor to their job satisfaction. Communities: we work with local and international organisations to understand the social and economic issues in the communities where we operate. Through our Seeing is Believing (SiB) programme, we work with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and governments across 29 markets to deliver eye health projects. Investors: we engage with investors and analysts on our business strategy through one-to-one meetings and roundtables, and announced our new strategy in November 2015. We also participate in sustainability surveys and indices including the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, FTSE4Good and the Carbon Disclose Project. Regulators, governments and industry bodies: we work with regulators and governments to promote the development of financial markets, products and services. In 2015, we continued our role as sovereign ratings advisor to 10 governments. In addition, we engage with industry bodies and global forums such as the Clinton Global Initiative and the Banking Environment Initiative to address sustainability issues in our markets.

This is to allow sufficient time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publication of results. Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same period rather than the calendar year used in financial reporting. This is consistent with international carbon reporting practice. ‘Measured’ data is collected from Global Environment Management System (GEMS) properties, defined as all properties that are over 10,000 square feet for energy and water. For paper and business travel, it is defined per full-time employee. ‘Scaled-up’ data is an extrapolation made from measured data to account for 100 per cent of the Group’s occupied property footprint for energy and water. For paper and business travel, it is defined per full-time employee (as at the end of the reporting period). Carbon abatement benefit from indirect renewable energy is not taken into account. Total energy use is normalised to reflect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period. Net internal areas used for water use intensity do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas. Warehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes, residential properties, space occupied by automated teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation. Scope 3 emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 36 countries, based on seating class and distance flown. As we operate largely outside of the UK, all flights domestic or international with flight distance of less than 463km, labelled by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) as ‘domestic flights’, have been classified as ‘short haul’. All flights with distance flown ranging from 463 to 1,108km, labelled by DEFRA as ‘short haul’ have been classified as ‘medium haul’. PwC is our independent third-party assurance provider for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In 2015, our measured Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions were assured by PwC, ensuring the accuracy and credibility of our reporting.
