COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS IMPLEMENTING UN GLOBAL COMPACT PRINCIPLES IN BIOELEKTRA GROUP S.A. SEPTEMBER 2015 – S EPTEMBER 2016 BIOELEKTRA GROUP ACTIVITY Bioelektra Group is a Polish company founded in 2010 and the owner of innovative RotoSTERIL technology of waste treatment. We remain active in areas of circular economy, waste management and recycling. Sustainable business is our main principle and we encourage our stakeholders, communities and local authorities to follow it. Our main goals are:  to recover every recyclable material from waste and fully eliminate waste landfills  to simplify waste collection systems as much as possible, so all the people worldwide will be easily able to participate in the system  to save the energy and reduce GHG s emissions, by producing green, renewable fuels and minimizing production from primary raw materials and fuels Bioelektra main office is located in Warsaw. We also own the facility of mechanical – heat waste treatment in Różanki (northern Poland), which is the first implementation of our technology and functioning example of the simplest and most effective waste management system. Bioelektra joined UN Global Compact in September 2015. Our main focus are environmental issues and sustainable development implementation in waste management in Poland and globally. We also have in mind all the CSR matters in our daily operations, above all excellent working conditions of our workers. During the last year we were engaged in the series of actions and events aiming to implement the CSR principles in practice and to share the knowledge with stakeholders and communities. But primarily, we focused on daily implementation of UNGC Ten Principles. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIONS DAILY ACTIONS 1. Human Rights  We ensure healthy environment for our workers, both in the office and the waste treatment facility. According to the legal regulations, we conduct OSH (occupational safety and health) analysis and OSH training for our employees.  We respect and take care for employees’ working conditions, for example we ensure home working possibilities, provide fully equipped kitchen and sanitary facilities (including healthy beverages and snacks)  We ensure constant development for our employees, which includes participation in specific trainings and conferences  We protect workers from any discrimination or workplace harassment, including physical, verbal, sexual or psychological harassment, abuse or threats  In our production plant: we eliminate people contact with waste, which is potentially harmful and onerous – waste treatment and segregation line is fully automatic, workers’ duties include only logistics, machines operation and quality control  In our production plant: we take all measures to provide safe and suitable work conditions during the waste treatment process (elimination of potentially harmful ingredients or designs, ensuring sanitary facilities, protective clothing) 2. Labour  We implement in our facility employees-friendly shift system and do not participate in any form of forced or bonded labour  We ensure very good wage standards and the salary system which includes full set of social security and health insurance contributions  We respect employees’ right to rest and encourage them to take vacation regularly  We provide relevant and objective criteria for employment-related decisions 3. Environment  We eliminate any negative impact of waste treatment process on environment, which includes: o odors elimination (it results from the technology parameters: waste are sterilized in the first stage of the process, which aims to eliminate microorganisms and decay processes; un-treated waste is stored in closed space in hall) o pollution control (dust extraction systems, water recirculation, clean LPG as fuel) o proper waste treatment (all waste is sterilized, clean processed fractions are stored in separate containers, we ensure collection of the fractions for further recycling and recovery), o proper waste water treatment (waste water from waste dehydration is collected in hermetic tanks and collected by qualified, licensed company), o proper components utilization (all the waste components from technological line are treated in accordance with instructions)  We implement circular economy in the simplest waste management system with no need of separate collection, so we minimize the emissions from waste transport  We aim to reduce carbon footprint and GHGs emissions – in our process we produce clean secondary raw materials and biomass from waste which aims to be fertilizer, soil improver or green fuel. Recycling and recovering these fractions have positive impact on environment by reducing primary production, primary raw materials extraction and significantly saves energy.  We ensure emergency procedures to prevent and address accidents affecting the environment and human health  We minimize the use and ensure safe handling and storage of chemical and other dangerous substances  We also take measures to relief the environment with ecological activities in our office, by: o energy – saving practices (low energy solutions in the office, new energy saving PCs, printers and other machines, procedure of turning of all the equipment during the nonoffice hours, videoconferences organization instead of travelling) o water – saving practices (usage of dishwasher) 4. Anti-Corruption  We ensure anti-corruption standards in contracts with our business partners  We ensure that internal procedures support the company’s anti-corruption commitment ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES Bioelektra participated in the number of events which are part of our company’s policies for sustainable business maintenance, CSR rules meeting and circular economy implementation, which are:  Joining the UN Global Compact Program Board by Jarosław Drozd, Bioelektra Group President of the Board and CEO – which let us contribute to the program and activity of Global Compact in Poland, share our knowledge and experience with other participants and reach more people with our message and objectives  Contribution to Yearbook 2015 / 2016 – we focused on sharing our knowledge on waste management and its influence on environment, especially in the terms of climate protection  Planned contribution to Yearbook 2016 / 2017 – we declared to focus on global recycling challenges and innovations, in terms of UE’s requirements  Publications in national media – we shared our knowledge on waste management influence on: environment, climate protection, GHGs emissions. We believe in transversal co-operation (waste management, energy sector, agriculture and others) for circular economy implementation and environmental protection – so one of our main focuses is to encourage authorities and communities to commit in such co-operation. During the last year we reached among the others: o national newspapers: http://www4.rp.pl/Opinie/310089820-Odpady-maja-najwiekszypotencjal-redukcji-gazow-cieplarnianych.html o national radio: http://www.polskieradio.pl/130/4212/Artykul/1555099/ and http://www.polskieradio.pl/130/2787/Artykul/1611205/ o branch media: http://www.teraz-srodowisko.pl/aktualnosci/Lepsze-gospodarowanieodpadami-zredukuje-emisje-gazow-cieplarnianych-1640.html o popular science podcasts: http://nauka.podkasty.info/odc/Bioelektra o specialist conferences and forums: http://www.forbes.pl/pawel-miller-bioelektra-naszepaliwo-moze-wzmocnic-bezpieczenstwo-energetyczne,wideo,199723,1,1.html  Dialogue with local and national authorities: we participate in conferences and meetings aiming to implement circular economy and proper waste management in Poland, e.g. strategic economy conferences, industry specialists’ meetings in administrative bodies MEASUREMENTS OF OUTCOMES  No employees were dismissed due to diversity factors  No employees quit their job due to diversity factors nor bad work conditions  Rate of occupational diseases, injuries, and absenteeism remains very low  No negative impact on environment was noticed from the process  Ecological effectiveness of the process remains very high: all the separated plastics, metals and glass were recycled, biomass was used for energy production  No corruption intentions were noticed in the company
