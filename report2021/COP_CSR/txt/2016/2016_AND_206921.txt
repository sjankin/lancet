For this reason, Tag Systems takes into account the following principles which are part of our integrated management policy: • We apply environmental and energy-saving criteria in our processes, we have a rational use of all the natural resources that we have and we strive to reduce emissions and waste management. • We comply with the environmental and energy legislation, as well as other commitments made on a voluntary basis. • We provide training and allocate the necessary resources so that our employees actively participate in the achievement of environmental objectives. • We make efforts to continuously improve our integrated management system, which allows us to improve its effectiveness and at the same time be more efficient. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 ENVIRONMENT 19 Environmental Indicators MANAGEMENT OF ENERGY RESOURCES AND CONSUMPTION One of the objectives of the company is to monitor the figures of energy and consumption of processes, with the aim of improving year after year, becoming more efficient and trying to minimise the environmental impact of the company and the associated costs. 2012 2013 2014 Electrical energy consumption (MWh) 703,53 788,68 844,23 Water consumption (m3) 8.399 9.789 6.433 Diesel consumption (litres) 13.143 10.000 13.850 Paper consumption (kg) 888 804 989 Not all of the consumption of energy resources can be reduced annually as many are directly linked to the production process, but we make emphasis to raise staff awareness and sensibility to the use of resources, and, when possible, technical investments are made in our facilities in order to be more efficient in the use of these resources.

WASTE Since 2011, Tag Systems has had an internal procedure of selective waste collection, with the aim that all employees of the company actively participate in it.

For this reason, Tag Systems has numerous integrated quality control points along the different stages of production, ensuring the highest level of quality throughout the manufacturing process. The quality control points are based on different regulations and standards that define the requirements for the manufacture of plastic cards. Starting from the CQM (Card Quality Management) programme based on some of the following regulations and requirements: • ISO/IEC 7810 • ISO/IEC 7811-1, ISO/IEC 7811-2, ISO/IEC 7811-6 • ISO/IEC 7816-1, ISO/IEC 7816-2, ISO/IEC 7816-3 • ISO/IEC 10373-1, ISO/IEC 10373-2, ISO/IEC 10373-3 • Interoperability of the chip with terminals according to EMV specifications • Design Requirements according to the manuals of the different payment schemes The Quality Control Department inspects all finished products in accordance with the ISO AQL (Acceptance Quality Level) sampling table. At Tag Systems we seek the continuous improvement of our processes with the aim of satisfying the needs of our customers. For this reason, when we receive a complaint, a process of complaint management starts under which all the necessary preventive and corrective actions are taken to correct the problem and to avoid it in the future. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 PRODUCT QUALITY AND SUPPLIERS 23 Suppliers Tag Systems cares greatly about the materials with which it makes its cards, that is why we select the best raw materials through a strict approval process. Each time that goods are received at our facilities, they are subject to entrance controls in order to determine their conformity. Due to these entrance controls, an increase in the Quality level has been achieved since, if any of the raw materials that we use in the production of the cards are defective, it is detected immediately thus preventing potential problems in production. In addition, Tag Systems not only prioritises the quality of the raw materials it purchases, but also takes into account those suppliers who, at the time of manufacturing their products, create a lower environmental impact, the fact of having implemented environmental management systems being one of the requirements in the evaluation of suppliers. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 PRODUCT QUALITY AND SUPPLIERS 24 GLOBAL COMPACT Support to the Global Compact The Corporate Social Responsibility Report of Tag Systems describes the actions taken by the company based on the Ten Principles of the Global Compact of the United Nations that the company has been supporting since 2011.
