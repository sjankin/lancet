Appendices CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 CORPORATE PROFILE Consolidated Contractors Company (CCC) is a contracting company formed in 1952 and incorporated under the laws of Lebanon. The managing office is presently located in Athens, Greece. CCC is by far the largest Engineering, Procurement and Construction Company in the Middle East and is currently rated by the ENR magazine as #22 among International Contractor Companies. CCC currently operates in 40 countries across 5 continents, employs over 110,000 employees from over 85 nationalities, building some of the most challenging and complex facilities. Drawing on its long and successful experience, CCC can provide a full range of projects services, from Project Development, through detailed Engineering, Procurement and Construction, to StartUp, Operation and Maintenance pertaining to the following:  Buildings and Civil Engineering Works  Oil & Gas, and Water Pipelines  Oil & Gas, and Petrochemical Plants and Refineries  Power Plants  Marine Works  Offshore Installations  Maintenance of Mechanical Installations and Underwater Structures CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 WE SUPPORT The UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles Brief support statement As part of the requirements of the UN Global Compact’s Initiative, submission of an annual Communication on Progress report is needed. CCC has approached this response in relation to the following four key areas – Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. CCC’s ongoing commitments display constant focus on core values and principles such as the development and growth of staff on all levels, the sense of belonging and harmony for all manpower, continuous propagation of innovation, sustainable commitments to the environment and anti-corruption ideals as well as the utmost respect of cultural identities on company projects. This report was created and developed by a select taskforce composed of staff stemming from diverse departments such as human resources, renewable energies and innovative solutions, construction support and development and health and safety. The objective of this taskforce is to examine and access the sustainability impact of the company across all facets of its operations. Meetings are held every month in order to conduct discussions and assessments of various parameters in order to constantly filter information that will eventually be utilized to compile the report using the contribution and input on all members of this taskforce. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS UN GC Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights CCC upholds and respects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the historic declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948. In its work related Article 23, the declaration highlights everyone’s right to “favorable conditions of work”. In the context of construction, favorable work conditions significantly relate to:  Worker accommodation,  Food and hygiene, and  Safety and the relevant to these three parameters regulations, standards and achievements on our project sites. Workforce well-being is at the core of human rights. Work stress, tight deadlines, distance from family, long working hours and many other life and work pressures are contributing factors that affect our workforce’s welfare and lead to stress, depression and feelings of anxiety among others. In CCC, we acknowledge the fact that that the good of our workforce is beneficial for both the staff and the business and we are performing a number of actions to improve workforce well-being beyond the industry standards, namely: 1. Management of work related stress On all our projects, we conduct Pre-employment Medical Screening that covers the psychological aspect of the workforce. On regular bases (i.e. semiannually or annually) a post-employment medical screening follow up is conducted, part of which measures any work related stress. With stress becoming such a valid concern, we are including it as a factor in our risk assessments and therefore aim to cut down these figures to as low as reasonably practicable. 2. Creation of a healthy working environment We strive to create an environment for our project staff that is both safe to work for and healthy to live in. We pay particular attention to helping our workforce release the work stress of the day. We achieve this by constantly improving the conditions of our worksites and off accommodation by: a) Ensuring that everyone involved in the production of our work is treated with respect and that the worksite is safe, comfortable and conducive for work b) Developing and maintaining a worker welfare plan CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 c) Ensuring worker accommodation and associated facilities cater to the needs of the staff by providing access to areas such as social events, vocational training, retail services, to name a few d) Providing for different nationalities to be in separate dormitories e) Providing recreational and welfare facilities such as cinema rooms, exercise and outdoor recreational areas, as well as sporting and religious facilities 3. Adding to workforce benefits We run generous monthly incentive schemes for good HSE performance for construction personnel, HSE staff and office staff (Administration, Technical support, others, etc.), such as best near miss report, hazard spot prizes, supervisor/foreman of the month and other 4. Communication with the workforce Often, the best way to ensure that our staff have everything they need is to ask them. The benefits of doing so are two-fold. First, we will be getting the information we need on how to manage our workplace. Secondly, communication in itself is one of the most effective ways to boost morale. Additionally, a Labor HSE Committee is established on all CCC Projects. In this committee, the labor force are more involved in safety in order to foster ownership and feedback in terms of safety issues at the worksite. Through this committee, selected representatives of the workforce have the capacity to raise safety enhancing ideas or concerns to the Project Management Team. 5. Medical/Health Culture Building a culture of health involves all levels of the organization and establishes the workplace health program as a routine part of business operations aligned with overall business goals. CCC’s culture of health is the creation of a working environment where employee health and safety is valued, supported and promoted through workplace health programs, policies and benefits. The wellness lifestyle is a positive notion for achieving wellness when we find ourselves in good enough shape to do what we like without difficulty, when we can manage stress without being overcome by it, when food is a healthy pleasure and not a daily obsession, when physical activity and exercise are an integral part of our week. To achieve the above goals, CCC has a health/medical policy that is highlighted by the health prevention and reporting as well as the health management promotion initiatives. Our above initiatives and their results have not gone unnoticed at our “Expansion of the Bab Gas Compression Project” in Habshan, outside Abu Dhabi UAE, where our employer acknowledged our application of Safe Working Practices during 2015 with the below Certificate of Appreciation. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 Below we have a selection of representative photos displaying our qualified accommodation camps and food & hygiene practices at our BTG Camp Operation in Habshan, Abu Dhabi UAE: CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 Our kitchens cater to the various dietary habits of our multicultural workforce (photos from our Riyadh Metro Project South Village Mess Hall): CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 UN GC Principle 2: Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses In CCC, we understand the importance of due diligence with respect to the Human Rights practices of our subcontractors and suppliers. A typical example is demonstrated in our relevant HSE policies. All subcontractors, stakeholders and suppliers are to implement and follow CCC HSE Management System requirements as follows: 1. The subcontractors shall fully meet and comply with the requirements of CCC HSE&S management system, HSE&S management plan and HSE&S procedures as applicable to and approved for the specific project. 2. For specialized tasks, activities or work scope that are to be executed by a subcontractor, and are not covered by CCC HSE&S management system, HSE&S plan, or HSE&S procedures, then the Subcontractor shall submit their HSE&S Procedures covering the specialized tasks, activities, or scope of work for CCC approval. Approved procedures covering the specialized tasks, activities, or scope of work shall be considered part of CCC HSE&S management system, HSE&S plan, and HSE&S procedures applicable to and approved for the project. 3. In the case where subcontractors are required to have their own HSE&S staff for any activity they will have to submit to CCC Project HSE&S department, CVs of their staff for approval by the CCC HSE Department. 4. We ensure that only approved HSE&S staff are working on our projects. The approved HSE&S staff cannot be replaced or released without CCC’s prior written approval. Our Midfield Terminal Project in Abu Dhabi UAE remains our flagship project with respect to due diligence practices. As stipulated in the contract documents, all engineering, construction and commissioning works on the Abu Dhabi International Airport – Main Terminal Building project shall be executed in accordance with the local Estidama principles & requirements. Estidama, which means sustainability in Arabic, is an integral part of Abu Dhabi's Vision for 2030. The Estidama Pearl Rating System is a framework for sustainable design, construction and operation across the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi Executive Council has mandated that all new communities, buildings and villas be required to achieve the minimum one Pearl rating. Government-owned and operated buildings are required to achieve at least a two Pearl rating. MTB has a 3-Pearl Rating requirement which means that the requirements are of the strictest to be found in the industry. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 Human Rights due diligence as demonstrated in accommodation arrangements, food & hygiene conditions and Labor practices are very high on Estidama’s agenda. In our capacity as the General Contractor (in the TCA JV) we require all subcontractors to fully comply with and adhere to the Estidama requirements. All Subcontractors are required to have fully made themselves aware of the ESTIDAMA requirements for the works. They are also requested to submit an “Estidama Execution & Compliance Strategy” that clearly explains how they intend to manage and execute the Estidama obligations for the three pearl rating. The plan should be submitted to the General Contractor before mobilization. Subcontractor compliance is ensured by close monitoring of their record through all the commercial and construction phases: Bidding Stage:  Project specific sustainability requirements are embedded in the tender documents  Clarification meetings are held with various bidders to ensure they fully understand the requirements Selection Stage:  Upon selection of subcontractor a dedicated sustainability kick-off meeting (KOM) is held in the presence of their senior project management team, the Contract sustainability requirements are again presented and a CD containing all the regulatory framework documentations (plans, procedures, laws, etc.) is handed over to the subcontractor and an acknowledgement sheet is collected and kept on file Execution Stage:  Training: subcontractor senior staff and related personnel are trained by the main contractor on the project’s sustainability principles. Each subcontractor is then requested to establish and implement their own detailed sustainability training plan (either in-house training or utilizing 3rd party consultants)  Deliverables: the subcontractor is requested to put forward a submittal log/matrix for their own sustainability plans within the agreed period CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015  Reporting: subcontractors are enforced to report their sustainability performance indicators on weekly and monthly bases using the provided templates. Main Contractor then run “trend analysis” reviews and compare the actual performance against the targets & goals  Sustainability audits are scheduled and carried out using standardized template/checklist  Delays or non-compliance is penalized through withholding monthly progress payments  Compliance and good performance is rewarded monthly through Subcontractors’ League where the leading subcontractor is awarded the “Best Subcontractor of The Month ” Award Post-Completion Stage:  The subcontractor’s performance (in terms of sustainability, HSE, Estidama, etc…) during the whole duration of the project is evaluated using the Subcontractor Performance Report template. This report can later on be used as a tool to decide on whether this particular subcontractor can be recommended for future jobs or not Our MTB project offers us the necessary experience and knowledge to expand the industry leading due diligence practices to an ever-increasing number of our construction sites, which remains our main goal. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 LABOUR UN GC Principle 3 – The support of freedom of association and the recognition of the right to collective bargaining The engagement and development of our people are critical to business operations. Professional development is constantly one of our top priorities as diversity is constantly prevalent in the workforce. Taking all these factors into consideration the company advocates constant and open communication between all levels of staff and this is supported though the open channels that are in place. We are continuously working towards the local advancement of communities and their people in the countries that we operate and we have set targets to support the organization of programs designed to maximize value creation, including promotion of employee volunteering, creation of employment positions and education programs. In 2015, there were no human rights breaches reported at any of our sites, projects and offices. UN GC Principle 4: The elimination of all forced and compulsory labour As a devoted upholder of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), CCC adheres to the labour laws of each country and provides its staff with the relevant and applicable compensation. All suppliers used by CCC have provided the company with straightforward and descriptive licenses for their scope of work and supplying of materials and services. We also check that suppliers utilized by the company adhere to federal labor laws of each reciprocal country for avoidance of unbecoming business practices. UN GC Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour CCC is adamant in the international directives of not employing persons below 18 years old at all projects, areas and offices. This notion has been a core ideal and procedure of the company since its inception. We support all initiatives directed towards the protection and propagation of children’s health, wellbeing and interests. These notions are achieved with direct engagement of staff members’ children in various company activities such as family activity days, interactive child-parent seminars, company excursions and participation in various volunteering programs to name a few. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 UN GC Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation The company currently employs over 110,000 staff from over 85 nationalities around the world, reflecting an 8.6% increase when compared to end 2014. This rise is mainly reflected in the difference of an increase of 3% in the daily skilled staff, whereas a reduction can be seen in management and commercial staff and the daily unskilled staff, a decrease of 1% and 2% respectively. The distribution of work force for 2015 is shown below: An effort was made during 2015 to tabulate and present concise male/female ratios in the countries where social challenges should be met concerning female employment. Areas of operation where this occurs come to a total of ten, in addition to European countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy and Greece where the managing office is located. The aggregate amounts of the Middle Eastern countries reflect a 12.3/87.7 female/male ratio of staff and European staff amounts to a total of 33%. Collectively, the female/male ratio of the entire company comes to 18/82, expected to not have large fluctuations in the future as it has also been observed in the past. Making changes in a work environment entails an all-level engagement. The key is proceeding with simple amendments that can assist in a smooth transition. Efforts can be then multiplied through raising understanding that can be propagated through the operational network or for individual needs and practices inside the organization. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 The above is evident through the several seminars, workshops and vocational training that are held on an annual basis for staff at project offices and sites. Once again, for 2015, training has been calculated to equal to one training day per employee regardless of where he/she is located. We are continuously adhering to policies put in place when it comes to equal opportunities and treatment in employment and occupation regardless of gender, race, religion, nationality and other such demographics. Differentiation of staff is made with criteria such as qualifications, work experience, skills acquired and needed, specialized education undertaken, etc., that are relevant to each unique job position. Communication is the most significant aspect to guarantee all-time efficiency. If adequately provided, guidance and orientation can motivate staff to get enthusiastically involved in implementing policy, and have impactful consequences internally and externally. Open lines of communication are constantly encouraged and promoted in all areas of operations as this helps promote active engagement between management and staff for addressing issues and finding solutions to any problems that may arise. Engagement and consultation is supported by communication achieved through the quarterly Bulletin magazine where featured articles discuss an array of subjects of the company, and the Knowledge Management internal platform where staff can display write-ups on several business, social and vocational issues occurring in the company. This platform also allows for other staff who read these articles to comment and weigh in their opinions in order to engage further interaction. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 ENVIRONMENT UN GC Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Sustainability Policy CCC’s Sustainability Policy (enclosed) crystalizes our environmental commitment with respect to our construction operations, including alleviating environmental impact, efficient use of resources and prevention of site nuisance. This policy defines the framework of sustainability within CCC and reflects the basic principles of conduct. All CCC projects follow CCC’s Sustainability policy. (Appendix 1) Sustainability KPI’s Dedicated to fulfill our sustainability commitments and in accordance to this policy, CCC has established key performance indicators (KPI’s) and targets (example enclosed). These help us measure our economic, environmental and social performance. The KPI’s are necessary to keep track of our progress, drive improvements and prepare CCC’s Sustainability Report. The selected KPI’s focus on sustainability issues that matter the most to CCC and are based on internationally accepted indicators and values (Global Reporting Initiative, UN Global Compact). In 2012, we introduced a system for assessing our sustainability performance in relation to our projects and area offices. We closely monitor these metrics and share them widely within CCC. The objective being to work together towards overcoming challenges and fostering improvement ideas. In general terms, our KPI’s provide us with a basis for strategic thinking, detailed planning and guided execution in terms of managing our energy performance. (Appendix 2) UN GC Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility We emphasize on environmental excellence as being an integral part of our construction operations. One of the ways to achieve this is by applying initiatives to mitigate our environmental impact. At our projects, camps and offices CCC follows a meticulous sustainability strategy underpinned by detailed practices in the fields of energy efficiency, water conservation, renewable energy and overall environmental responsibility. Some of our applied measures include: solar power plants, PV powered lighting systems, wastewater treatment plants and recycling construction materials. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 Examples of CCC’s applied initiatives together with the specific results generated are included in the table below: # Initiative Result 1 1 368Kw PV Power Plant  Reduced electricity consumption by 381 Mwh per year  Offset 18,025 tons of CO2e emissions (annually) 2 PV lighting systems  Reduced electricity consumption by 15.5 Mwh per year  Offset 10,7 tons of CO2e emissions (annually) 3 Solar heated water system  Reduced electricity consumption by 547 Mwh per year  Offset 376.0 tons of CO2e emissions (annually) (Total capacity of 11,500 lt.) 4 Wastewater treatment plant Reduced freshwater supply by 410,000.0 m3 (MBR technology) (annually) (Avg. capacity 250 & 900 m3 /day) 5 Low flow sanitary fixture installations Reduced water consumption by 70,300 m3 (40%) 6 Recycling Concrete & Aggregates  Total of 992,160 m3 recycled concrete & aggregates  On-site recycling offset 2,469 tons of CO2e emissions (annually) by avoiding transportation Wastewater treatment plant PV Power Plant CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) 2015 In fact, CCC has been internationally recognized for its dedication to environmental responsibility and sustainable development. Specifically, it received the 2015 Gold Award for “Energy Efficiency-Private Sector” from the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy. The award was conferred in recognition of the initiatives applied at construction camps and site facilities of CCC projects in UAE (Habshan) and Qatar (Qusahwira). The Emirates Energy Award honors best practices and business leaders in the fields of energy efficiency and sustainability. Once again, CCC is confirming its worldwide leadership in construction this time by setting the example as a responsible corporate citizen.
