ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Year ended March 31, 2016 Global Challenge 2018 To All Our Stakeholders  2 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Since its founding in 1858, the Marubeni Group has strived to contribute to e ­ conomic development as well as to the betterment of people’s daily lives as a responsible member of society. Today, the global operating environment is undergoing drastic change, as illustrated by such trends as the slowdown in emerging economy countries, the end of favorable resource market conditions, and increasing political and geopolitical risks. However, even in the face of such change, Marubeni’s role remains the same. With the start of fiscal 2016, we kicked off our new mid-term management plan, Global Challenge 2018, or GC2018 for short. This plan defines our road to 2020 as being a quest to become a true global company. We will continue to relish great challenges as we grow, working to combine all our individual strengths to create a more powerful Marubeni Group capable of outperforming the top players in business fields and markets around the world.

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, consolidated net profit* amounted to ¥62.3 billion, significantly lower than anticipated primarily due to the recording of impairment losses related to the deterioration of the resource market. The inability to achieve our initial forecast was disappointing, especially given the importance of our performance this year in light of the large downward revision to the previous fiscal year’s target. Unfortunately, we suffered substantial impairment losses for the second consecutive year. As a representative of Marubeni’s management, I am fully aware of the gravity of this situation. We are now forced to weather an adverse operating environment that is unlike any before. Nevertheless, we remain committed to returning to the path of sustainable growth. I hope that we can look forward to your ongoing support as we brave the new frontiers that lie ahead.

This outcome was largely due to impairment losses recorded primarily in natural resources-related businesses. Looking at the balance sheet, net interest-bearing debt was down ¥125.2 billion, to ¥2,762.5 billion, following a substantial increase in free cash flow resulting from exhaustive efforts to improve the efficiency of working capital. At the same time, total equity as of March 31, 2016, decreased ¥263.5 billion year on year, to ¥1,415.2 billion, mainly because of the impacts of yen appreciation and stock price declines.

In this environment, we suffered a substantial decline in earnings stemming from impairment losses in natural resources-related businesses, and the net D/E ratio climbed to 1.95 times on March 31, 2016, as a result. This significant divergence from the level of 1.50 times initially targeted in the previous mid-term management plan, Global Challenge 2015, makes it clear that improving our financial position is a matter of urgency. The future of the natural resources market and domestic and overseas economic conditions remains uncertain, and it was under these circumstances that we launched our new mid-term management plan, Global Challenge 2018, or GC2018, in the year ending March 31, 2017. In order to achieve the goals of GC2018, the improvement of our financial position will be a top priority, particularly during the year ending March 31, 2017, and we therefore intend to focus on advancing measures for enhancing our balance sheet and cash flows and strengthening the profitability of existing businesses. Enhancing the Balance Sheet and Cash Flows In the year ending March 31, 2017, we aim to achieve a positive free cash flow and maximize the amount of this cash flow on a single-year basis. All business segments have set minimum free cash flow targets, and we are taking steps to enhance our cash generation capacity at the base level of operations as well as at the management level. Through these efforts, we will target a net D/E ratio of less than 1.7 times for March 31, 2017. Strengthening Existing Business Profitability As we strive to strengthen operations in business fields in which the Group excels, namely agriculturerelated businesses, infrastructure businesses, and transport-related businesses, we will raise the bar for all existing businesses. At the same time, we will strategically exit unprofitable businesses, businesses that have peaked out, low-growth businesses, and other non-core businesses to thoroughly improve the quality of our existing asset and business portfolios. Measures for enhancing our balance sheet and cash flows and strengthening the profitability of existing businesses will be placed among our top priorities for the year ending March 31, 2017, and, by advancing these measures, we will blaze a trail toward the success of GC2018. MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 13 Message from the CFO  Policies as Chairman of Investment and Credit Committee New Investment Plans under GC2018 While improving our financial position is a top priority, this does not eliminate the need to allocate funds toward new investments in order to achieve sustainable income growth. GC2018 earmarks a total of ¥1 trillion for use in new investments over its three-year period. In selecting candidates for these investments, we will prioritize those projects that will help us maximize cash flows. With the start of GC2018, we defined four business model categories that we will seek to further develop and promote: distribution businesses, finance businesses, stable earnings-type businesses, and natural resource investments. We have laid out clear business and investment strategies based on the differing operating environments and business characteristics in each of these categories, and advancing these strategies will be a major objective going forward. In the distribution businesses and finance businesses categories, we will participate in projects through majority investment, in principle, and work to maximize the cash flows generated through enhanced cash flow control and other management practices. Meanwhile, in stable earnings-type businesses, which tend to have high dividend payout ratios and of which overseas IPP, projects are a representative example, we will generally acquire minority stakes with the aim of improving capital efficiency. At the same time, we will decide on financial recovery mechanisms with partners ahead of time to quickly recover our investment. Under GC2018, we will strive to generate stable earnings and cash flows by increasing the portion of funds allocated to non-natural resources-related businesses, where earnings potential is steadily growing, while focusing on strengthening these businesses based on the characteristics of the aforementioned business models. In fact, around 90% of new investments under GC2018 will be directed at non-natural resourcesrelated business model categories. In the year ending March 31, 2017, we plan to conduct new investments totaling ¥200.0 billion at most. In selecting these investments, we will carefully consider such factors as the extent to which we have been able to reduce interest-bearing debt and the level of our cash flows. We also realize how important it is to create highly accurate business plans when conducting investments, making sure not to bank on unrealistic growth projections or difficult-to-achieve synergies. We are thus committed to formulating precise business strategies based on the characteristics of each individual project, primarily focusing on those fields in which we can utilize our insight and functions, and steadily advancing these strategies. 14 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Marubeni Group aims to Become a True Global Company Emphasizing Cost of Capital Management At Marubeni, we practice management that emphasizes cost of capital. This type of management includes utilizing Marubeni’s unique management indicator called PATRAC, which stands for profit after tax less risk asset cost (see diagram below) and is designed to ensure earnings that exceed cost of capital, and making investment decisions based on an internal rate of return calculated for each potential investment. Since we introduced the PATRAC indicator, we have succeeded in realizing a targeted allocation of management resources by replacing unprofitable or inefficient assets. GC2018 targets return on equity of more than 10%. To achieve this target, we will heighten capital efficiency through measures such as replacing assets to improve profitability.

This water, known as ballast water, is generally loaded from the ocean at the port of discharging, and then discharged back into the ocean at the port of loading. This process can result in the transferring of microscopic aquatic organisms, contaminated in the water, into different regions of the ocean in which they do not normally dwell. Consequently, these transferred organisms could multiply, and disrupt the marine ecosystems and fishing industries of the Ballast Water Treatment Systems regions. Marubeni Group Company MMSL Japan Ltd. has been selling electrolysis ballast water treatment systems in Japan through an alliance with its manufacturer, Techcross Inc. of South Korea, since 2009. To date, MMSL Japan Ltd. has sold more than 250 units of the systems. The Marubeni Group will continue to spread the use of ballast water treatment systems in order to contribute to the preservation of marine ecosystems.

Marubeni’s Business and Supporting Foundations We have continued to grow our business in all business areas in which Marubeni excels, including agricultural material, grain, and other agriculture-related businesses; power, plant, and other infrastructure businesses; and automobile, trailer, aircraft, and other transportation-related businesses, while conducting asset replacements in this highly fluid market environment. Looking ahead, we will work to further improve and expand existing businesses while building even stronger relationships with prominent companies to pursue new businesses in the aforementioned fields as well as in other fields related to domestic demand, such as food products and chemicals. Through these efforts, we will strive to establish even stronger earnings bases. ASEAN Developing both BtoB and BtoC operations The ASEAN region continues to display robust economic growth, and the rising income levels in this region are expected to drive domestic demand expansion in various countries. Strong growth in infrastructure demand is also anticipated as countries pursue urbanization. In this region, Marubeni will endeavor to develop its businesses while focusing on three types of operations. These types include infrastructure businesses, power, water, and transportation infrastructure businesses for example, and trading businesses targeting domestic demand, such as in the fields of chemicals, metals, and food products. In addition to these areas of traditional strength, we will also deploy businesses of the third type, region-linked businesses, in fields such as ICT, distribution, and healthcare, which are expected to experience increased demand in conjunction with the growth of the middle class. In the future, the business environment is projected to undergo significant change due to factors such as the development of the ASEAN Economic Community and the formation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Faced with such change, we will leverage our networks consisting of prominent local companies as well as the insight and presence we have cultivated over our years of operating in the ASEAN region as we continue to focus on growing our business by developing both business-tobusiness, or BtoB, operations and business-to-consumer, or BtoC, operations. SUB-SAHARA Striving to grow together with sub-Saharan Africa from a midto long-term perspective For more than a decade, sub-Saharan Africa has enjoyed brisk economic growth supported by soaring resource prices. The economic climate in this region now, however, is quite harsh as a result of economic slowdown in China and falling resource prices. Regardless, there can be no doubt that this region has the potential to achieve astounding growth as its population increases. The three areas Marubeni should focus on in sub-Saharan Africa include power and other infrastructure projects, projects that correspond to industrial diversification needs in the region, and initiatives to cater to domestic demand in the commodity field. Going forward, we will invest in these areas from a midto long-term perspective and otherwise work to create new businesses. Addressing domestic demand has been placed as an important area for initiatives in sales and marketing operations under GC2018. Accordingly, we will endeavor to gain direct access to market needs through the acquisition of distribution platforms as we strive to grow our businesses together with the sub-Saharan African economy.

Global Challenge 2018, the new mid-term manTakao Kitabata agement plan that started with the year ending March Chief Independent Director 31, 2017, defines strategies and targets for natural resource and non-natural resource-related businesses. I believe that this policy is appropriate from the perspectives of risk management and corporate governance. Natural resource-related businesses are heavily impacted by international market conditions and can therefore suffer from substantial fluctuations in profits or losses that are beyond the control of a company. One characteristic of general trading companies are their various functions for hedging risks to reduce the impacts these risks may have. For this reason, I think Marubeni should work to contribute to the development of the global economy by seeking out business opportunities while appropriately managing risks. It is important to act without delay when the threat of an unexpected loss comes to light in order to maintain financial soundness, and this holds true for non-natural resource-related businesses as well.

MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 97 9 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Business Overview Marubeni Corporation (the “Company”) is a corporation domiciled in Japan. The Company and its domestic and overseas subsidiaries, which are controlled by the Company mainly through direct or indirect holdings of the majority of voting rights (together the “Companies”), engage in import and export trading of domestic and overseas products and commodities, including domestic and offshore trading in fields which cover a wide range of commodities such as Food & Consumer Products, Chemical & Forest Products, Energy & Metals, Power Projects & Plant, Transportation & Industrial Machinery, and others. In addition, the Companies offer various services and engage in diversified businesses such as investments in domestic and foreign businesses, exploration of natural resources and others.   The translation of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts for the year ended March 31, 2016 and at March 31, 2016 is included solely for the convenience of readers outside of Japan and has been made at ¥113 to $1, the exchange rate prevailing on March 31, 2016. The translation should not be construed as a representation that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 2. Basis of Presentation (1) Statements of Compliance The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. As the Company meets the requirements of a “Specified Company applying Designated International Financial Reporting Standards”, pursuant to Article 1-2 of the Ordinance on Terminology, Forms and Preparation Methods of Consolidated Financial Statements (Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance No. 28 of 1976, the “Consolidated Financial Statements Ordinance”), it has applied the provisions of Article 93 of said Ordinance. (2) Functional Currency and Presentation Currency The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are presented in Japanese yen, the functional currency of the Company, and amounts of less than one million yen are rounded to the nearest million yen. (3) Use of Estimates and Judgments Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make accounting estimates and assumptions, as necessary that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions due to their inherent uncertainty. Accounting estimates and assumptions that could significantly affect the Consolidated Financial Statements are as follows: ・ Write-down of inventories (Note 4 “Inventories”) ・ Impairment of property, plant and equipment (Note 5 “Property, Plant and Equipment”) ・ Impairment of intangible assets (Note 6 “Intangible Assets”) ・ Provisions (Note 7 “Provisions”) ・ Defined benefit obligation (Note 10 “Employee Benefits”) ・ Recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 12 “Income Taxes”) ・ Impairment of investments in associates and joint ventures (Note 13 “Associates and Joint Ventures”) ・ Valuation of financial instruments (Note 14 “Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures”) ・ Contingent liabilities (Note 23 “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities”)   Information related to judgments made by the Company that could significantly affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in the process of applying the accounting policies are as follows: ・ Scope of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (Note 3 “Significant Accounting Policies”) ・ Classification of non-current assets or disposal groups as held for sale (Note 8 “Non-current Assets or Disposal Groups Held for Sale) ・ Accounting for leases (Note 9 “Leases”) ・ Derecognition of financial assets (Note 14 “Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures”) 98 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 10 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 3. Significant Accounting Policies (1) Basis of Measurement The Consolidated Financial Statements, as stated in the accounting policies below, have been prepared on an historical cost basis, with the exception of certain current assets, financial instruments, and assets and liabilities relating to the post-employment benefit plan, which are measured at fair value. (2) Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of all domestic and foreign subsidiaries under the control of the Company either through direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest or by other means. Intercompany transactions and accounts between the Companies are eliminated. To align the reporting periods of subsidiaries that have a financial year end that is different from the financial year end of the Company (March 31) due to unavoidable reasons such as compliance with the local legal system of the country in which they operate, subsidiaries prepare additional financial statements Financial Information as of the financial year end date of the Company and similar such adjustments. (3) Business Combinations The Companies use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations. The acquisition cost is the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value, plus any previously held equity interest in the acquiree remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The amount of any non-controlling interest is measured as elected for each business combination either at fair value or at the proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree.   Any difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the equity interest in the acquiree previously held at the time control is obtained is recognised in profit or loss. Further, any other comprehensive income that had been previously recognised in connection with the equity interest in the acquiree is treated in the same way as a disposal of the equity interest. Acquisition costs incurred are recognised in profit or loss.   The Companies perform any necessary classification and designation of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based, in principle, on the contractual terms, economic conditions, business or accounting policies, and other appropriate conditions that exist on the acquisition date. (4) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Associates refer to investees over which the Companies have the ability to exercise significant influence through such factors as the ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting interest in the entity and other factors.   A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the Companies, as the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.   The Companies account for investments in associates and joint ventures under the equity method. Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are normally recorded at cost, adjusted for the Companies’ share of the change in the net assets of these associates and joint ventures since the acquisition date. Any dividends received from these associates and joint ventures are subtracted from the carrying amount of investments in associates and joint ventures.   The Companies’ share of the profit or loss of the associates and joint ventures is included as “Share of profit of associates and joint ventures” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Companies’ share of any change in other comprehensive income recognised by the associates and joint ventures is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any unrealised profit arising from the transactions between the Companies and the associates and joint ventures is eliminated against the Companies’ interest in associates and joint ventures. Certain adjustments are made to achieve unification of the accounting policies of the associates and joint ventures with those of the Companies. MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 99 11 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   To align the reporting periods of associates and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method that have a financial year end that is different from the financial year end of the Company (March 31) due to unavoidable reasons such as the relationship with other shareholders, the associates and joint ventures prepare additional financial statements as of the financial year end date of the Company and similar such adjustments.   If it is determined, after the initial application of the equity method to investments in associates and joint ventures, that there is objective evidence of impairment based on all available information, the carrying amount of investments in associates and joint ventures is reduced to their recoverable amounts and the difference is recognised in profit or loss as an impairment loss.   The Companies determine, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that the recognised impairment loss may no longer exist or may have been reduced. If there is such an indication, the Companies estimate the recoverable amount of investments in associates and joint ventures. If the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, a reversal of impairment losses is recognised in profit or loss to the extent of the increase in the recoverable amount of the investment since the recognition of impairment losses, and is recognised only up to the amount of impairment losses that have been recognised in the past.   If the Companies lose significant influence or joint control over any associates and joint ventures, such investments in associates and joint ventures are measured at fair value. Specifically, the difference between; the fair value of any residual interests plus the proceeds from the partial disposal of interests in associates or joint ventures, and the carrying amount of the investment at the date on which control was lost, is recognised in profit or loss. Any other comprehensive income previously recognised under the equity method is accounted for in the same manner as a disposal of assets or liabilities related to the other comprehensive income of the associates and joint ventures. (5) Foreign Currency Translation The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Companies are presented in Japanese yen, the functional currency of the Company. Each entity in the consolidated group determines its functional currency in consideration of, among other factors, the economic environment in which it operates, and it measures the items in its financial statements using its own functional currency.   Assets and liabilities included in the financial statements of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at the reporting date rates. Income and expenses are translated at the average rates prevailing for the reporting period. The resulting translation adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income and the cumulative translation adjustments are recognised in other components of equity.   On disposal of a subsidiary that results in loss of control, all cumulative translation adjustments related to the foreign operation that have been recognised in other components of equity are reclassified to profit or loss. In a partial disposal of a subsidiary that does not result in loss of control, the corresponding share of the cumulative translation adjustment that has been recognised in other components of equity is reclassified to non-controlling interest rather than profit or loss.   On disposal of an associate or joint venture that results in loss of significant influence or loss of joint control, the full amount of the cumulative translation adjustment that has been recognised in other components of equity is reclassified to profit or loss. In a partial disposal of an associate or joint venture that does not result in loss of significant influence or loss of joint control, the corresponding proportionate share of the cumulative translation adjustment that has been recognised in other components of equity is reclassified to profit or loss. (6) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Companies include deposits in banks and certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity of 3 months or less at the acquisition date in cash equivalents. 100 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 12 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (7) Financial Instruments (i) Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets to which IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”) applies are classified as follows: debt instrument financial assets are classified as either financial assets measured at amortised cost or financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (“Financial assets measured at FVTPL”), and equity financial assets are classified as either Financial assets measured at FVTPL or financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“Financial assets measured at FVTOCI”). The Companies determine such classifications at initial recognition of the financial assets.   Financial assets measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value at initial recognition and financial assets other than Financial assets measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value plus transaction costs at initial recognition. Financial Information   For purchases or sales of financial assets under contracts with terms requiring delivery of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned (regular way purchase or sale), the purchase or sale is recognised on the trade date on which the Companies become a party to the contract for the financial asset.   Financial assets of the Companies include cash and cash equivalents, debt instrument financial assets including notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, equity financial assets, and derivative financial assets. Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial assets are measured according to their category as follows: Financial assets measured at amortised cost A debt instrument financial asset is measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: ・ The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and ・ The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.   After initial recognition, a debt instrument financial asset for which these conditions are satisfied is measured at amortised cost calculated using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. Amortisation using the effective interest method is recognised as part of finance income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.   The Companies may, at initial recognition, make an irrevocable election to designate a financial asset that meets the conditions for classification as measured at amortised cost mentioned above as Financial assets measured at FVTPL, if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. Financial assets measured at FVTPL The Companies classify the following financial assets as Financial assets measured at FVTPL: (i) equity financial assets not designated as Financial assets measured at FVTOCI at initial recognition and (ii) debt instrument financial assets that either do not meet the conditions for classification as measured at amortised cost or those that meet these conditions but are designated as Financial assets measured at FVTPL under an election made by the Companies at initial recognition.   After initial recognition, changes in the fair values of financial assets classified as Financial assets measured at FVTPL, together with the related dividend and interest income, are mainly recognised as part of finance income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 101 13 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Financial assets measured at FVTOCI The Companies make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to (or not to) designate equity financial assets that are not held for trading as Financial assets measured at FVTOCI.   After initial recognition, equity financial assets designated as Financial assets measured at FVTOCI are measured at fair value with any change in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount of the change in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other components of equity. However, dividend income arising from equity financial assets designated as Financial assets measured at FVTOCI is recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Derecognition The Companies derecognise a financial asset in the following situations: ・ When the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset are extinguished; ・ When the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset are transferred or when the Companies retain their contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assume a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more of the ultimate payees without significant delay under a pass-through arrangement and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the transferee; and ・ When the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset are transferred or when the Companies retain their contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assume a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more of the ultimate payees without significant delay under a pass-through arrangement and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are neither transferred nor retained, but control over the financial asset is transferred.   Where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are neither transferred nor retained and control over the transferred financial asset is retained, the Companies continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of their continuing involvement.   When Companies continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of their continuing involvement, any liabilities arising in relation to such continuing involvement are recognised. The continuing involvement in the financial asset and any liabilities arising in relation to such continuing involvement are measured on the basis of the rights and obligations held by the Companies. Impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost The Companies judge that a financial asset measured at amortised cost is impaired only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occur after the initial recognition of the asset, and such an event or events have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.   Objective evidence of impairment includes such events as significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor and a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments.   The amount of an impairment loss is estimated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate or observable market prices of the financial asset. However, if the returns on the financial asset are based on a floating interest rate, the present value of estimated future cash flows is calculated using the effective interest rate at each reporting date.   In addition to the impairment losses recognised in the manner described above, the Companies recognise impairment losses on financial assets based on historical credit loss rates calculated in consideration of past experience, etc. or estimated recoverable amounts after evaluating potential risks associated with the obligors, geographic areas, etc. pertaining to the financial assets.   Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position by deducting them directly from the carrying amount of the respective assets in the case of debt securities and by recognising an allowance in the case of financial assets other than debt securities. Impairment losses arising from trade receivables are recognised as part of selling, general and administrative expenses and those arising from other assets are recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 102 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 14 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed either directly or by adjusting an allowance account. Such a reversal is recognised to the extent that it does not result in the financial asset having a carrying amount that exceeds what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised at the date the impairment is reversed. The amount of reversal of impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. (ii) Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities to which IFRS 9 applies, are classified as follows: financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost unless they are financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss (“Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL”). The Companies determine such classifications at the initial recognition of the financial liabilities. Financial Information   Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value at initial recognition and financial liabilities classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are measured at fair value less transaction costs at initial recognition.   Financial liabilities of the Companies include corporate bonds and loans payable, notes and trade accounts payable, derivative financial liabilities, etc. Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured according to their classification as follows: Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL Financial liabilities designated as Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value.   After initial recognition, changes in the fair values of Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL together with the related interest expense are mainly recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. However the amount of changes in the fair value of the financial liabilities that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of the entity is recognised as other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Financial liabilities not classified as Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost.   After initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortisation using the effective interest method is recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Derecognition The Companies derecognise a financial liability only when the underlying obligation specified in the contract is performed, discharged, cancelled or expires.   An exchange of financial liabilities with substantially different terms or a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as the derecognition of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability, and the difference between the carrying amount of these liabilities is recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 103 15 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Financial guarantee contracts The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries, in the normal course of their business, issue various guarantees for obligations owed by associates and general trade partners (“guaranteed parties”). These are issued to third parties to guarantee the repayment, mainly of loans which the guaranteed parties have borrowed from external parties. When a guaranteed party fails to perform its obligations, the Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries are obligated to perform the obligations in accordance with the relevant financial guarantee contract.   Liabilities recognised for such financial guarantee contracts are measured at initial recognition at the present value of the total guarantee premiums to be received by the guarantor over a future period under the financial guarantee contract adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, these liabilities are amortised over the financial guarantee period on a systematic basis and the amortised amounts are recognised in profit or loss. However, if the estimated amount required to settle any such current guarantee obligations at the reporting date exceeds the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, the balance of any such liability is recognised at the estimated amount required to settle such current guarantee obligations at the reporting date, and any resulting difference is recognised in profit or loss. (iii) Offsetting of financial instruments A financial asset and a financial liability are offset and the net amount is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Companies currently have a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intend either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. (iv) Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments at the end of each reporting period is measured based on the market price in an active market. If the market in which a financial instrument is traded is not active or no active market exists for the financial instrument, fair value is determined by using an appropriate valuation technique. (8) Derivatives and hedge accounting Initial recognition and subsequent measurement The Companies recognise derivatives as assets or liabilities at fair value. For derivatives designated as qualifying hedging instruments, subsequent changes in fair value are recognised according to the objective and designation of the hedge. Subsequent changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as qualifying hedging instruments are recognised in profit or loss. Fair value hedges If the objective of holding a derivative is to hedge the exposure of changes in the fair value of the hedged item (as a fair value hedge), changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised in profit or loss and are offset against the changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments.   When financial instruments measured at amortised cost are designated as hedged items, after recognising the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of such hedged items in profit or loss, the adjusted financial instruments are amortised through profit or loss using the recalculated effective interest rate.   The Companies use fair value hedges mainly for hedging the exposure of changes in the fair value of goods or firm commitments to purchase goods and the exposure of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities with a fixed interest rates arising from changes in interest rates. 104 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 16 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Cash flow hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, which are held to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows of the hedged items, are recognised in other components of equity until changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recognised in profit or loss. However, the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised in profit or loss. The Companies use cash flow hedges for hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows of forecast purchases of goods, sales of goods, etc. arising from changes in prices and exchange rates and the exposure to variability in interest cash flows of a floating rate interest bearing assets and liabilities arising from changes in interest rates.   The amounts that have been recognised in other components of equity relating to such hedging instruments are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. However, if a hedged item is a recognised non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts that have been recognised in other components of equity relating to the hedging instrument are reclassified as adjustments to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. Financial Information   If a forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the Companies discontinue hedge accounting. Accordingly, any amounts that had been recognised in other components of equity while the hedge was effective are reclassified to profit or loss when hedge accounting is discontinued. Changes in the fair value of the derivative after hedge accounting is discontinued are recognised in profit or loss prospectively as it is no longer a hedging instrument. However, to the extent that such a previously hedged forecast transaction continues to be expected to occur even if hedge accounting is discontinued, amounts that had been recognised in other components of equity before the discontinuation of hedge accounting remain in other components of equity until the forecast transaction occurs. Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation Where the objective of holding a derivative and other non-derivative hedging instruments, such as loans payable, is to hedge the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation (as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation), changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments attributable to changes in exchange rates are recognised in other components of equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. Of the changes in the fair values of derivative and other non-derivative hedging instruments which are due to exchange rate movements, the portions related to any ineffectiveness or any parts outside the hedge effectiveness assessment are recognised in profit or loss.   The cumulative amount of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments attributable to changes in exchange rates that have been recognised in other components of equity under a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss when the underlying foreign operation is disposed of. (9) Inventories Inventories, which mainly consist of commodities, merchandise, and real estate held for sale, are measured at the lower of cost (mainly specific or moving average cost) and net realisable value. If the net realisable value is lower than cost, the difference is expensed as a write-down and the amount of the write-down is directly deducted from the carrying amount of inventories.   Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.   When the cause of a write-down no longer exists, or when there is clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value due to changes in economic conditions, reversals of such write-downs are recognised. The carrying amount after reversal is recognised at the lower of cost or the revised net realisable value, and the amount of the reversal of write-downs is recognised in profit or loss.   Inventories held for generating profits from short-term fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value less costs to sell, with fluctuations in fair value less costs to sell recognised in profit or loss in the period in which such fluctuations occur. MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 105 17 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (10) Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are recognised initially at acquisition cost including transaction costs. Acquisition cost includes borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, etc. of assets requiring a considerable time period before they can be used as intended. The present value of the estimated costs for the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment at the end of its useful life is included in the acquisition cost of the item if the recognition criteria for provisions are met, and are recognised as an expense through depreciation over the useful life of the item.   After initial recognition, the Companies apply the cost model to items of property, plant and equipment and measure such assets at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. The depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment is allocated over each period for the useful life of each item through depreciation, mainly on a straight-line basis over the useful life of each item (buildings and structures from 2 to 60 years, machinery and equipment from 2 to 45 years), or the units of production method based on reserve estimation. Land is not depreciated. If an item of property, plant and equipment includes one or more significant parts, each significant part is individually depreciated.   The Companies derecognise an item of property, plant and equipment when they have disposed of it or when it is no longer expected to produce any future economic benefits through use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of the item and its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss when the item is derecognised.   The basis of depreciation of property, plant and equipment, such as residual value, useful life, and depreciation method, is reviewed at each reporting date. When there is a change in the basis of depreciation, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate. (11) Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at initial recognition at acquisition cost. The acquisition cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is measured at the acquisition date fair value. After initial recognition, the Companies apply the cost model to intangible assets and measure such assets at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Internally generated intangible assets are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, unless they satisfy the criteria for capitalisation.   Intangible assets are classified as either intangible assets with finite useful lives or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.   The amount of intangible assets with finite useful lives subject to amortisation is allocated as an expense over each period for the useful life of each asset (franchises and customer relationships approximately from 3 years to 45 years, software approximately from 2 years to 20 years) through amortisation, mainly on a straight-line basis. The basis of amortisation of these intangible assets, such as useful life and depreciation method, is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. When there is a change in the basis of amortisation, the amortisation charge is adjusted prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.   Intangible assets judged to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation, and the Companies review, at the end of each reporting period, whether the events or circumstances supporting such a judgment continue to exist. If the judgment that the useful life is indefinite is no longer valid, the intangible asset is reclassified from an intangible asset with an indefinite life to an intangible asset with a finite useful life, with amortisation charges adjusted prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.   The Companies derecognise an item of intangible assets when they have disposed of it or when it is no longer expected to produce any future economic benefits from its use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of an intangible asset arising from its derecognition and its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. 106 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 18 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Goodwill Goodwill is recognised as the excess of (a) the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value, the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree remeasured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the aggregate amount of consideration”) over (b) the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The amount of noncontrolling interest is measured for each business combination either at acquisition date fair value or at the acquirer’s proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree. If the total amount of consideration is less than the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.   After initial recognition, goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is measured at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment loss. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, on or after the acquisition date, allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to receive benefits from the business combination. Financial Information   If an operation within a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is disposed of, the portion of goodwill related to the operation to be disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation for the purpose of calculation of the disposal gain or loss. Goodwill is allocated on the basis of the relative percentage of the values of the business to be disposed of and the remaining portion of the cash-generating unit, unless there is a more reasonable method. (12) Oil, gas and mineral resources mining activities Costs associated with the exploration, evaluation and development of oil and gas are accounted for based on the successful efforts method. Costs associated with the acquisition of vested mining rights, costs associated with the drilling and construction of exploratory wells and development wells, and related facilities are capitalised; and costs associated with exploratory wells are expensed when it has been demonstrated that the wells have no commercial viability, while other costs associated with exploration and evaluation, including geographical survey costs, are recognised as expenses when incurred. Costs associated with the exploration and evaluation of mineral resources are recognised as an expense as they are incurred until such time as the commercial viability of the mining activities is demonstrated.   Capitalised costs associated with exploration, evaluation and development are recognised as property, plant and equipment (machinery and equipment). Additionally, expenditures associated with the acquisition of rights to explore, etc. are recognised as intangible assets (licenses and operating rights for natural resources), and reclassified as property, plant and equipment (machinery and equipment) when their technical feasibility and economic viability have been demonstrated.   When facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount, such carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount. (13) Leases The Companies engage in the business of leasing non-current assets as lessors and lease non-current assets as lessees under finance leases and operating leases.   Whether or not an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is determined at the inception of the lease based on the substance of that arrangement considering whether the performance of that arrangement depends on the use of a specific asset or group of assets, and whether the right to use the asset is transferred under the terms of that arrangement. MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 107 19 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Accounting as lessee For finance leases that transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset, an asset and a liability are recognised on the commencement of the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset, determined at the inception of the lease, or the present value of the minimum lease payments calculated at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the outstanding liability, and finance charges are calculated so that they are equivalent to a constant interest rate on the balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised as expenses over the lease term and contingent rents are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Leased assets are depreciated over the period of expected use by a method consistent with the depreciation method for other similar assets owned by the lessee. The period of expected use is the useful life of the asset if the transfer of ownership is reasonably certain, or the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset if the transfer of ownership is not reasonably certain.   Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern by which the user of the asset obtains benefits from use of the asset. Contingent rents are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Accounting as lessor For finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset, a lease receivable is recognised on the commencement of the lease term at an amount that equals the net investment in the lease at the inception of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred by the lessor are recognised as part of net investment in the lease in principle.   For operating leases, the leased assets are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position according to the nature of the assets and are depreciated by a method consistent with the depreciation method for other similar assets owned by the lessor. Lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern by which the user of the asset obtains benefits from use of the asset. Initial direct costs incurred by the lessor are included in the carrying amount of the leased asset and are recognised as expenses over the lease term as corresponding lease income is recognised. (14) Impairment of non-financial assets other than inventories Impairment losses The Companies assess, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with finite useful lives:   If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill:   If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The Companies also evaluate whether the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount on a regular basis (at least annually), irrespective of whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.   The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. This determination is made for individual assets, unless an individual asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and that reduction is recognised as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at a discount rate reflecting the time value of money and the current market evaluation of the risks inherent in the asset. 108 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 20 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Reversals of impairment losses The Companies assess, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is an indication that the recognised impairment losses in prior periods for an asset may no longer exist or may have decreased. If there is such an indication, the Companies estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. If the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, a reversal of impairment losses is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount after the reversal does exceed the carrying amount (after deducting accumulated depreciation or accumulated amortisation) that would have been determined had the impairment losses not been recognised previously. Reversal of impairment losses is recognised in profit or loss.   However, impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed under any circumstances. (15) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations The Companies classify a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the following conditions are met: Financial Information ・ It is available for immediate sale in its present condition based solely on usual or customary conditions; and ・ Sale is highly probable.   A non-current asset or disposal group classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.   Depreciation or amortisation is discontinued for a non-current asset or disposal group for the year in which it is classified as held for sale. (16) Provisions The Companies recognise a provision when (i) they have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and (iii) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision is measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation, discounted at a discount rate reflecting the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance expenses.   For decommissioning obligations, a provision is recognised for the costs of demolition or removal of the asset, land restoration costs and expenditures incurred as a result of the use of the asset, and is added to the acquisition cost of the asset. Estimated costs and the discount rate applied are reviewed every year and any adjustment to the estimated amount is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. The effect of changes in estimated costs or the discount rate applied is added to or deducted from the carrying amount of the related asset. (17) Post-employment benefits The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and lump-sum severance indemnity plans covering substantially all employees. The Companies measure the present value of defined benefit obligations and the postemployment benefit costs based on the projected unit credit method for each plan.   The effect of the remeasurement of a net defined benefit asset or liability is recognised in other comprehensive income and is immediately reclassified from other components of equity to retained earnings. Such remeasurement consists of actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit obligation and the return on plan assets (excluding the amount of interest income on plan assets). Past service cost is recognised immediately in profit or loss.   A net defined benefit asset or liability is calculated as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets and is recognised as an asset or liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 109 21 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (18) Treasury stock If the Companies buy back their own equity instruments (treasury stock), such treasury stock is recognised at acquisition cost and is deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss at the time of purchase, sale, issuance or retirement of treasury stock. The difference between the carrying amount and the sale proceeds is recognised in capital surplus. (19) Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Such a fair value is calculated after deducting sales discounts, volume rebates, etc.   The Companies are involved in various forms of transactions including proprietary transactions and agency transactions. In agency transactions, consideration for the transaction is settled directly between the ultimate buyer and the seller, and the Companies receive fees from the buyer, the seller or both. Proprietary transactions, agency transactions, etc. are carried out in the following forms. Sale of goods Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied: ・ The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer; ・ Neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold is retained; ・ The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; ・ It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and ・ The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.   For sale of goods, if the Companies arrange shipping or deliver a bill of lading, warehouse receipt, delivery order, etc., to the buyer, revenue is recognised when the delivery obligations specified in the contract have been performed, such as when said document is delivered or when the inspection of goods is completed, and there are substantially no further obligations to perform, and the receipt of goods by the customer is practically certain. Rendering of services When the outcome of the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period. The Companies judge that the outcome of the rendering of services can be estimated reliably if all the following conditions are satisfied: ・ The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; ・ It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; ・ The stage of completion of the transaction can be measured reliably at the end of the reporting period; and ・ The costs incurred for the transaction or the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.   In the case of rendering of services, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses recognised that are recoverable, unless the outcome of the rendering of services can be estimated reliably. In acting as an agent, the Companies recognise commissions when contracted services are fully rendered to the customers. 110 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 22 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Construction contracts When the outcome of the construction contract can be reliably estimated, the percentage of completion method is applied. Under the percentage of completion method, contract revenue is recognised progressively over several accounting periods as work is performed representing the proportionate completion of the contract. The Companies judge that the outcome of the construction contract can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied: ・ The total amount of contract revenue can be measured reliably; ・ It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the entity; ・ Both the contract costs to complete the contract and the stage of contract completion at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and ・ The contract costs attributable to the contract can be clearly identified and measured reliably so that actual contract costs incurred can be compared with prior estimates.   When the outcome of the construction contract cannot be reliably estimated, contract revenue is recognised to the extent Financial Information recovery of contract costs incurred is probable.   When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the excess amount is recognised immediately as an expense. Presentation of the total amount of revenue and the net amount of revenue The Companies are deemed to be performing transactions as a principal when they have exposure to the significant risks and rewards associated with the sale of goods or the rendering of services, and the total amount of transactions is presented as revenue. The Companies are deemed to be performing transactions as an agent when they do not have exposure to the significant risks and rewards associated with the sale of goods or the rendering of services, and the net amount, after deduction of amounts due to third parties from the consideration earned on the transactions, is presented as revenue.   “Total volume of trading transactions” includes all transactions involving the Companies regardless of transaction type. “Total volume of trading transactions” is not required by IFRSs but is presented here to provide readers with a better understanding and is as presented in common Japanese accounting practice. Interest income Interest income is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Companies and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive the dividends is established. (20) Income and other taxes Current tax Taxes payable (receivable) at the end of each reporting period are measured at an amount expected to be due for payment to, or refunded from, the taxation authorities. In measuring the amount of taxes, the Companies use the statutory tax rate or statutory effective tax rate at the end of each reporting period.   Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income, whereas current tax related to items recognised directly in equity is recognised directly in equity. The Companies recognise the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on technical interpretations, that the tax positions will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.   Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset if the Companies currently have a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts of the assets and liabilities and intend either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 111 23 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised by the Companies based on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and their tax basis, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and tax laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.   Deferred tax liabilities are recognised with respect to taxable temporary differences other than those arising in the following cases: ・ Initial recognition of goodwill; ・ Initial recognition of assets or liabilities arising from a transaction that is not a business combination and does not affect accounting profit or taxable profit (loss) at the time of the transaction; and ・ Taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, and associates or interests in joint ventures if the parent, investor or party to a joint venture is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.   Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, tax loss carryforwards, and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference, etc. can be utilised, except as follows. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are not recognised where they arise from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities as a result of transactions that are not a business combination and which do not affect accounting profit or taxable profit (loss) at the time of the transaction.   For deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates or interests in joint ventures, a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.   The Companies review, at the end of each reporting period, whether it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to realise part or all of the benefit of the deferred tax assets, and reduce the amount of deferred tax assets to the extent that it is no longer probable that such taxable profit will be available. The Companies also review unrecognised deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period and recognise them to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will be available.   Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented as non-current assets and non-current liabilities, respectively.   Deferred tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income, whereas deferred tax related to items recognised directly in equity is recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset and presented net if, and only if, the Companies currently have a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and either of the following two conditions is met: ・ The deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity; and ・ The deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on different taxable entities, and those entities intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period. Consumption taxes Revenues, cost, and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income do not include consumption taxes. (21) Reclassifications Certain reclassifications and format changes have been made to the prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. 112 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 24 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (22) Early application of new standards and interpretations   The Companies have early applied the following standards. Standards and interpretations Description IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Amended Changes in qualifying criteria for hedge accounting November 2013) (23) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted Major standards and interpretations issued by the date of approval of the Consolidated Financial Statements are as follows.   At March 31, 2016, the Company has not yet adopted the following standards and interpretations. The potential impacts that application of the following standards and interpretations will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Companies are currently being evaluated and cannot be estimated at the present time. Reporting periods on or after which the application are Reporting periods for Financial Information Standards and interpretations required adoption by the Company Description IFRS 9 Financial Financial year ending Changes in qualifying criteria for Instruments (Amended January 1, 2018 March 31, 2019 impairment accounting July 2014) IFRS 15 Revenue from Financial year ending Accounting for and disclosure of revenue January 1, 2018 Contracts with Customers March 31, 2019 recognition Financial year ending IFRS 16 Leases January 1, 2019 Changes in lease accounting March 31, 2020 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 113 25 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 4.

Changes in the cost of “Franchises and customer relationships” classified as “Other” included ¥20,573 million as a result of adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation of Gavilon. Changes in the cost of “Goodwill” classified as “Other” included a decrease of ¥15,382 million as a result of adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation of Gavilon.   Of the intangible assets stated above, the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at March 31, 2016 and 2015 were ¥52,965 million ($468,717 thousand) and ¥55,512 million, respectively. Major intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were trademarks, which were included in “Franchises and customer relationships”. As the trademarks with indefinite business terms will basically exist as long as the Company continues to exist, it has been determined that there is no foreseeable limit to the period of inflow of future economic benefits and thus they are classified as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at March 31, 2016 and 2015 included trademarks recognised as a result of the acquisition of Gavilon in the amount of ¥42,255 million ($373,938 thousand) and ¥45,064 million, respectively.   Of the intangible assets stated above, intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised by the straight-line basis based over their expected useful lives. However, exploration and evaluation assets are not amortised until the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the mine have been demonstrated. When the technical feasibility and commercial viability are demonstrated, an exploration and evaluation asset is reclassified to property, plant and equipment, and amortised using the units-of-production method based on the estimation of proved reserves. Major intangible assets with finite useful lives at March 31, 2016 and 2015, which were included in “Franchises and customer relationships”, and their carrying amounts were as follows: customer relationship assets related to the trading and distribution business of grains and fertilizers were ¥29,263 million ($258,965 thousand) and ¥33,756 million, franchises and customer relationship assets related to the mobile phone sales distribution business were ¥29,821 million ($263,903 thousand) and ¥32,099 million, and trademarks acquired through the other business combinations were ¥22,559 million ($199,637 thousand) and ¥25,434 million. The assets are amortised over 4-31 years on a straight-line basis.   Amortisation of intangible assets is included in “Cost of goods sold” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.   For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries recognised impairment losses on intangible assets of ¥2,109 million ($18,664 thousand) and ¥48,742 million, respectively, based on the relevant recoverable amounts due to decreases in estimated future cash flows and other factors.   In terms of operating segments, the major impairment losses of ¥48,053 million were included in the Food & Consumer Products segment for the year ended March 31, 2015.   Impairment losses are included in “Impairment losses” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.   The Company recognised an impairment loss of ¥48,053 million with respect to goodwill arising from the acquisition of Gavilon for the year ended March 31, 2015.   The carrying amount of “Goodwill” at March 31, 2016 included goodwill for Gavilon in the amount of ¥70,462 million ($623,558 thousand). The recoverable amount used in impairment testing was calculated based on value in use which was measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on the revised business plan approved by the management. The business plan represents the management's estimate of a range of economic conditions including such significant assumptions as quantity, price and margin based on past experience, which was also consistent with external evidence. The business plan used on the most recent 10 years forecasts in order to average market conditions. For the period beyond 10 years, the Company calculated the terminal value based on a steady growth rate of 2%. The growth rate was determined by considering the market in which Gavilon operates or the long-term average growth rate in the U.S.A.. Weighted average cost of capital used in value in use calculations was 8.8%, which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the assets. 120 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 32 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 7.

The primary investment policy is to analyse the risk/return characteristics by asset class and to invest in a diversified portfolio taking into consideration the correlation among asset classes.   The Company sets an asset mix policy with investments in equity securities, debt securities and other assets. Based on this policy, the Company selects multiple investment managers who execute the strategy. When selecting an investment manager, the Company gives consideration to management philosophy and content, investment management policy and investment style, investment control systems including information collection mechanisms and decision-making processes, compliance systems, investment experience and the track record of the investment manager as well as the professionals in charge of managing pension assets.   Plan assets are invested 30%, 60% and 10% in equity securities, debt securities and other, respectively, at March 31, 2016.   The investments executed by investment managers are outlined as follows:   Equity securities are selected mainly from stocks that are listed on securities exchanges.

This impairment loss was included in “Gains (losses) on investment securities” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Additionally, this segment recognised impairment losses of ¥15,832 million from investments in certain copper mining projects in Chile and coal mining projects in Australia due to the anticipated decrease in the estimated future cash flows following the decline in commodity prices. The impairment losses were calculated using the recoverable amounts measured at value in use based on discounted future cash flows, and the total amount of the recoverable amounts was ¥291,538 million. Weighted average cost of capital used in the value in use calculations ranged from 7.5% to 8.2% and reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the assets.

MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 133 45 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 14. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures (1) Policy for managing capital The fundamental policy of the Companies is to maintain an optimal mix of funding in line with the requirements of the asset portfolio. Funding sources include indirect financial procurement firstly from banks and other financial institutions, as well as direct procurement through the issuance of bonds, commercial paper and other means. The Companies utilise such management indicators as net D/E ratio (Note 1) and risk assets (Note 2) and strengthen the financial base to establish a strong earnings structure and a solid financial footing that can withstand changes in the business environment while attaining sustainable growth. Note 1 Net D/E ratio = Net interest bearing debt / Total equity. Net interest bearing debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits from the total bonds and borrowings (current and non-current). Note 2 The Company defines risk assets as the exposure of its portfolio to the maximum possible loss that could be incurred on a consolidated basis, measured using the Value at Risk method. The Company conducts computer simulations on all group assets including the assets of the consolidated subsidiaries that take into account the risk attributes of each type of exposure such as country risk, industry risk, credit rating of the customers, and scheduled due dates of receivables.   At the group level, the management regularly monitors net D/E ratio, which was targeted at approximately 1.3 times by the end of the year ending March 31, 2019 under the three-year mid-term management plan, “Global Challenge 2018”, which commenced April 2016.   The Companies are not subject to any significant capital restrictions (with the exception of general restrictions pursuant to laws such as the Companies Act of Japan). (2) Policy for managing risks The Companies conduct business activities in various countries including Japan and are, thus, subject to the effects of interest rate risks, exchange rate risks, credit risks, commodity price risks, liquidity risks and stock price fluctuation risks described below. The Companies evaluate these risks through monitoring on a regular basis and manage these risks under an identical risk management policy, regardless of the application of hedge accounting, in order to hedge all or part of these risks. In principle, the hedged items and the hedging instruments are based on the same underlying and have an economic relationship. Additionally, the hedge ratio is on a one-to-one basis so that the risk exposure of the hedged items is effectively reduced. (i) Management of interest rate risks Since the Companies have raised certain funds at floating interest rates, they are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest expense in the event of a hike in market interest rates. The majority of liabilities at floating rates correspond to notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, which are positively affected by changes in interest rates. Interest insensitive assets such as certain fixed assets and investment securities will also possibly produce an increase in dividends and other income because of a rise in market interest rates. The Companies cannot completely avoid interest rate risks, however, risk exposure is limited by the portfolio of assets and liabilities held.   In addition, among the liabilities used to fund interest insensitive assets, such as certain fixed assets and investment securities, that portion with floating rates is categorised as “unhedged” based on the Group’s asset-liability management. Monitoring market movements in interest rates, the Group utilises interest rate swaps and takes other measures to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations.   Interest rate sensitivity   The following table illustrates the impact of a 1% rise in interest rates on the profit before tax of the Companies at March 31, 2016 and 2015 assuming that all other variables are held constant. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars March 31, 2016 March 31, 2015 March 31, 2016 Effect on profit before tax ¥(18,117) ¥(18,949) $(160,327) 134 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 46 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (ii) Management of foreign currency risks The Companies conduct transactions in a variety of currencies and are, thus, subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuation risks associated with business activities conducted in foreign currencies and with net investments in foreign operations. In order to hedge the risks associated with business activities, i.e., the risk of changes in cash flows of foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, firm commitments and forecast transactions, and the risk of changes in fair value of foreign currency denominated receivables, payables and firm commitments; as well as the exchange rate fluctuation risk of net investments in foreign operations, the Companies utilise forward-exchange contracts, foreign currency denominated bonds and borrowings, currency swaps and other means to mitigate these risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations. Effective April 1, 2015, the Companies have decided to manage forward-exchange contracts closely linked with bonds and borrowings denominated in Japanese yen for the purpose of financing foreign currency. In conjunction with this, the classification of cash flow relating to such forward-exchange contracts has been changed from “Operating activities” to “Financing activities”. Financial Information   Foreign exchange sensitivity   The following table illustrates the impact of an appreciation of the Japanese yen by ¥1 against the US$ and AU$ on profit before tax and equity of the Companies, assuming that all other variables are held constant at March 31, 2016 and 2015. A depreciation of the Japanese yen by ¥1 against the US$ and AU$, assuming that all other variables are held constant, would result in the opposite impact on the profit before tax and equity of the Companies of the amounts shown in the following table. Currencies other than the US$ and AU$, there are no foreign currencies that pose a significant exchange rate fluctuation risk. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars March 31, 2016 March 31, 2015 March 31, 2016 <U.S. dollars> Effect on profit before tax ¥292 ¥215 $2,584 Effect on foreign currency translation adjustments (before tax) (6,538) (5,754) (57,858) <Australian dollars> Effect on profit before tax 33 38 292 Effect on foreign currency translation adjustments (before tax) (385) (1,009) (3,407) (iii) Management of credit risks The Companies carry out general trading business, which comprise export, import, domestic and offshore trading in a wide variety of fields including industrial, agricultural and consumer products, and which also involves all levels of activities from planning, investment, and research and development through production, distribution and marketing. In addition, the Companies operate in substantially all geographic areas of the world, and their customers are diversified. Accordingly, the management of the Companies believes there is no significant concentration of credit risk among its customers or in its investments. The Companies require collateral to the extent considered necessary.   The carrying amount of the financial assets of the Companies after impairment represent the maximum exposure to credit risk that does not take into account collateral and other credit enhancements. MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 135 47 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (iv) Management of commodity price risks The Companies are subject to the effects of fluctuation risk of oil and gas, coal, aluminum, copper, and agricultural product prices. The Companies match buy and sell orders and use commodity derivatives including commodity futures, commodity forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity options to mitigate the fluctuation risks of commodity prices. Additionally, certain commodity derivatives are entered into for trading purposes within pre-determined limits and loss limits.   Commodity price sensitivity   The fluctuation risk of commodity prices on inventories, and purchase and sales contracts at the end of year is substantially diminished through commodity derivatives and other means. Additionally, the impact of changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives for trading purposes is not significant. (v) Management of liquidity risk The Companies are subject to the effects of liquidity risk including the dramatic decline in liquidity of held assets due to financial market turmoil. The Companies maintain a sufficient level of liquidity, mainly in the form of cash and deposits, in addition to cash flows from operating activities and the establishment of commitment lines with financial institutions.   The following table illustrates the results of a liquidity analysis conducted on the derivatives of the Companies at March 31, 2016 and 2015. Derivatives that are settled net with other contracts are represented as gross amounts.

(vi) Management of stock price fluctuation risk The Companies hold equity instruments (stocks) mainly for the purpose of strengthening relationships with business partners and are, thus, subject to the effects of stock price fluctuations. The Companies regularly review their holding of stocks, and by disposing of stocks that are no longer considered worthwhile holding, mitigate the risk of fluctuations in stock prices.   Sensitivity to stock price fluctuations   In terms of equity instruments (stocks) in active markets, if quoted prices drop 5% across the board at the year end, the negative impact (before tax) on “Gains (losses) on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income” of the Companies for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 would be ¥(8,811) million ($(77,973) thousand) and ¥(8,524) million, respectively; while the impact on profit or loss would be minimal. 136 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 48 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) (3) Fair value of financial instruments (i) Fair value measurement methods The estimated fair value of the financial instruments of the Companies has been determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.   The following methodologies and assumptions are used by the Companies in estimating the fair value disclosures of financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits: Cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits are measured at amortised cost, and their carrying amount in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position approximate fair value due to the relative shortterm maturities. Financial Information Investment securities and other investments: The fair value of investment securities in active markets is measured on the basis of quoted prices at the year end.   The fair value of equity financial assets in markets that are not active and debt instrument financial assets classified as Financial assets measured at FVTPL is measured on the basis of discounted future cash flows, third-party valuations and other valuation methods.   The fair value of debt instrument financial assets measured at amortised cost is estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the market interest rates at the year end applicable to debt instrument financial assets with identical remaining periods and similar credit ratings. Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, and notes and trade accounts payable: The fair value of notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, and notes and trade accounts payable is estimated using discounted future cash flows based mainly on the interest rates at the year end applicable to notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, and notes and trade accounts payable with identical remaining periods and similar credit ratings. Bonds and borrowings: The fair value of bonds and borrowings is estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the interest rates at the year end applicable to similar loan agreements with identical remaining periods. Other financial assets and liabilities: Other financial assets and other financial liabilities include derivative assets and derivative liabilities as well as non-derivative assets and non-derivative liabilities.   The carrying amounts of derivative assets and derivative liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position represent fair value.   Non-derivative assets mainly consist of other receivables from customers, and have been measured at amortised cost, with the exception of Financial assets measured at FVTPL.   Non-derivative liabilities mainly consist of other payables to customers and payables relating to consideration for notes, trade accounts and loans receivable that have been transferred without satisfying the criteria for derecognition of financial assets, and have been measured at amortised cost.   The carrying amounts of non-derivative assets and non-derivative liabilities measured at amortised cost reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position approximate fair value. Interest rate swap agreements: The fair value of interest rate swap agreements is estimated using discounted future cash flows based on the swap rates at the year end applicable to similar interest rate swap agreements with identical remaining periods. Forward exchange contracts: The fair value forward exchange contracts is estimated based on quoted prices at the year end. Commodity futures and forward contracts: The fair value of commodity futures and forward contracts is estimated based on quoted prices at the year end.

Correspondingly amounts received from such transfers of ¥73,162 million ($647,451 thousand) and ¥88,964 million, respectively, have been included in “Other current financial liabilities”. In terms of these notes, trade accounts, and loans receivable, the Companies have been judged to substantially retain all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred assets, as the Companies assume payment obligations in the event of default by the drawer or the obligor. Of the amounts above, notes, trade accounts and loans receivable for which the transferee has the right to recourse to the transferred assets only were ¥96,394 million ($853,044 thousand) and ¥88,267 million, and the carrying amount of the related liabilities were ¥42,101 million ($372,575 thousand) and ¥52,835 million at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These carrying amounts approximate their respective fair values.   Additionally, certain notes, trade accounts and loans receivable transferred continue to be recognised as assets to the extent of continuing involvement, due to the Companies assuming partial payment obligations in the event of a default by the obligor or due to the Companies having been determined to retain control over the said notes, trade accounts and loans receivable. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying amounts prior to transfer of the said notes, trade accounts and loans receivable were ¥1,450 million ($12,832 thousand) and ¥1,278 million, respectively, and the carrying amounts of assets continued to be recognised by the Companies due to continuing involvement and the related liabilities in the same amounts were ¥251 million ($2,221 thousand) and ¥224 million, respectively.     Changes in allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars March 31, 2016 March 31, 2015 March 31, 2016 Balance at beginning of year ¥31,212 ¥36,253 $276,212 Provision for the year 5,476 4,735 48,460 Charge-offs (2,491) (12,386) (22,044) Others 5,685 2,610 50,310 Balance at end of year ¥39,882 ¥31,212 $352,938 138 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 50 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable for which impairment was recognised at March 31, 2016 and 2015 were ¥31,268 million ($276,708 thousand) and ¥29,231 million, respectively; and their corresponding allowances for doubtful accounts were ¥24,049 million ($212,823 thousand) and ¥23,335 million, respectively.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries enter into long-term purchase contracts for certain goods and products in chemical, metal and machinery industries at either fixed or variable prices. The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries generally enter into sales contracts for such purchase contracts with customers. The total amounts of the long-term purchase contracts were approximately ¥743,000 million ($6,575,221 thousand) and ¥908,000 million at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries had commitments to make additional investments or loans in the aggregate amounts of approximately ¥200,000 million ($1,769,912 thousand) and ¥345,000 million at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which capital expenditures in property, plant and equipment were approximately ¥4,000 million ($35,398 thousand) and approximately ¥48,000 million, respectively, while commitments to joint ventures were approximately ¥54,000 million ($477,876 thousand) and approximately ¥101,000 million, respectively.   The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries provide various types of guarantees for the obligations of their associates and customers in the ordinary course of business. The guarantees mainly relate to the repayment of borrowings to third parties. Should the guaranteed associates and customers fail to fulfill their obligations, the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries would be required to fulfill the obligations under these guarantees.   Outstanding guarantees were ¥406,467 million ($3,597,053 thousand) and ¥391,630 million, including ¥357,048 million ($3,159,717 thousand) and ¥282,033 million to associates and joint ventures, at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Outstanding guarantees (total of guarantee payable) represent the maximum potential amount of future payments under the contracts without any consideration of the likelihood of such obligations being incurred.   Therefore, such amounts do not represent the anticipated losses on these guarantees and indemnifications, and they greatly exceed anticipated losses. Some guarantees are secured by counter guarantees provided for the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries by third parties.   The amounts of counter guarantees provided for the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries by third parties were ¥21,919 million ($193,973 thousand) and ¥24,685 million, including ¥20,589 million ($182,204 thousand) and ¥23,289 million relating to the associates and joint ventures at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   The Company manages the risk of fulfillment of obligations under the guarantees by setting the appropriate line of credit and by undertaking provisional measures in accordance with the credit risk rank to which each guaranteed customer belongs. The Company determines the rank of each customer before entering into the guarantee agreements according to the customer’s credit risk which is estimated and reviewed based on the customer’s financial information.   The likelihood of such obligations being incurred under the guarantees which would have a material effect in the Consolidated Financial Statements were estimated to be remote at March 31, 2016. A provision for loss on guarantees was recognised for the amount that was considered probable.   The Companies conduct business activities on a global scale and are involved in transactions which are subject to the oversight by various types of authorities, both in Japan and abroad. Such business activities are exposed to risk and, from time to time, may involve legal actions, claims or other disputes. Although there are certain outstanding litigations such as those relating to compensation for damages and collection of receivables regarding infrastructure and plant projects overseas at the end of the financial year, the outcome of these cannot be determined at this time. The Company provides no further disclosures on these litigations since the Company believes that such disclosures would prejudice seriously the outcome of the proceedings. 170 MARUBENI ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 24. Structured Entities The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in structured entities engaged in asset management, financing and leasing, through investments and financing, but do not include certain of such structured entities in their scope of consolidation. Total assets of these unconsolidated structured entities at March 31, 2016 and 2015 were ¥405,669 million ($3,589,991 thousand) and ¥441,780 million, respectively. These structured entities mainly procure funds through bank loans.   Carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position relating to the involvement in these unconsolidated structured entities and maximum exposures to assets, liabilities and lease contracts at March 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars Classification March 31, 2016 March 31, 2015 March 31, 2016 Carrying amount of assets ¥11,380 ¥14,365 $100,708 Financial Information Carrying amount of liabilities 9,774 10,700 86,496 Maximum exposures 109,807 94,137 971,743 The carrying amount of assets mainly consists of non-current notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, whereas the carrying amount of liabilities mainly consists of non-current notes and trade accounts payable. The sum of the carrying amount of assets and the carrying amount of liabilities is different from maximum exposures primarily due to lease contracts.   Maximum exposures represent the maximum potential amounts of losses precipitated through the decline in the price of assets held and lease contracts. Therefore, such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated amounts of losses through the involvement in the structured entities. 25. Other Notes On January 20, 2016, the Company exercised the right to purchase all preferred shares issued by its subsidiary Gavilon Agriculture Holdings, Co. (Gavilon Agriculture Investment has absorbed and merged Gavilon Agriculture Holdings in March 2016.) that had been held by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (hereinafter referred to as “JBIC”) pursuant to the agreement between shareholders—i.e., the Company and JBIC—and acquired the preferred shares for an aggregate amount of ¥61,886 million ($547,664 thousand) including the amount equivalent to the preferred shares yet to be paid for until the day of purchase, and completed the payment for the preferred shares. As said preferred shares had been recognised as “Non-controlling interests” in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the purchase resulted in a decrease in “Non-controlling interests” by the same amount as the amount of the acquisition. 26. Subsequent Events The Companies have assessed whether any subsequent events occurred through June 24, 2016, the issuance date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and there are no subsequent events to be disclosed. 27. Approval of Consolidated Financial Statements The Consolidated Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors on June 24, 2016.
