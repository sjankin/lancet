The power conditioning sub-systems and substation equipment are at the center. Providing Clean Energy Fuji Electric offers a variety of technologies and products that help to Transreduce CO2 emissions and provide environmentally friendly energy at portation thermal power plants using highly efficient equipment, and at power generation facilities using renewable energy sources including geothermal, water, solar, and wind. Geothermal power generation uses steam created by magma underneath the earth’s surface, and we are one of the world’s leading suppliers of geothermal steam turbines and power generators. In the area of solar and wind power generation, we supply key equipment, including the power conditioning subsystems and substation equipment that are essential for a stable power supply. Our strength in power plant work is our ability to handle one-stop orders for plant construction, from overall facility design to equipment procurement and installation. We are also one of the world’s few manufacturers developing industrial uses for fuel cells, on which hopes are being placed as a next-generation form of energy. Transportation Safe, Energy-Saving Cars and Trains In the area of transportation, we contribute to safe driving and energy savings. Our power semiconductors are used in sensors and electric convertors for engines, brakes, steering controls, and motor drives for electric vehicles, which are expected to gain popularity as a means of preventing global warming. For railways, we supply Japanese and overseas rolling stock manufacturers with door drive systems that ensure a high level of safety, and power converters that provide a stable supply of electric power.

We are building a structure that our development of SiC devices and modules, which are nextfocuses on two areas: automation, labor savings, and energy generation power semiconductors, toward the development of conservation with drive control systems as the core product, competitive, high-value-added products focusing on electronic and stable supplies of electricity with power supplies as the devices and power electronics, and use these devices and core product. Specifically, we are innovating operations in the modules to develop SiC-equipped power electronics industrial infrastructure and power electronics businesses, and equipment. Looking further into the future, upfront investment also through the electric power distribution being carried out by will emphasize the development of modules for automobiles the social engineering systems business. and railway rolling stock. The second step is to expand our overseas business. We will achieve results from the M&A we have conducted to date and carry out new M&A that bring the scale of our business to the next level. In Asia, we have set up the APAC Regional Corporate Strategy Office, in Singapore, which is responsible for ASEAN countries, to optimize and expedite our businesses in the region.
