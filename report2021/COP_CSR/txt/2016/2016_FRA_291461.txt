JCDecaux’s Communication on Progress To the United Nations Global Compact November 2016 Message from the Co-CEOs expressing support for the Global Compact “By adopting an ambitious sustainable development strategy in 2014 and signing up to the UN Global Compact in 2015, we have demonstrated our intention to pursue growth in a way that is respectful to people and the environment.” Jean-Francois Decaux and Jean-Charles Decaux Extract of JCDecaux’s 2015 Reference Document (pdf page 10): In 1964, Jean-Claude Decaux invented an economic model that is, today, more relevant than ever: providing cities with products and services offering a public service to citizens financed by advertising revenues. Deployed across all of the Company’s activities (cities, airports, transport services, shopping centres, etc.), our economic model offers numerous advantages particularly in its service dimension. This economic model allows cities to provide high-quality services to citizens, to have outdoor communication spaces available to connect with them, and to improve their eco-mobility offer with no impact on local finances and taxpayers, thanks to advertising revenues. We provide urban solutions with a low environmental impact and offer high-quality, aesthetically pleasing and accessible products and services in line with our values to serve cities and the public. With the launch of our Sustainable Development Strategy in 2014, JCDecaux set itself ambitious objectives to minimize its impact on the environment and create social and stakeholder value: Reduce our energy consumption Reduce our other environmental impacts Deploy a group-wide Health and Safety policy Implement an ambitious group-wide social Policy Reinforcing sustainable development in the Purchasing Policy Strengthen employees’ commitment towards sustainable development See the appendix for perimeter covered and specific targets set In this Communication on Progress, we report on specific Company commitments, practical measures and outcomes which have been achieved to date in each of the four areas addressed by the Global Compact: Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption.
