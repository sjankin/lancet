Despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions that companies of KONČAR Group faced in most markets, operating results in 2015 show a continuation of stable business as a result of systematic work on developing new products and improving market positions. In order to reduce the negative impact of the economic and financial crisis, ensuring stable business and maintening and strengthening of market position in KONČAR a number of measures was taken. First of all, the scope of offers was increased and efforts were intensified to open new markets, the measures for greater synergy were implemented within the system and also measures to reduce operating costs. All implemented measures have resulted in the continuation of profitable business and financial stability of the Group.

Corporate social responsibility approach puts a special emphasis on taking care of people, the environment and all aspects related to the protection and preservation of natural resources, as well as collaboration with community. Traditional cooperation with the academic community has not only continued, but has also secured a new joint project “Knowledge management “ in 2015. The agreement with the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb, and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb was a start of the project “Knowledge Management” that will enable the effective management of all components of the intellectual capital of an organization, which will result in increased efficiency, and thus the market competitiveness. As an introduction we have selected only a small part of what we have done in the year 2015, so I invite you to read about numerous other activities on economic, environmental and social responsibility of business categories in the following pages of this jubilee Report. Respectfully, Darinko Bago Chairman of the Management Board STRATEGY AND ANALYSIS 5 Key Impacts, Risks The KONČAR Group is exposed to various market and financial operating conditions. The business and Opportunities environment risk results from political, economic and social conditions existing in the markets of G4-2 companies’ operations. All Group companies regularly monitor and manage their balance sheets, liquidity and capital adequacy as well as set measures focused on illiquidity causes prevention or elimination, take measures focused on companies’ sufficient long-term funding sources in view of the scope and type of their business activity and regularly monitor the capital adequacy performance. The Group manages the risks that might impact its business operations by means of monitoring business processes and internal risk reports, identifying and analysing risk exposure based on its degree and significance. • Market Risk Market risk emerges as a consequence of potential losses resulting from less-than-favourable economic conditions and a decline in market demand. The Group companies operate domestically and internationally. The Group’s core activity includes energy and transport-related equipment and products. The production scope heavily depends on investments. Under the influence of the global crisis and the instability of geopolitical situations in some parts of the world, there is a risk of a decrease and of closing certain markets down while providing stimulus in order to assign work to domicile enterprises. Besides volatile prices of basic raw material, there was a huge competition pressure on the power equipment market in 2015 in terms of the prices, equipment and profit margin. • Procurement Risk The prices of main raw and other materials (copper, tin, steel...) in the last couple of years have been affected by unpredictable changes (immense growth or fall in short time periods). In 2015, there was a disturbance on transformer tin market in Europe due to the antidumping process led by the European Commission. The disturbance caused the shortage of tin, especially high-quality one. The Group companies successfully overcame this disturbance. During 2015, the European Commission withdrew the introduction of antidumping prices and introduced minimum prices on the import of tin from Japan, China, Korea, Russia and the USA. •Technological and Development Risks The Group companies have been continuously investing considerable resources into key technologies and strategically important segments of production in order to decrease the risk of lagging behind the competition in technological and development areas. KONČAR is planning to invest considerable amounts into the development of new products and the innovation of existing ones in the future period too. • Human Resources Risks Usual turnover and changes in personnel structure do not have a significant effect on Group companies’ business operations. The companies employ a hedging strategy of continually investing into education and incentivizing their key employees through income. • Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital in a way to ensure its ability to continue further ongoing operations while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance. 6 STRATEGY AND ANALYSIS CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 The Group manages capital and makes its appropriate adjustments in accordance with the changes of market economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its assets. The Group companies can make a decision on dividend payouts to shareholders, on the equity increase/decrease, on the sale of assets in order to decrease liabilities etc. • Currency Risk The official currency of the Group is Croatian Kuna. However, some transactions executed in foreign currencies are being converted to Croatian Kuna, applying the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses are being credited or debited against the Profit and Loss Account. The companies hedge against the foreign currency exchange risk by continuous planning and monitoring their cash flow, contracting sales and procurement in the same currency where possible, adjusting the cash flow rate by term foreign currency purchases in accordance with the cash flow plan. A smaller portion of the companies employ financial derivatives to hedge against the financial risk exposure. • Interest Rate Risk The Group is exposed to interest risk since some loans are agreed at a variable interest rate while most assets do not bear interests. Some companies within the Group hedge against the interest rate risk by agreeing foreign currencies. Apart from an increased market risk due to a reduced demand as a consequence of prolonged recession, there were no other significant changes as regards the Group’s exposure to financial risk. • Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty defaulting on its contractual obligations resulting in the financial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties thus mitigating the risk of default-caused financial loss. The Group uses data and opinions collected from rating agencies, the Croatian Chamber of Economy as well as other publicly available financial information on companies’ financial status to rate its major customers. The Group’s risk exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored. In principle, contracts are concluded only with creditworthy counterparties when appropriate payment insurance instruments have been obtained. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is primarily affected by individual characteristics of each customer. The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually in terms of its creditworthiness before standard payment, delivery terms and conditions are set. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment as an estimate of incurred losses in respect of expected losses from receivables and investments. • Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of the Group not being able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Risk management is the responsibility of the Management Boards of Group companies. The Group manages this risk by continuously monitoring the estimated cash flow, comparing and adjusting it to actual income and expenses. As a whole, there was no significant exposure of the Group to liquidity risk. More detailed information on key impacts, risks and opportunities are available in the 2015 Business Report on www.koncar.com/Investors/Reports (Chapter 7 ‘Risk Exposure’).
