Such platforms, generally divided into mobile and fixed platforms, are essential for offshore oil and gas exploration and development operations and house drilling, power, communications, navigation and other equipment, as well as lifesaving and accommodation facilities. Recovery Ratio Recovery ratio refers to the percentage of geological oil reserves accounted for by the amount of oil that can be extracted from oil reservoirs. This is a key criterion in evaluating the level of development of an oil field. Reserve Replacement Ratio As an index to reflect reserve replacement capacity, reserve replacement ratio is a ratio between the annual newly proven reserve and the reserve that has been mined and consumed in the same year. Heavy Oil Heavy oil is highly viscous crude oil that contains a relatively high level of asphaltenes and resins. This usually refers to those with ground densities greater than 0.943 and underground viscosities greater than 50 centipoises. Oil Reservoir This is the smallest unit for the storage of oil. Oil reservoir layer or oil layer in short refers to the porous strata for the storage of oil. Not every part of an oil layer will contain oil. Oil reservoir refers to those independent oil-containing areas within an oil layer. Adjustment Well Adjustment wells refer to scattered or clustered wells drilled, in addition to existing well clusters, for improving the development of oil fields. Well Logging Well logging usually refers to geophysical well loggings, in which different forms of well loggers made based on electrical, magnetic, acoustic, thermal, nuclear and other physical principles, enter wells through the use of well logging cables, to allow the ground electrical measuring instruments to record continuously along the well bore the various parameters that change with changes in depth. Underground rock formations, including oil, gas, water, and coal layers and metal deposits, can then be identified through curves representing these parameters. Oil Spill Response Oil spill response is the formulation of plans and adoption of measures to control and prevent oil spills and reduce pollution damage, based on the environment and resources in the potential spill sources and waters within the designated sea areas. This sees common use in offshore oil exploration and development activities. LNG Liquefied natural gas or LNG in short refers to the liquid that forms when natural gas extracted from gas fields cools to a low temperature under high pressure after undergoing the fluid and acid removal, drying and distillation processes. LNG is predominantly methane and is colourless, odourless, non-toxic and non-corrosive.
