International Holding a/s CVR. no. 31 15 85 91 Corporate Social Responsibility 2015 SCHUR INTERNATIONAL HOLDING A/S – CSR STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT The history of Schur began in 1846 when Johan Wilhelm Schur founded a small lithographic workshop in Horsens, Denmark. Almost 170 years later still owned by the family with the sixth generation about to join management. This would not have been possible if we had not taken responsibility for the world in which we live and treated our stakeholders with respect, honesty and loyalty. Wars, recessions and untimely deaths in the family have played an integral part in our history. However, the employees supported our company, as did customers and suppliers close to us. Today's global marketplace creates new standards and poses ever growing challenges. However, our focus on corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributes to ensure that we will be able to hand over a financially sound and strong organization to the next generation in a safe and sustainable society and environment. Schur's CSR strategy and efforts are closely connected to the company's values. As an overall framework of our CSR work, we signed and thereby committed ourselves to the international guidelines for corporate social responsibility, the UN Global Compact, in 2015. We are pleased to show our continued commitment by outlining our 2015 initiatives in this first annual Communication on Progress report.
