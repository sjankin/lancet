In addition to cooperation and taking responsibility, it has increased our understanding of customers. Successful business requires that customers are at the heart of it all. We have trained our personnel and changed our organizational structure in a customer-oriented way. We are all, starting from the top management, at our customers’ service, listening to their needs and improvement proposals. This way, we can offer even better products and services. Safety has always been important to us, and last year we further enhanced management’s input in safety-related matters. We carried out safety rounds and talked with people. I believe that this has now been understood better than before. Safety is part of our corporate culture and the Neste professional identity.

The word “Oil” no longer gave the right overall impression of the company. In recent years, Neste has mostly grown through the production of renewable fuels and we have become the world’s largest producer of NEXBTL renewable diesel. Our aim is also to grow as a producer of other products based on renewable raw materials, such as various bio-based products for the chemical industry. Renewed vision takes us forward We are not a traditional oil company anymore which also underpins our renewed vision “Creating responsible choices every day”. We are offering our customers choices that have the power to make the world a better place to live in.

Executive share ownership A major principle of our executive remuneration policy is to ensure that there is strong alignment between the interests of Neste executives and those of its shareholders. Our executive share ownership policy requires that the President & CEO and the members of the NEB build up and maintain shareholdings which are equivalent to their annual salary. Until this threshold is met, participants must retain 100% of vested incentive shares, net of tax (~50% for 2010 LTI plan). The President & CEO, and NEB members, are not permitted to sell or transfer any vested LTI plan shares for a period of three years after vesting.

The role of price risk management in logistics is particularly present in the Renewable With the aim of securing its margin and cash flow, Neste has defined margin hedging Products’ business due to market practices in feedstock pricing and longer sea voyages. principles for its main refining businesses.

The base inventory creates a risk in Neste’s income statement and balance sheet In hedging the refining margin, derivative financial instruments are used. Hedging inasmuch as Neste applies the FIFO method for measuring the cost of goods sold, raw transactions are targeted at the components of Neste’s total refining margin, based on its materials and inventories. Hedging operations related to price risk do not target the base forecasted or committed sales and refinery production, which are exposed to international inventory.

As the pricing currency used in the oil industry is the U.S. dollar and Neste operates and Refining margin risk reports in Euro, this factor is one that exposes Neste’s business to short-term transaction and longer-term economic currency risks.

Events after the balance sheet date In 2014 Finnish Customs has levied a penalty payment totaling approximately EUR No significant events took place in the Group after the balance sheet date. 44 million on the Group because they saw that Finnish biofuel mandate requirements were not met in 2009 and 2010. Neste has supplied the amount of biofuels required by legislation in 2009 and 2010. Neste disputes Finnish Customs’ interpretation and believes that it complied with the requirements according to the legislation in force at the time. The disagreement between Neste and Finnish Customs covers how the legislation on biofuel mandate should be interpreted. Neste appealed against the Finnish Customs’ interpretation before the Administrative Court of Helsinki, which made its decision in June 2015. According to Court’s decision, Finnish Customs should not have ordered a penalty payment, because Neste had not neglected its duty to report to the authority or erred in the biofuel mandate reporting. Finnish Customs have appealed against the decision before the Supreme Administrative Court. Despite the appeal, Finnish Customs has returned penalty payment to Neste in August 2015. In March 2014, Neste received a U.S. customs ruling regarding the classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the code and corresponding duty rate for a certain product Neste Oil imported into a foreign country, including prior entries from the years 2009–2014. This classification was different than the one utilized by Neste and has a higher duty rate, which could have an effect on some of the import entries dependent upon any Free Trade Agreement between the countries. Neste disputes the classification ruling and believes the classification originally utilized was appropriate considering the product’s chemical composition and the applicable explanatory notes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Neste has filed an appeal against such classification ruling seeking to align it with those of other global jurisdictions. If the classification ruling is ultimately upheld, Neste could be required to pay additional duties with an estimated impact of EUR 12 million which has not been reported as a provision in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2015. In February 2015 the District Court of Helsinki has given its ruling in the long-pending fairway due dispute in favor of shipping companies who took action on the issue. Neste Shipping is one of the shipping companies party to the action and as a result of the court ruling will receive approximately EUR 23 million from the Finnish state as a refund for unjustifiably collected fairway dues for 2001–2004, if the ruling of the District Court becomes legally valid. The sum also includes interest for the time elapsed. The Finnish state has appealed the ruling of the District Court to the Court of Appeals. According to the ruling, in breach of EU legislation, the Finnish state was charging higher fairway dues from international traffic than domestic traffic. Consequently, traffic between Finland and other Member States was discriminated against when compared with internal traffic in Finland. In addition some Group companies are involved in legal proceedings or disputes incidental to their business. In management’s opinion, the outcome of these cases is difficult to predict but not likely to have material effect on Group’s financial position.
