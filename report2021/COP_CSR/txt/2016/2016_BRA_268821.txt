Management has been focusing constantly on conducting operations cautiously, managing risks and optimizing capital allocation in our current portfolio.

Projections suggest fossil fuels will still meet 64% of the world’s total demand for energy in 2030, according to studies presented by BP Energy Outlook 2030. Therefore, we believe barrel prices will stabilize and come into balance at a new level, to which the production chain will eventually adapt.

The investments and measures required by the EPS were completed in 2015. They involved a bidding process for larger equipment – including the FPSO unit, which is in Rotterdam for adjustments and should be in Brazil in 2H16 – , as well as hiring subsea equipment and systems; creating teams; leasing support vessels, flexible lines and umbilical cables; and structuring the logistics scheme. Able to conduct operations in deep water, QGEP is among the leading players in Brazil. The initial production is expected to amount to 20 thousand barrels of oil per day during the EPS phase. However, it will reach 30 thousand barrels per day if another well is drilled. QGEP will be able to collect data and information that will allow it to learn more about the field when production starts up at Atlanta, through the EPS. As a result, it will be able to design the best settings and specifications for the Full Development System, thus optimizing the production process with more effective cost management. First oil at Atlanta is expected for late 2016.
