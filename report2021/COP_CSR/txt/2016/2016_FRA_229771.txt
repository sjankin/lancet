The portfolio valuation includes: the appraised or at cost value of the entire property portfolio, when fully consolidated or under joint operation; the equity value of Unibail-Rodamco’s investments in assets accounted for using the equity method (mainly CentrO, Ring-Center, Gropius Passagen and Paunsdorf Centre in Germany, the Zlote Tarasy complex in Poland and a part of Rosny 2 in France).

Sustainability is a day-to-day commitment of all teams within the Group to run a more efficient and ethical business. The Group’s sustainability strategy, based on environmental best practices, social fairness and transparent governance, is designed to return reliable, quantifiable improvements in performance over the long-term. In 2015, the Group continued the implementation of its long-term sustainability strategy and priorities. In particular, in parallel with continuing efforts in environmental matters, the cooperation with stakeholders and local economic development have been reinforced in the Group’s Sustainability initiatives, which aim to sustain and create value for both the Group and its stakeholders. In 2015, an update of the materiality survey, initiated in 2012, was carried out to measure progress made and identify changes in business risks and opportunities in the real estate sector and for the Group. This updated Sustainability vision, which also included input from external stakeholders, led to design a new framework for structuring the Group's Sustainability policy and priorities, and to setup new middleterm objectives. In April 2015, Unibail-Rodamco successfully issued its third Green bond, which demonstrated again the Group’s commitment to and long-term view on sustainability both for the development, construction and operating phases. The enclosed second Green Bonds' reporting demonstrates compliance of the first three issuances on the usage of the raised funds and on the compliance of the selected projects according to the disclosed “use of proceeds”. 3 At the same time, the Group maintained its efforts in tackling environmental issues as illustrated by the increase in environmental certification for its entire portfolio and development projects. In 2015, 21 Shopping Centres and one Office building obtained “BREEAMIn-Use” certificates. By December 31, 2015, 84% (in GLA) of the Group's standing Retail properties were awarded an environmental certification representing more than 2.6 million m2 of GLA. 96% of certifications obtained reached an “Excellent” or “Outstanding” level for the “Building Management” score, which is the highest certification profile for a portfolio in the retail real estate market. The Group's active policy for CO2 emissions mitigation pays off, with a carbon intensity reduction (cumulative CO2 emissions/visit for managed shopping centres on like-for-like basis) of -17% achieved end of 2015 compared to 2012, in line with the -30% target to reach by 2020. This Group's objective for carbon emissions reduction is consistent with scenario +2°C of the Climate Conference COP21 and among the most ambitious targets across the Real Estate sector. In 2015, Unibail-Rodamco continued to implement its core Sustainability policies in the retail assets owned and managed in Germany, which are included in the Group’s reporting scope for the second consecutive year: the significant achievements in 2015 are the environmental certifications for standing assets and the rolling out of the Group's in-house Risk Management System dedicated to health and safety matters, including the annual assessment carried out by an independent third-party. For further details on the 2015 progress, KPIs and the long-term targets, please see pages 129-132. The environmental information and indicators disclosed in the following pages cover 87% of the total gross market value of the Group’s consolidated asset portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 100% of the Group’s entities with employees for human resources information.

INDEPENDENT VERIFIER’S REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT This is a free translation into English of the original report issued in the French language and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. Year ended the December 31st, 2015 To the Shareholders, In our quality as an independent verifier accredited by the COFRAC(1), under the number n° 3-1050, and as a member of the network of one of the statutory auditors of the company Unibail-Rodamco SE, we present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information established for the year ended on the December 31, 2015, presented in the “Sustainable Development” section of the management report, hereafter referred to as the “CSR Information,” pursuant to the provisions of the article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce). Responsibility of the company It is the responsibility of the management board to establish a management report including CSR Information referred to in the article 3 R. 225-105 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce), in accordance with the environmental and social protocols in their versions updated in 2013 for environmental data and in 2015 for social data (hereafter referred to as the “Criteria”), of which a summary is included in introduction to chapter 3.2, 4.1.1 and 6.1 of the management report (the “Methodological note”) and available on request at the company’s headquarters. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory requirements, the Code of Ethics of our profession as well as the provisions in the article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce). In addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations. Responsibility of the independent verifier It is our role, based on our work: ¡¡ to attest whether the required CSR Information is present in the management report or, in the case of its omission, that an appropriate explanation has been provided, in accordance with the third paragraph of R. 225-105 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce) (Attestation of presence of CSR Information); ¡¡ to express a limited assurance conclusion, that the CSR Information, overall, is fairly presented, in all material aspects, in according with the Criteria; Our verification work was undertaken by a team of six people between September 2015 and March 2016 for an estimated duration of ten weeks. We conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicables in France and the Order of May 13, 2013 determining the conditions under which an independent third-party verifier conducts its mission, and in relation to the opinion of fairness, in accordance with the international standard ISAE 3000(2). 1. Attestation of presence of CSR Information We obtained an understanding of the company’s CSR issues, based on interviews with the management of relevant departments, a presentation of the company’s strategy on sustainable development based on the social and environmental consequences linked to the activities of the company and its societal commitments, as well as, where appropriate, resulting actions or programmes. We compared the information presented in the management report with the list provided in the Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce). (1) Scope available at www.cofrac.fr (2) ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical information. UNIBAIL-RODAMCO – 2015 Financial Report 151 3 Corporate Sustainability Independent verifier’s report on consolidated social, environmental and societal information presented in the management report In the absence of certain consolidated information, we verified that the explanations were provided in accordance with the provisions in Article R. 225-105-1, paragraph 3, of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce). We verified that the information covers the consolidated perimeter, namely the entity and its subsidiaries, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L. 233-1 and the entities which it controls, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce), with the limitations specified in the Methodological Note in chapter 3.3, 4.1.1 and 6.1 of the management report. Based on this work, and given the limitations mentioned above, we confirm the presence in the management report of the required CSR information. 2. Limited assurance on CSR Information Nature and scope of the work We undertook about ten interviews with people responsible for the preparation of the CSR Information in the PMPS (Property Maintenance, Purchasing and Sustainability) and Human Resources departments, in charge of the data collection process and, if applicable, the people responsible for internal control processes and risk management, in order to: ¡¡ assess the suitability of the Criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and legibility, taking into consideration industry standards, especially the sectorial recommendation of the EPRA (European Real Estate Association) as well as the environmental and societal Guidelines of the National Council of Shopping Centres (CNCC) issued in July 2013; ¡¡ verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the CSR Information. We determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information, in relation to the characteristics of the Company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best practices. For the CSR Information which we considered the most important(1): ¡¡ At the level of the consolidated entity and of the controlled entities, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions, etc.), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, on a test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other information presented in the management report ; ¡¡ At the level of the representative selection of sites that we selected(2), based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. The sample selected therefore represented on average 15% of the total surface and 12% of the energy consumption of the 2015 total consolidated values. For the other consolidated CSR information, we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company. Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information taking into account, if relevant, professional best practices formalised in the CSR reporting sectorial Guide of the National Council of Shopping Centre. We consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work. Due to the necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk of non-detection of a significant anomaly in the CSR Information cannot be entirely eliminated. (1) KPIs (Environmental, societal and social): environmental certifications of new developments and standing assets, waste disposal and recycling, energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions per m² and per visit, water consumption, economic footprint (direct and indirect jobs), share of “green” leases among tenants signed leases, accessibility by public transportation, 4-star label, total number and breakdown of employees by geographical zone, absenteeism, total number of hours of training. Qualitative information: Company’s organisation to take into account environmental matters and environmental assessment approaches or certification, measures taken to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, territorial, economic and social impact of the Company in terms of employment and regional development, mapping of purchases, measures taken in favor of customers health and safety, HR and training policy. (2) Aéroville (Shopping Center – France), Les Quatre Temps (Shopping Center – France), Le Bourget (Exhibition & Convention Center – France), Hofe Am Brühl (Shopping Center – Germany), Paunsdorf Center (Shopping Center – Germany), Shopping City Süd (Shopping Center – Austria). 152 2015 Financial Report – UNIBAIL-RODAMCO Corporate Sustainability Independent verifier’s report on consolidated social, environmental and societal information presented in the management report Conclusion Based on our work, we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken together, has not been fairly presented, in compliance with the Criteria. Observations Without qualifying our conclusion above, we draw your attention to the following points: ¡¡As recommended by the sectorial Guidelines of the National Council of Shopping Centres (CNCC) and the sectorial Best Practices Recommendations of the EPRA (European Real Estate Association), energy consumption for shopping centers is monitored and reported over the operational scope (energy bought and managed for common areas and private areas connected to the common network), except when tenants directly and independently buy their own energy for specific uses. ¡¡The greenhouse gases emission factors used for energy consumption are the ones provided by suppliers, except for Austria and The Netherlands areas for which the emission factor related to green electricity consumption is considered equal to zero. These areas represent 9% of the total electricity consumption of the Group. ¡¡Reporting mistakes on environmental data that were validated by the sites were identified during our works. However, these mistakes do not impact consolidated data, given the controls and corrections carried out by the headquarters.
