Since the introduction of systematic measurements in 2008/09, great strides have been made in industrial safety and health. Even with the strong growth in production, the number of work-related accidents resulting in more than one lost shift or working day (lost time accidents, or LTA), was reduced significantly from 25 LTA in 2010/11 to eight in 2013/14 Despite continued development work on employee safety, Schaffner registered an increase in LTA in fiscal year 2014/15. The following measures have already been initiated:  Review and improvement of occupational health and safety management at all sites  Internal audits of workplace safety  Global interpretation of accident analysis results and preparation of an action plan  Inclusion of specific topics in the international training program (which is open to all management and staff of the Schaffner Group) 30.04.2016 UNGC COP Team Luterbach 2I5 Schaffner Group I Nordstrasse 11 I 4542 Luterbach I Switzerland P +41 32 681 66 26 I F +41 32 681 66 30 I www.schaffner.com 3.2 Environmental management 3.2.1 Energy consumption, CO2 reduction Recently completed actions Target Action Results Reduction of electricity Replacing of existing conventional lighting bulb Saving in electricity consumption at with highly efficient LED lighting system. consumption 100 MWh Schaffner's production per year Installation of variable speed control for exhaust plant in Thailand fan-motors in production lines.

Exact figure Group's headquarters we will report after one year of measuring. The reduction of the CO2 footprint goes hand in hand with the reduction of energy consumption. Reduce CO2 emission Schaffner’s goal is to significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions and to be a role model for such efforts. To accomplish this, the Group launched a project to study its global potential for emission savings and plan the necessary investment. The findings to date showed that most of the CO 2 emissions are generated by materials transport, manufacturing plants, logistics hubs and the Group’s headquarters. Based on the analysis, further emissions reduction investment is being planned and implemented. As well, employees are being sensitized to the need to reduce energy consumption and to be prudent stewards of the available resources. Transportation With production centers in Asia, Europe and the USA, the Schaffner Group is able to manufacture its products in close proximity to customer delivery locations, thus substantially reducing shipping costs. Over the years, Schaffner has reduced the share of air freight in favor of sea freight. The associated CO2 emissions (per unit of weight and distance transported) were substantially lowered. Schaffner is aiming for a further significant reduction in CO 2 emissions in the coming five years through continuous optimization of processes and the increase in the share of sea freight. In fiscal 2014/15, the proportion of air freight increased again, as customer projects are demanding ever shorter delivery times and more flexibility. New approaches to this challenge are planned.

Production The Schaffner Group’s biggest manufacturing facility is located in Thailand. Energy efficiency at the plant has been continually improved since 2010 through investment in building insulation, efficient production infrastructure and rigorous energy management. As the large improvements have already been achieved, the focus has now shifted to realizing smaller-scale savings – for instance, by investing in LED lighting. In the aggregate, such multiple small efficiency gains continue to add up to significant economies.
