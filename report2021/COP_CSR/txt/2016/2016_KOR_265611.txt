Basis of Preparation (a) Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (“K-IFRS”), as prescribed in the Act on External Audits of Corporations in the Republic of Korea. The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors on February 4, 2016, which will be submitted for approval to the shareholders at a meeting to be held on March 25, 2016. (b) Basis of measurement The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following material items in the consolidated statements of financial position: ⋏ derivative financial instruments measured at fair value ⋏ financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss measured at fair value ⋏ available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value ⋏ liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements measured at fair value ⋏ liabilities for defined benefit plans recognized at the net of the total present value of defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets and unrecognized past service costs (c) Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Parent Company’s functional currency and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. (d) Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with K-IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. (i) Uncertainties of assumptions and estimation Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included in the following notes: ⋏ Note 13 – Allowance for loan losses 095 DGB FINANCIAL GROUP 2015-2016 INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ⋏ Note 23 – Provisions ⋏ Note 24 – Defined benefit obligations ⋏ Note 47 – Commitments and contingencies The valuation team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of K-IFRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified. The Group reports significant valuation issues to the audit committee. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows. ⋏ Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ⋏ Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). ⋏ Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. (e) Changes in accounting policy Except as described below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in Note 3 to all periods presented in these separate financial statements. ⋏ Employee contribution (Amendments to K-IFRS No. 1019) The Group has applied the following amendments to standards and interpretation, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2015. The change had no significant impact on the measurements and disclosures of the Group’s assets and liabilities. (i) Employee contributions Amendments to K-IFRS 1019 introduced a practical expedient to accounting for defined benefit plan, when employees or third parties pay contributions if certain criteria are met. According to the amendments, the entity is permitted to recognize those contributions as a reduction of the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered. 3. Significant Accounting Policies The significant accounting policies applied by the Group in preparation of its consolidated financial statements are included below. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements except for the changes in accounting policies as explained in note 2.(e). (a) Operating segment An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. The Group has four operating segments which consist of Marketing, Money Market Center, Life Insurance, and Others, as described in note 4. (b) Basis of consolidation (i) Business combinations A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless it is a combination involving entities or business under common control. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. The costs to issue debt or equity securities are recognized in accordance with K-IFRS No.1032, 'Financial Instruments: Presentation' and K-IFRS No.1039, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. If share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards), then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based measure of the replacement awards compared with the market-based measure of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to pre-combination service. 096 DGB Financial Group A Decade-long Devotion to DGB Financial Group DGB Financial Group Financial Section Appendix Profile Sustainability Management 2015-2016 Highlights Strategy & Performance (ii) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. (iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. (iv) Non-controlling interests(NCIs) NCIs are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. (v) Loss of control When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. (vi) Interests in equity-accounted investees The Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates and a joint venture. Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Interests in associates and the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised initially at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and OCI of equityaccounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases. (c) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and are used by the Group in management of its short-term commitments. Generally equity investments are excluded from cash and cash equivalents. However, redeemable preference shares, for which the period from the acquisition to redemption is short, are classified as cash and cash equivalents. (d) Non-derivative financial assets The Group recognizes and measures non-derivative financial assets by the following four categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group recognizes financial assets in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Upon initial recognition, non-derivative financial assets are measured at their fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the asset’s acquisition or issuance. (i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss if it is held for trading or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Upon initial recognition, transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss when incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss. (ii) Held-to-maturity investments A non-derivative financial asset with a fixed or determinable payment and fixed maturity, for which the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, are classified as held-to-maturity investments. Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. (iii) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method except for loans and receivables of which the effect of discounting is immaterial. (iv) Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as availablefor-sale or are not classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments or loans and receivables. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value, which changes in fair value, net of any tax effect, recorded in other comprehensive income in equity. Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured and derivatives that are linked to and must be settled by delivery of such unquoted equity instruments are measured at cost. When a financial asset is derecognized or impairment losses are recognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity 097 DGB FINANCIAL GROUP 2015-2016 INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements to profit or loss. Dividends on an available-for-sale equity instrument are recognized in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. (v) De-recognition of financial assets The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred financial assets, the Group continues to recognize the transferred financial assets and recognizes financial liabilities for the consideration received. (vi) Offsetting between financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position only when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts, and there is the intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. (e) Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below. (i) Hedge accounting The Group holds forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and other derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Group designated derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments (a fair value hedge). On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s), including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of a derivative hedging instrument designated as a fair value hedge are recognized in profit or loss. The gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value for a derivative hedging instrument and the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in profit or loss in the same line item of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. Any adjustment arising from gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from the date the hedge accounting is discontinued. Cash flow hedge When a derivative is designated to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax, and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in profit or loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss in the periods during which the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognized immediately in profit or loss. (ii) Separable embedded derivatives Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately only if the following criteria has been met: (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract; (b) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and (c) the hybrid instrument is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of separable embedded derivatives are recognized immediately in profit or loss. (iii) Other derivative financial instruments Changes in the fair value of other derivative financial instrument not designated as a hedging instrument are recognized immediately in profit or loss. (f) Deferred recognition of day-one profit or loss The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (the fair value of the consideration given or received) unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. If the valuation technique incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value based on the valuation technique (day-one profit or loss) is not recognized in profit or loss upon initial recognition but deferred. Deferred day-one profit or loss is recognized over the period between the trade date and the date when the variables are expected to become observable in the market, or over the life of the trade (whichever is shorter). 098 DGB Financial Group A Decade-long Devotion to DGB Financial Group DGB Financial Group Financial Section Appendix Profile Sustainability Management 2015-2016 Highlights Strategy & Performance (g) Impairment of financial assets A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. However, losses expected as a result of future events, regardless of likelihood, are not recognized. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment. If financial assets have objective evidence that they are impaired, impairment losses should be measured and recognized. (i) Financial assets measured at amortized cost An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Group considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss either directly or by adjusting an allowance account. (ii) Financial assets carried at cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has occurred on an unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, or on a derivative asset that is linked to and must be settled by delivery of such an unquoted equity instrument, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset. Such impairment losses shall not be reversed. (iii) Available-for-sale financial assets When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognized in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment even though the financial asset has not been derecognized. Impairment losses recognized in profit or loss for an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale shall not be reversed through profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognized in profit or loss. (h) Property and equipment Property and equipment are initially measured at cost and after initial recognition, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property and equipment includes expenditures arising directly from the construction or acquisition of the asset, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. Subsequent to initial recognition, an item of property and equipment shall be carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent costs are recognized in the carrying amount of property and equipment at cost or, if appropriate, as separate items if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Property and equipment, except for land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis or a declining-balance basis over estimated useful lives that appropriately reflect the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. A component that is significant compared to the total cost of property and equipment is depreciated over its separate useful life. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment and are recognized in profit or loss. Depreciation method and the estimated useful lives of the Group’s assets are as follows: Depreciation method Useful lives (years) Buildings Straight-line method 40 Leasehold improvements Straight-line method 5 Furniture, equipment and vehicles Declining-balance method 4 (i) Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured initially at cost and, subsequently, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of intangible assets except for goodwill is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use. The residual value of intangible assets is zero. However, as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which club memberships are expected to be available for use, this intangible asset is determined as having indefinite useful lives and not amortized. 099 DGB FINANCIAL GROUP 2015-2016 INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The estimated useful lives of the Group’s assets are as follows: Useful lives (years) Computer software 4 Contributed acceptances 10 – 20 Usable and profitable donation assets 10 – 20 Amortization periods and the amortization methods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The useful lives of intangible assets that are not being amortized are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite useful life assessments for those assets. Changes are accounted for as changes in accounting estimates. (i) Research and development Expenditures on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Development expenditures are capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Other development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. (ii) Subsequent expenditures Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditures, including expenditures on internally generated goodwill and brands, are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. (j) Borrowing costs The Group capitalizes borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognized in expense as incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that requires a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Financial assets and assets that are ready for their intended use or sale when acquired are not qualifying assets. To the extent that the Group borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Group determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalization as the actual borrowing costs incurred on that borrowing during the period less any investment income on the temporary investment of those borrowings. To the extent that the Group borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Group shall determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalization by applying a capitalization rate to the expenditures on that asset. The capitalization rate shall be the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the Group that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. The amount of borrowing costs that the Group capitalizes during a period shall not exceed the amount of borrowing costs incurred during that period. (k) Investment property Property held for the purpose of earning rentals or benefiting from capital appreciation is classified as investment property. Investment property is measured initially at its cost. Transaction costs are included in the initial measurement. Subsequently, investment property is carried at depreciated cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent costs are recognized in the carrying amount of investment property at cost or, if appropriate, as separate items if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Investment property except for land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 40 years as estimated useful lives. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting date and adjusted, if appropriate. The change is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate. (l) Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than assets arising from employee benefits, deferred tax assets and non-current assets held for sale, are reviewed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, are tested for impairment annually by comparing their recoverable amount to their carrying amount. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (“CGUs”). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The value in use is estimated by applying a pre-tax discount rate that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU for which estimated future cash flows have not been adjusted, to the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. (m) Leases The Group classifies and accounts for leases as either a finance or operating lease, depending on the terms. Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards 100 DGB Financial Group A Decade-long Devotion to DGB Financial Group DGB Financial Group Financial Section Appendix Profile Sustainability Management 2015-2016 Highlights Strategy & Performance of ownership are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. (i) Finance leases At the commencement of the lease term, the Group recognizes as financial assets and financial liabilities in its consolidated statements of financial position, the lower amount of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. Any initial direct costs are added to the amount recognized as an asset. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent rents are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. The depreciable amount of a leased asset is allocated to each accounting period during the period of expected use on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy the lessee adopts for depreciable assets that are owned. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. The Group reviews to determine whether the leased asset may be impaired. (ii) Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. (iii) Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease Determining whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease shall be based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets (the asset) and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. At inception or reassessment of the arrangement, the Group separates payments and other consideration required by such an arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a financial lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, the Group recognizes an asset and a liability at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset that was identified as the subject of the lease. Subsequently, the liability shall be reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance charge on the liability recognized using the purchaser's incremental borrowing rate of interest. (n) Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. The assets or disposal group that are classified as non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. The Group recognizes an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of an asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell, and a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, up to the cumulative impairment loss previously recognized in accordance with K-IFRS No. 1036 ‘Impairment of Assets’. A non-current asset that is classified as held for sale or part of a disposal group classified as held for sale is not depreciated (or amortized). (o) Non-derivative financial liabilities The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liabilities. The Group recognizes financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial liability. (i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading or designated as such upon initial recognition. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss. Upon initial recognition, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. (ii) Other financial liabilities Non-derivative financial liabilities other than financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are classified as other financial liabilities. At the date of initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at fair value minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Group derecognizes a financial liability from the consolidated statement of financial position when it is extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires). (p) Fair value of financial instruments (i) Determination of fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value Where the classification of a financial instrument requires it to be stated at fair value, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument or by using a valuation model. The best evidence of fair value is quoted prices in an active market. If the market for a financial instrument is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using a valuation technique. 101 DGB FINANCIAL GROUP 2015-2016 INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, as reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. If there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, the Group uses that technique. Periodically, the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests it for validity using prices from any observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on any available observable market data. Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques. (ii) Classification and level of disclosure for fair value K-IFRS No. 1107 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires the Group to classify its financial instruments held at fair value according to a hierarchy that reflects the significance of observable market inputs. The classification of a financial instrument is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below. Level Description Level 1 Financial instruments are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. If there are no quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets, financial instruments classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable Level 2 in an active market. Level 3 Financial instruments are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). (iii) Determination of fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value Deposits, loans and receivables The estimated fair values of money market deposits and deposits with a residual maturity of less than 6 months are the carrying amounts. The estimated fair values of non impaired deposits, loans and receivables are the present value of contractual cash flows discounted at current market rates by factoring in the default rates and credit spreads. The estimated fair values of individually assessed impaired deposits, loans and receivable are the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. The estimated fair values of collectively assessed impaired deposits, loans and receivables are the carrying amounts less allowances for loan losses. Held-to-maturity financial assets The fair values are the quoted prices in the market or fair values evaluated by a credible evaluator. If there is no such information, their fair values are estimated by using observable market prices of financial assets with similar credit level, maturity and profit rate. Depository liabilities The carrying amounts of non-interest bearing deposits and deposits with no stated maturity or a residual maturity less than 6 months are assumed to be fair values. The estimated fair value of an interest bearing deposit is the present value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rate (market rate) of a recently issued deposit with the similar maturity. Borrowings The carrying amounts of borrowings with readjustable term for floating rate or a contract maturity less than 6 months are assumed to be fair values. The estimated fair value of borrowings not quoted in an active market is the present value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rate (market rate) of a recently issued borrowing with the similar maturity. (q) Employee benefits (i) Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are due to be settled within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service. When an employee has rendered service to the Group during an accounting period, the Group recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service. (ii) Other long-term employee benefits Other long-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are settled beyond 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service, and include the cost of training overseas which the Group grants to long-serving employees. The calculation method of the Group’s obligation is consistent with defined benefit plans. (iii) Retirement benefits: defined contribution plans When an employee has rendered service to the Group during a period, the Group recognizes the contribution payable to a defined contribution plan in exchange for that service as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for service before the end of the reporting period, the Group recognizes that excess as an asset (prepaid expense) to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund. (iv) Retirement benefits: defined benefit plans The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. 102 DGB Financial Group A Decade-long Devotion to DGB Financial Group DGB Financial Group Financial Section Appendix Profile Sustainability Management 2015-2016 Highlights Strategy & Performance The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in OCI. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. (v) Termination benefits Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when the Group is committed demonstrably, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, then they are discounted to their present value. (r) Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of a provision. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined at the present value of the expected future cash flows. Where some or all of the expenditures required to settle a provision are expected to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement shall be recognized when, and only when, it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the entity settles the obligation. The reimbursement shall be treated as a separate asset. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. A provision shall be used only for expenditures for which the provision was originally recognized. Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, are subsequently measured at the higher of: the amount of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period ; and the amount initially recognized less, cumulative amortization recognized on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period. (s) Foreign currencies (i) Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functional currency using the reporting date’s exchange rate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognized in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available-for-sale equity instruments, a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. (ii) Foreign operations If the presentation currency of the Group is different from a foreign operation’s functional currency, the financial statements of the foreign operation are translated into the presentation currency using the following methods: The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, whose functional currency is not the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, are translated to presentation currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to functional currency at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in the translation is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the relevant proportion of such cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interest. In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the relevant proportion is reclassified to profit or loss. Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which in substance is considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation, are recognized in other comprehensive income in the translation reserve. 103 DGB FINANCIAL GROUP 2015-2016 INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (t) Equity capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares and share options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. When the Group repurchases its share capital, the amount of the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction from equity and classified as treasury shares. The profits or losses from the purchase, disposal, reissue, or retirement of treasury shares are not recognized as current profit or loss. If the Group acquires and retains treasury shares, the consideration paid or received is directly recognized in equity. (u) Share-based payment transactions The Group has granted shares or share options to its employees and other parties. For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the Group measures the goods or services acquired and the liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period. (v) Finance income and finance costs (i) Interest Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses. The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability. (ii) Fees and commission Fees and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or liability are included in the measurement of the effective interest rate. Other fees and commission income, including account servicing fees, investment management fees, sales commission, placement fees and syndication fees, are recognized as the related services are performed. When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, the related loan commitment fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period. Other fees and commission expense relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are expensed as the services are received. (iii) Dividends The Group recognizes dividend income when the shareholders' right to receive payment is established. (w) Income taxes Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. (i) Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The taxable profit is different from the accounting profit for the period since the taxable profit is calculated excluding the temporary differences, which will be taxable or deductible in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future periods, and non-taxable or non-deductible items from the accounting profit. (ii) Deferred tax The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. The Group recognizes a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates, and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Group recognizes a deferred tax asset for all deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized. The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduces the carrying amount to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to offset the related current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis. 104 DGB Financial Group A Decade-long Devotion to DGB Financial Group DGB Financial Group Financial Section Appendix Profile Sustainability Management 2015-2016 Highlights Strategy & Performance (x) Accounting for trust accounts The Group accounts for trust accounts separately from its bank accounts under the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act. Funds transferred between a bank account and a trust account is recognized as borrowings from trust accounts in other liabilities with fees for managing the accounts recognized as non-interest income by the Group. (y) Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise convertible notes and share options granted to employees. (z) Acquisition costs In accordance with Article 31 of the Regulation on Accounting of Insurance Business and Article 3 of the Addendum to the Regulation, the Group amortizes actual policy acquisition costs (excluding the amount exceeding expected costs), which arose from a long-term contract entered into on or before March 31, 2004, over the life of the contract (up to seven years) using the straight-line method. If the difference is immaterial, the Group calculates amortization by subtracting the difference between premium reserves based on a net premium method and premium reserves based on a surrender value method from acquisition costs arose in the current year and deferred unamortized acquisition costs. On the other hand, the lesser of the actual or expected costs for a new contract entered into after April 1, 2004, is amortized over the life of the contract (up to seven years). The Group additionally amortizes the excess amount if unamortized acquisition costs are more than the difference between premium reserves based on a net premium method and premium reserves based on a surrender value method as of December 31, 2015. (aa) Insurance and investment contracts-classification The Group classifies a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder as an insurance contact. The Group assesses the significance of insurance risk contract by contract, considering the amounts payable if an insured event occurs, and the amounts payable if no insured event occurs. The Group classifies a contract that exposes the issuer to financial risk without significant insurance risk as an investment contract. Depending on whether an investment contract contains a discretionary participation feature or not, the accounting treatments of the investment contract is different. If there is the discretionary participation feature in the investment contract, it is treated as the same as insurance contracts, but if not, K-IFRS 1039 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is applied. A contract that qualifies as an insurance contract remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expired. If the insurance risk is not significant in the period of insurance contract, it will not be reclassified as an investment contract. But in the case of the investment contract, the Group reclassifies as an insurance contract if insurance risk turns significant after the first recognition. (ab) Insurance contract liabilities(Policy reserves) In accordance with the Supervision Regulation and related rules, the Group is required to maintain policy reserves for payment on future claims or refunds, and on dividends to participating policyholders. Such policy reserves are to be provided based on calculation methods approved by the Insurance Business Act of Korea, related laws and rules, and the Minister of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of Korea. (i) Premium reserve Premium reserve refers to an amount calculated by the net premium method for payment on future claims, which is the bigger amount between the one calculated based on standard interest rate and standard risk rate issued by the Financial Supervisory Service and the one calculated based on standard rates applied to premium calculation. If premium reserve results in an amount below zero, the Group records the premium reserve as zero. (ii) Reserve for unearned premium Reserve for unearned premium refers to the amount of premium at the collection date as of or prior to the statement of financial position date, which will be realized in the subsequent periods. (iii) Guarantee reserve In accordance with the Insurance Business Act and the Regulation on Supervision of Insurance Business, guarantee reserve refers to an amount calculated based on the standard method of measuring the guarantee reserve, which is the guarantee amount for payment on future claims up to a reasonable level in consideration of future estimated loss. (iv) Reserve for outstanding claims Reserve for outstanding claims is an estimate of loss for insured events that have occurred prior to the dates of consolidated statements of financial position, but for which a fixed value cannot be determined. In estimating the reserve for outstanding claims, the expenses to be incurred in the course of settlement of the insured events, such as expenses for lawsuit or arbitration, are added, and the claims to be reimbursed through sale of security assets, which could be acquired in the course of settlement of the insured events or exercise of rights, such as right of reimbursement, are deducted. (v) Reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends Reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends is provided for future dividends to be paid to participating policyholders to compensate for the difference in actual investment yields, mortality rates or morbidity rates, and operating expense rates from the initial rates in each policy. In addition, it includes reserve for long-term maintenance dividends to discourage cancellations; reserve for revaluation dividends, which are policyholders’ share of earnings arising from asset revaluations; and reserve for excess crediting rate to provide compensation should the expected interest rates fall below the average interest rates of one-year maturity time deposits in the current year. 105 DGB FINANCIAL GROUP 2015-2016 INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (vi) Dividend reserve for policyholders’ income participation Dividend reserve for policyholders’ income participation refers to the amount to be reserved, in lump sum, depending on the business performance for the purpose of appropriating it for future dividends to policyholders or for additional accumulation as part of policy reserve other than the reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends that is based on the contract terms and conditions. In accordance with the Supervisory Regulation, it is used for reserve for participating policyholders’ dividends and is required to be used within five years from the end of the year of occurrence. (ac) Liability adequacy test The Group assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether its recognized insurance liabilities are adequate, using current estimates of future cash flows under its insurance contracts. If that assessment shows that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities (less related deferred acquisition costs and related intangible assets) is inadequate in the light of the estimated future cash flows, the entire deficiency shall be recognized in net income. In accordance with K-IFRS 1104 Insurance Contact, the Group applies a liability adequacy test that meets specified minimum requirements. The minimum requirements are the following: (i) The test considers current estimates of all contractual cash flows and related cash flows, such as claims handling costs, as well as cash flows resulting from embedded options and guarantees. (ii) If the test shows that the liability is inadequate, the entire deficiency is recognized in net income. (ad) Reinsurance contracts The Group entered into reinsurance contracts with reinsurers to compensate them for losses on one or more contracts issued by the Group and shall not offset reinsurance assets against the related insurance liabilities or income or expense from reinsurance contracts against the expense or income from the related insurance contracts. Reinsurance assets are tested for impairment at least annually. If a reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group shall reduce its carrying amount accordingly and recognize that impairment loss in net income. A reinsurance asset is impaired if, and only if: (i) there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract; and (ii) the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer. (ae) Policyholders’ equity adjustment Policyholders’ equity adjustments consist of reserve for stabilization of participating policyholders’ dividends, reserve for social contributions, net gain (loss) from valuation of AFS securities, and (negative) changes in equity arising from application of the equity method. The reserve for stabilization of participating policyholders’ dividends and the reserve for social contributions are the amounts reserved for future dividends to participating policyholders and future social contributions through surplus from asset revaluations, respectively. Gain (loss) on valuation of AFS securities and (negative) changes in equity arising from application of the equity method represent the policyholders’ portion of gain (loss) on valuation of AFS securities and (negative) changes in equity arising from application of the equity method, respectively. (af) Valuation of separate account assets and liabilities In accordance with Article 108 of the Insurance Business Act and the Supervision Regulation of Insurance Business, all assets and liabilities related to retirement benefit insurance contracts are managed and accounted for separately as separate account assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. According to the amended Article 4-1 of Supervision Regulation of Insurance Business, the Group presents receivables from and payables to the separate account as deduction from the separate account liabilities and the separate account assets, respectively. Income and expenses of variable insurance contracts are not presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. However, income and expenses of severance insurance contracts, as shown above, are aggregated and presented as a one-line item in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as separate account income and separate account expenses, respectively, in accordance with Article 6-23 of the Regulation on Supervision of Insurance Business. (ag) New Standards and interpretation not yet adopted The following new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2015, and the Group has not early adopted them. Impact of the amendments on the following standards and interpretations cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2015. (i) K-IFRS No.1109,Financial Instruments K-IFRS 1109, published in December 2015, replaces the existing guidance in K-IFRS No. 1039, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. K-IFRS 1109 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from K-IFRS No. 1039. K-IFRS 1109 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. (ii) K-IFRS No.1115,Revenue from Contracts with Customers K-IFRS 1115, published in January 2016, establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including K-IFRS No. 1018, Revenue, K-IFRS No. 1011, Construction Contracts and K-IFRS No. 2113, Customer Loyalty Programmes. K-IFRS 1115 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. 106 DGB Financial Group A Decade-long Devotion to DGB Financial Group DGB Financial Group Financial Section Appendix Profile Sustainability Management 2015-2016 Highlights Strategy & Performance 4.

(i) Deferred recognition of day-one profit or loss In the case that the fair value of financial instrument is measured through a valuation technique with observable market data, the fair value of financial instrument is a transaction price if the transaction price differs from the fair value through a valuation technique. If the valuation technique incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value based on the valuation technique (day-one profit or loss) is not recognized in profit or loss upon initial recognition but deferred. Deferred day-one profit or loss is recognized over the period between the trade date and the date when the variables are expected to become observable in the market. If the variables become observable, the deferred remaining amount is recognized in profit or loss immediately. The details of deferred day-one profit or loss as of December 31, 2015.

Financial Risk Management (a) Purpose of risk management The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk from financial instruments. The Group's risk management system aims at maintaining capital adequacy and managing stability through the comprehensive appraisal and management of significant risks that arise in management activities. By optimizing risk and return balance, the risk management system realizes the stable growth of the Group, while maximizing company value and maintaining an adequate equity capital level as well as achieving business strategies, policies and plans. (b) Risk management organization The Group's risk management organization consists of a risk management committee, risk management council, risk management working group, risk management department and sub-risk management departments. The risk management committee (the Committee) is the top decision-making body chaired by an outside director. It sets up risk management strategy, maintains the adequacy of capital level and manages risk tolerance. Commissioned by the Committee, the risk management council (the Council) deliberates and resolves issues on the agenda, develops and controls risk management strategies and policies and oversees interest rates, capital supply and management risks involving new products and businesses. The risk management working group (the Working Group) monitors the operation and practical review of resolutions and deliberations of and by the Council. The risk management department (the Department) assists top management, the Committee, the Council and individual risk management department of each division fine-tune their risk management plans and measure as well as analyze risks at the division level. The Group sets up sub-risk management departments for credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk and each department is responsible for compliance with risk management strategy and policy. Through the step-by-step loss management (MAT), the Group built a step-by-step reporting system which prevents additional loss and controls risk efficiently for the excessive loss on trade and valuation of the loss limited portfolio. (c) Credit risk (i) Purposes of credit risk management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to The Group, if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's balance accounts and off balance accounts such as loans and receivables, payment guarantee, securities, derivatives from customers and investment securities. The purposes of credit risk management are to maintain the asset quality by controlling loss possibility for the counterparty in falling to meet its contractual obligations and to manage industry type and borrower type concentration risk by controlling a loan portfolio and the credit share limit. (ii) Credit risk management organization Credit risk management is conducted by the Committee, the Council, the Working Group, the Department, credit risk team and sub risk management departments. The Department conducts recognizing, measuring, controlling and checking the adequacy of the Group-wide, departmental or organizational credit risk. It also conducts analyzing and reporting credit risk, developing and improving credit risk management skill, reporting the result of credit risk check-up and providing the information. Credit risk team conducts installing and operating the credit risk management system. Loan review department conducts check-up of loan quality classification through regular credit review. Sub-risk management departments establish and implement credit risk management plans, recognize, measure, analyze and report credit risk, manage loan portfolio considering risk and return, analyze credit risk and conduct follow-up management resulted from new product launching, implement the resolutions from the Committee and Council, supervise countries' credit risk considering credit level of international credit appraisal institutes and submit other credit risk reporting documents. Internal audit inspects the adequacy of recognizing, measuring and evaluating credit risk, credit risk control organization and managing process. (iii) Method of credit risk management ① Loans Credit line The Group manages the concentration risk by considering the economic conditions and environmental factors, and sets credit line for each individual, industry and type of loan. The Group evaluates the concentration ratio of the borrower with large exposure and uses the concentration ratio as a parameter for credit risk management. 144 DGB Financial Group A Decade-long Devotion to DGB Financial Group DGB Financial Group Financial Section Appendix Profile Sustainability Management 2015-2016 Highlights Strategy & Performance Credit approval system Enterprises' Credit Scoring System is operated through sophisticated, common or unsophisticated credit rating models according to the amount of enterprises' loans and financial conditions. Households' Credit Scoring System is operated through the ASS (Application Scoring System) or BSS (Behavioral Scoring System). Evaluation The Group systematically evaluates clients' qualifications for a loan by the professional in charge of credit assessment and SRM (Senior Relationship Management) and reevaluates the clients' capability to redeem according to the change of credit conditions. Evaluation is performed on a regular basis. If there is a specific circumstance regarding clients, evaluation may be performed when necessary. In the case of households, the length of extension, renewal or revolving of loans is determined according to the Behavioral Scoring System. ② Debt securities The Group manages the credit risk for debt securities through their credit rating or the similar external credit rating. In the case of using the external credit rating, it is converted to internal rating and its credit line is managed in accordance with the credit line regulations on internal rating. ③ Risk mitigation policy If there is a circumstance or evidence that can increase the credit risk, the Group takes action to mitigate credit risk such as reducing amounts outstanding (in discussion with the clients or counterparties if appropriate). Collateral The Group has various policies and guidance regarding the mitigation of credit risk. Generally, the Group obtains collateral for loans and operates guidance related to acquisition, valuation, and limits related to collateral management. In the case of collateral for real estate, settlement of mortgage is required for acquisition. For movable assets, securities and deposit receivables and establishing the right of pledge is required. Other receivables are required to be obtained through transfer. Obtained collateral are revalued through appraisal after a certain amount of time. Collaterals for loans are, for instance, house, equipment, factories, land, deposit, debt securities and equity securities. Guarantee and derivatives The Group enters into guarantee and derivative contracts to transfer the credit risk of its loans and receivables to third parties. The above contracts require third parties to make payments to reimburse the Group for a loss incurred by debtor’s default. Master netting agreements In many cases, even though master netting agreements are in place, the lack of an intention to settle on a net basis results in the related assets and liabilities being presented gross on the statement of financial position.

The Group is able to deal with unexpected cash flows through the disposal of securities and by additional fund raising resources such as the asset securitization market. 153 DGB FINANCIAL GROUP 2015-2016 INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (e) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments or future cash flows is affected by the volatility of market rates or prices such as interest rates, stock prices and foreign exchange rates. (i) Purposes of market risk management Purposes of market risk management are to secure the profitability and stability by controlling the losses generated from managed assets and liabilities due to volatility of market risk factors such as interest rates, stock prices and foreign exchange rates. Those subject to market risk management are securities held for trading, foreign currency net open positions, derivatives, off balance transactions and other market risk inherent assets and liabilities. (ii) Market risk management organization The Group divides exposures to market risk into trading position and non-trading position. To promote the classification and management of trading position, the Group operates its accounting and computer system according to the classification. The Group also classifies and operates a trading desk and nontrading desk separately. Market risk management of the Group is conducted by the Committee, the Council, the Working Group, the Department and sub-risk management departments. The Department is distinctly separated from operating departments and controls entire market risks. The main tasks of the Department are to establish and implement a market risk management policy, to review the adequacy of market risk management criteria, to establish and implement the market risk tolerance management system, to distribute market risk tolerance, to monitor the observance of market risk tolerance, to assess, analyze and report total market risk and to establish and implement the market risk management system. Front office is distinctly separated from the assisting department and the Department. The main tasks of the front office are to establish and implement investing policy, process and strategy, to set out and operate the limit of the Group's market risk tolerance, to record transaction history and to submit related documents to the assisting department. The assisting department is supposed to secure the restrict separation of work and mutual control function between middle office and back office. The main tasks of assisting departments are to review the compliance of limits, transactions, profit and loss evaluation, to conduct follow up works such as exchanging transaction confirmation documents based on operating department's transaction documents, accounting, money and to submit market risk reports. (iii) Trading position Trading position is the interest rate, equity positions, derivatives, foreign exchange positions, among others that pursue profit from short-term changes in market factor price rather than pursue profit from interest income. Specifically, it includes short-term trading and the financial instruments for arbitrage trading of stock, interest rates, foreign exchange, commodity, among others, which are acquired by a professional dealer or operational departments within a predetermined limit, things acquired for hedging risk, derivative that does not apply hedge accounting, etc. ① Risk management method The tolerance limit (including the limit of VaR, investment limit, loss limit) to manage the market risk on trading positions is required to be set principally at least once a year, and approved by the Committee. Compliance of the tolerance limit is monitored daily and the changes of the risk are simultaneously reported to the management, the Council and the Committee on a regular basis (daily, monthly, and annually). Plans for dealing with the market risk are established and operated for each level of the risk. ② Risk assessment method Value at Risk (VaR) The main method to measure and manage exposure to market risk for trading position is VaR. The VaR measures the potential loss in value of a risky asset or portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. The VaR is calculated by applying 99% confidence level at a 10-day. Analysis of crisis situations The Group conducts crisis situation analysis to determine changes in market price of the portfolio under extreme market volatility that cannot be considered in the VaR model. Crisis situation analysis is conducted every business day for all the assets, or if necessary, can be performed by constructing a portfolio. Implementations are reported to the Council one or more times a month. For analysis of crisis situation, changes in the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured under integrated scenario which assumes decline in stock prices by 30.8%, rise in interest rates by 200bps and change in exchange rate by 25%. Verification Adequacy of the VaR model is continuously monitored through follow-up verification. Verification is conducted for the latest 250 business days. If a real loss exceeds a virtual loss (1-day VaR) of the previous day significantly, the Group verifies assumptions and modifies the model, if necessary. Verification is conducted every business day and implementations are reported to the Council once or more times a month. VaR by risk types (trading position) VaR by risk types as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows: (In millions of won) 2015 Period end Average Minimum Maximum Interest rate risk \ 132 215 35 532 Foreign exchange risk 1,383 124 27 1,383 Stock risk 1,912 1,885 369 3,417 Diversification effect (1,489) (455) (17) (2,266) Total risk \ 1,938 1,769 414 3,066 154 DGB Financial Group A Decade-long Devotion to DGB Financial Group DGB Financial Group Financial Section Appendix Profile Sustainability Management 2015-2016 Highlights Strategy & Performance (In millions of won) 2014 Period end Average Minimum Maximum Interest rate risk \ 29 188 29 535 Foreign exchange risk 708 64 15 709 Stock risk 323 2,289 322 3,438 Diversification effect (220) (269) (13) (1,266) Total risk \ 840 2,272 353 3,416 The sum of VaR for each risk type does not match the total VaR due to correlation between risk factors and the diversification effect. The correlation between risk factors and the volatility are calculated using the simple moving average method. The interest rate risk of DGB Life Insurance Co.,Ltd. The interest rate exposure is the volume of the interest-bearing asset and liability that their values are changed based on interest rate fluctuations. The duration provided by an asset management firm, bond rating agency or trust company must be applied to the interest-rate sensitivity of the interest-bearing asset. If the duration is unavailable, the maturity method from the Financial Supervisory Services is applied. For the interest rate sensitivity of interest-bearing liability, different variables are applied on the basis of the insurance categorization and the way of interest rate separation. DGB Life Insurance Co.,Ltd. calculates interest rate risks reflecting the interest rate backspread amount due to the difference between the market rate and the accumulated rate because of the revision of the way of interest rate risk amount calculation.

The price risk is an analysis about KOSPI 200 index changes, and 10% increase and decrease are used for reasonable and possible fluctuations. This shows a management’s evaluation about the reasonable and possible fluctuations of the stock index. (In millions of won) 2015 The effect of profit or loss Capital effect Beneficiary certificate 10% increase \ 79 10% decrease \ (79) (iv) Non-trading position The Group manages interest rate risk for non-trading position. Interest rate risk of non-trading position is the risk that the net asset value or net interest income might decrease due to the inconsistency of interest rate maturity and the unfavorable change of market interest rate. The Group measures interest rate risk for interest assets such as loans, dues from banks and bonds, for interest rate liabilities such as deposits and borrowings and for hedge derivatives. Among non-trading positions, marketable availablefor-sale financial assets (stocks) are managed through VaR.. ① Method of interest rate risk management The tolerance limit to manage the interest rate risk on trading positions is required to be set in principle at least once a year, and approved by the Committee. To verify complying with the tolerance limit, the interest risk is measured and managed at least once a month, and reported to the management, the Council and the Committee. 155 DGB FINANCIAL GROUP 2015-2016 INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ② Assessment methods for interest rate risk Value at Risk (VaR) Interest rate VaR measures potential losses in value of a net asset over a defined period for a given confidence interval. The Group calculates interest rate VaR by the gap of interest rate and the modified duration. Earning at Risk (EaR) EaR is the quantity by which net income is projected to decline in the event of an adverse change in prevailing interest rates. Others The Group evaluates interest rates risk by using the rate of interest gap, and conducts the interest risk analysis of crisis situations under abnormal market conditions at least twice a year. Also, the department verifies the accuracy, completeness and suitability one or more times a year regularly and observes measurement-related data constantly and independently. Interest rate VaR (non-trading position) Interest rate VaR as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows: (In millions of won) End Average Minimum Maximum 2015(*) \ 65,732 43,207 8,365 73,233 2014(*) 56,439 53,985 33,601 72,599 (*) Simple sum of Daegu Bank’s interest rate VaR and DGB Capital Co.,Ltd’s interest rate VaR. (v) Foreign exchange bias Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments or future cash flows are affected by the volatility of foreign exchange rate. The Group does not divide foreign exchange position into trading position and non-trading position but manages it on the whole. Exposures to foreign exchange risk as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows: (In millions of won) USD JPY EUR Others 2015 Foreign currency financial assets \ 1,922,285 82,077 35,835 64,371 Foreign currency financial liabilities 1,561,696 104,621 22,704 48,367 2014 Foreign currency financial assets 1,011,851 121,006 29,735 29,565 Foreign currency financial liabilities 1,028,157 135,685 27,791 12,162 (f) Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Group's processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure and from external factors. The Group designates a related department to identify operational risk and other departments are responsible for recognition of loss data and computer system management. The Department is responsible for establishing and implementing operational risk strategy, policy and process. It is also responsible for establishment, operation and improvement of operational risk management system and management of the Group's loss data. The Group applies operational standardized approach and calculates required capital with the average amount for three years by mapping its business lines into eight lines and aggregating the amounts obtained by multiplying gross income for each business line by the corresponding rate(12~18%). Tolerable limit for operational risk is set at least once a year and gets an approval from the Committee. Operational risk is measured and is reported to the management, the Council and the Committee on a regular basis. (g) Insurance risk The Group calculates an insurance price risk amount on the basis of risk based on capital requirements (RBC). The insurance price risk is the possibility of a loss from the difference between the actual insurance payment and benefit payments from policyholders. The details of the insurance risk exposure as of December 31, 2015 are as follows. (In millions of won) 2015 Death \ 14,728 Hazard 4,335 Hospitalization 3,400 Surgery·diagnosis 11,643 Medical indemnity 3,051 Others 2,332 Total 39,489 The Group uses reinsurance for the purpose of building financial stability and easing the concentration of the insurance risk. The reinsurance strategy is managed by the reinsurance management standard that the risk committee sets up. The Group determines reinsurance ceded in the consideration of the risk tendency of the contract, the Group’s payment ability, and mortality profit and loss. 156 DGB Financial Group A Decade-long Devotion to DGB Financial Group DGB Financial Group Financial Section Appendix Profile Sustainability Management 2015-2016 Highlights Strategy & Performance (h) Capital management The Group is required to maintain more than 8% of minimum capital compared to risk-weighted assets (“BIS ratio”) on a consolidated basis according to the Financial Holding Company Act. BIS ratio is defined by the ‘International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard’ of Basel Committee on Banking Supervision within the Bank of International Settlement. BIS ratio is an international standard regarding the capital adequacy ratio regulation to cope with risk increase of financial companies and is calculated as ‘(common stock capital + other core capital + supplementary capital – deductions) ÷ risk weighted assets’. Common stock capital is the permanent capital comprised of capital, capital surplus, retained earnings, etc., other core capital is comprised of hybrid securities which meet the requirements of Basel III, and supplementary capital is comprised of allowances for credit losses accumulated for assets classified as ‘normal’ or ‘precautionary’ and hybrid securities which meet the requirements of Basel III. Deductions are assets (e.g. deferred tax assets) which don’t have the nature of capital for the purpose of capital adequacy regulation and are deducted from equity capital. Regulated capital and BIS ratio (neither audited nor reviewed by the external auditor) of the Group as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows. The Group has complied with all the external capital maintenance restriction conditions for the past two years.

Disclosures for Fair Value (a) Valuation method of fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost Valuation method of disclosed fair value for assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value are as follows: Valuation method Cash and due from banks The estimated fair values of cash and due from banks are the carrying amounts. Held-to-maturity financial assets The fair values of held-to-maturity financial assets are determined using prices evaluated by credible evaluators. Loans The fair values of loans are the present value of contractual cash flows discounted at market rates by factoring in the default rates and credit spreads. Depository liabilities The estimated fair values of demand deposits are the carrying amounts. The estimated fair values of time deposits are the present value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rate. The estimated fair values of call money and borrowings in won are the carrying amounts. The fair values of other borrowings are the present value of Borrowings future cash flows discounted at the interest rate. Debentures The fair values of debentures are the present value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rate.

Responsibility and Objective DGB Financial Group is responsible for all information and claims contained in the Report regarding the establishment of its sustainability management goals, performance management etc. The responsibility of the Auditor is to deliver the findings from its assurance undertaking to the management of DGB Financial Group. The key objective of the assurance is to check whether there are any material bias or errors present in the Report; assess whether the underlying data collection system is in proper working order; while undertaking in an overall review of the Company’s process for identifying issues of material importance to sustainability management as well as the produced results so that the Auditor may deliver recommendations that can help improve the quality of future reporting. Assurance Type and Level The Report was reviewed against the following criteria and guidelines: (1) AA1000 Assurance Standards (2008)1 ; (2) Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines2; and (3) B.E.S.T Sustainability Reporting Guidelines3 Assurance Scope Contents of the “2015-16 Sustainability Report by DGB Financial Group Assurance Type & Level Type Ⅱ, Moderate level “IPS Assurance Manual” to verify compliance against AA1000AS (2008) standard's three core principles “IPS Performance Indicators Assurance Criteria” to assess the reliability of performance indicators Assurance Criteria GRI Guideline’s “in accordance” options B.E.S.T Guideline’s “reporting level” Work Undertaken and Scope The Auditor confirmed 1) the inclusivity, materiality, and responsiveness of the reported content; 2) the reliability of the reported performance data; 3) the Report’s level of compliance against GRI's G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines; and 4) the level of compliance relative to the B.E.S.T Reporting Guidelines through the process outlined below. •Review of the Company’s processes for identifying material issues and outcomes •Review of the Company’s stakeholder engagement processes •Interviews with persons responsible for each performance dimension and the collection of performance data to determine the adequacy of the reported content •On-site review to assess systems and processes in place for the collection and reporting of raw performance data(DGB Financial Group's Head Office) •Review of underlying reference data on key economic, social, and environmental performance •Sample testing of materiality issues to ascertain the completeness and accuracy of information contained in the Report •Review of the Report’s compliance against GRI/ B.E.S.T reporting guidelines Limitations The scope of this undertaking was limited to: •Interviews with individuals responsible for different performance dimensions and the collection of performance data; review of the adequacy of the reported data •On-site review of DGB Financial Group 's Head Office •Assurance based on relevant data and information available for the relevant reporting period •Review of the reliability of reported performance data •This undertaking does not include data on green-house gas emissions, which is subject to a separate review Assurance Findings The Auditor does not find the Report to contain any material misstatements or bias. ● Inclusivity Does the Company have adequate stakeholder engagement strategy setting and related processes in place? It is the Auditor's view that the DGB Financial Group has put various processes for stakeholder engagement in place to better reflect relevant findings in its business management activities, in recognition of the importance of stakeholder participation in achieving its sustainability management objectives. Notably, the Company has defined its stakeholders into three groups depending on their level of potential impact on performance outcomes core, strategic, and others while providing communication channels specific to each group to better collect stakeholder-specific requirements and views. The Company also carried out stakeholder awareness surveys to assess factors that may potentially impact the Company's sustainability management while reflecting survey findings in its sustainability management program and initiatives all in line with the principle of inclusivity. ● Materiality Does the Report contain information of the highest material importance to DGB Financial Group stakeholders across the economic, social, and environmental dimensions? It is the Auditor’s view that the Report does not omit or exclude any issues of material importance to the sustainability management activities of the DGB Financial Group. The Auditor took note of efforts by the Company to provide a full well-balanced account not only of the core-most issues of stakeholder concern but other non-core issues as well, including related activities and achieved outcomes, by establishing a process for identifying major issues impacting sustainability management based on findings from internal and external environmental analysis; defining priorities based on materiality testing results; verifying the validity of findings by analyzing the level of importance to the Company in terms of organizational impact and stakeholder interest; defining the top ten core issues and top 20 focused reporting items via a process of identifying core-most issues of stakeholder concern as well as top priority issues subject to focused reporting, etc. The Auditor noted that the top 20 focused reporting items were highlighted adequately throughout the Report as a central part of its overall layout all in line with materiality principles. 1 AA1000AS is a sustainability assurance standard developed by the UK-based Institute of Social and Ethical Accountability (AccountAbility) in November 1999 to assure organization-wide sustainability performance and accountability by improving the quality of accounting, auditing and reporting practices in the social and business ethics domain. The revised 2008 version has been in effect since 2010. 2 The GRI G4 Guideline was established by the GRI, convened by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES) and UNEP in 1997. After the first universal GRI sustainability reporting guidelines for multinationals was released in 2000, the latest G4 version was introduced in May 2013, with enhancements in supply chain, governance, ethics & integrity, anti-corruption, GHG emissions & energy disclosures. 3 The B.E.S.T Guideline was jointly developed by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy (MOCIE), the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), and the Institute for Industrial Policy Studies (IPS) in 2006 as a sustainability reporting and assurance guideline, and provides for five levels of reporting rigor (Level 1 ~ 5). 161 DGB FINANCIAL GROUP 2015-2016 INTEGRATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT ● Responsiveness Does the Report provide an adequate response to stakeholder demands and interests? The Auditor found the DGB Financial Group to be providing an adequate response to issues of concern and interest to Company stakeholders. It has established diverse channels of communication for different stakeholder groups, while working to reflect the Company's response to those communication findings in its Report. The Auditor took note of efforts by the DGB Financial Group to keep track of and manage expectations and issues identified via its two-way communication channels with respective stakeholders. Moreover, efforts by the Company were noted in many areas assessing the level of stakeholder awareness toward sustainability management through surveys; carrying out surveys to identify issues of material importance to sustainability management; analysis on views and recommendations from stakeholder representatives and experts; and incorporating the Company's position and planned response into its sustainability Report, etc. all consistent with the principle of responsiveness. ● GRI “In Accordance” Criteria The Auditor confirmed that the Report is “in accordance” with GRI G4 guidelines under the “comprehensive option”, as it reports on General Standard Disclosures and Additional Disclosures (materiality aspects, DMA, performance indicators) as indicated in the G4 Guidelines. ● Reliability of Performance Indicators Pursuant to a review of the performance data stated in the Report, the Auditor found the underlying data collection system to be adequate and failed to find any material errors that can either bias the Company’s judgment or compromise the reliability of the data. The following performance indicators were reviewed for the purpose of this assurance. Strategic Direction Strategic Challenge Core Issue Performance Indicator Future Strategic Creating sustainable performance Responding to globalization and financial/economic crisis Publication of research reports 31 reports Management Sound corporate governance Governance (decision making structure) Proportion of outside directors 83.3% Customer Satisfaction Creating customer values Strengthening IT security and prevention of financial transactions Leakage of personal information zero Management Sustainable finance Strengthening product and service accountability Financial support for low income households 139 bn won Strengthening Human resource promotion and support Greater priority on securing human talent Average training expenses per person 1,060,000 won Organizational Competency Management for happiness of executives and employees Improving satisfaction of executives and employees Satisfaction level of executives and employees 90 points Risk and change management Corruption Anti-corruption/number of unlawful violations zero Risk Management Strengthening environmental management Response to climate change GHG emissions 18,132tCO2e Creating Shared Win-win management with business partners Enhancing vendor rights and roles Percentage of vendor grievances processed 100% Values Local community engagement and advancement Local community (social contributions) Social contribution expenditure/net income 8.8% ✽Although all top 20 issues and KPI's most relevant to the DGB Financial Group were validated, only a partial sub-set of indicators most relevant to sustainability management has been noted above. ● Level of B.E.S.T Guideline Application In view of the coverage and reliability of the information provided, the Auditor finds the Report to qualify for a Level 4 Report (Levels 1 to 5) relative to the B.E.S.T Guidelines, which is indicative of a level of sustainability consistent with the “anchoring” phase. Recommendations The Auditor found the “2015-2016 Sustainability Report by the DGB Financial Group commendable in the following respects. The Report (1) outlines Company plans for sustainability management in the future, based on a review and analysis of all related activities, achievements, and key issues addressed over the last ten years since the Company first declared the launch of its sustainability management initiatives; (2) identifies areas for improvement based on stakeholder survey outcomes and expert advice as well as the Company's response reflecting its recognition of the importance of stakeholder engagement; and (3) reflects its interest and active engagement in global issues along side efforts to deliver value to its customers as a financial group centered around the local community while also working to expand its operations nationwide. For future reports, the Auditor recommends considering the following. •Provide analysis and disclosure on stakeholder-specific or economic, environmental, social values delivered across DGB Financial Group's value chain; •Strengthen reporting on the Company's mid-to-long term sustainability management roadmap while also identifying actionable tasks and reporting achieved outcomes relative to stated goals; •Strengthen the responsibilities, roles, and activities of the Company's sustainability management committee, as the highest decision making body responsible for sustained integrated management of sustainability; •Outline plans for providing specialized products and services for sustainable financing and propose values for sustainable consumption; and •Examine ways to further refine channels of communication as well as analytical methodologies to better identify the needs of respective stakeholders more accurately.
