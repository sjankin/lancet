They also included recommendations on how to solve those problems. RESULT: One year later, during the next scheduled follow-up audit, the supplier had taken action and greatly improved its chemical and hazardous material management. It had installed proper anti-leak catch basins, fire prevention equipment, and made available the necessary safety equipment.

There is now coating costs through labor and sustainability savings, without one instead of three separate pretreatment processes, resulting compromising throughput time or quality. in savings in terms of waste-water disposal and therefore charges as well as significantly reduced safety hazards. SOLUTION: Following a complete review of workflows across the factory, the floor layout has been redesigned to operate using a single powder-coating line. Advanced technology has delivered lower energy consumption due to more efficient gas burners, along with production monitoring systems, which drop the supply of gas to the line when not in use during shift changeover or employee breaks. The line is capable of running two ­colors simultaneously, while sharing pretreatment and drying processes in order to reduce chemical waste and minimize safety hazards.

HID Global’s Green Team Playbook engages employees in sustainability To empower more employees who are enthusiastic about ­environmental responsibility to participate in the company’s sustainability efforts, HID Global created a “playbook” for its innovative Green Teams. The HID Green Team Playbook was developed as a practical, hands-on guide to standardize sustain­ ability practices across the organization. CHALLENGE: The HID Global Sustainability Program formally started three years ago with small projects and then increasingly took on bigger challenges, such as ISO 14001 certification and LEED Platinum. As this was happening, an increasing number of employees within HID Global were hearing about the com­ pany’s commitment to sustainability and had an interest in ­contributing to “green” efforts, but they didn’t know how to get involved. Enthusiasm among employees to support sustainabil­ ity efforts was being squandered due to a lack of a structure for employee engagement. SOLUTION: Recognizing that the company was missing an opportunity to harness the knowledge and initiative of employ­ ees outside the core centralized team, HID Global decided to broaden the possibilities to give more employees the opportu­ nity to get involved in creating “green” business value. The Green Teams share a common purpose to build a sustainable future, and the HID Green Team Playbook provides best prac­ tices, methodologies, case studies, process worksheets and tips on how virtually any employee can help increase resource effi­ ciency, reduce costs or drive “green” product revenue. RESULT: The Green Teams and their playbook are energizing a broader base of employees to make a difference for both the environment and the business. Employees now come together on these teams across functions and regions to brainstorm ideas, make recommendations and collaborate on ways to add value to the business by being ”green.” ASSA ABLOY SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 People 17 People Gender balance and diversity A progressive approach to gender balance and diversity is both positive and necessary for the Group.
