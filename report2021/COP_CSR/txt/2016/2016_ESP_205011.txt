Looking back on the past and forward into the future, it is impossible to contemplate the growth of the Madrid region without considering Metro and everything it represents: a spectacular parallel transformation above and below ground and a nearly century-long tradition of regular metro use by both Madrid residents and visitors alike. In order for a company like Metro de Madrid to remain economically, socially and environmentally sustainable, it must constantly face challenges. For us, challenge means efficient management and holding ourselves to the highest standard of service to our users, all of which has made us a domestic and international reference for other companies. One of the best examples of the efforts to manage the company as efficiently as possible is the Energy Saving Plan, which has yielded the positive results that we are proud to present here today thanks to the implementation of money-saving and energy-optimising technical measures. Generally speaking, since 2012 the Company has managed to reduce high voltage power usage by 22%, from 713 MkWh in 2012 to 582 MkWh in 2014. The energy we saved is equivalent to the amount of energy that all of the households in a city like Guadalajara would use in one year. Sustainable mobility is another area where the Company’s efforts have been focused. In 2014, we entered the pilot phase of the Train2Car Project with the presentation of the first Metrolinera in Spain. This R+D+i led by Metro de Madrid enables electric cars to recharge using the energy created by the trains’ braking systems. Once the usefulness of this project has been demonstrated, 10 Anual Report and CSR 2014 it will undergo further studies and testing before it is expanded to other areas in the future. As for the generation of revenue, successful business development initiatives were combined with the commencement of the Strategic Real Estate Plan in 2014, the main objective of which is to allocate more than 95,000 square metres of property in disuse owned by Metro and the Community of Madrid to residential and tertiary use and green space by filling gaps and burying depots in Madrid. These efforts are expected to bring in revenues of nearly 120 million euros. In 2014, two of the four planned transactions were completed, which consisted of a plot of land at calle Granada-Cavanilles and the Cuatro Caminos depot. Thanks to these operations, Metro will be moving its headquarters to Canillejas. The construction of a new building that is scheduled to be ready by for 2018 will allow us to integrate staff, take advantage of synergies, decrease productions costs and save on rental costs. One of the signs of recovery in the Community of Madrid is the uptick in passenger demand that was seen in 2014 for the first time since 2008. As a consequence, 21 secondary lobbies that had been closed since the summer of 2012 as a cost-saving measure to offset the decline in passenger demand and reduce fraud were reopened in 2014. In conclusion, it is important to note that as a result of the improvements made to the way in which the company is managed during these years which have been difficult for Metro de Madrid, transit fares did not increase in 2014, which is a first in the history of our Community. u 11 Anual Report 2014 Message from the CEO Ignacio González Velayos CEO Our Company celebrates its 95th anniversary this year. Today, we can proudly affirm that the three underlying objectives for which Metro de Madrid was created, that is to provide a “fast, comfortable and safe” transit system, remain intact. Over the last 95 years, Metro de Madrid has transformed the mobility of the entire region. Today, Metro de Madrid is a regional transit system that is present in 12 municipalities of the Community of Madrid. Once again this year, we have combined our Corporate Social Responsibility Report and Annual Report into a single document. This, the second integrated report that combines legal, economic and financial data with social and environmental, is yet another example of Metro de Madrid’s commitment to transparency and to reinforcing the company’s image as an organisation that is committed to its customers and has assumed the obligation to develop corporate responsibility policies and practices. As such, we have assumed the obligation to share the Company’s progress each year made in a sustainability report, as established in the United National World Compact which Metro de Madrid has signed. 2014 was characterised by the economic recovery. Following years of steady decline in demand, metro trips were up by more than 3 million in 2014, which resulted in a series of improvements to our services: all lobbies were reopened in December 2014, more trains were added to the schedule and the Metro Quality Plan was set in motion. I encourage you to learn, through this integrated report, about the projects, initiatives and actions we are taking to meet the challenges our Company faces, as well as our commitment to social and economic development and the protection of our environment. u 12 13 02 Board of Directors Board of Directors of Metro de Madrid, S.A.

The underground network has modern, automated operating, signalling, safety and accessibility systems, all of which are part of the Company’s knowhow and have attracted the interest of subway operators and companies operating in the rail sector from all over the world. With 95 years of experience and an increase in demand for the first time since 2008, at Metro de Madrid we are fully committed to our travellers and to offering them the highest quality service as the region’s leading mode of public transport. According to the latest survey of Metro’s image among the citizens of the Community of Madrid, our overall image rating improved by 0.12 last year (7.21 out of 10).

The strategic initiatives in place in 2014 designed to enable Metro de Madrid to achieve these objectives were as follows: The Metro de Madrid 2012-2015 Optimisation Plan, led by the Executive Committee and coordinated by the Strategic Planning Service, is designed to enhance the Company’s financial situation, reducing its dependence on subsidies from the Madrid Regional Government and other administrations. This Plan seeks to augment efficiency in public expenditure with a package of measures designed to cut costs in all possible areas with minimum repercussions for passengers, while actively searching for 26 Management Report and C.S.R Benchmarking Metro de Madrid is a member of the CoMET Group (Community of Metros), which is made up of the world’s main subway networks, as well as the NOVA Group (whose members are medium sized subway networks). Between the two, they account for practically all of the world’s most relevant underground networks. These groups seek to understand and disseminate best practices for the sector at the international level. As a member of these groups, we are able to consult the solutions to real problems that have been adopted by metro operations similar to ours. In addition, the ability to compare ourselves with other metro operations is a magnificent tool for identifying areas for improvement. Metro de Madrid was the Vice President of the Group in 2014 and will assume the Presidency in 2015. The CoMET and NOVA groups receive methodological support from RTSC, an organisation associated with the prestigious Imperial College of London that works with the international community of metro operators on research and maintains an exhaustive database that includes a complete battery of key benchmarking indicators. As a member of this community, all Metro de Madrid employees have access to this international forum of experts and the ability to learn how other metro operators around the world have solved some of the problems that we face on a daily basis. The queries, studies and other activities involving the CoMET community are coordinated by the Internal Audit and Studies Area, which also provides support to the departments that require assistance in this area. u 27 Annual Report 2014 Corporate Social with our stakeholder groups to help us maintain a close relationship with each one.

The efficiency of dissipation of the heat generated within the infrastructure is much better when the temperature of the outside air entering the tunnel is lower. Similarly, the energy cost is not the same throughout the whole day, making it cheaper ventilate the premises during the subsidised period. With this in mind, the operation of the ventilation system is based on establishing a strategy to adjust its operation, taking advantage of periods when the temperature differential between the inside and outside (temperature swing) is maximum, attempting to move its operation to periods when energy cost is lower. In fact, these two factors are usually compatible, because at night the energy cost is at a minimum and the temperature swing at a maximum. The employment of this strategy saved more than 24.2 million kW during 2014. Depot operations  I­nstallation of the TebaTREN system in the Fuencarral depot.

In-person Customer Service Centres assisted a total of 320,411 visitors. New centres were opened during the year, in addition to the ones at Vodafone Sol and Nuevos Ministerios, to perform traditional customer service functions and assist customers with public transit passes. Integrated centres of this kind were inaugurated in April at the Coslada Central, Móstoles Central, Fuenlabrada Central and Leganés Central stations. 111 Annual Report 2014 The most common cause of the complaints received in 2014 had to do with “Operation of ticketing equipment” with a total of 1,700 complaints (17% less than in 2013), due to problems encountered by users when trying to purchase tickets. Throughout the year, the complaints are most commonly received on the first and last days of the month, which is when most people are trying to use the equipment. The second reason was “Train frequency”, with 1,473 complaints related to time intervals between trains. The increase in these complaints during the summer was due to the fact that certain sections of different lines were closed for repairs. The number of claims received for this reason was 12% lower in 2014 than in 2013. “Receipt for purchase”, with 1,452 complaints, was the third most common cause, which was 38% lower than it had been in 2013. These complaints have to do with the fact that the vending machines fail to issue a receipt when the customer charges his or her public transit pass. There were fewer complaints for all lines in 2014 except Line 12, which saw an 11% increase, due primarily to construction work which resulted in scheduled suspension of service in the summer months. u 112 Management Report and C.S.R Environmental  The system for detailed evaluation of legal requirements and the involvement of the different Management services/areas of the Company in ensuring compliance with the requirements identified.  Internal environmental consulting for outside work/ As a company committed to the Environment, Metro projects, although this activity is not certified at the de Madrid has an Environmental Management System moment. based on the UNE-EN ISO 14001 Standard which raises awareness and seeks effective solutions to prevent, control In addition to the steps taken as part of the 2012-2015 and minimise the environmental impacts caused by our Optimisation Plan to minimise energy usage, the environoperations as a way of contributing to environmental mental commitment of Metro de Madrid can also be seen protection. in the implementation of different measures designed to reduce the Company’s impact on the environment.

About the company Metro de Madrid, S.A. was incorporated on 24 January 1917 as a private limited company. With passage of Legislative Royal Decree No. 13/1978 of 7 June, Act No. 32/1979 of 8 November declared the utility and requirement of urgent occupancy for the purposes of forced expropriation in acquisition of the Company’s shares, the beneficiaries of the expropriation being the Madrid Provincial and Municipal Authorities with holdings in each case of twenty-five and seventy-five percent. In 1986, the Compañia Metropolitano de Madrid, S.A. shares were handed over to the Madrid Regional Community and Madrid City Corporation. Royal Decree No. 869/1986 of 11 April among others provides in Article 2-1 for transfer of State assets assigned to the operation of the service to the Regional Community of Madrid. Then, on 24 and 30 December 1986, the Community and the City Corporation transferred the share rights in the former Compañía Metropolitano de Madrid, S.A. to the Madrid Regional Regular Public Transport Consortium. Under the general collaboration protocol signed on 12 December 2011 between Madrid Regional Community, Madrid City Corporation and the Madrid Regional Public Transport Consortium on Metro de Madrid, S.A.’s collective passenger rail transport service, the Madrid Regional Government and City Corporation recovered all the rights to the shares transferred to the Regional Transport Consortium. The City Corporation then transferred title to all assets and rights inherent to the provision of the transport service in the network operated by Metro de Madrid, S.A. and held by the Corporation to the Regional Government and, in particular, 75% of the shares representing the capital of Metro de Madrid, S.A. and held by the City Corporation. This share transfer was effective as of 28 December 2011, pursuant to the Fiscal Measures Act (Act No. 6/2011). According to Number 2 of its Articles, the purpose of the Company is:  a) Management and operation of the Madrid public metropolitan rail service.  b) Design, construction, management and operation of means of transport for persons or luggage.  c) Design, construction, management and operation of means of transport, with or without cable, of signals or communications, directly or in collaboration with others, after obtaining the appropriate licenses when necessary.  d) To manage and generate returns on its assets by any means, directly or in collaboration with others, and any types of civil engineering works and constructions, save activities for which special requisites are demanded by law and which are not met by this Company. The activities making up the corporate purpose may be carried on by the Company indirectly by holding shares or stakes in Companies with the same or a similar purpose. The Company’s main activity is the integral operation of public rail transport in the Region of Madrid, regulated in a Framework Agreement concluded with the Madrid Regional Transport Consortium on 16 January 2009. 170 Cuentas anuales The Framework Agreement expired on 31 December 2012 and on 27 December 2013, CRTM and Metro de Madrid, S.A. signed an agreement whereunder a Technical Committee would be created to negotiate a new Framework Agreement and the terms of the former framework agreement would continue to apply, except inasmuch as Mintra was concerned, until the new agreement took effect. The agreement is valid from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014. On 30 December 2014, a new agreement was signed which will remain in effect until 31 December 2015, maintain the terms of the previous agreement relative to the creation of a Technical Committee for the purpose of representatives from both side negotiating the contents of a new agreement to regulate the relations between the two companies. Until such time as the new agreement takes effect, it is agreed that the framework agreement signed on 16 January 2009 will continue to apply. In line with the financial system in place since 1 January 2003, regulated in Act No. 6/2002 of 27 June partially amending Act No. 5/1985 creating the Madrid Regional Public Transport Consortium (CRTM), the Framework Agreement signed by Metro de Madrid and the CRTM provides for a financial regime for public transport services governed by the principle of sufficient charge to cover all true costs in normal conditions of productivity and organisation, based on a mean fare per trip. As a result, on 1 January 2003, operating subsidies ended and were replaced by compensation directly coupled to the service provided. Metro de Madrid S.A. holds stakes in associate companies and, as a result, dominates a Corporate Group in the terms provided for in the current legislation. According to generally accepted accounting principles and norms it is a requirement to submit consolidated Annual Accounts that present a true reflection of the financial situation and the results of operations, of changes in the Group’s Net Worth and Cashflow. However, the Company does not submit consolidated Annual Accounts because it participates solely in dependent companies which, as a whole, are not of significant interest in such true reflection (see note 8.2). The Company created a branch in the 2010 financial year with the name of “Metro de Madrid S.A., Sucursal en Ecuador” to deal with consultancy projects under way in Ecuador. Metro de Madrid, S.A. is domiciled in Madrid at calle Cavanilles No. 58. 171 Anual Report 2014 2. Bases for the presentation of the annual accounts a) True Image The attached Annual Accounts were taken from the Company’s accounting records and are presented in accordance with Royal Decree No. 1514/2007 approving the General Accounting Plan and its amendments, and Order EHA/733/2010 on accounting aspects of public corporations operating in certain circumstances, to show a true reflection of the assets and financial situation to 31 December 2014, the results and the cashflows during that financial term. These Annual Accounts, drawn up the Company’s Administrators, will be submitted for clearance by the Sole Shareholder, and are expected to be approved unmodified. b) Non-compulsory accounting principles applied. No non-compulsory accounting principles were applied. Additionally, in formulating these Annual Accounts, the Administrators considered all the mandatory accounting principles and rules whose effect on said Annual Accounts is deemed to be significant. c) Critical aspects of valuation and estimate of uncertainty Preparation of the Annual Accounts demands application of relevant accounting estimates and the making of judgements, evaluations and hypotheses in the application of the Company’s accounting policies. The following were the aspects which involved a greater degree of judgement or complexity or in which the hypotheses and estimates in the elaboration of the Annual Accounts were significant: • The hypotheses used for the actuarial calculation of liabilities from obligations for personnel benefits (see Note 16). • Classification of leases as operational or financial (see Note 7). • Deterioration of value of tangible and intangible fixed assets (see note 4.d). • Deteriorations in the value of investments in associate companies (see note 4.f). • Calculation of provisions (see Note 11). Although these estimates are based on the best data available at the close of the 2014 financial period, it is possible that future events may make it necessary to amend them (up or down) in coming years, which would in any case be done prospectively. d) Comparison of data For comparative purposes, with each item on the balance Sheet, and Profit and Loss Account, the Statement of Changes in the Equity, the Cashflow Statement and the Annual Report, in addition to the 2014 figures those for the previous financial year are also included and which formed part of the 2013 Annual Accounts approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders on 18 June 2014. e) Grouping of data Certain items on the Balance Sheet, the Profit and Loss Account, the Statement of Changes in the Net Worth and the Cashflow Statement are grouped to facilitate their understanding although, to the extent that it is significant, the information is broken down in the corresponding notes in the Annual Report. f) Correction of errors No significant error was detected in the elaboration of the attached Annual Accounts relative to previous years which made it necessary to correct the 2013 figures in the 2014 Annual Accounts. 172 Cuentas anuales g) Operational currency and currency of presentation The Annual Accounts are presented in euros, the Company’s functional and presentation currency. h) Principle of a going concern The Company posted losses of 29,756,174 euros (losses of 218,817,242 euros at 31 December 2013), with negative working capital of 245,546,818 euros at 31 December 2014 (-247,020,116 euros at 31 December 2013). Within that Operating Fund, included in the Current Liabilities under “Various creditors”, there is a balance pending payment to the Directorate-General of Infrastructures in the Madrid Regional Government, (sole shareholder of Metro de Madrid), and amounting to 143,577,715.21 euros. Nevertheless, the Administrators have drawn up these accounts according to the principle of a going concern, based on the following:  As the demand for public transport recovers in the Autonomous Community of Madrid and with the help of the Optimisation Plan, the Company will be able to correct the imbalance that existed at 31 December 2014.  Regarding the negotiations between the company and the Madrid Regional Transport Consortium, in 2013 and 2014 the parties signed an agreement whereunder a Technical Committee would be formed to negotiate a new framework agreement and the parties agreed to apply the former framework agreement until the new one takes effect or until 31 December 2015 (See Note 1).  The Madrid Regional Transport Consortium has stated in relation to the Company’s current liability balances at 31 December 2014, it will do what is necessary to guarantee the Company’s financial equilibrium so as to enable it to meet its payment commitments  The Company also has credit contracts not drawn down amounting to 29 million euros (see note 8.1.2). In addition, the Operating Budget of the Autonomous Community of Madrid for the 2015 fiscal year reflects a loan in the amount of 1,060,739,488 euros to Metro de Madrid, S.A., as detailed below: Expense Budget Euros Item 1: Staff costs 351,558,045 Item 2: Cost of goods and services 487,485,200 Item 3: Financial expenses 25,994,718 Item 6: Investments 100,832,056 Item 8: Financial assets 19,167,944 Item 9: Financial liabilities 75,701,525 1,060,739,488 Income budget Euros Item 5: Equity income 840,169,084 Item 6: Divestitures 18,014,078 Item 8: Financial assets 6,800,000 Item 9: Financial liabilities 195,756,326 1,060,739,488 173 Anual Report 2014 3. Distribution of results The proposal for the application of the financial year losses as formulated by the Company’s Administrators, to be submitted to the Sole Shareholder for approval, is to transfer it to the “Negative Results, Previous Financial Years” Equity Account.” DISTRIBUTION OF RESULTS Amount (Euros) Negative results from previous financial years -29,756,174,24 TOTAL -29,756,174,24 The application of 2013 losses is set out in the Statement of Change in Net Equity. 4. Measurement and recognition standards a) Capitalisation of financial charges The Company includes the financial charges related to specific external financing, directly attributable to acquisition, construction or production in the cost of the tangible and intangible fixed assets requiring more than one year to come into conditions for use, operation or sale. To the extent that financing was secured specifically, the sum of the interest to be capitalised depends on the financial charges accruing on it. Interest begins to capitalise when the charges associated with the assets have been incurred, interest is accrued and the necessary work is under way to prepare the assets or parts thereof for use, operation or sale, ending when all or virtually all the necessary work is finished, irrespective of whether the administrative permits required have been obtained, and without taking interruptions into account. Interest is capitalised under “Capitalisation of financial interest” on the Profit and Loss Account. Financial charges are no longer capitalised should there be an interruption to the work needed to prepare the assets for use. b) Intangible fixed assets The assets and rights in this section are valued at their acquisition price or cost of production and are presented on the Balance Sheet at cost less the amount of amortisation and corrections of value arising from accumulated deterioration. The annual provision for amortisation is calculated linearly, depending on the estimated useful life of the asset, as follows:  Patents and trademarks 10 years  Computer applications 3 years 174 Cuentas anuales c) Property, plant and equipment The assets in this section are valued at their acquisition price or cost of production and are presented on the Balance Sheet at cost less the amount of amortisation and corrections of value arising from accumulated deterioration. Costs of extension or improvement which increase an asset’s duration are capitalised at its greater value. Repairs and maintenance charges which do not represent an extension to the useful life of an asset are assigned to the Profit and Loss Account in the year when they are incurred. Capitalisation of the production cost, comprising consumption of store materials, direct manpower charges and indirect costs necessary for the investment are realised under heading A) 3. of the Profit and Loss Account “Work done by the company for its assets”. The Company’s Balance Sheet does not include valuation of the cost of infrastructure construction charged to the budgets of the various Public Administrations since 1956, of assets assigned to Metro de Madrid for operation, and the infrastructure assigned gratuitously by the Directorate-General of Infrastructures under the Agreement concluded on 2 July 2012 whose special characteristics make it difficult to estimate their book value. This aspect has no significant effect on the Annual Accounts taken as a whole. The annual provision for amortisation is calculated linearly, distributing the amortizable sum systematically throughout the estimated useful life, estimated as follows for the assets:  Infrastructure and superstructure 67 years  Track 10 years  Buildings and industrial constructions 33 years  Administrative buildings 50 years  Buildings external to operations 50 years  Plant and machinery 17-10 years  Other installations, tooling and fittings 10-3 years  Vehicles 25-7 years  Other fixed assets 17-4 years Metro de Madrid, S.A. periodically revises the useful life and amortisation procedure for the tangible fixed assets. Modifications to the initial criteria are recognised as a change of estimate. d) Impairment of non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation Pursuant to Order EHA/733/2010 of 25 March, the Society has considered that the goods making up the tangible and intangible fixed assets must be classified as assets which do not generate cashflow as they are held with the aim of providing a service of benefit to the group, with an objective other than that of creating a commercial return. With that classification, the Company only verifies a deterioration of value where there are indicators of deterioration of value inherent to this type of asset. In any case, such events or circumstances must be significant and above all have long-term effects. Should the indicators suggest that a value is impaired, the recoverable value is the value in use and the reasonable value less the costs of sale, whichever is greater. In 2014 and 2013, in application of Order EHA/733/2010, the value in use is the asset’s current value maintaining its service potential, and is calculated by reference to the depreciated replacement cost. Until 2009, the value in use was calculated according to the General Accounting Plan in accordance with the current value of future cashflows. 175 Anual Report 2014 The deterioration in the value of assets not generating cashflow is calculated on individual assets, unless the identification of the service potential is not clear, in which case the recoverable figure is calculated according to the operating unit or service to which it belongs. The lower numbers of passengers which began in 2008 and continued in 2014 and 2013 was considered an indicator of a possible impairment of asset value. However, after considering the replacement value of the tangible and intangible fixed assets, it was not deemed necessary to enter any figure for impairment of asset value on 31 December 2014 or 31 December 2013. e) Leases Leases which initially substantially transfer to the Company the risks and benefits inherent to ownership of the assets are classified as financial leases, otherwise as operational leases. Modification of the terms of the lease agreements other than renewal and which imply a different classification are, if considered at the commencement of the contract, treated as a new contract during the residual term. Changes of estimate or modifications to the circumstances do not however imply a new classification. e.1. Financial leases In financial leasing transactions in which the Company acts as lessee, the cost of the leased assets is presented on the Balance Sheet according to the nature of the asset which is the subject of the contract and, simultaneously, as a liability for the same sum. That figure is the reasonable value of the asset leased, or the true value of the minimum amounts agreed on at the beginning of the lease, including the option to buy if there are no reasonable doubts that it will be used, whichever is lower. Its calculation does not include contingent quotas, the cost of the services and any taxes which lessor may pass on. The total financial charge for the contract is placed in the Profit and Loss Account for the year in which it accrues, applying the effective interest rate method. Contingent quotas are acknowledged as charges in the financial period in which they are incurred. Assets registered in this type of transaction are amortised using criteria similar to those applied to the tangible assets as a whole, depending on their nature. e.2. Sales with subsequent lease Sales of assets linked to subsequent lease transactions which meet the conditions inherent to a financial lease are treated as financing operations the nature of the asset is not altered, and no result is recognised. e.3. Operating leases Payments arising from operating lease contracts are charged linearly to the Profit and Loss Account during the term of the lease. f) Financial instruments Financial instruments are classified at the time of initial acknowledgement as a financial asset, a financial liability or as equity instrument depending on the economic substance of the contractual agreement and the definitions of financial asset, financial liability or equity instrument. f.1. Recognition The Company recognises a financial instrument when it becomes a party bound by the contract or legal business in the terms thereof. 176 Cuentas anuales Debt instruments are recognised as of the date of the legal entitlement to receive or the legal obligation to pay, effective. Financial liabilities are recognised on the date when contracted. Operations to buy or sell financial assets pursuant to conventional contracts, understood as those where the parties’ mutual obligations must be fulfilled within a period of time established by regulation or market conventions and which may not be settled by means of differences, are acknowledged according to the type of asset on the contracting or settlement date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, contracts which may be settled according to differences or which are not performed within the regulatory time-span are recognised as a derivative financial instrument during the period between the contracting date and settlement. Stock market operations are registered on the date of settlement, while financial assets traded on secondary Spanish securities markets are, if equity instruments, acknowledged on the contracting date, and if securities representing debt, on the settlement date. f.2. Financial assets f.2.1 Classification The Company’s financial assets are classified as follows: a) Loans and receivables: financial assets originating in the sale of assets or the provision of services in the company’s business operations, or those not of commercial origin, which are not proprietary instruments or derivatives, receipts from which are a fixed or calculable sum and they are not traded on an active market. b) Investments in associate company equity: Associate companies are considered to be those over which the Company directly or indirectly through dependents exercises a significant influence. Such significant influence is the power to intervene in a company’s financial policy and operational decisions without implying control or joint control over it. An assessment of the existence of significant influence takes account of potential voting rights or rights which are convertible on the closing date of each financial period, together with potential voting rights held by the Company or another enterprise. c) Cash and other equivalent liquid assets: this includes cash in hand and bank deposits on call in credit entities, together with other highly liquid short-term investments if easily convertible into determined cash figures and risk of change of value is insignificant. This includes investments maturing in less than three months following the date of acquisition. d) Hedges: includes derivative financial instruments used to hedge cash flows. The Company verified that the hedging was effective at the 2014 year end. f.2.2 Valuation Initial valuation Loans and receivables as well as investments in associate company equity are initially entered at the reasonable value of the consideration delivered, plus the directly attributable costs of the transaction. Subsequent valuation Loans and receivables are valued at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. However, financial assets are valued at their par value if no interest rate was established, the sum matures or is expected to be received short-term and the effect of updating is not significant. 177 Anual Report 2014 Investments in associate companies are valued at cost, less any accumulated amount of corrections in value due to deterioration. Such corrections are calculated as the difference between the book value and the recoverable sum, understood as its reasonable value less sale costs or its value in use, whichever is greater. The value in use is calculated according to the company’s stake in the current value of the estimated cashflows from ordinary activities and final disposal, or the estimated flows anticipated from payment of dividends and final disposal of the investment. Corrections of value due to deterioration in the value of the investment are limited to its value, save when the Company may have taken on legal or implicit contractual commitments or obligations or made payments on companies’ behalf. In this case, a provision is acknowledged in accordance with the criteria set out in section k) of this note. At least at the close of the financial period, the Company runs a test on the deterioration for financial assets not entered at a reasonable value. Any deterioration is placed on the Profit and Loss Account as the difference between the book value and the financial asset’s recoverable value. In particular, and relative to corrections in value related to commercial debtors and other receivables, the Company continues the criterion of entering any corrections of value when there is a reduction or delay in estimated future flows as a result of a debtor’s insolvency. The criterion applied by Metro de Madrid, S.A. in calculating any such corrections of value is based on their individual review. The Company discharges a financial asset or part thereof when the contractual rights to its cashflows expire or are assigned, if the risks and benefits inherent to its possession are transferred substantially. Cash flow hedges are initially measured at fair value. The Company recognizes the gains and losses on the fair value of hedging instruments saw income and/or expenses in equity. 178 Cuentas anuales Hedging instruments are derecognised once the instrument expires, is sold, finalised or exercised or when it ceases to meet the requirements to be recognised as such. At that time, any accumulated profit or loss on the hedging instrument that was recognised in equity is maintained until the transaction takes place. When the operation that is being hedged is not expected to take place, the cumulative net gains or losses recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement. At 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Company’s financial hedging instruments met the requirements to be considered cash flow hedges. f.3. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are the Company’s debits and payables arising from the purchase of goods and services in its business operations, or those not of commercial origin which cannot be treated as derivative financial instruments. Debits and payables are initially assessed at the reasonable value of the consideration received, adjusted by the directly attributable costs of the transaction. These liabilities are subsequently valued according to their amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. The Company discharges a financial liability when the obligation is extinguished or the responsibility inherent to the liability is legally released, whether by the courts or by the creditor. g) Inventories Materials in storage for consumption and replacement are valued at the mean weighted price which may under no circumstances exceed market prices. The Company makes provisions for deterioration in the value of stocks when their market value is below the cost of acquisition or production and the reduction is reversible. If irreversible, it is discharged at the cost of acquisition/production of those stocks, taking their market value as their sale value. For these purposes, market value is considered the realisation value. There are no limitations on the availability of stocks for guarantees, pledges, bonds and for other similar reasons. 179 Anual Report 2014 h) Foreign currency transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions were converted to euros at the cash exchange rate for the sum in foreign currency on the dates when they took place. Money assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency were converted to euros at the rate in place at the close of the financial year, while those of a non-monetary nature valued at their historic cost were converted by applying the exchange rate on the date when the transactions took place. Positive and negative differences which come to light in the settlement of foreign currency transactions and the euro conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are acknowledged in the results. i) Corporate tax Expenditure or income from profit tax includes the part relative to current tax expenditure or income and that related to deferred tax expenditure or income. Deferred tax expenditure or income relates to the recognition and cancellation of deferred-tax assets and liabilities, including temporary differences identified as sums likely to be payable or recoverable as a consequence of differences between the book sums for the assets and liabilities and their fiscal value, along with credits for tax deductions not applied fiscally. Those figures are entered by applying the rate of assessment at which it is expected to recover or settle them to the associated temporary difference or credit. In general, a deferred tax liability is recognised for all the temporary taxable differences unless arising from the following: a) Initial acknowledgement of goodwill. However, goodwill-related deferred tax liabilities are entered provided that they did not arise from their initial acknowledgement. b) Initial acknowledgement of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a combination of businesses and also did not affect the book result or the taxable base for the levy. For their part, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is deemed likely that the Company will post future fiscal gains with which to realise them. Deferred tax assets and liabilities originating in operations with direct charge or payments in the capital accounts are also recorded with a counterpart in the net worth. Deferred-tax assets entered are reconsidered at each accounting close and corrected to the extent that there are doubts about their future recovery. Also at each close, deferred-tax assets not entered on the balance sheet are reconsidered and acknowledged to the extent that their recovery is likely with future fiscal benefits. j) Income and expenses Income and expenses are acknowledged according to the criterion of accrual, that is when the real movement of goods and services they represent takes place, irrespective of the time of the resulting monetary or financial current. As an exception, the costs of Ferromóvil lease operations are linearised (See Note 7.2 a.3). 180 Cuentas anuales k) Provisions and contingencies Provisions are acknowledged when the Company has a current liability, whether legal, contractual, implicit or tacit, as a result of past event, and resources are likely to emerge which include future economic benefits with which to settle the liability. They are assessed at the present value of the best possible estimate for cancelling or transferring that liability. The financial effect of the provisions is acknowledged as a financial charge on the Profit and Loss Account. Provisions revert to results if no resources are likely to emerge to cancel the liability. l) Indemnifications for dismissal Compensation owed for voluntary layoffs is recognised as soon as there is an official plan in place and a valid expectation has been created among the affected personnel that their jobs are going to be terminated, either because the Company has already started to implement the plan or because the main features of the plan have been announced. In 2014, the Company paid the compensation promised to the employees laid off at the end of 2013. The Company does not foresee the need for any individual or collective layoffs in 2015 other than potential disciplinary layoffs and therefore does not consider it necessary to set up any additional provisions for this item. In the hypothetical event of a dismissal, the compensation is treated as a current charge in the financial year in which it is incurred. m) Grants, donations and bequests received Subsidies, donations and legacies associated with the acquisition of Company fixed assets are entered as income acknowledged in the net worth when officially granted, the conditions have been met for them to be granted and there is no reasonable doubt that they will be received. Grants received for activities linked to operations are entered with payment to the Profit and Loss Account of each financial year. Non-reimbursable capital grants, donations and legacies are assessed at the reasonable value of the sum or property assigned, depending on whether or not of a monetary character, and are assigned to the results in proportion to the endowment or amortisation made in the period for the items subsidised or, where applicable, when disposed of or their value is corrected for impairment. n) Related party transaction. These transactions are acknowledged at the reasonable value of the consideration given or received. o) Pension commitments The Company has long-term commitments with personnel which have always been treated as defined-benefit commitments. The Company acknowledges a provision in the balance for the difference between the current value of payment undertakings and the reasonable value of the assets assigned to the commitments with which the liabilities will be settled (if such difference is significant) less any costs for past services not yet acknowledged. 181 Anual Report 2014 Should that difference generate an asset, its evaluation may not exceed the present value of benefits which may revert to the company in the form of direct reimbursements or reduced future contributions, plus any part pending assignment to the results of costs for past services not yet acknowledged. Any adjustment the Company must make for this limit in the evaluation of the asset is assigned directly to the net worth and acknowledged as reserves. The current value of the liability is determined using actuarial calculation procedures and financial and actuarial hypotheses which are unbiased and mutually compatible. Variation in the calculation of the current value of the payment commitments or, as applicable, the assets affected on the date of closure as a consequence of actuarial losses and gains are recognised in the financial year in which they arise, directly in the net worth, as reserves. For these purposes, actuarial losses and gains are solely variations arising from changes in the actuarial hypotheses and from adjustments based on experience. Costs of past services are recognised immediately in the Profit and Loss Account except in the case of revocable rights, in which case they are assigned to that account linearly in the period remaining until the rights are placed there immediately, except in the case of a reduction in the current value of benefits which may revert to the Company as direct reimbursements or lower future contributions, in which case the excess beyond that reduction goes immediately into the Profit and Loss Account. 182 Cuentas anuales 5. Intangible fixed assets The composition and changes in the cost of items recognised under this heading on the 2014 and 2013 balance sheets are as follows: 20,546 euros were capitalised in 2014 arising from financial charges on long-term loans and treated as specific financing for projects of more than a year’s duration. In 2013, 41,148 euros in financial charges were capitalised. The variation in accumulated amortisation between 2014 and 2013 was as follows: The fully amortised assets of this kind still in use at the end of FY 2014 and 2013 totalled EUR 71,935,771 and EUR 66,718,827, respectively. 2014 OPENING INTEREST CLOSING ASSETS ADDITIONS TRANSFERS BALANCE CAPITALISED BALANCE Patents and trademarks 102,330.77 102,330.77 Computer applications 73,584,276.89 4,516,498.50 4,940,984.68 83,041,760.07 Advances, intangible 5,295,959.64 176,610.28 20,545.61 -4,286,065.75 1,207,049.78 fixed assets TOTAL 78,982,567.30 4,693,108.78 20,545.61 654,918.93 84,351,140.62 2013 OPENING INTEREST CLOSING ASSETS ADDITIONS TRANSFERS BALANCE CAPITALISED BALANCE Patents and trademarks 102,330.77 102,330.77 Computer applications 72,645,335.30 573,258.36 365,683.23 73,584,276.89 Advances, intangible 5,317,277.87 14,998.50 41,148.25 -77,464.98 5,295,959.64 fixed assets TOTAL 78,064,943.94 588,256.86 41,148.25 288,218.25 78,982,567.30 2014 ASSET USEFUL LIFE OPENING PROVISION CLOSING FULLY Patents and 10.00 42,330.77 42,330.77 42,330.77 Computer applications 3.00 71,130,273.78 3,669,040.39 74,799,314.17 71,893,440.16 TOTAL 71,172,604.55 3,669,040.39 74,841,644.94 71,935,770.93 2013 ASSET USEFUL LIFE OPENING PROVISION CLOSING FULLY Patents and 10.00 42,330.77 42,330.77 42,330.77 Computer applications 3.00 67,422,548.01 3,707,725.77 71,130,273.78 66,676,495.95 TOTAL 67,464,878.78 3,707,725.77 71,172,604.55 66,718,826.72 183 Anual Report 2014 6.

Long-term employee benefits The Company’s commitments are set out in the 2013-2015 Company Collective Bargaining Agreement into which it was agreed to incorporate the arbitration awards handed down on 18 December 1999 and 2 February 2000 as an integral part. The following are the Company’s commitments:  Lifelong and immediate survival income for personnel on pensions or benefiting from the defunct FAS (Social Welfare Fund) receiving retirement income prior to 30 June 1998, widowed or orphaned or permanently disabled pursuant to the 18 December 1999 Arbitration Award and the 2 February 2000 explanatory award.  Death of beneficiaries (the retired and the absolutely, permanently disabled) who joined the company prior to 18 March 1998.  Early retirement benefits between 60 and 63 for those who joined the company prior to 18 March 1998 and have listings accredited to the employment Welfare Society prior to 1 January 1967. The figure for the benefit is fixed according to the employees’ age on 31 December 1999. All commitments are underwritten and updated to 31 December 2012 in insurance policies adapted to Additional Provision One of Legislative Royal Decree No. 1/2002 of 29 November passing the Reform Pension Plan and Funds Act, and Royal Decree No. 1588/1999 of 15 October passing the Regulation on the implementation of company pension commitments with employees and beneficiaries. The current value of pension commitments outsourced in 2001 for beneficiary personnel was calculated on the basis of the following parameters: 228 Anual Report and CSR 2014  Technical interest rate: 5.97% for the first 40 annuities and 3.05% for the rest.  Mortality table: PERM/F-2000P. The current value of beneficiary death commitments was outsourced on 31 December 2010, calculated on the basis of the following parameters:  Technical interest rate: 5.97% for the first 40 annuities and 3.05% for the rest.  Mortality table: PERM/F-2000P. In the year 2014, for future services arising from policy 5-83190000270 (early retirement prospects), no sums were paid in accordance with Article 2.3 of Law 22/2013, of 23 December on the Government’s General Budget Act for the year 2014 and article 16 of Law 5/2013 of 23 on the Madrid Regional Government’s 2014 General Budgets Act, prohibiting contributions to pension or employment schemes or collective insurance contracts which include cover for the contingency of retirement in favour of public employees. These policies involved payment of a single premium guaranteeing rights consolidated until the outsourcing date and, as applicable, generate an annual premium (or refund) to cover rights accruing each year. The Company considers that all commitments were fully and correctly insured on the date of the accounting statements, so that no liability is acknowledged on the Balance Sheet for commitments funded in insurance policies. In addition to the commitments mentioned, Metro de Madrid S.A.’s active and beneficiary personnel receive free aid for season tickets provided that they have applied for it to the Company. This commitment is formally regulated in the company’s internal rules. However, subsidised transit passes for the beneficiaries of retired employees are on hold. The company asked an independent actuary to prepare an actuarial audit report to 31 December 2011 to determine the amount of the provision for this obligation. The amount of the provision was 8,247,565 euros (see note 11.1.1). The following were the main hypotheses used in the study:  Mortality tables: PERM 2000 NP  Technical interest rate: 4.5%  Inflation: 0%  No invalidity or rotation rates were applied  Calculation of the benefits accrued from the commitments evaluated used the Projected Unit Credit method which assigns costs as services are provided, i.e. distributing the total projected obligation uniformly during the years of the employee’s service in the company until receiving the benefit. There were no significant changes in 2014 compared to 2013. 229 Anual Report 2014 17.

Post-balance sheet events No significant development had occurred by the date on which these Annual Accounts were drawn up which might affect them and knowledge of which may be useful in their interpretation. In 2015, prior to the date of this report, the Company took a 20-year loan from the European Investment Bank for 48 million euros with a fixed interest rate of approximately 1.4% and subsequent to the date of this report it took out a 14-year loan with a Spanish bank for 60 million euros with a fixed interest rate of approximately 1,7%. On 23 March 2015, the Superior Court of Justice of Madrid issued ruling number 134 in relation to the appeal filed by the investee company, Transportes Ferroviarios de Madrid, S.A., in which Metro de Madrid, S.A. holds a stake of 42.50% (see note 8.2.), against the rejection by the Department of Transport and Infrastructure of the Community of Madrid and the Madrid Regional Transport Consortium of the request made by the company for economic restoration and compensation for the execution of an administrative contract, rejecting the appeal. The Directors do not believe that this ruling will have a significant effect on these annual accounts taken as a whole. 234 Anual Report and CSR 2014 20.

Pursuant to Act No. 53/1984 of 26 December, the personnel coming within its scope of application may receive no allowances for membership of more than two Boards of Directors. Senior Community of Madrid officers are prevented under their specific Incompatibilities Act, Act No. 14/1995 of 21 April, from receiving any allowances which represent an increase to the remuneration for the posts to which they are appointed. 235 Anual Report 2014 The Company’s senior management on 31 December accrued wages and salaries, allowances and other remuneration in 201 for 973,207.14 euros, and 1,212,790.10 in 2013.

Environmental information In line with environmental policy in place, activities and projects are underway with the management in this field. Charges and investments during this 2014 financial period were insignificant and so are not broken down in the Annual Accounts. Those actions are however entered, in turn on the Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet. There is no provision for environmental contingencies, as it is considered that there is no significant risk. 236 Anual Report and CSR 2014 237 12 Audit Report Independent Auditor’s Report on the Annual Accounts To the Sole Shareholder of Metro de Madrid, S.A. (Sole Proprietorship): Report on the annual accounts We have audited the annual accounts of Metro de Madrid, S.A.U. (the Company) comprising the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014, the income statement, the statement of change in equity, the cash flow statement and the notes to the annual accounts for the fiscal year ending on said date. The Directors’ responsibility in relation to the annual accounts It is the responsibility of the directors to draw up the annual accounts so as to show a true image of the consolidated financial situation and results of Metro de Madrid, S.A. in accordance with the financial reporting standards applicable to the Company in Spain which are identified in note 2 of the enclosed report, and the internal controls that are deemed necessary to ensure that the annual accounts are free of material inaccuracies due to fraud or error. The Auditor’s responsibility It is our responsibility to state an opinion on the enclosed annual accounts based on our audit, which has been carried out in accordance with the laws governing the auditing profession in Spain. Those laws require that we comply with certain ethical standards and that we plan and execute our audit so as to be reasonably certain that the consolidated annual accounts are free of material inaccuracies. An audit requires the application of procedures to obtain evidence of the amounts and the information disclosed in the annual accounts. The procedures are selected at the auditors’ discretion, including the evaluation of the risk of material inaccuracies in the consolidated annual accounts as a result of fraud or error. When assessing such risks, the auditors consider the relevant internal controls applied to the formulation of the annual accounts by the parent company in order to design the right audit procedures in each case but not to express an opinion on the efficacy of the company’s internal controls. An audit also includes an evaluation of the appropriateness of the accounting policies applied and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates used by management as well as an evaluation of the presentation of the annual accounts as a whole. We believe that the evidence obtained during our audit provides a sufficient and adequate basis for our auditor’s opinion. Basis for reserved opinion As indicated in note 4 b) of the enclosed notes to the annual accounts, the Company has not included in its 2014 annual accounts the property assigned to it for operating purposes, without the payment of any consideration, corresponding to the infrastructure elements built and charged to the budgets of different public administrations since 1956. Nor has it included the assignment in 2012 of certain rail infrastructure to the Company for its use by the Department of Transport of the Community of Madrid, free of charge for a period of 15 years. Metro de Madrid, S.A.U. has not provided the information needed to evaluate these assets and usage rights, as a result of which we are unable to determine the effects which these items could have on the enclosed 2014 annual accounts. Our auditor’s report on the 2013 annual accounts contains a similar reservation. Reserved opinion In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the circumstance described in the preceding paragraph, “Basis for reserved opinion”, the enclosed annual accounts for 2014 financial year reflect, in all significant respects, a true and fair view of equity and financial position of Metro de Madrid, S.A.U. at 31 December 2014 and of the results of their operations, in addition to resources obtained and applied during the fiscal year closed on the aforementioned date, according to the regulatory framework for financial reporting applicable to the Company and in particular, to the accounting standards and principles contained therein. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements The accompanying 2014 directors’ report contains the explanations that the directors deem to be necessary on the situation of the Company, the evolution of its businesses and on other issues, but it is not an integral part of the annual accounts. We have verified that the accounting information contained in said directors’ report tallies with the annual accounts for 2014. Our work as auditors is limited to verifying the directors’ report within the scope mentioned in this paragraph and it does not entail a review of any information other than that obtained from the Company’s accounting records.
