During that time, IDEC launched control units conforming to the IEC standards, Creating an optimal environment for people and machines Entering into the 1990s, the manufacturing environment of HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces), in which people and machines work together, became mainstream. In responding to the need for machines and systems providing higher productivity and safety, IDEC launched Japan’s first safety switches and enabling switches. In 2000, New IDEC logo and tagline which turned out to be another big hit, fully-automated robot control cellular of manufacturing sites. and the products have been successful production systems were installed in our even to this day.
