Together with all Ukrainians, our company went through dramatic events and hardships which never happened before in the newest history of Ukraine. It was not easy, but we have stood the test. We succeeded as market leaders and as citizens of our country. We did not just sit and wait or stop our operations, but we continued to grow and move forward. Why did we succeed? First of all, because we are a team united by common values. During the past year, our corporate values were the strongest pillar that allowed us to withstand the challenge. Our list of achievements for 2014 is not really short: • We continued with our business, opening new filling stations, restaurants and cafés; • We extended the network of natural gas modules; • We invested into the future of Ukraine by installing electric car chargers at our filling stations; • We maintained a high level of credit in the eyes of our international investors, and even during an economic crisis we had secured additional loan resources on reasonable terms. In 2014 we continued to create new jobs all across the country. At the same time we did not let our colleagues in the East down. We helped them find new jobs in other regions, and many others received financial support even when our filling stations were closed in their cities. Besides, we have been supporting medical institutions in purchase of medicines and medical equipment for treatment of people who suffered in the events in the East. People are always in the company’s focus. These are our clients on one hand, and our colleagues on the other. They are the two wings of our success. Their credit of trust is worth more than money. And as our clients as well as employees are part of the society, our social concerns remain a top priority for our company even in the toughest times. That is why last year we put considerable effort into strengthening safety at our facilities and, together with EBRD, implemented a big project aimed at road safety. Because a human life is of the utmost value to us. Considering all the above, we entered year 2015 with dignity and confidence. We have a clear awareness that our activities can have significant impact on many different processes within Ukraine. Following the principles of the UN Global Agreement, our company strives to maximize the positive effect of this impact, to broadly integrate the sustainable development objectives into our business processes, and to adopt the best CSR practices from the world and national content as well as share our achievements in this sphere. This Sustainable Development Report for 2014 is also one of the forms of communication with the world, when we share our experience with the public. And we are ready to take every piece of advice and every critical comment into account. Jumping a few steps forward, I would like to note that in 2015 we established a Business Social Responsibility Committee in the company, composed of our top managers. This expert body is crafting a sustainable development strategy for the company and regularly reviews socially important projects and public initiatives which can be joined and supported by our company. It makes our decisions more systematic and participatory, and our involvement may bring even more benefits to the society. Vitaliy Antonov President of Concern Galnaftogaz (OKKO filling station network) 6 7 ABOUT US PJSC Concern Galnaftogaz is an operator of OKKO network, one of the largest filling station networks in Ukraine that counts over 400 locations. The largest network of roadside restaurants in Ukraine is also a part of the company’s structure, represented by A la minute, Pasta Mia, and Hot café brands. Concern Galnaftogaz business units are also involved in retail merchandise sales through the filling station shops, wholesale and retail sales of oil products, expert analysis of fuel quality, storage and transportation of oil products. Concern Galnaftogaz is a Ukrainian company with a share of foreign capital. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is one of the company’s shareholders. The registered capital of Concern Galnaftogaz exceeds UAH 195 million. According to the study by Deloittе, the international consulting company, Concern Galnaftogaz ranks 126th among the biggest companies of Central and Eastern Europe and 16th among Ukrainian businesses. The company is one of the biggest employers and taxpayers in Ukraine. As of the end of 2014, OKKO team counted over 9 thousand employees. In 2014, all business units of Concern Galnaftogaz have paid a total of UAH 4.396 billion in taxes, which constituted more than 1% of total budget income of Ukraine. The OKKO network is present in all 24 oblasts of Ukraine and in Crimea. Due to the fighting in the East in 2014 and impossibility to maintain operational control over its facilities, the company was forced to suspend the operation of 25 filling stations in Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. All OKKO filling stations in Crimea are presently leased out. In 2014, another 21 filling station were added to the network and 19 more were reconstructed. Besides, the company installed 34 chargers for electric cars at our filling stations along major highways.

Over the year, the consumption of fuel in Ukraine decreased by more than 11%, and in the fourth quarter the drop was over 20%. The root cause of this drop-down was the deterioration of social and economic situation in the country, which resulted from political instability and start of military warfare in the East of Ukraine. This led to the devaluation of national currency and a decline in business activity and purchasing capacity of citizens. In these circumstances the retail market was filled with cheaper and lower-grade oil products. The negative tendencies affected all operators of fuel market in Ukraine and thus the competition for clients became even more acute. The sales volumes of OKKO network were also decreasing this year, but slower than those of our competitors. The company’s market share in 2014 amounted to 16%. Due to complications at the market the company had to adjust some of our initial plans. Nevertheless, in the past year we managed to implement may new projects in our key directions, namely in business, in service and in sustainable development. We also installed the first network of electric chargers in Ukraine (see page 65 for more details). We enrolled almost 1 million new participants to our FISHKA rewards program. We launched a unique online platform for OKKO fuel card holders that has no match to it in Ukraine by today. USD 49 million were solicited from the syndicate of Western banks for business development, which were used in part for the refinancing of short-term loans and for the construction of new filling stations in the other part. In 2014 all our oil product quality testing laboratories were certified according to the European ISO/IEC 17025:2006 standard. As in previous years, in 2014 OKKO network offered its clients imported Euro-5 grade petrol and diesel fuels produced according to the highest European standards of quality and environmental safety. Oil refineries of Belarus, Lithuania and Poland remained the main fuel suppliers for OKKO.

Although the gross revenue of the company increased, our net loss was UAH 875.7 million in 2014. At the same time Concern Galnaftogaz paid UAH 4.4 billion in taxes, having increased tax payment twofold in comparison with the previous year. Thus, we provided over 1% of total budget income of Ukraine which constituted UAH 425 billion according to the State Fiscal Service. Taxes paid by Concern Galnaftogaz constituted over 1% of total budget Income of Ukraine in 2014. Taxes and duties paid by the Gross income, company, billion UAH billion UAH 0.15 19.60 0.10 0.22 To Social Insurance Fund 14.70 15.68 0.16 0.09 Directly to budgets 0.18 4.03 3.13 1.91 Import taxes 2012 2013 2014 2012 2013 2014 In 2014 prices for oil products increased significantly, which negatively affected the company’s financial results. The main reasons were devaluation of national currency, tax burden, decrease of purchasing capacity of Ukrainian citizens and forced closure of 25 filling stations in the East of Ukraine. Retail prices of oil products increased by over 60% in one year. But when prices are compared in USD equivalent, they were actually lowered. 19 1.5 Price for A-95 Price for A-95 17 1.4 Price for diesel Price for diesel 15 1.3 13 UAH currency rate to 1.2 11 USD, UAH/USD 1.1 9 1.0 0.9 7 0.8 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 This disproportion was caused by the devaluation of national currency which happened in parallel to the global oil prices drop-down. Global prices for fuel became a stimulating factor, and without its influence fuel at Ukrainian filling stations would be even more expensive. But the global factor could not completely level the consequences of devaluation: hryvnia was losing value even faster than global oil prices were decreasing. These fluctuations above all affected operations of oil products importers, including the OKKO network. We pay for oil products to European refineries in foreign currency which we need to purchase at the interbank exchange, and at the same time we sell fuel for hryvnias. Besides, excise duty rates, customs fees and other charges for oil products in Ukraine are also linked to the foreign currency. 14 15 Ratings The OKKO brand took ranked In the rating of 500 biggest According to Forbes magazine, 15th among the Top 100 bigcompanies of Central and Concern Galnaftogaz is placed gest Ukrainian companies Eastern Europe which is 18th in the rating of Ukraine’s by income level, 5 positions published annually by the 200 largest companies. higher than the previous year. international consulting The President of Concern company Deloittе, Concern Galnaftogaz Vitaliy Antonov Galnaftogaz ranked 126th, ranked 7th among the Tophaving improved its posi100 best top managers of tion by 12 points.

The audit was initiated in order to measure the level of trust to the company, to define the most important factors affecting company’s reputation among the clients (В2С, В2В), partners, experts, employees and mass media. The audit results will form the basis for development of reputation management system and will be taken into account in drafting the Sustainable Development Strategy, as company’s responsibility is one of the factors influencing our reputation.

The concept of “safety” is perceived in its broadest context which covers: personal safety of OKKO employees and clients; safety of all road users; comfort and unrestricted access to all our services for clients with limited mobility; compliance with all rules and regulations of technological safety; safe work conditions; economic safety. Due to military warfare in the East in 2014, safety issues became even more important and had a significant impact on the company’s business. Particularly, due to potential threat to lives of our employees and clients we had to suspend operation of 25 filling stations on the territory of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. The employees of the closed filling stations continued to receive their wages, and those willing to move received necessary support for relocation and employment in other regions. In 2014 the company supported the employment of 30 internally displaced employees and the trade union provided financial aid to 27 displaced people. At the same time the company helped hospitals and medical institutions in purchases of medical equipment. The trade union provided financial support to employees mobilized to serve in the ‘ATO zone’ (40 persons as of the end of 2014). Personal safety The filling stations are highly visited locations that are open 24 hours a day. Due to this specific nature of our operations the company must consistently take necessary measures to ensure safety of out clients and employees at our filling station. That is why we invest significant costs into safety equipment and measures each year. Investments and minor expenses for In 2014, according to statistics of the Prosecutor’s General Office, the number of infringements, including crimes safety system, mln UAH against property, had significantly increased. In particular, 0.18 last year there were 1000 more robbery-related assaults 0.27 0.20 against property objects than in 2013. Beside banks, ATMs and retail shops, the filling stations are unfortunately also included into the risk group. With this in mind, the 9.45 9.25 10.35 department of economic safety has, in cooperation with operational division, taken additional measures in order to prevent any dangerous incidents at our filling stations. As a result, in 2014 none of our employees or visitors of 2012 2013 2014 OKKO filling stations were harmed. Investments into Minor expenses for As part of our efforts to protect personal safety of people safety systems physical guards and at OKKO filling stations, we have installed video surveilalarm button lance and emergency alarm systems and optimized cash logistics and cash storage systems. To avoid storing large amounts of money in our cash registers, the company provides options for clients to pay for products and services using electronic payment systems. The company continuously cooperates with State Security Service and Investments and minor expenses for other law enforcement bodies in areas of its operations in order to minimize law enforcement officers arrival time in video surveillance systems, mln UAH case of an emergency signal from our filling station. Due to the complicated situation in the country, in 2014 the company paid much more attention to preparation to new possible challenges, like threats of subversive 6.20 5.92 or terrorist acts, hostage-taking, etc. We have approved an algorithm of steps that need to be taken in case of 0.73 threats related to explosive devices, evacuation, etc. 0.29 0.61 0.63 2012 2013 2014 A number of instructions for company employees have been developed. They provide detailed description of Minor expenses for video steps that should be taken in case of different contingensurveillance cies, including attacks at filling stations or in case of threats of such attacks. All the steps employees should take in such circumstances should be directed at minimizing the threats to life and health of our filling station/restaurant employees, clients or other persons. In order to enforce the rules described in the instructions, all the OKKO network objects regularly run through safety training sessions. 24 25 Technological safety Filling stations and fuel depots are objects with higher risk of technological or fire disasters. With that in mind, OKKO network employees carefully follow all applicable rules and regulations on technological and fire safety and maintain strict control over all operations in order to prevent any emergencies. The service of labor, technological and fire safety of the company holds a level 4 audit on a monthly basis, aimed at monitoring safety and working conditions. The anti-crisis strategy and a comprehensive compilation of instructions for employees on acting in critical situations are now being developed. An individual plan for mitigating emergency situations (PMES) and safety declarations were developed for each of the company’s facilities. According to these documents, the employees of these facilities have to be properly prepared for mitigation of a potential accident. To achieve this, OKKO filling station network regularly organizes practical exercises for the personnel. The schedule of such practical exercises and instructions is approved annually. Corporate exercise on fire liquidation with participation of State Service of Emergencies officers and rescue teams are held each year at one of our network filling stations. In 2014 the exercise was held in Vinnytsya, in addition to Lviv, Rivne and Ivano-Frankivsk in previous years. Accident prevention exercises are held at least twice a year, where employees learn to act in different modeled emergency situations. Instructions on labor safety, fire safety and public safety are held quarterly at each of the company’s facilities for employees involved in high-risk tasks. Each week company drivers are instructed and reminded about safe driving methods and measures to be taken in emergency situations. GPS navigation system installed in all corporate vehicles helps monitor the compliance with these rules. All employees of the OKKO filling stations are trained how to act in case of car or clothes of a person catching fire, during natural disasters and in cases of significant spill of oil products so that they could avoid risks to their own lives and protect others who may be present on the premises of a filling station. As a result of these measures, no production-related accidents were reported at OKKO network facilities over the last 3 years.

Unfortunately, Ukrainian roads are among the most dangerous in Europe. According to statistics of World Health Organization, the traffic accident death rate in Ukraine is 13.5 per 100 thousand of the population, which is one of the highest figures in Europe. Over 5 thousand people die in traffic accidents in Ukraine each year. The economy loses USD 5 billion a year in road accidents and mitigation of their consequences. Highways passing through villages are especially dangerous as local citizens often get injured in accidents. Number of car accidents with Death rate as a result of car accidents in some victims on Ukrainian roads countries of Europe, persons per 100 thousand citizens 313 13.5 485 278 11.8 489 421 488 6.4 4788 M05 (Kyiv-Odesa) 3.7 4.7 3648 M03 (Kyiv-Kharkiv) V06 (Kyiv-Chop) 2013 2014 Other roads of Ukraine UK Germany France Poland Ukraine The main reasons of traffic accidents in Ukraine are: Deliberate violation of traffic rules Drunk driving Low visibility at night The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is one of the largest investors in Ukraine. Modernization of road network is among the most large-scale projects of the Bank. EBRD is also an investor and a lender of Concern Galnaftogaz. The activity of EBRD and Concern Galnaftogaz is directly linked to roads, and thus they are united by common intention to make Ukrainian roads safer. The OKKO network includes over 400 filling stations across Ukraine which serve more than 200,000 clients daily. Thus, they are the most visible place of communication with all road users. Our long-term cooperation and trustworthy relations resulted in signing of open memorandum on realization of a joint social project “I plead, live! Road safety”, which promotes responsible behavior on the road. The team of Provid creative agency has promptly joined the memorandum and developed a creative platform of the project and images of the main campaign characters – Blahunchyky (pleaders). ‘I plead, live! Road safety’ is the first social project in Ukraine implemented on the basis of public and private partnership Blahunchyky are fantastic creatures pleading you to remember that your family, friends, and the loved ones love you, always care for you and wait for you to come home safe and sound! Blahunchyky remind you to be careful on the road, not to violate traffic rules and respect the others. They appeal to you: ‘I plead, live!’ 28 29 Road safety The primary goal of the project is to increase the awareness of population, and especially children, living near one of the most dangerous international highways, Route M05 (Kyiv–Odesa), vehicle drivers, cyclists and other road users about road safety and possible consequences of traffic rules violation. The main achievements of the project: 3 round tables 65 extracurricular events on 12 Training sessions on 10 thousand free “Safe roads 500 information posters in on the issues road safety for schoolchildren road safety for personnel with blahunchyky” villages and at OKKO of road safety of grades 5 and 6. of OKKO filling stations guidebooks filling stations along the Route M05 1800 9 kits of reflecting bracelets, jackets, “Safety shelves” where clients may take labels and pendants handed out to information materials and buy light-reflecting schoolchildren in areas along the items or other products for safe driving were Odesa-Kyiv highway installed at OKKO filling stations 300 355 employees of OKKO filling children of our employees stations along Route M05 received gifts with light-reflecting were provided with complete items and information materials sets of light-reflecting materials about road safety Blahunchyky appealed to drivers: Blahunchyky appealed to pedestrians: I plead you, do I plead you, I plead you, I plead you, I plead you, not drive drunk! fasten your belt! Follow the rules! get visible! take care of yourself! On our web-site www.okko.ua/uk/pray_live you may find leaflets for drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, horsedrawn transport drivers, and children, as well as news about the project. Project ‘I plead, live! Road Safety’ lasted from November 2014 till April 2015. The campaign received many positive feedbacks, and thus in 2015 the company will continue the project expanding it to the entire network. 30 31 Economic safety In order to ensure transparency in our relations with partners, OKKO filling of tenders are held in elec99% station network annually extends the volumes of products and services tronic form which guarantees for company’s own needs which are purchased at open tender auctions. transparency and efficiency of The aim of this open purchasing is to create competitive and dynamic environment for buying products, works and services for OKKO filling stapurchasing process and allows tion network, eliminate any chance of misconduct and corruption, and to substantially minimize cirensure efficient and rational use of financial resources.

In order to avoid and minimize the risks of fines, financial or other sanctions for violation of effective laws, to strengthen the status of reliable partner in the eyes of international investors and lenders, and to establish the reputation of the company which operates in strict accordance to all laws and regulations, we implemented a range of internal corporate compliance procedures. These procedures include constant monitoring of changes in current legislation, analysis of business processes and projects on their conformity to norms and moral requirements, continuous dialog and cooperation with state regulatory bodies enabling the company to follow relevant regulatory requirements, continuous monitoring of fulfillment of our obligations and financial covenants for loans and investment contracts, counteractions against corruption and prevention of financial misconduct. In the area of corporate management the company strictly complies with all requirements of applicable laws, charter, by-laws and the Corporate Management Code while following the world’s best practices and standards and thus securing the rights and interests of our shareholders and investors to the maximum extent. Personal data handling The safety of our clients’ personal data is among the key principles of our interaction with outside stakeholders. The company takes very serious measures to protect personal data: we store all data at secure data centers that conform to European security standards; we minimize the number of vendor companies that handle the data; we provide access to the data solely via secure channels; we set up authorized access for designated employees both in the company that is running the program and in coalition partner companies. We handle personal data in strict accordance with applicable legislation of Ukraine, drawing upon the best international practice. 32 33 Accessibility Starting from 2008, the OKKO network implements an accessibility standards program to provide unrestricted access for persons with limited mobility, namely people in wheelchairs and parents with children, to all services of our filling stations. Today over 30% of OKKO filling stations are equipped in accordance with accessibility requirements All the new stations are built in accordance with these requirements. 150 filling stations with ramps, wide entry doors and appropriate space for wheelchair movement between the shelves in sales hall or tables in restaurants or cafés. 71 dedicated parking space for the 60 specially equipped sanitary units disabled at OKKO filling stations at OKKO filling stations For the smallest visitors and their parents we have: 24 filling stations equipped with swaddling tables 40 highchairs for baby feeding 40 restaurants offering special menu for kids 2 open-air playgrounds with a great choice of dishes in the filling station area 34 35 TEAM AND COMMUNICATIONS From the moment of its inception, the OKKO network was always eager to work in line with European values based on respect to people and society. During the past 10 years we joined the UN Global Agreement, approved the Corporate Management Code, and defined our mission and values. In 2014, the implementation of Code of Corporate Ethics was an important milestone in company’s development and its internal culture. In 2014 the company paid special attention to internal communication, as the only way to organize efficient work of 10 thousand employees is by establishing reliable links between different regions and business units, ensuring equal understanding of our goals and ways to achieve them. The reputation audit held last year also helped us understand opinions and expectations of OKKO employees regarding our brand (see p. 21 for more details). The results of this study demonstrated a high level of internal loyalty to the company. At the same time the study allowed to identify new tools to unite our staff, exchange information and engage employees in society development projects supported by the OKKO network. We continued our dialog with existing and potential clients, partners, local communities, and civil society leaders using broad range of communication tools. Top managers of our company represented not only Concern Galnaftogaz but also Ukraine at the reputable economic and sectoral forums such as Annual EBRD meeting in Warsaw, XIV International Economic Forum in Lviv, Davos Communication Forum in Kyiv, and Petroleum Ukraine 2014, HR Wisdom Summit. Team The OKKO network is one of the biggest employers in Ukraine. Our employees form our main intellectual capital. That is why our relations are guided by the principles of partnership and social responsibility of the company. We strictly follow the requirements of Ukrainian legislation and international human rights standards, we pay competitive wages in a timely and transparent manner, we do not allow any type of discrimination and provide equal opportunities for professional development and career growth to all employees. 9,408 people were working in the company at the end of 2014 Among them, almost 8 thousand were employed at filling stations, over 1 thousand at restaurants, cafés and shops, and about 500 in the main office. The company created 449 new workplaces in 2014 At the same time the general number of employees decreased by 400 persons in comparison to 2013. This was mainly related to withdrawal of city retail shops from company’s structure and events in the East. The company was forced to suspend operation of 25 filling stations in the zone of combat, affecting a total of 380 employees. Total number 449 newly created of employees working places in 2014 9810 9408 9068 2012 2013 2014 38 39 Labor standards The company aims for a long-term cooperation with each OKKO team member and due to this reason we create necessary conditions for professional and personal development and encourage our employees to take part in training courses and events. In 2014, 2769 employees benefited from these training courses. 85% of training courses were held by the company’s department of organizational development and training. We also adhere to the principles of gender equality. That is why today we have almost equal number of male and female employees. The percentage of the latter at managerial positions is growing each year and now reaches 35% in the main office and 43% at filling stations and restaurants. The company is open to young people without previous work experience. At the same time we highly value the people who decided to grow professionally at OKKO. Today we have about 500 people who have been working with the company for more than 10 years. We ensure high labor standards at each workplace and in case of necessity we may offer different forms of cooperation depending on employees’ convenience: flexible schedule, part-time job, and remote positions. This approach is effective when employing disabled people or women who are in the maternity leave. 177 employees left 52 employees returned to maternity leave from their maternity in 2014 leave in 2014 Employment of Women at disabled people management positions 278 292 43% 232 35% 35% 86 46 80 2012 2013 2014 Filling stations Total number of disabled employees Employed in the current year 40 41 Career and rewards Our aim is to ensure that all OKKO employees receive adequate remuneration for their work, that they enjoy safe work environment and social security. We are investing in training and professional growth of our employees. Approximately one third of the company’s job openings are filled from our internal candidate pool, but for management positions this figure is over 70%. In 2014, over 200 employees were promoted to higher positions. As in previous years, the company could boast one of the lowest staff turnover rates in this industry. The only exception was in restaurant business where this rate constituted 9%. Number of employees promoted Employee turnover in 2014 9.2% 484 5% 262 1% 157 Filling Stations, Restaurants 71 57 59 2012 2013 2014 Filling Stations The company values all its employees to the same degree, and pays salaries based exclusively on each individual’s contribution to the company’s development, his or her experience, qualification and personal achievements. In spite of an economic downturn, the company managed to increase salaries for all categories of employees in 2014. Avarage salary growth Avarage salary growth in restaurants segment in shops segment 12.5% 11.5% 8.5% 10% 11% 5% 3% 8.7% 3% 6% 12% 8% 8.6% 11.9% 5% 6.3% 7.3% 14.8% 15.3% 1.9% 12% 12% 12% 9% 8.1% 8% 5.8% 2012 2013 2014 2012 2013 2014 2012 2013 2014 42 43 Code of Corporate Ethics The Code of Corporate Ethics for employees came into force at Concern Galnaftogaz on July 1st, 2014. The company President Vitaliy Antonov took an active part in its preparation as he is convinced that the effectiveness of the code directly depends on the company’s culture and how well the top management follows the behavior standards established for the employees. The Code reflects the OKKO network philosophy, business behavior principles and working relations within the company which are equal for all regardless of their position, gender, age, experience, etc. Our ethic rules are equal for all: internal zero tolerance to corruption, political client-oriented work theft and other fraudulent acts neutrality alcohol and drug corporate shared responsibility for abuse is a taboo confidentiality the company’s reputation The Code defines the principles of relations between managers and their subordinates, as well as communication rules and instruments in the company. A special communication campaign was held to promote the adopted ethic rules among OKKO employees. A printed copy of the Code of Corporate Ethics was presented to each employee. All new employees will also receive the same copy. 44 45 Internal communication In 2014 the OKKO network extended the list of communication tools within the company while focusing on bridging the gap between the main office and regional employees and creating a single information sphere and a unified corporate culture. In order to achieve this, the company performed an audit of internal communications and developed an action plan for the nearest 3 years. In 2014 the corporate internal portal was updated with new functionality, regular email newsletter service was set up, “ОККО Inform” electronic bulletin for filling station employees was established, and a network of regional correspondents for corporate media was organized out of company employees. Also the company started the tradition of regular meetings of employees from regional divisions with top management. In 2014 such meetings took place in Kyiv and Odesa. Company managers discussed the results of the year in Skype conferences with all 10 regional branches of the ОККО network. The main instruments of internal communications OKKO Drive magazine OKKO Inform newspaper corporate (quarterly) (twice a month) portal regular meetings and Ideas internal events Number of employees who Skype conferences of tank common leisure participated in Solidarity Day top managers with teams 334 In 2014 the company started a program of collecting ideas from its employees 298 called “Ideas tank”. Each company employee may send his or her ideas on how to 247 256 improve client service, enhance working processes, ensure reliable operation of 184 equipment, etc. to the expert committee. Authors of ideas supported as viable and 161 implemented will receive a reward from the company. The company held the seventh Solidarity day when office employees voluntarily worked as junior operators at a filling station or shop assistants for one working shift. 300 company employees took part in this event, working at more than 200 filling stations. After one working day spent at the filling station, employees shared their impressions and proposals 2012 2013 2014 2012 2013 2014 for the improvement of operational processes. 46 47 External communication During 2014 we continued our open dialog with clients, media and social media users trying to respond to inquiries in a timely and most detailed manner and implement changes into our operational processes in case of necessity. In July we implemented another communication tool, a feedback form at OKKO website. By the year’s end it became the most popular instrument for communication with the company among our clients. In 2014 the company worked with mass media in the following directions: daily open communications in order to maximize reports about company’s activity; establishment of close contacts with regional mass media (Donetsk, Odesa, Vinnytsya, Rivne, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy oblasts); explanation of pricing principles for oil products in the network; active promotion of sustainable development principles and our projects in this sphere in mass media, including road safety, Go Green program, electric charger network, and sorting of waste. Last year the company and its business units prepared over 100 press releases for mass media, provided responses to over 500 inquiries from journalists. The company was mentioned in mass media more than 5000 times. The company extended its presence in social media which are not only a platform for communication with the public, but also one of the instruments for implementation of our social projects such as ‘I plead, live! Road safety’, or collection of fuel for Dzherelo rehabilitation center for children. Today OKKO brand has its own accounts in Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and eight automobile forums where the company constantly communicates with clients of the network. The popularity of our Facebook page was growing very rapidly and the number of followers increased from 4 to 15 thousands in just one year. The audience of OKKO Facebook page tripled in the course of one year. Number of processed requests Number of from clients through online Facebook followers channels in 2014 16500 15000 15000 13500 Feedback at OKKO site (663) 12000 Automobile forums (571) 10500 10500 OKKO page at 9000 7500 Facebook (284) 7500 Websites with clients' feedback (158) 6000 4500 3000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 48 49 “Ukraine through the lens” photo contest In 2014 the OKKO network in partnership with Raiffeisen Bank Aval, Concern Khlibprom and Terrin company organized a national photo contest titled “Ukraine through the lens” intended to reveal Ukraine by means of photography as an interesting, modern and diverse country undergoing the period of dramatic historical changes. Another goal was to create additional stimulus for talented photographers and support their creativity. Professional photographers working in different genres and styles, photographers of leading Ukrainian mass media and those who published their high-quality pictures in social media were invited to participate in the contest. In total the jury reviewed 172 pictures and selected a Photo of the Year (it was a picture called Revolution by Kyiv art photographer Andriy Broide) and also 8 other winners in different nominations. Two of them were selected by polling among Facebook users at official pages of OKKO network and Raiffeisen Bank Aval. The best photos of the contest were published in “Ukraine through the lens” photo book, printed in 2000 copies. “The works represented in this album will not only retain their meaning over time but will become even more valuable, – says the President of Concern Galnaftogaz Vitaliy Antonov. – That is because authors focused not only on certain characters or events, but on human dignity, dignity of Ukrainian people which was most vividly manifested in 2014.” The photo book was distributed among contest participants and also among investors, clients and partners of the network. 50 51 Collaboration with the trade union The Spivdruzhnist national trade union which includes employees not only from Concern Galnaftogaz but also from other companies, has regulated a broad spectrum of relationships between the company and its employees since 2010, and it has also organized a number of labor-related, social and cultural processes over this time. In 2014 the Spivdruzhnist trade union united 6,073 people Owing to cooperation of the company with the trade union OKKO employees may receive social aid, financial support for health improvement, assistance in organization of cultural and leisure events and corporate holidays. Since 2014, support for employees mobilized to ATO region, their families, and internally displaced persons has become one of the top priorities for the trade union. 2987 1639 1330 employees attended financial children attended cultural events aid allowances leisure events N W E S 53 21 404 employees used vouchers corporate tickets to gyms for health improvement trip (1013 and swimming pools participants) provided to employees 52 53 ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION Sales of oil products is a kind of activity that seriously impacts the environment. That is why The company strictly follows all legal norms regulating environmental safety standards during construction and operation of our filling stations. OKKO filling stations are constructed according to legally defined sanitary protection zones (SPZ) and only sell lead-free products which conform to the highest European environmental standard Euro-5. Starting from 2006, 296 new and reconstructed filling stations have been equipped with double-wall tanks which prevent leakage of oil products into soil. 150 filling stations have tanks with automatic level-measuring systems which allow real-time monitoring if there is any leakage of oil product. The company also plans to install the same system for the whole network. Proper equipment of fuel depots, reliability and safety of tanks for storage of fuel are also of utmost importance for us. Concern Galnaftogaz developed a seven-year program for development of storage depots and invested large amounts in order to reach the level of European standards. In the framework of this program the company equipped 10 depots with oil products vapor exhaustion systems which decreased air emissions resulting from tanks “breathing” by 50%. While cooperating with EBRD, IFC and BSTDB the company held an environmental audit the results of which are taken into account for annual development of business plans and environmental policy. We consistently adhere to Go green principles in our operations promoting them among our employees, clients and partners. The company continues to implement energy-efficient technologies across our filling station network and takes measures to decrease the volume of resources consumption. In July 2014 the company organized a workshop on “Environment Management System (EMS) according to the ISO 14001:2004 standard and internal EMS audits in accordance with ISO 19001:2011 standard requirements” for environmental engineers. Having received the new knowledge and skills, company experts held an internal environmental audit at 19 filling stations and 8 depots according the the above-mentioned standards. In 2015 the same number of internal audits is to be held. Use of resources The OKKO network uses significant amount of recyclable as well as non-recyclable resources in its operations. Thus, we produce waste of different hazard classes. The company consistently takes measures to shorten these amounts, which were described in detail in previous reports. In 2014 we managed to decrease the volume of greenhouse gas emissions in general, and lower the consumption of fuel and electricity at OKKO filling stations. However, the consumption of natural gas and water increased, and this fact is a reason for a more detailed study of their consumption and research of new saving opportunities. Electricity is dominating the structure of energy resources consumption in the OKKO network, while other types of resources do not play an important role. Particularly in 2014 the company consumed over 187 million MJ in electricity, while other energy resources consumption was up to 1 MJ. Amount of fuel consumed, Amount of energy Amount of gas consumed, thousand cubic m consumed, GW/hr thousand cubic m 4.89 221 4.22 191 4.05 183 53.46 52.09 46.31 2012 2013 2014 2012 2013 2014 2012 2013 2014 *amount of consumed energy resource in MJ The company understands that with limiting energy resources consumption we may also decrease the volumes of greenhouse gas emissions. Direct emissions constitute only about 0.5% of the total volume of emissions caused by our activity; accordingly, about 99.5% are indirect ones. In the past year the volume of the former somewhat increased, but that for the latter dropped. In total we managed to decrease emissions by 1,600 t or 2.5% Green gas emission, CO2, thousand t/year 0.34 0.39 Direct green gas emissions, CO2, thousand t/year 262.9 83.7 2013 44.6 65.6 63.9 304.8 2.2 2014 37.5 2013 2014 Carbon dioxide (CO2) Indirect Methane (CH4) Direct Nitrogen dioxide (N2O) 56 57 Water for operational needs of OKKO network is supplied from two sources: through central water supply system or from water wells where there is no central system. Now we are using 76 water wells. At filling stations without central water supply system biological wastewater treatment units such as Biotal or Bioprocessor were installed. Today we have 110 filling stations of that type in our network. These units produce technical water and mineral fertilizer suitable for secondary use.

The company has secured contracts for collection and disposal of all types of waste. However, company’s expenses for licensing decreased almost twice: from UAH 1,974,030 to UAH 1,093,786. Due to moratorium on state inspections of economic entities introduced in the second half of 2014, the number of inspections from state authorities significantly decreased. 58 59 Go green May 2014 was the fifth anniversary of the Go Green program started in Paper wastes collected OKKO network which aimed at developing the business in maximum harmony with the environment. During this period the program extended to at OKKO network, t all 400 filling stations and environmental care had become one of the most 77 important values of the company. 55 45.5 Within the framework of the Go Green program, OKKO held a range of promotional campaigns about thoughtful attitude to our environment, arranged sorting of waste and collection of paper and plastic waste for recycling, vastly introduced energy-saving technologies, and supported a range of community environmental initiatives. 2012 2013 2014 Over 2014 the company collected about 55 t of paper waste, which is 20% more than in the previous year. In order to motivate all filling stations to actively collect paper waste, in 2013 the company introduced the procedure Sources and paper wastes which allows to reward the filling station teams for their participation in recyclable resources collection. As a result, over 80% of paper waste were handling in 2014 accumulated at filling stations. Moreover, part of the collected paper waste is used for the second packaging of goods. In 2014 almost 5 t of packaging paper ran through several life cycles Apart from paper waste, OKKO filling stations are collecting used plastic packaging. The first 18 containers for PET materials were installed at filling stations of Transcarpathian oblast. In 2014 the company was actively searching for contractors able to collect and transport these materials for recycling in other regions. As a result, the company agreed to install PETpackaging containers in Ivano-Frankivsk and Zaporizhzhya oblasts in 2015. OKKO network supported the Energy Evolution UA community initiative aimed at protecting the energy independence of Ukraine and raising citizens awareness on how everyone may save energy resources. Within the campaign, 10 thousand leaflets with tips on energy saving were distributed at OKKO filling stations in Kyiv and Lviv oblasts. Traditionally we also joined the nationwide spring cleaning rally “Make Ukraine clean!” In 2014 the com95% pany provided its support in organization of this event in Lviv, Donetsk, 1% Zaporizhzhya by supplying fuel for transportation of waste and necessary 4% instruments and informing OKKO network clients about the rally. Hundreds of company employees took an active part in cleaning their towns and vil91% 1% lages as volunteers. 8% Eco-bags 1082 kilograms of plastic 18 containers for In order to make the “green” attitude popular, OKKO network continued to produce promotional souvenirs in Go green style and to sell eco-friendly packaging. Paper bags Plastic bags waste gathered at separate collection of OKKO in 2014 plastic were installed in 2014 4,400 eco-bags and 16,450 paper bags were sold through OKKO filling stations in 2014 60 61 Fuel quality Starting from 2013, the OKKO filling station network only sells imported certified fuel of the highest European environmental standard Euro-5. This means lower emissions of hazardous substances, which harm the environment and human health. The fuel is purchased from the best foreign manufacturers and corresponds to all relevant Ukrainian standards (DSTU 4839:2007 “Motor petrol of improved quality” EN 228:2008, DSTU 4840:2007 “Diesel fuel of improved quality” EN 590:2004, Technical regulations on motor petrol, diesel, ship and boiler fuels requirements). On the consumer’s information board at each OKKO filling station every client may receive all necessary details about composition, origin and characteristics of our oil products. High quality standards DSTU 4839:2007 “Motor petrol of improved quality” EN 228:2008 DSTU 4839:2007 “Diesel fuel of improved quality” EN 590:2004 Technical regulations on motor petrol, diesel, ship and boiler fuels requirements. EURO 5 Before delivery to the filling station, all the fuel sold at OKKO network undergoes three-level quality control. This control is performed by Fuel Testing Center TFC which has 12 testing laboratories. All of them are accredited according to the European ISO/IEC 17025:2006 standard. The TFC center is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment which has no rival at the Ukrainian market. Beside services for OKKO network, the center checks the quality of oil products for external customers, including State Standardization bodies. Three-level quality control Fuel depot Filling station Continuous monitoring of Storage and transportation is At every OKKO filling station oil products quality on the market under continuous control quality control system is in place We select the best suppliers of high-quality Every tank with fuel delivered to After every discharge of fuel foreign fuel: depot is controlled the tanks are sealed ORLEN LIETUVA (Lithuania) Each tank truck is sealed and At each filling station we store samples ORLEN (Poland) tracked using GPS taken from the last three tank trucks MOL (Hungary) TFC testing center performs NAFTAN and MOZYR OIL REFINERY (Belarus) regular checks at each filling station ROMPETROL (Romania) 62 63 Electric charger network OKKO network systematically supports the process of integration of the most eco-friendly vehicles of today, electric cars, into Ukrainian market. The company created infrastructure which simplifies travel across Ukraine for electric car owners. In December 2014, KEBA P20 high-speed chargers for electric cars were installed at 34 OKKO filling stations. Electric chargers are now present in 11 oblasts along the main highways. This is the first network of electric chargers in Ukraine which allows electric car owners to travel across the entire country with greater comfort. They may now have their car charged for free at OKKO. New electric chargers are positioned in such a way that the average distance between them does not exceed 200 kilometers. Electric cars of any mass produced model can drive this distance without being charged. In order to create as much comfort as possible for our clients, electric chargers are installed at filling stations that have full-scale A la minute, Pasta Mia or Hot cafe restaurants. While the car is being charged, the driver may relax having a delicious meal or a cup of coffee. KEBA P20 chargers produce a max. capacity of 22 kW/h. The duration of electric car charging depends on the car brand and model. For example, for a Tesla Model S, one hour of charging ensures additional range of 150 to 200 kilometers. Other electric cars have chargers with lower capacities, and charging will last a bit longer.
