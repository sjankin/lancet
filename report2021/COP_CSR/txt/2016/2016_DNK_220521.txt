Creating progress for others Kamstrup is a world-leading supplier of So far, we are represented in 65 countries energy and water metering solutions and worldwide by Kamstrup sales and subsidiary we define our value by the progress we offices and by our distributors. create for others. Our solutions support utilities and are also applied in properties with individual metering. For 70 years we have delivered reliable, cost-effective ways to measure and manage energy and water consumption worldwide. Our solutions include consumption meters, smart metering systems, hosting and services, analytics and smart grid applications. All products are produced with the highest certifications for environmental safety and quality in our automated production facilities in Denmark. 2. Statement of support for the UN Global Compact Advancing sustainable development serves as our inspiration to create innovative and cutting edge solutions which drive our customers’ businesses forward. Our relentless quest to develop solutions which create progress for others is helping customers all over the world to optimize their efficiency, identify new opportunities for growth and promote greater environmental responsibility. By anticipating our customers’ challenges, we are creating environmentally friendly technologies which enable them to run a better business and inspire smarter, more responsible, solutions for the communities they serve. Striving for a better water and energy future Climate change and the long-term availability of fossil fuels are subjects of worldwide concern. Both of these issues are driving the development of more efficient energy systems, including distributed local power supply and storage, and smart grids for electricity distribution. Smart energy metering solutions are a vital part of this development. Water scarcity and the sustainable management of water resources have, and will continue to be, a driving force behind our innovation. According to the UN, water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population increase over the last century. Our water meters, with their leakage and low flow detection, can contribute to the sustainable use of the world’s water resources. To save energy and water you need to understand how you are consuming it, and that in turn is only possible if you have accurate and reliable data. This is the essence of our intelligent metering solutions. Data from the meters is transferred to user friendly systems that keep customers informed about how much energy they consume over different periods and across different energy sources. For instance, information from all of a household’s utility meters can be shown on a single display. By showing consumption clearly and accurately, our products encourage end-users to protect the environment and natural resources by managing what they consume. We joined the UN Global Compact in January 2010. The reporting associated with the UN Global Compact helps us to understand where we stand as a sustainable company, and to see what we should focus on in the future. Constant development through parallel initiatives is how we create growth, and also how we improve our social and environmental performance; in this way the UN Global Compact helps take us to the next level. Per Asmussen, CEO 5 3.

Subsequently, we and conform to appropriate environmental point out our intention to use energy, water policies. The standard does not itself and raw materials with care. state specific environmental performance criteria, but instead shows how the organisation can set its own environmental goals, taking into account the law and those aspects of environmental protection which 6 it can influence. 3.2.2. Energy consumption (headquarters) The graph below shows a generally steady drop in energy consumption per unit of production since 1998. During 2009 and 2010 there were small increases in energy use per unit because production fell during the recession; as a result, the fixed component of our energy consumption increased as a proportion of the total. The actual decrease of the graph is due to the increase of the production. In 2012/2013 there was a small increase due to cold weather (heat) and new building activities (electricity). Energy consumption per meter produced 1998-2015 20 Electricity consumption (kWh) 15 Heat consumption (kWh) Consumption 10 5 0 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Year 3.2.3. Water consumption (headquarters) In our production facilities the only water we use is for calibrating meters, and this is reused. The great majority of our water is therefore used as drinking water and for sanitary purposes. Most of our washrooms now have taps with sensors and variable-flush cisterns.

Environmentally friendly technologies All our products are completely recyclable apart By showing energy consumption clearly and from their lithium batteries. We dispose of lithium accurately, our products encourage end-users to batteries at an authorised facility and ask our manage their use of resources and protect the customers to do the same. environment. Furthermore our system solutions for Most of our customers are in European countries energy metering do much more than just measure: with their own laws covering recycling. However, we they provide remote reading, so minimizing vehicle also offer to recycle any products returned to us use; they enable detailed analysis of consumption by our customers.

Recycling, Safety incineration and deposit for more information. A full set of emergency procedures, plans, equipment and training is in place to protect health and safety. For more information please see section 6. 9 3.3.2. Carbon footprint Since 2010 we have calculated the carbon footprint of our products. Carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, expressed in tonnes CO2 equivalent, generated by a product through its entire life cycle. To carry out this initiative we have bought the life cycle analysis tool SimaPro, including the EcoInvent database. The resulting calculations can be used to identify possible environmental improvements to help develop cleaner product technologies. 3.3.3.

Future focus areas Driven by consumers’ needs and values we will continue to develop energy-saving meter solutions. Besides this, we will continue: • Certification of energy management in our ISO 14001 system (4.4.3 from ISO 50001) • Carrying out local environmental initiatives according to our environmental action plans for 2016 (these will be issued late in the first quarter of 2016). 4.

Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2: Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 14 5. Anti-corruption cf. principle 10 Principle 10: Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery In Kamstrup, corruption is never acceptable. Our CSR policy says: “…none of Kamstrup’s employees may receive or give gifts, loans, payment or other remuneration which may incite dishonesty or illegal acts, or which may be seen as an attempt to influence the objectivity of commercial decisions”. We do not have a separate policy covering anti-corruption measures for the simple reason that we have not seen the need for one so far. Our CEO Per Asmussen stresses: “If we are offered entering into corrupt agreements, the answer is always NO”. Our intolerance for corruption is well known to everyone within Kamstrup who may face this issue. Future focus areas We will continue our strong stand on this issue. 15 6. Working conditions cf. principle 3, 4, 5 & 6 Principle 3: 6.1.3.
