We have by way of acknowledgement and support displayed our commitment to the principles of the Global Compact and we believe that as we move forward, implement and progress, our drive will be in the direction of reaching out to the entities and people we do business with. We foresee and expect they will in turn appreciate our efforts they will also abide by the principles of the Global Compact. Our belief is that we cannot be an island all by ourselves and the special meaning we attach to the word “global”, as in Global Compact, is what will strengthen our resolve. Activity Statement The Bowden Print Group understands that the 10 principles of the Global Compact that define clearly a global culture that should be upheld by companies worldwide. Implementing measures should not be seen by companies as an inhibitor to business but as an opportunity to better themselves to the peers; locally, nationally and globally. We submit to the United Nations Global Compact a commitment over the next twelve months to maintain standards implemented and recording processes across all 10 principles. This evaluation of measurements will ensure that we maintain and implement continual improvement methodologies. We have identified processes in line with Global Compact recommendations that we have adopted. … give yourself the advantage Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Our understanding and support for the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights underline an important part of acknowledging commitment to social responsibility since 2009. We understand that our commitment entails that we work continuously to support and improve the worlds social performance by setting our own high objectives and integrating human rights considerations where necessary into our daily business. We ensure that nobody whose work is contributing to our success is deprived of his or her human rights, or suffers mental or bodily harm. We consider this as an unwritten Code of Conduct which is a non-negotiable requirement from within and entails that all our suppliers and their subcontractors, without exception, should adopt and follow this code. Our Policy and Procedure Manual provides an objective guide to handle, solve, capture, analyse, and investigate compliance failures identified by employees. We see it as our responsibility to help ensure that our suppliers act in accordance with our minimum requirements. The need for such a set of guidelines is due to the overall compliance we wish to attain within the industry. An unfortunate fact is that suppliers fail to ensure compliance with governing labour standards. The requirements in the Bowden Print Group Code of Conduct are therefore stricter in many areas than the general standard in comparison to similar businesses in our country. Clearly there may be structural conditions or cultural traditions that may give rise to non immediate compliance with the Bowden Print Group Code of Conduct. We consider the most important point is that suppliers are prepared to actively work to ensure they eventually comply with the requirements. Our Code of Conduct expresses our support for the UN Declaration of Human Rights, and we also encourage our suppliers to sign up to the UN Global Compact. … give yourself the advantage Human Rights (continued) The Bowden Print Group provides access to basic health and education for the workers. Social assessments are considered in certain circumstances if the employee can not afford the medical treatment. If an employee is found to be not able to pay, the employee may be either granted or subsidised by way of a loan to attain the needed health care. A programme designed for the consideration of human rights will be developed for our employees to better understand the involvement of Amnesty International in this area.
