Page 1 Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility is an integral part of our firm’s culture, aligned to our firm values and essential to the way in which we do business. We monitor our improvement and impact within our workplace and across the local communities in which we work, specifically focusing on the theme of access across our five key strands: Social inclusion Raising the aspirations of young people in education through access to work experience and opportunities Diversity & inclusion Ensuring that our organisation and profession more widely is accessible to people from a diverse range of backgrounds and circumstances Pro bono Making a difference by sharing our legal expertise with those without access to justice Charitable giving Access to funding and donations from the Simmons & Simmons Charitable Foundation to support those in pressing need Environmental sustainability Supporting environmental issues and minimising our environmental impact We are committed to upholding the ten UN Global Compact principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption and incorporating them in to our policies, operations and culture to consistently ensure we are operating to the highest ethical standards. We seek continuous improvement and increased participation in our CR programme across our network and engage our clients and our suppliers to collaborate in our community projects to strengthen our overall impact. Page 2 Pro bono In 2015/16, our UK pro bono programme focused on Access to Justice and the individual casework we do in the area of disability benefits appeals. Our response to a desperate need from the most vulnerable members of our society is measure of our commitment, and we were delighted to welcome social welfare lawyer Diane Sechi to the firm in May 2015 to oversee and develop this stream of work. Internationally we have seen a similar enthusiasm for supporting individuals’ access to justice among lawyers around our network, more details of which are set out in the section on our communities. We are proud to have supported the achievement of the Paris Agreement in December 2015 through our pro bono support for the Legal Response Initiative, which assists Least Developed Countries and NGOs in international climate change negotiations. Lawyers from the firm attended the conference as liaison officers. Page 3 Our communities We take our responsibilities to engage with and support individuals in our local communities seriously, and try to share with them our time, knowledge, experience and expertise. Access to work experience and opportunities We are committed to a number of innovative and sustainable community projects that provide fair and equal opportunities to assist young people in education to develop their skills and realise their aspirations, helping to prepare them for the world of work. Young Talent Programme Our ambitious and award-winning secondary school programme with Frederick Bremer School in Walthamstow, London continues to develop with increased volunteer participation across the firm. The programme is designed to raise students’ aspirations through a series of ongoing, longer-term initiatives that provide access to the legal profession and wider work opportunities. Each year our firm, in collaboration with the school, selects a group of twelve Year 10 students to be part of the programme, which spans a seven year commitment of support for each cohort of students while they are at school, college and university or at work, with each cohort returning to the firm every year to participate in a range of activities including work experience; skills sessions; project work; presentations; paid internships; and group mentoring. As at April 2016 there are 62 students enrolled on to the programme, all of whom have completed one week of work experience at the firm. 37 students have also completed a week’s paid summer internship. Two Year 13 students were awarded the Simmons & Simmons bursary in September 2015 to assist them through university, and two more students (from the second cohort) will be awarded the bursary this year. We are proud supporters of the Social Mobility Business Compact and PRIME: this programme continues to complement and exceed our commitments to these initiatives while delivering transformational benefits both to the young people involved and members of the firm who support the programme. Page 4 Page 5 Supporting young people in Bristol Our Bristol office works with Envision on the annual citywide Community Apprentice programme. Simmons & Simmons volunteers support a team of local students from disadvantaged backgrounds who develop communityfocused projects over twelve months before being assessed by the Mayor of Bristol. The Bristol office has also introduced a weekly reading scheme with Kingfisher Primary School to support students with lower reading abilities. Paris Science & Literature initiative Our Paris office continues to support Paris Science and Literature (PSL) initiative. The firm’s Charitable Foundation has provided ongoing funding for three students who are enrolled into the initiative’s scholarship scheme, to help with accommodation and study expenses. At the end of the three year scheme, which is conducted in collaboration with the prestigious Lycée Henri-IV, the students receive a diploma qualification which provides entry to the grandes écoles (elite professional schools) in France. Lawyers in Schools We continue to support the delivery of the Lawyers in Schools programme to students at Saint Saviour’s and Saint Olave’s Schools in Southwark, London. Volunteers lead small groups in interactive sessions on various aspects of the law such as including Social Media and the Law, Intellectual Property, Family Law and Consumer Law. The resources provided by Lawyers in Schools are designed to foster debate and discussion, as well as to encourage critical thinking from the students so as to develop young people’s awareness and understanding of the law and the legal system, their rights and responsibilities and how the law affects their everyday lives. Moreland Reading Scheme Volunteers continue to participate in our longest running social inclusion scheme working with Moreland Primary School in Islington. Each week a group of volunteers attends to support 10 and 11 year old students to improve their reading ability. In July, we invited the students to visit our London office for the annual end of term summer celebration and an afternoon of arts and crafts with volunteers from the programme. The Big Issue Foundation For the eighth year running the firm has participated in the Big Issue Vendor Development Programme, which sees a Big Issue vendor join our firm for a six month placement at our London office, selling the Big Issue magazine and undertaking a personalised work shadowing programme. The firm’s Charitable Foundation also provided funding to allow the Big Issue Foundation to increase the scope of the Vendor Development Programme, allowing a greater number of vendors to participate. The firm continues to support the Big Issue Foundation with operational, corporate legal advice. Page 6 Foundation for Refugee Students UAF students, refugees, charities and non-profit associations.

Page 11 Our environment We continue to acknowledge that the business activities of our firm have an impact on the environment, are a cause of pollution and contribute to climate change. We proactively manage our environmental impacts through the central management of our buildings, investment in emerging clean technologies and the encouragement of behavioural change amongst our own people and supply chain. Climate Change The firm continues to support two of the UK’s most important climate change related pro bono charities: the Legal Response Initiative and PURE Leapfrog. Legal Response Initiative December 2015 saw the landmark ‘Paris Agreement’ at the UN Climate Change Negotiations, the first time all countries have committed to reducing their carbon emissions by way of international agreement. Crucial to reaching this Agreement was the work of the Legal Response Initiative (LRI), which provides pro bono legal support to the least developed and climate vulnerable countries in the UN Climate Change negotiations. The firm has supported the LRI since 2009 when it was founded in the lead up to the Copenhagen Conference. It works through a network of lawyers in different jurisdictions who give hands-on assistance during meetings, draft legal opinions and build the capacity of lawyers and negotiators from developing countries. Several of the firm’s lawyers and trainees worked in the Situation Room throughout the year in the lead up to the Paris Conference, and particularly in the final two weeks, advising on several dozen legal queries regarding the text of the Agreement from the least developed and climate vulnerable countries. The LRI had 10 advisors assisting on the ground in Paris, two of whom were lawyers from Simmons & Simmons. Page 12 Page 13 Pure Leapfrog PURE Leapfrog is a unique business-led charity that channels free professional advice into carbon reduction projects, and provides affordable loans to community energy projects. Leapfrog’s long-term vision is to put community energy at the heart of the future sustainable energy mix. Leapfrog works to level the playing field by offering community energy revolutionaries professional support and affordable finance. Our work in 2015 included supporting PURE Leapfrog with Energy Local contract set up for new energy pooling platform, the UK’s first energy pooling platform for communities in the UK. Carbon offset projects This year we have chosen three technology projects, in Sudan, Turkey and the Democratic Republic of Congo to offset our carbon emissions; all of which have environmental and social benefits. Low smoke cook-stove project, Sudan. (VCS + Gold Standard) This is a UN award winning project that addresses climate change, health, female emancipation and a range of social issues in Sudan. The largest killer of women and children in the developing world is respiratory disease, heavily influenced by indoor air pollution from cooking over wood, charcoal and dung. This project reduces emissions by introducing efficient stoves and modern fuels. The co-benefits can be transformative in terms of health, social and female emancipation. REDD+ forestry conservation, Democratic Republic of Congo (VCS + CCB) This innovative project aims to prevent logging of the DRC’s biodiversity rich rainforests around the banks of Lake Mai Ndombe in West Congo. The local community of 50,000 Congolese villagers receive direct benefits from the project. For example, jobs, schools, health clinics, improved food security through better agronomy and restoration of native fish stocks in Lake Mai Ndombe, and capacity building of local NGOs and community based organizations. It is the first REDD+ project in DRC. Run of river hydroelectricity, Turkey (VCS + SOCIALCARBON) This 20MW hydropower project generates clean energy from the natural flow of the Cakit River, Turkey. The project developer has gone far beyond what is required through its investment in managing the river, planting trees and engaging with the community. As a result this project was the first to gain the SOCIALCARBON® standard in Turkey. Page 14 Carbon Neutral + Simmons & Simmons has been committed to neutralising our carbon footprint annually since 2006. This year we purchased VCS certified carbon credits through our CR partner, PURE Leapfrog, to offset 12,587 tonnes of Carbon Dioxide equivalent produced by our global network of offices. This is an increase of less than a quarter of a percent on last year’s absolute figures, but is a reduction of 2% per employee. It is a 16% reduction on the baseline set in 2007/08.

Pure Leapfrog is developing an energy efficiency and renewable energy programme that will support the charity to reduce its energy and carbon footprint by installing measures and training staff, thereby saving them tens of thousands of pounds. “Williams Lea Tag understands the importance of working together to embed sustainability into Simmons & Simmons’ global supply chain.

This is reinforced by the firm’s “open door” culture, as well as an anonymous whistleblowing service which ensures that even the most sensitive issues can be disclosed and addressed. An Ethics Committee, chaired by our Senior Partner, monitors the firm’s compliance with our ethical obligations and commitments and suggests actions which should be taken to ensure that we continue to do so.
