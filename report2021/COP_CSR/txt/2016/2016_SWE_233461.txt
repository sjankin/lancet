Husqvarna Group Sustainability Report 2015 The full Sustainability report 2015 has been published on the web site http://www.husqvarnagroup.com/en/sustainability_achievments. This pdf is a copy of the 2015 sustainability report pages published on the web site. Sustainability is becoming more and more integrated in Husqvarna Group’s processes, and sustainability achievements are reported in the Annual Report 2015. Apart from a sustainability section on pages 30-34, other sections with relevant information are strategy, brands and markets, risk management as well as corporate governance. Strategy and analysis Letter from the CEO A year of progress Husqvarna Group’s products are enabling performance in nature and its business has significant impact on the environment and on society. Thus, sustainability is being integrated into our operations because we regard it as a prerequisite for conducting profitable and responsible business, now and in the future. During the year, top management has been involved in refining our sustainability strategy. We added divisional sustainability goals to embed sustainability into the new organizational structure. The next step is to develop Groupcommon sustainability goals which we plan to have finalized Kai Wärn, President and CEO by mid-year 2016. Naturally, we aim at objectives and goals that are both measurable and inspirational and that are driving our contribution to getting a more sustainable world and yet feels feasible to achieve. In parallel, we have continued executing on actions related to previously defined goals. The Group has the greatest environmental and social impact through innovating and manufacturing high quality products that help consumers and end-customers enhance their local environments. This is where we can make the biggest difference, and this is where we are – and for many years have been – focusing our ambitions. Across our offering, we are focusing is on creating ergonomic and more energy-efficient products. A growing number of our products have lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions compared to previous product generations, such as our handheld construction products, our robotic mowers and our battery-powered range of lawn mowers, blowers, trimmers and chainsaws. We want to make more end-customers aware of the advantages with battery-powered products, such as less noise and no emissions during use – advantages suitable for products being used in urban areas. Husqvarna Group is also continuously improving its petrol-powered products. Husqvarna’s professional chainsaws have AutoTune™ with micro-processor control to regulate the flow of the fuel to the engine, optimizing performance and minimizing exhaust emissions. The X-TORQ® engine technology, reduces fuel consumption for two-stroke engines by up to 20 percent and exhaust emissions by 60 to 75 percent compared to a conventional engine.; Connectivity will be part of changing the future and how we care for green spaces. With the help of connectivity, operators get guidance on how to perform tasks while staying on top of health and 1 (20) safety. It alert technicians about maintenance needs before there is a need for service, information that can be shared with a dealer to enable fast and accurate support. Husqvarna Fleet Services™ also allow landscaping management companies to plan and drive their businesses in a much more efficient way. In 2016 Gardena launches its new smart system for garden use. The Gardena smart sensor collects live data on soil moisture, outdoor temperatures and light intensity, making it easier for gardeners not only to plan when to mow or water their lawns and plants, but also to adapt to all weather conditions, thus making sure water is used as efficiently as possible. To further enhance the benefits the Group can deliver the benefit of the Group, we must also understand our impacts and bring value right along the value chain. The Group aim to improve working conditions in the supply chain, provide a safe and attractive workplace for employees, realize shared objectives for our business partners, dealers and retailers, reduce negative impacts from our operations, and contribute to dealing with the challenges facing society. Through this holistic approach, Husqvarna Group can also deliver long-term investment returns for shareholders. At every level of the organization, we are putting the processes in place to ensure that our operations are conducted sustainably. We strive to be a company that acts responsibly in respect of people, products and processes along our value chain. Husqvarna Group is a signatory to the UN Global Compact’s ten principles on human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption. We will continue our dedicated work to promote good workplaces, reduce negative operational environmental impacts and ensure responsible sourcing and good business ethics. With a century of experience from innovating products that are caring for green spaces, we are prepared to continue pushing the industry in an ergonomic and sustainable way. I am also proud to say that our Group is prepared to embed sustainability in all aspects of conducting our business. Caring for all dimensions – economic, environmental, social and governance might not be easy, but we are confident that we are on a path to contributing to a more sustainable society. Stockholm, March 2016 Kai Wärn, President and CEO Integrating sustainability into our strategy Husqvarna Group’s products are enabling performance in nature and its business has significant impact on the environment and on society. Sustainability is integrated into our operations because it is regarded as a prerequisite for conducting profitable and responsible business. When integrating sustainability into our strategy, we have taken the following steps: Drivers and megatrends Understanding future stakeholder expectations is critical to develop a resilient, long-term strategy. An important part of understanding future customer requirements and the business landscape has been to assess the impacts of the megatrends shaping our world, such as climate change, urbanization and globalization on society. More about our strategy can be found in the Annual Report 2015. Anchoring the sustainability strategy Based on the materiality analysis and analyzing the Group’s impacts at every phase of our value chain, our sustainability strategy is focused on three main pillars. Within these areas sustainability objectives, targets and action plans will be developed in 2016. 2 (20) Strong culture Culture is considered an important building block for Husqvarna Group to reach the 2020 market leadership position. During the year, numerous culture dialogs were held in the Group around our key behaviors; Seek the customers point of view, Demonstrate collaboration and Maintain focus and simplicity. The starting point for these dialogs was to realize that change starts with me and by asking the question What can I do?

Due to the nature of our business and its seasonal variations in sales, the share of temporary to permanent employees is approximately 20 percent. The Group’s workforce is comparatively larger at the end of the year; higher during the first quarter and at the beginning of the second quarter when manufacturing of garden products is at its highest production period. * Due to reporting system limitations, only regions and gender are reported on. Read more in the Annual Report 2015, page 71, note 4 11 Collective bargaining agreements 40 percent of total employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. As outlined in the Code of Conduct, all employees are free to exercise the right to form, join or refrain from joining unions or similar organizations, as well as to bargain collectively or individually. In countries where no independent labor unions exist, such as the U.S. and China, several forums for employer-employee relations have been established, such as work councils, consultations and environment and safety committees. In several countries, e.g. Germany and Sweden, all employees except Group Management are covered by collective agreements. In accordance with Swedish law, two employee representatives and two deputies are members of the Board, providing employee input to the Board’s decision-making. 12 Organization’s supply chain Husqvarna Group’s supply chain spans some 2,300 direct suppliers and approximately 35% 5 (20) of our suppliers are based in low-cost countries. approximately 150 of our largest suppliers cover about 65 percent of the Group’s purchasing spend. Through a specific program (EXCITE), the Group has close ties with the 150 largest suppliers, covering about 65 percent of the Group’s purchasing spend. During the year, one supplier day for the EXCITE suppliers was arranged in Münich and one in Shanghai. Important topics at the supplier days are the Group’s Code of Conduct and the importance of sustainability. Husqvarna Group’s Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Business Ethics outlines our expectations of suppliers to ensure that universal standards for doing good business are in place. The Code addresses concrete actions within labor, human rights, product safety, environmental and ethical business practices. Suppliers are also required to follow the Restricted Materials List. Staff from Husqvarna Group has arranged training sessions for suppliers in chemical legislations, such as REACH and RoHS. Sustainability risk assessments are made as one part of the Supplier Quality Assurance (SQA) process. The purpose is to identify potential risk suppliers from a sustainability perspective. During 2015, supplier sustainability audits were focused to suppliers in China. We completed four full sustainability audits on high-risk suppliers. Additionally, 15 high-risk suppliers were revisited. These audits verify that improvements, even though some suppliers show limited progress, are made by the suppliers on how the environment and the working conditions are handled. 13 Significant changes during the reporting period During the year, one production facility was acquired in the U.S., and one closed in Shanghai, China. No material changes affecting share capital structure were made. Nor were there any bigger supplier relocations. 14 Precautionary approach or principle As described in the Environmental policy, the Group applies the precautionary principle and takes action to prevent or mitigate injury or harm to human health or the environment. The Code of Conduct, policies, guidelines and a strong corporate culture provide a foundation for a sound business environment. 15 External economic, environmental and social charters, principles and initiatives Husqvarna Group is signatory of the UN Global Compact. The Group also find the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) important and response to its survey. 16 Membership in organizations Husqvarna Group is represented in EGMF (European Garden Machinery Federation) and OPEI (Outdoor Power Equipment Institute) where we take part in committees and working groups. Through these organizations, we respond on inquiries and public consultations from the European Union (EU) and the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Our memberships in these organizations is considered as being of strategic importance. The Group refrains from involvements that are considered to be political. Identified Material Aspects and Boundaries 17The Sustainability report covers the Husqvarna Group, including wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, and joint-ventures, where the Group owns 75 percent or more of the capital. 6 (20) 23 Environmental data is collected for production facilities and for warehouses larger than 5,000 m². Administration and sales, as well as smaller warehouses are excluded due to limitations in the reporting system. Social data, including health and safety reflect all employees working in the production facilities and employees in most supporting operations. Environmental data: Each production facility has one or more Environmental, Health and Safety managers (EHS), and they collect and report environmental as well as health and safety data into Group-wide reporting systems. HR managers in each country report employee data into the Group’s accounting system. This data covers the entire Group; production facilities, warehouses, sales organizations as well as other staff. Figures are compiled and verified annually by the People & Organization department. No material restatements were made for this year’s report. Stakeholder engagement 7 (20) 24-27 Stakeholder dialog Listening to and learning from our stakeholders enables us to meet expectations and improve conditions for long-term business success. Dialogue with employees, investors, end-customers, trade partners and suppliers is ongoing on many levels throughout our global operations. The responsibility for maintaining dialogs with representatives from the local community is handled on local level. Operations also cooperate with various non-governmental organizations, while shareholder dialogs take place on the Group level. Our most important stakeholders – shareholders, retailers, employees and potential employees — contributed to our strategy development during the year by providing input for identifying and prioritizing sustainability topics relevant to our business.

The most relevant topics were: energy and water-efficient products (1), customer health and safety (2), sustainable product portfolio (3), sustainable and efficient operations (4) as well as talent attraction and retention (5). Responsibility for focusing on these prioritized topics rests with each division. A number of other issues -anti-competitive behavior, anti-corruption and supply chain management -have the potential to influence stakeholders’ trust if we do not manage them adequately. Primary responsibility for these topics lies within Group staff functions. We validate the materiality assessment on a continuous basis.

It is difficult to measure the product’s total environmental impact because it depends on how much they are used. A professional user, for example, uses the products to a greater extent than a consumer. To develop more energy-efficient products is a priority. For chainsaws, trimmers, leaf blowers, robotic mowers, battery-powered lawn mowers and power cutters, for example, the latest product generations have less fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Battery products have significantly lower environmental impact throughout their life cycle compared to petrol-powered products. Husqvarna Group is also working to improve the environmental impact of the petrol-powered products. Husqvarna professional chainsaws are equipped with AutoTune ™, where a computer chip regulates the fuel flow to optimize performance and minimize exhaust emissions. With the help of X-TORQ® technology, fuel consumption of two-stroke engines reduces with up to 20 percent and exhaust emissions by 60 to 75 percent. Aspect: Supplier Environmental Assessment EN33 Actual and potential negative environmental impacts in the supply chain and actions taken Significant environmental non-conformities identified during Full Supplier Sustainability Audits (FSSA) found were e.g. no EIA permit and no firefighting permit. Chemical storage and waste management are also identified as having actual and potential negative impacts. Suppliers are requested to ensure corrective actions. No supplier has been terminated due to the results of the assessment. Social Labor practices Aspect: Employment LA1 Employee turnover 2015 Permanent Country Total Voluntary staff Voluntary In-Voluntary In-voluntary number of turn-over 2015, staff turn-over staff turn-over, staff turnpeople number 2015, % number over, % Sweden 1 960 237 12,1% 0,8% Germany 1 577 39 2,5% 7 0,4% China 1173 76 6% 386 32,9% US 4 229 613 14,5% 443 10,5% 14 (20) Japan 350 12 3,4% 3 0,9% TOTAL 9 289 977 10,5% 854 9,2% LA2 The benefit package Husqvarna Group offers to its employees differ between countries, due to laws and collective agreements. Differences are also based on whether the employee is regular or a temporary, full-time or part-time, the length of the employment as well as tier. Below, benefits in the three bigger countries; Germany, Sweden, and the US are shown. In Germany, health care, disability and invalidity coverage as well as parental leave are mandatory by law. Retirement provision is provided to full-time regular employees, but not for temporary employees. In Sweden, all employees have access to health care insurances, parental leave, pension plans (tjänstepension), occupational disease insurance (arbetsskadeförsäkring), as well as wellness grants (friskvårdsbidrag). Additional salary during parental leave is based on the length of the employment. A variable pay program ( KPI ), which is measured on Productivity, Quality and Cash-flow is given to employees based on their presence. Based on tiers, some managers instead get access to STI (Short Term Incentive) programs, and/or LTI (long-term incentive) programs, stock ownership as well as life insurances. Permanent employees can decide to change salary for other payments (löneväxling) such as cost for fertility program (IVF) and eye surgery, a possibility which is not open to temporary employees. In the US, Husqvarna Group offers all full-time, regular employees a complete benefit package; medical coverage, dental coverage, vision coverage, life insurance, short & long term disability, 401k, Employee Assistance Program, Education Assistance and Business Travel. Full-time, temporary/seasonal employees are offered medical coverage, 401k, and Employee Assistance Program. Aspect: Occupational Health and Safety LA6 Injury Rate (IR) – 8.3* Lost Workday Injury Rate (LWIR) – 3.3* Fatalities – 0 *injuries per million hours worked The reporting of injuries are tracked per division, not per region or gender: Husqvarna Division: 3,3 injury rate/million hours Gardena Division: 14,5 injury rate/million hours Consumer Brand Division: 11,8 injury rate/million hours Construction Division: 8,2 injury rate/million hours Supplier assessment for labor practices Aspect: Supplier Assestment for Labour Practices LA14 Husqvarna Group has 2,300 suppliers. The 150 largest suppliers account for around 65 percent of the Group’s purchasing spend. Through a specific program, the Group has 15 (20) close ties with these suppliers. During 2015, 4 Full Supplier Sustainability Audits were conducted on suppliers in China. In 2014, there were 9 full supplier audits and during 2013 there were 7. During 2015, 15 follow-up FSSA visits conducted in Asia, where improvements were seen on öabot practices LA15 In 2015, the Group identified one supplier using two under-aged workers. This was a breach of our Code of Conduct. The supplier was immediately informed verbally and in writing. The supplier took immediate action and ensured that this would not be repeated. Suppliers are requested to ensure corrective actions to all identified non-nonconformities. So far, no supplier has been terminated due to results of the assessment. Aspect: Labor Practices and Grievance Mechanisms LA16 As it is likely that an employee may not feel comfortable with using standard grievance possibilities in existing reporting lines, Husqvarna Group has engaged an external service provider for operating a grievance mechanism (internally referred to as the AlertLine). The AlertLine can be accessed world-wide (24h) through telephone and email. The AlertLine report is reviewed (i) quarterly by the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee; and (ii) annually by the Board of Directors of Husqvarna, which also include two employee representatives and two deputy employee representatives. Employees are informed about the existence of the AlertLine through internal communication, a reference in the Code of Conduct and in online and physical trainings. In 2015, a total of 86 internal labor practice compliance reports were logged, whereof 78 were in North America, 4 in Europe and 4 in Rest of the World. Of the reported cases in North America, 5 related to alcohol or substance abuse, 22 to improper employment or disciplinary action, 4 to sexual harassment, 7 to threats and physical violence, 15 to workplace harassment, 6 to workplace health or safety violation and 19 to miscellaneous. Of the reported cases in Europe, 3 related to unfair employment practices and 1 to sexual harassment. In Rest of the World, 1 of the reported cases related to unfair employment practices, 1 to workplace practice and 2 to miscellaneous. Of the reported cases, 6 were substantiated, 11 partially substantiated, 68 unsubstantiated and 1 is still being investigated. Human Rights Aspect: NonDiscrimination HR3 No of incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken In 2015, a total of 7 discrimination compliance reports were logged. All of these cases were in North America. Of the reported cases, 1 were substantiated, 1 partially substantiated and 5 unsubstantiated. For the substantiated case, a formal warning for termination of employment has been issued to the faulty party. The partially substantiated case has been solved through additional training of the faulty party. Aspect: Freedom of Association and collective bargaining HR4 Operations and suppliers identified in which the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining may be violated – and measures taken 16 (20) The Group has not identified any facility that does not have the right to exercise freedom of association and/or collective bargaining. During the Full Supplier Sustainability Audits, no supplier has been identified to have violated the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining. Aspect: Human rights Grievance Systems HR12 No of grievances about human rights impacts filed, addressed and resolved through formal grievance mechanisms There have been no human rights related grievances reported through the Alertline or through internal auditing procedures. Society Aspect: AntiCorruption SO4 In 2014 and 2015, 100% of managers in tiers one through four globally received the online Code of Conduct training, with additional personnel (within Sales, Sourcing, Customer Service, etc.) trained based on needs identified by the divisions. In the United States and Canada, all salaried new hires regardless of division are enrolled in the online training. The overall completion rate for the online training is approximately 80%. Husqvarna Group has implemented firm and detailed intra-group policies regarding non-acceptance of corruption. A lot of emphasis has been put to safeguard compliance with these policies throughout the entire value chain (i.e. in relationships with the Group’s suppliers and customers) by way of incorporating relevant clauses in written contracts as well as highlighting such matters e.g. during Supplier Days held by the Group. Internal procedures such as signing memorandums, approval forms and “grand-parent-rules” have also been issued to govern obedience to these rules. In addition to the web-based Code of Conduct training, the Group’s Legal Affairs team are continuously training the various organizations in its policies against corruption. The main intra-group bodies for governance of compliance in this respect are the Board of Directors’ Audit Committee, Internal Audit and Legal Affairs. Corruption and bribery exist in markets where the Group conducts business, however, the majority of production and sales operations are located in countries with a lower risk for corruption, as defined by Transparency International. Corruption and bribery are not tolerated in any form. To strengthen the Group’s anti-corruption measures, the Group has close interaction with its suppliers, strengthened training in the Code in general but also where deemed necessary, the Group has translated the Code into applicable local languages, established a whistleblower function, appointed a Compliance Officer and is providing regular training for local management, employees and suppliers in countries where the risk is deemed to be higher.

Product Responsibility Aspect: Customer Health and Safety PR1 The Group is committed to offering products and services with a high regard for quality and safety. Continuous improvements are instrumental for all product categories, and products undergo safety assessments to ensure compliance towards safety regulations.
