Environmental Principles Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Assessment, policy and goals: DBPL is committed to prevent environmental pollution & continually improve the environment management system. DBPL recognizes that the delivery of its operations inevitably impact on the environment in a number of ways, for example, through the generation of waste through the production process and the use of energy for heating and lighting. Through a commitment to continuous environmental improvement, DBPL’s aim is to ensure that our business operation is undertaken in such a manner as to have minimum impact on the environment. Specifically, DBPL strives to minimize environmental aspects by decreasing wastes, using optimum energy, using non-hazardous chemicals instead of hazardous chemicals, produce eco-friendly products that can be recycled and reused, seek continuous improvement in the design and implementation of products and processes, to eliminate or minimize probable health hazards, incident risks and minimize environmental aspects by using new technologies. The basic raw material of DBPL is Polypropylene which is a polyolefin thermoplastic. Generally, polyolefin are recyclable through a re-extrusion and granulation process. Furthermore, DBPL also remains prepared for emergencies and act promptly to eliminate their resulting impacts. Implementation: DBPL undertook various measures to achieve reductions in waste management. One such measure is proper segregation of waste products. Waste management principles require separate storage and consequent disposal of waste material at every step of the production process. An intensive training program has been accustomed to make the employees aware of waste management principles. Regular monitoring also undertaken to confirm that employees are not deviating from established rules and regulations. Currently, wastage materials are only placed in designated waste containers, which are collected at a designated frequency and stored in a separate warehouse. Later, this waste is recycled through an external recycler. Furthermore, to promote energy efficiency, DBPL has installed solar panels on its roofing, which is used for internal heating. DBPL has also arranged for several Energy audits which attempted to identify scopes for reducing energy consumption without compromising working environment comfort and safety. Based on the feedback of the energy audit, DBPL implemented specific steps, such as converting older T12 fluorescent fixtures to high efficiency T5 or T8 fixtures, daylight harvesting etc. DBPL is also currently evaluating the possibility of installing water absorption chillers that shall reduce energy requirements for air conditioning significantly. To effectively control the use of hazardous substances, DBPL firstly identifies all hazardous substances that are required for the production process. An initial evaluation is done to ascertain whether any of these substances can be replaced with less harmful alternatives. Consequently, attempts are made to mitigate the risks of contamination and exposure through these hazardous materials by implementing precautionary measures such as secondary containers, encased and designated storage, minimizing storage of hazardous chemicals that are susceptible to human contact etc. Measurement of Outcomes: Ø Certificate of ISO 14001:2004 for Environment Management System. Ø List of Environmental aspect-impact and control the significant impact. Ø Achievement of the objectives of Environment management system. Ø NOC from the Environment department of Bangladesh. Ø Periodic internal & External Audit. Already total 03 nos. of Internal & 05 nos. of External audit conducted till to date.

Ø DBPL has instituted a waste recycling project at an investment of USD 600,000 to ensure safe, sustainable and commercially-viable recycling of plastic waste. The project shall not only recycle the plastic waste generated by DBPL, but also invigorate others to follow suit by acting as a pilot project. This project is also subsidized by DEG (German Development Finance).
