Global Compact United Nations Communication on Progress Business Language Skills Period from May 2015 to May 2016 Statement of continued support by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) BLS’s CEO makes a formal commitment to Global Compact principles every year in her note to shareholders. Dear Shareholders This year we have continued to advance the principles of Global Compact both within the company and throughout our customer and supplier base. Since joining in 2004, we have continually upheld the ten principles of Global Compact with regards to human rights, labor standards, protection of environment and anti-corruption, promoted and supported those principles within our company and have striven to extend them to our sister companies, BLS formation and BLS Group. This commitment is included in our website on the home page. We are today happy to inform our shareholders that the panel of suppliers we use continue to correspond to the principles we uphold and that in our commercial relationships with our customers, support for Global Compact is included in all our framework agreements. Since the introduction last year of our Ethical Charter – code of Conduct, we are happy to announce that all our staff are committed to applying its principles and that our charter is communicated to our partners and customers on a regular basis. This year our efforts have been directed towards internal Quality Action Plans to ensure that the services we provide are an accurate reflection of our principles and those of Global Compact on a wider scale and to promoting the role of women in leadership. As always practical actions taken by our group in the last year are summarized in our Communication on Progress and periodically in our internal newsletters to staff.

This information is also communicated to the Trade Unions, the Work inspectors and to the shop floor stewards. At BLS we make every effort to ensure equal opportunities for our staff (to training, to promotion opportunities, to access to the management for example) and to ensure a positive, respectful environment for all. We reassert our commitment to the respect of human rights principles and labour law in the contracts we sign with our customers. We also ensure that our suppliers respect human rights principles and respect the French laws and practices. We respond favorably to surveys on our respect of human rights carried out by autonomous organizations. Implementation With the support of the workers’ representatives in BLS, we have an ongoing suggestion box to raise awareness of these issues and to anonymously bring to management’s attention any violation of Human Rights. We publicize on our noticeboard our commitment to equality of treatment and respect for our staff and our commitment to ensuring that no form of harassment occurs in BLS. We specifically include in our work contracts an article referring to our commitment to equality of treatment of every member of our personnel within our organization. These principles and rules of conduct were set down in our Ethical Charter – Code of Conduct published last year. In addition we ask our customers to provide us with their own internal Code of Conduct or Supplier Code so as to raise their awareness and to inform our staff of behavior and rules to be respected.

The results and appreciations were communicated to the workers’ representative body. Globally very satisfactory, we have applied improvements in terms of ergonomics in the company to optimize working conditions.

This document explains BLS’s commitment to protecting the environment, preventing and managing environmental risks. BLS ensures sustainability in the management of all its activities and is committed to minimize its impact on the environment such as promoting car sharing and preference for public transport. Implementation Some concrete examples of the implementation of our ecological charter are : • the decision to work with suppliers that are committed to respecting the environment and with a sustainable development. • the choice of a photocopier / printer certified “imprimvert”, the French ecological label” with standby functions to economize energy and renewed recycling efforts such as : o the choice to order recycled paper o recycling printed paper as internal notebooks • the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies – promotion of e-learning tools and remote conferencing internally. A formal offer for viseoconfering now completes our training solutions offer. • raising awareness among suppliers by asking them for environmental data on their products. • to favour “soft copies” of training materials (podcasts, IT versions of training packs) over “hard copies” such as paper training manuals and burning CDs. This option has been actively promoted for the last 3 years in our response for calls for tender and several companies have seized this more cost effective and environmentally friendly option.
