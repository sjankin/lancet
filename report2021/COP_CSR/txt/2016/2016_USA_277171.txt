UN GLOBAL COMPACT Communications on Progress October 2016 STATEMENT FROM THE CEO COMMITMENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT SUPPORT FOR THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT TEN PRINCIPLES WE Communications (WE) reaffirms its support of the company’s participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) initiative and the company’s commitment to responsible, sustainable business practices, contributing economically and socially to society while helping conserve natural resources and positively contributing to the quality of life of our employees and communities. WE has shown support and made incremental progress on its commitments to key initiatives, including educating and training employees on human-rights issues in the workplace and encouraging and supporting the positive impact of our professionals through our volunteer and pro bono programs, since issuing the first Communication On Progress (COP) in 2011. The company’s core values — imagination, courage, collaboration, purpose, excellence — are woven into the fabric of the company and align with the UNGC principles. Within our influence, we remain committed to adhering to and advancing the Global Compact Ten Principles with respect to human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, for the long term. Melissa Waggener Zorkin CEO, President WE Communications | 2 HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE 1 BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS; AND PRINCIPLE 2 MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES Human rights take the form of nondiscrimination personnel practices that promote equal opportunities and diversity, and a harassment-free workplace environment at WE. The company remains committed to creating and maintaining a safe, clean and healthy work environment, providing professional development opportunities to improve employability and rewarding employment benefits to full-time and part-time staff to support health, wellness and quality of life for employees. The company tracks employee engagement, rates of injury and absenteeism, and the number of work-related injuries and fatalities. The company has not registered any fatalities or injuries in the company’s history. The company also protects and supports human rights through financial contributions, employee volunteering, community relations, and pro bono services with the goal of helping develop and sustain communities in partnership with nongovernmental organizations, especially those focused on education and economic empowerment. WE makes monetary and time-based donations to charitable organizations around the globe. WE continues to support the IMPACT 2030, a business-led coalition that is committed to mobilizing corporate volunteers to directly contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the year 2030. The company promotes the initiative and is committed to mobilizing employees to impact these three SDGs: No Poverty (SDG1), Good Health (SDG3), and Quality Education (SDG4). WE employees are eligible to take up to 16 paid hours per year to volunteer for nonprofit organizations of their choosing. In 2015–2016, 735 employees spent almost 4,000 hours volunteering for causes that matter most to them. Employees use their volunteer hours via WE-facilitated team events and campaigns or individually via skilled or general service. Mapping employee volunteering to the SDGs, in 2014–2015, 30 percent of initiatives supported education-focused nonprofits (SDG4), 30 percent supported economic empowerment/anti-poverty programs (SDG1), and 40 percent supported health and wellness projects (SDG3). Annually the company applies its strategic business insight/expertise to collaborate with NGOs on pro bono initiatives that address global and local issues. This translates into more empowered and healthier individuals, more educated children, and stronger economic opportunity. LABOR PRINCIPLE 3 BUSINESSES SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING; PRINCIPLE 4 THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY LABOUR | 3 PRINCIPLE 5 THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOR; AND PRINCIPLE 6 THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT TO EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION. At WE, we believe in the importance of working and living according to strong ethical values. WE supports the right of employees to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining in adherence with local laws. WE’s business expansion strategy and process involves assessing local and national laws and norms to ensure compliance to, adherence to, and support of local cultures and labor laws. Child labor and forced, compulsory labor issues are not material risks to our business, and both are unacceptable to the company. All WE employees are employed of their own free will; contracts state the terms and conditions pertaining to employment and provide for the parties’ rights to terminate the employment relationship (general procedures associated with departures are posted on the corporate intranet site). WE’s code of conduct incorporates references to key labor issues identified by the UNGC, including discrimination. Every employee is required to acknowledge the code to certify their understanding and their commitment to comply with it. Attracting and retaining a diverse and engaging global workplace is critical to our business. We commit to creating a diverse workplace where differing perspectives, experiences, lifestyles and cultures are embraced and respected, the differences among individuals are valued, and diversity within our workforce is welcomed. We support and obey laws that prohibit discrimination everywhere we do business and are committed to ensuring opportunities for all employees to develop their abilities and contribute to WE’s success. WE has an equal opportunity hiring and recruiting policy to support the company’s commitment to attracting and retaining a diverse community of employees. WE tracks the ethnic and gender diversity of its employees. The company does not — and legally it cannot — require its employees to disclose their ethnicity, but the nondisclosed missing data is estimated by a human resources representative as required by U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reporting guidelines, and for reporting purposes globally. Currently, 87 percent of WE’s U.S. diversity data is self-reported, and the remaining 13 percent is estimated. Globally, 20 percent is estimated. In 2016, WE’s employee population was made up as follows:  Global Gender Diversity: 71 percent women | 29 percent men  Global Ethnic Diversity: 32 percent nonwhite | 68 percent white  U.S. Ethnic Diversity: 17 percent nonwhite | 83 percent white THE ENVIRONMENT PRINCIPLE 7 BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES; PRINCIPLE 8 UNDERTAKE INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY; AND | 4 PRINCIPLE 9 ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES. WE continues to integrate sustainable business practices into decisions about our operations, technology investments, travel options, partners and more. Since 2008, WE has measured its annual carbon footprint with the goal of identifying and tracking material aspects of its business and ways to continually reduce or minimize its impact on the environment and increase cost efficiencies. In 2015–2016, WE achieved a 49 percent reduction in its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its 2008 baseline. Total GHG emissions were 2,169 metric tons of CO2 equivalents in 2015–2016, which equates to an average of 3.2 metric tons per employee (versus 4.7 metric tons per employee in 2014). Achieving revenue goals while decreasing emissions continues to be a focus for WE, in light of the company’s heavy reliance on travel to deliver services. This is an area that WE continues to monitor and seek costeffective, sustainable and alternate solutions for that would have a substantial impact on its environmental record while supporting the company’s positive bottom-line performance. For example, the company offers a work-from-home policy to maximize employee productivity. The company’s leased offices and facilities are designed based on an eight-point metric to measure the general sustainability practices of our offices worldwide, to make decisions, select vendors and balance costs. ANTI-CORRUPTION PRINCIPLE 10 BUSINESSES SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND BRIBERY. WE is committed to working against corruption in all its forms, including bribery and extortion, and is committed to being in compliance with all relevant laws in the countries where it operates. The company has set clear standards and policies that employees are required to acknowledge and comply with, including the company’s code of conduct. This is very important as a professional services company where our employees have an active role in facilitating discussions and disseminating information between a wide variety of stakeholders on behalf of clients, including but not limited to media, bloggers, customers and nongovernmental organizations. Integrity drives decisions, shapes the services that the company provides and the quality of the work, and is key to the relationships that WE and its employees maintain. Since the last COP, there have not been any recorded incidents of corruption involving WE employees, clients or stakeholder relationships; therefore, no actions were necessary. The company continues to pride itself on a clean record. WE is equipped to respond if corruption, including extortion and bribery, occurs. The company has a disciplinary procedure in place should such a situation arise. Information about the handling and process of dealing with anti-corruption matters are addressed in the employee handbook and would be managed under the guidance of human resource business partners, who are assigned to each business group. | 5 ABOUT THIS REPORT The COP 2015–2016 provides brief highlights of actions that WE is taking on a global basis to address UNGC principles on human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption.
