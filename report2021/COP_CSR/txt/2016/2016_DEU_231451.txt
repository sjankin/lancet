We remain committed to promoting all ten principles both for ourselves as a company but also through the innovations we deliver for our customers. Technology trends such as hyperconnectivity, cloud computing, and Big Data go hand-in-hand with social and business trends. Rapid urbanization, the sharing economy, enormous demographic change, and resource scarcity require that leaders of tomorrow adapt to a world of ever-growing change. To remain competitive – and create a sustainable competitive advantage – businesses today must become sustainable digital businesses. Our enduring vision as a company is to help the world run better and improve people’s lives. We start with ourselves as we seek to minimize our own environmental footprint and positively impact the communities in which we work. Since 2014, we have continued to use 100% renewable energy in all of our data centers and facilities and see this as one of our most significant actions to date to make our operations more sustainable. And, our 81% employee engagement index score is at its highest mark in ten years. Our commitment to achieving sustainable success is further demonstrated in our Integrated Report 2015, where we integrated our sustainability and financial reporting for the fourth time and which also contains our communications on progress towards the UN Global Compact. SAP will continue to support the UN Global Compact and seek to integrate its principles as fully as possible into our business operations and solutions.
