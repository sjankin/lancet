Financial Statements����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������90 Torre Reforma Latino, Mexico City 5 Torre Caballito, Mexico City 6 LETTER FROM THE CEO Dear investors, It is a great pleasure to share with you yet another successful year. FUNO continues leading the real estate market in Mexico through constant innovation founded in our broad expertise in all the segments in which we operate real estate. For example, as a result of this innovation, and continuing with our growth focus, this year we created HELIOS, our real estate development vehicle. We have identified several development opportunities in the Mexican market that, given their specific conditions; particularly the need to devote substantial amounts of capital to large-scale, mixed use projects, led us to create HELIOS. It is the first vehicle of its kind whose target is to ensure capital to seize future growth opportunities through large-scale developments, while we minimize the development risk and avoid substantial cash flow dilution for FUNO’s investors. I firmly believe that this is the best news for FUNO since its IPO. Additionally, we continue to execute our growth strategy in order to keep generating added value through acquisitions. During 2015, FUNO closed a series of acquisitions of first-class real estate portfolios, featuring iconic and unique office buildings on key locations of Mexico City, strategic shopping centers in areas with high traffic levels and economic dynamism; but above all, with high profitability and efficiency potential when operated on FUNO’s platform. With these acquisitions we strengthen our portfolio and grow in a profitable manner, creating sustainable value for our shareholders. Furthermore, additional to our acquisitions strategy and the development growth opportunities for which we created HELIOS, there is the development of new properties of lesser scale, which contribute to maintain a young real estate portfolio. In 2015 we concluded the development of three industrial parks in Mexico City’s Metropolitan Area, while continued with the final stages development of four office buildings and three shopping centers. We expect to conclude these developments shortly. In line with our strategy and business model, during 2015 we acquired the Mitikah development in Mexico City. This project, given its specifications and scale, fits ideally into HELIOS’ profile, providing us with a unique opportunity to develop what we consider the best and most important real estate project in Latin America. Mitikah is a mixed-use, large-scale project, designed by renowned architects such as Cesar Pelli and Sordo Madaleno; that represents a paradigm shift in the southern part of Mexico 7 City. This development will have more than 450,000 sqm of GLA including office buildings, a fashion mall, a business class hotel and an apartment complex for sale. All this real estate innovation, acquisitions and development process has taken us to be the largest FIBRA in Mexico and one of the largest REITs worldwide. Our scale within our country allows us to offer the best real estate solutions to all our tenants. We have achieved all our objectives while we focus on improving the operation of our portfolio. I want to highlight that we have maintained our occupancy levels at our target of within 1% of 95% for 20 quarters in a row, while our net operating income margins continue to be stable above 80%. To maintain these ambitious metrics while growing rapidly and continuously has represented a great and complex challenge, specially given FUNO’s current size and scale. This has been achieved through the excellent performance of the professionals that integrate our extraordinary management team, which I am proud of leading, and that are indeed the best group of executives that any company could have at the same time. We continue to be optimistic and we are convinced to continue investing in Mexico. Our sector is still very fragmented and there are still several acquisition and development opportunities. We have also identified several re-development and reconversion opportunities within some of our existing properties as a way to keep adding sustainable value to our portfolio; and we are in the process of tackling these opportunities. We will keep focused in growing with long-term, value-added opportunities, increasing our shareholder value and building a leading real estate company globally. Value creation relies on acquiring, developing and operating the best portfolio of properties by their locations and features. This leads to the appreciation of the real estate over time and to the creation of sustainable value. FUNO is real estate driven, not cap-rate-arbitrage focused. 8 Our main goal is very clear and our objective has not changed; we remain on our way to fulfill the goals we set since the very beginning: to take this enterprise to be a world-class company. Our commitment with tenants, investors, and associates is not to build a large company, but a great company. Sincerely, Andre El-Mann Chief Executive Officer, FUNO San Martin Obispo 9 1 WHO IS FUNO?

FUNO has grown significantly during almost 5 years, while maintaining occupancy levels and excellent operating and financial metrics, an especially challenging task given the size and scale that FUNO has gained. FUNO has the best executives for each of its different areas. FUNO’s administrative platform has three main pillars: the team, the processes, and the technology. During 2014, FUNO was able to successfully integrate its platform, enhancing significantly FUNO’s administrative capabilities. All of this is supported by a state-ofthe-art Oracle system and other high-tech platforms. Thanks to that, FUNO has today the ability to considerable grow the size of its portfolio with a modest increase in human resources. On the other hand, we operate a matrix-style management structure and manage our real assets by exception; which enables us to channel resources exactly where they are needed, maximizing efficiency. FUNO has a long-term, result-oriented compensation scheme, with career plans based on meritocracy and continuous training.

FUNO’s growth model has several growth sources, both organic and inorganic. Inorganic sources of growth: • Acquisitions of properties and real estate portfolios from third parties FUNO is constantly analyzing acquisition opportunities of both stabilized assets and potential developments through a methodology than ensures value creation, maximizing profitability and creating synergies within FUNO’s operating platform. • Contribution of assets from the group of Founders The Founders of FUNO are the most experienced real estate group in Mexico. This ensures that all the real estate that is contributed to FUNO is of high-quality, in good locations and that comply with the highest industry standards worldwide. Additionally, FUNO has a Right-of-First-Refusal on all acquisitions and sale transactions of the group of founders (please refer to the Conflict of Interest Mitigation Mechanism in our webpage www.fibrauno.mx). Organic sources of growth: • Developments Developments are a very important source of growth for FUNO. The broad experience of the management team and the long-term relationships that the group of Founders has with tenants and contacts with key industry suppliers ensure that FUNO has a robust development platform, and that such developments are executed in a timely and effective manner. • Redevelopments and reconversions Redevelopments and reconversions are an attractive source of growth and improvement for FUNO. The size, diversification and locations of our portfolio presents us with these opportunities constantly, and are supported by the natural growth of urban areas and the cycle of the real estate business. • Tenant expansions FUNO is committed especially with its tenants. Long-term relationships are key to FUNO’s growth strategy since it has become the real estate solution for many of them in all the segments which FUNO operates. Our tenants’ growth means growth for FUNO. 34 EFFICIENT OPERATION FUNO’s operation is based on the following pillars: • Diversification Diversification is a core component to FUNO’s strategy. Our portfolio is diversified by segments, geographies, tenants and industries, with a healthy balance of currencies (Mexican Pesos and U.S. Dollars). Diversification contributes to mitigate risks associated to the business cycle and to generate growth opportunities within markets with diverse economic dynamics. • High occupancy levels To have high occupancy levels is essential to operate our portfolio. FUNO has been able to maintain high occupancy levels on its properties despite the tremendous growth it has experienced. This is achieved by having high-quality assets on key locations and with competitive rents in markets where FUNO operates. • Prudent use of leverage Debt is a strategic component for our business. FUNO has a policy of prudent use of leverage. FUNO’s historic leverage profile has been relatively low. We seek to have leverage at around 35% of the value of our assets. FUNO has accessed the public debt markets under attractive conditions through a healthy balance among currencies, rates and terms, which translates in enhanced value for our investors.

This increase is mainly due to the income from the acquisitions of the Florida, Oregon, Utah, Kansas, Buffalo, Indiana, CuautiPark II and Alaska; additionally, there were several increases in lease renovations during the year, some increases on variable portions in some leases, and the exchange rate depreciation of the Mexican Peso in those USD-denominated contracts. Furthermore, we added over 200,000 sqm of GLA that were under development and became operational during 2015, which also contributed to additional revenue. Comercial 20 % Industrial Offices Oficinas Rental Revenue Breakdown Retail by Segment 24% Industrial 56 % Ingresos por segmento Área por segmento Cuautipark II, State of Mexico 38 • Net Operating Income (NOI) FUNO posted an increase of $2,241 million Pesos of NOI to reach $8,645 million Pesos, an increase of 35.0% compared to 2014, and with a healthy margin of 80.6%. This increase is in line with that of revenues. • Funds from Operations (FFO) FUNO’s FFO totaled $5,763 million Pesos in 2015, an increase of $1,780 million Pesos compared to 2014, which represents a growth of 44.7%, with a margin over total revenue of 59.3%, which is line with historic figures. This increase is mainly due to an increase in revenues. FFO/CBFI increased 12.8%, which is especially significant given that inflation in 2015 was on historic-low figures. • Interest Expense FUNO’s net interest expense increased $680 million Pesos in 2015 to total $2,269 million Pesos, an increase of 42.9% with respect to the previous year. This increase is explained by (i) the issuance of a 10-year bond for $300 million U.S. Dollars, (ii) a two-tranche issuance of bonds in Pesos: re-opening of FUNO13 for $2,500 million, and the issuance of a 10.5-year bond for $7,500 million, (iii) a $2,000 million Pesos line of credit with Banco Inbursa, and (iv) the exchange rate depreciation of the Mexican Peso on the USD-denominated portion of our debt. 39 FUNO IN 2015 • Debt FUNO’s total debt at the end of 2015 increased 51.3% compared to 2014. This increase is mainly due to the bond issuances for approximately $15,000 million Pesos, and to the line of credit with Banco Inbursa for $2,000 million Pesos. Moreover, there were debt payments made to GE, MetLife, and Banamex. The exchange rate depreciation of the Mexican Peso, which increased from 14.7348 to 17.3398 Pesos per U.S. Dollar, and an increase of approximately $167 million Dollars also contributed to this increase. Generally, during 2015 we improved significantly the profile of our debt; we extended the average term, improved the cost, and replaced bank loans with market debt under better conditions. 2014 2015 Var % '14 vs '15 Short-term debt 1,791.9 10,123.6 465.0% Long-term debt 34,128.7 44,209.4 29.5% Total debt 35,920.6 54,333.0 51.3% Figures in million Pesos MXN Floating rate Unsecured 22% 21% USD Fixed rate Secured 45% 55% 79% 78% Currency Rate Collateral FUNO is Investment Grade rated; on the international scale, FUNO’s bonds have a Baa2 rating from Moody’s, and BBB rating by Fitch, both with stable outlook.

FUNO has always been the most innovative company in all aspects in the sector. With HELIOS, FUNO is the very first FIBRA or REIT to create an external vehicle whose purpose is to develop large-scale, mixed-use, long-term real estate projects. HELIOS uses resources provided by Mexican institutional investors, while FUNO co-invests in those projects and manages the vehicle. FUNO will contribute projects or land, and HELIOS will provide the cash needed to fund the development. Through this structure, FUNO will enhance its potential return. FUNO managed to structure and list this vehicle in a 6-month period, a record time for this type of vehicles.

We firmly believe in adhering to the highest ethical business standards in the manner in which we conduct our business. (please refer to our Code of Ethics in our website: www.fibrauno.mx). Technical Committee Our Technical Committee is the equivalent of a Board of Directors in a corporation. Currently, our Technical Committee is integrated by 12 members, of which 4 are independent; and we are currently searching for a fifth independent member. In FUNO we understand that there is a growing trend towards Boards and Committees that are 100% independent in large-cap, world-class enterprises. However, we believe that the interests of all of FUNO’s stakeholders are best served by having a combination of independent members and non-independent but seasoned real estate experts. This is particularly true given the budding nature of the Real Estate market in Mexico. The expertise of our non-independent Technical Committee members is one of the most important competitive advantages of our Company. Corporativo Opcion Santa Fe II, Mexico City 54 Nonetheless, we are conscious that in absolutely fair and transparent transactions, conflicts of interest may arise; therefore, we created a mechanism to ethically and openly deal with potential conflicts of interest (please refer to the Conflict of Interest Resolution Mechanism section in our website: www.fibrauno.mx).

Therefore, in line with the Executive Compensation Plan guidelines, the goals resulted in a yearly payout of 76% of the 2015 Plan, plus 36.1% resulting from the catch-up in FFO/CBFI due to its growth well in excess of the 2015 goal of 500 bps over inflation. This resulted in a total issuance of 18,261,112 CBFIs for 2015. City Center Merida, Yucatan 62 FUNO IN CAPITAL MARKETS FIBRAs, by their nature and cycle, are frequent issuers on capital markets. FUNO has raised more than Ps. 105,000 million from such markets, through four equity offerings and three debt issuances. The highquality of our assets and FUNO’s management fulfillment of commitments have contributed significantly to FUNO’s broad access to these markets. Amount Date Type of Offering Market (Ps.

In terms of debt, FUNO was the first in entering public debt markets, both local and international, issuing 10 and 30-year bonds, an unprecedented development for Mexican corporates debuting in debt markets. ® 2014 Follow-On Equity Deal of the Year Ps. $32.8 billion “The largest ever Latin American real estate equity sale.” 2014 Latin America Bond Us. $1.0 billion “FUNO’s US$1bn dual-tranche offering opened yet another funding door for Mexican real estate investment trusts in 2014, marking a number of firsts for the evolving asset class and for the region as a whole.” 63 6 INTRODUCTION Since its early stages, FUNO positioned itself as the market leader for Real Estate in Mexico, thereafter, contributing to the country´s development and enhancing the quality of life for many Mexicans who benefit directly or indirectly from FUNO´s operations.

These practices strengthen our performance and decision making process, while minimizing risks. For further information, on the composition, mandates and activities of such bodies, please refer to the Corporate Governance section above or visit our website. Business Ethics We adhere to just, ethical and transparent business practices, as well as to all applicable laws and regulations, moreover we target bribery and extortion within our operations. We do not in the name of FUNO or personally, participate, order, authorize, promise, conspire, induce nor assist, someone practicing corruption; either directly or by means of a third party. We do not in the name of FUNO or personally, give, accept nor compromise, any gifts, advantageous conditions, salaries, trips, commissions or any other way of compensation that influences business decisions. We do not grant advantages nor inadequate benefits of any type, or practice extortion or bribery within our relationship towards tenants, suppliers, financial institutions, contractors, business, authorities or any other related party with whom we operate. Bribery of any type, to induce an action or the lack of one in a government official, besides being illegal under national law, is a violation of FUNO's values and compromises; hence it is a fundamental disposition that we obey. The violation of our ethical principles may be the cause for terminating any professional contract and could result in civil or penal sanctions for those involved. . 73 SUSTAINABILITY Competitive practices and behavior Our success was built upon the premise of treating our partners and clients in an honest, equal and fair manner. At FUNO, we vigorously compete, observing all applicable laws and regulations; our Code of Ethics establishes amongst other things: • We do not participate in any agreement that pretends to limit the free movement of market forces in which we operate and we will not use improper means to improve our competitive position in such markets. • All employees who interact with competitors, will upkeep a professional attitude, in accordance with FUNO´s values and principles. • We avoid making statements or comments about our competitors, however, when it is the case, we do so in a just and objective manner. As a result of our position towards fair play, FUNO has not been the object of any legal action for monopolistic practices nor for anticompetitive behavior. Moreover, we have not been fined, nor received any other action derived from breaching the law, or other anti-competitive regulations. San Martin Obispo Park, State of Mexico 74 Risk management Through internal supervision bodies, we constantly review possible risks, that may affect our operations. Amongst the main ones that we have identified are: OVER LEVERAGE NATURAL DISASTERS AND METHEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA MAY AFFECT OUR ASSETS CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LEGISLATION AND PUBLIC POLICIES MONEY LOSES DUE TO A POOR SUPPLIER SELECTION OR BAD PRACTICES IN OUR “OTHER INCOMES” SECTOR RELIANCE ON NATIONAL ECONOMY; WHICH IN A SLUGGISH ECONOMIC SCENARIO MAY REDUCE OUR NUMBER OF CONTRACTS, RENOVATIONS AND FEE COLLECTION Visit our website for a comprehensive list of our identified risks and opportunities. 75 SUSTAINABILITY At FUNO, we have designed action plans and response plans to the above mentioned risks and many others we identified. It is also important to note, that our culture and the way we operate are designed to prevent, manage and mitigate risks. From our open door policy to the way our offices are structured; they are all a system that promotes immediate communication amongst different departments and team work in case of emergencies. Operational risks are managed in a cross-cutting way; depending on the property and the activity. In order to ensure a holistic risk assessment, multidisciplinary teams identify, evaluate and mitigate such risks. These teams are integrated by people from all hierarchical levels and whenever necessary, they are complemented with the operational, technical experience and knowledge of different departments, such as: maintenance, architecture and design, acquisitions, finance, law, marketing, tenant coordination, administration, fee collection, human resources amongst other specialists that are invited, depending on the case. Additionally, we implemented operational manuals that are revised and updated regularly, in which we document the most recurring risks and operational processes; as well as the ways in which they must be tackled.

SUSTAINABLE CITIES & COMMUNITIES At FUNO, we are committed with our employees, their interests and needs; correspondingly we try to maintain good relationships with the neighboring communities to our properties and, to collaborate with institutions and NGO´s that create social value. 79 SUSTAINABILITY FUNO contributes to community development through providing access to markets and services; not only commercial, but financial, recreational, and cultural. Similarly, since its early stages, FUNO is an innovative concept, breeding opportunities for small investors to access the stock market and the real estate business. Thus, contributing to the personal, social, urban and community development through new opportunities. We also understand the social responsibility that comes inherent to our business, therefore we cautiously select the properties in which we invest; with the intention to improve the economic, social and cultural prospects the area has to offer. In new developments, we strive to contribute positively through their architecture and design; focusing on avoiding the creation of future problems such as: traffic jams, communication and transport issues, safety matters, etc. We strive to comply with the highest construction and infrastructure standards even in the supply chain. . “FUNO´s main contribution to Mexico, has been the development and institutionalization of the Real Estate industry. Before, it was a business for small families or groups, rarely did they acquired debt or leverage for developments. We opened up the real estate market to pension funds, we brought to Mexico more than 100,000 million pesos that have been invested on infrastructure. With it, we create jobs, we develop communities, we buy land and build better infrastructure for the country”. Gonzalo Robina. Deputy CEO 80 Lermapark, State of Mexico Human Rights FUNO is committed to operate under ethical and responsible standards. We respect and support all international principles that aim to protect Human Rights. We recognize that governments are the responsible entity to protect and guarantee Human Rights to its citizens. However, FUNO assumes its compromise to promote respect for all Human Rights within our operations and within our possibilities. Our policy and culture is based on the fundamental respect for Human Rights. • In accordance to Mexican laws, we respect the right of maintaining the privacy of information and data. • In our activities, we reject all kinds of slavery, child labor and forced labor. • We recognize the right to collective bargaining and freedom of association. • We resist all employment and occupational discriminatory practices. • We impugn any kind of sexual abuse or sexual harassment. FUNO, is committed to the development of equitable and respectful communities. We strive to provide dignified work to our employees, and we avoid distinctions based on sex, race, sexual preference, ethnicity, age, etc. Every hiring, raise or upgrading decision is based exclusively on competences, skills and work performance. 81 SUSTAINABILITY Health and Safety At FUNO, we recognize our duty to provide our employees, tenants, guests and all others who visit our estates with a healthy and safe environment. Hence we not only comply with all applicable regulation, but we also strive to go further, acquiring state of the art safety equipment and to maintain them in optimal conditions; additionally, we empower our teams with training, the right safety equipment and safety procedures. These are some of the measures we take towards guaranteeing our best response in case of emergencies In order to safeguard our guests, we have several prevention and emergency response protocols set in place, these protocols are applicable to all our estates. Some of the main activities we perform are: • Emergency Response Protocols in all our shopping malls and mix use estates in case of: · Medical emergencies · Natural disasters · Meteorological phenomena · Fire · Public safety issues • Drill performance • Evacuation Plans • Human Rights • Trained Security Personnel • Insurance for: employees, estates, third parties, etc. The protocols we have set in place, secure an accurate response to most crises that may occur; through our protocols, we have a risk identification phase after which we can deploy a precise handling strategy. 82 METEROLOGICAL LOST CHILD PHENOMENA THEFT THREATS RISK IDENTIFICATION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROTOCOL DISTURBANCE VIOLENCE AUTHORITIES COMMUNICATION MEDIA CLIENTS GUESTS 83 SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Maximize resource efficiency in order to reduce our consumption, minimize our waste, abate our emissions and mitigate our impacts on the natural environment, is a goal we keep since our early stages. We recognize the impacts of our activities on the environment, on the well-being and the quality of life of the communities we work with. Consequently, our new developments go all-out to be eco-efficient, mainly regarding water and electricity consumption. Our environmental strategy targets the following: 1. Increase our NOI, through sustainable buildings 2. Reduce our operational and maintenance costs 3. Improve tenant well-being 4. Continue to strengthen FUNOs reputation 84 Responsible operation & consumption We know being efficient at resource consumption, is not only a responsibility with present and future generations, but it´s also an operational and economical strategy. Part of our environmental commitment, is to offer environmentally friendly services and products. Hence, FUNO, owns, operates and develops high performance buildings that aim to improve city resilience, our star assets on these criteria are: • Torre Mayor – Leed Gold since 2013 • Torre Diana – Pre-certified Leed Gold in 2015 • Torre Reforma Latino – Pre-Certified Leed Silver 2013 Our shopping malls, upkeep high standards for sustainable consumption not only for us, but also for our tenants. For example, we request the use of non-toxic paints, and sometimes we ask for design optimization in order to reduce their energy consumption, while maximizing the use of natural light. When remodeling or performing other important modifications to our estates, we search for locally produced supplies and materials (approximately 80% of our materials, come from local sources). This measure is not only cost-effective, but also boosts local economies. Other criteria we have set for the purchasing of goods and services is their eco-efficiency; we are determined to implement technologies that not only reduce consumption, but also diminish the impact of our operations. We also have climatic criteria in our procurement process; such as durability, maintenance, resistance to natural phenomena, acidity, corrosiveness, humidity, etc. In portfolio or properties acquisitions, we have strict selection processes, which go beyond due diligence, in financial, fiscal, legal, architectural issues. We also audit, socio-environmental aspects, such as: • Land use and zoning • Environmental Impact Assessment (Authorized) • Generator and hazardous waste 85 SUSTAINABILITY • Management of hazardous wastes (certificate of appropriate management, issued by an authorized company to collect, transport and dispose them) • Water supply services • Water emission discharges • Environmental certificate for GHG emissions • The existence or absence of PCBs and asbestos • The existence or absence of environmental fines • The existence or absence of soil leakage or other types of pollution. • Traffic and mobility license • Others PIN POINT PROSPECT ESTATES DUE DILLIGENCE FINANCIAL OPERATION MANAGEMENT STABILIZATION ACQUISITION FOLLOW UP MAINTEINANCE COLLECTION 86 Availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Waste water treatment as well as water recycling on site, not only preserves a vital resource for our world, it also reduces operational and maintenance costs. Our strategy to ensure an efficient use of water, includes: • Monitor and measure in detail, our consumptions; we cannot improve what we do not measure. • Install individualized monitors, to measure the overall water consumption, and water consumption by tenant. • Leakage control. • Regulated flowmeters. • Night irrigation, to reduce evaporation. • Water emission analysis. • The majority of our shopping malls have water treatment plants; all treated water complies with regulatory standards and is constantly monitored and used for irrigation or sent back into the municipal sewage system. Biodiversity Mexico is a megadiverse country; therefore, we are all responsible for the conservation of its resources. At FUNO, we contribute through planting and foresting our green spaces with local and endemic flora. The introduction of native species, favors our properties by giving identity to public spaces and creating stronger bonds between the place and our guests. Meanwhile, operational costs also see positive impacts, since local plants tend to adapt better to local climatic conditions, requiring less inputs for their optimal conservation. As part of our efforts towards bio-cultural diversity, all the properties we directly operate and all of those which we own completely, are evaluated on their impact towards biodiversity, every time a permit renovation or modification is required for expansion projects or any other relevant infrastructure alteration. 87 SUSTAINABILITY Affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Currently, four shopping malls have a collaboration agreement with automotive companies to install electric car charging stations. The distribution of such stations is: 3 in Mexico City and 1 in Guadalajara. We are working on expanding this network. ECONOMIC DIMENSION Inherently our business contributes to growth and development in Mexico. Our shopping malls, in many ways perform as local economic drivers through which we attract investment, income, employment and development at large. FUNO closely collaborates with the largest enterprises, supermarkets, cinemas, clothing stores, etc. As a result of this relationship, we have been able to summon them to become part of new developments in isolated communities; with it, FUNO transforms communities at large. Value Chain Our supply chain is perhaps one of the most significant operational variables that modifies our operational costs. Therefore, we have implemented a centralized purchasing system, through which we can minimize risks and optimize costs by creating synergies. We believe in win-win business deals; as such, we work closely with our main suppliers to create value for Mexico. As a result of such efforts, in June 4th, 2015 we signed a General Agreement with Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), our only electricity supplier. With it, we were able to consolidate all our electricity payments from our entire portfolio; while also allowing CFE to have better control and single on time payments for its services. We believe this synergy will bring along greater innovations and energy efficiency in the short term. Another success case, is where we endeavor to strengthen our work with strategic partners. Such is the case of SONNE Energeticos, with whom we collaborate in 4 shopping malls in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey. 88 SONNE is an enterprise dedicated to the collection of waste vegetable oils and animal fats; this waste is transformed into bioenergetics or used in the chemical industry, instead of polluting sewage waters. For this purpose, we have recommended a synergy amongst tenants, guests and the supplier; their containers have been installed inside our tenant’s shops on every fast-food court. This project resulted in: • Consolidating our compromise to the natural environment and backing environmentally friendly innovations. • Minimizing pollution in sewage waters. • Additional income for our tenants is created, which in return, increases their commercial viability while renting our properties. Chemical Industry Biodiesel Vegetable Shopping AVU Collector Transportation Oil Malls FUNO´s main economic contribution to communities is through its supply chain; hence we always focus in finding no only the best price, but also the quality FUNO offers to tenants and guests.

The significant accounting polices follow by FUNO are: d. Business combinations • Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Trust, liabilities incurred by the Trust to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Trust in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in statements of comprehensive income as incurred. • At the acquisition date, all the identifiable assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value. e. Financial instruments • Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. • Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability (other than financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial asset or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets 115 or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in income. • Subsequent measurement of financial instruments depends on the accounting category in which they are classified. Detail of the categories of financial instruments can be found in Note 12 and the accounting treatment for each category of financial instruments can be found in the accounting policies described below. Cash • Cash consists mainly of bank deposits in checking accounts. Cash is stated at nominal value. Restricted cash • Restricted cash consists of cash in the custody in various trusts. Its use is restricted to the payment of the current debt service and interest under the loan agreement with Banco Nacional de Mexico, S. A. Institucion de Banca Multiple, Grupo Financiero Banamex (“Banamex”) and Blackstone (formerly “GE Real Estate Mexico”). Once payments are settled, funds remaining in these accounts will be released and may be used for the operation of FUNO. Financial assets at FVTP (Fair Value through Profit or Loss) • Financial assets are classified as FVTPL when the financial asset is either held for trading or it is designated as FVTPL. • A financial asset is classified as held for trading if: –– It has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or –– On initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or –– It is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. • A financial asset other than a financial asset held for trading may be designated as of FVTPL upon initial recognition if: –– Such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or –– The financial asset forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or –– It forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 permits the entire combined contract to be designated as of FVTPL. • Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the other income (expense), net, line item. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 13. The Investments in securities are trading and are recorded and valued as FVTPL. Loans and receivables • Accounts receivable, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments 116 that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment tests. • Interest income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. Impairment of financial assets • For financial assets, other than financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, potential indicators of impairment are assessed at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. For financial assets carried at amortized cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the financial asset. Derecognition of financial assets • FUNO derecognizes a financial asset, only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred to another entity. Classification as debt or equity • Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. • The key feature in determining whether a financial instrument is a liability is the existence of a contractual obligation of FUNO to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, or to exchange financial assets or liabilities under conditions that are potentially unfavorable. In contrast, in the case of an equity instrument the right to receive cash in the form of dividends or other distributions is at the FUNO’s discretion and, therefore, there is no obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder of the instrument. Equity instruments • An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Trust are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. • When FUNO receives contributions or acquires properties which do not constitute a business, in return for its equity instruments, the transaction is recorded as a payment to third parties (other than employees) payable with share-based equity instruments, which are valued at the fair value of the assets received, except where the value cannot be estimated reliably. The effects on the financial position are recorded in the statement of changes in trustors’ capital as “equity contributions” and do not impact current earnings. The fair value of the properties is estimated as described in Note 9. Financial liabilities • Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at “FVTPL” or “other financial 117 liabilities”. FUNO does not hold any financial liabilities at FVTPL. • Other financial liabilities (including long-term debt) are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. • Other financial liabilities are valued subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method which is a method of allocating interest expense over the relevant period using the effective interest rate. Derecognition of financial liabilities • FUNO derecognizes a financial liability when its obligations are discharged, canceled or expire. Derivative financial instruments • Financial instruments issued by FUNO, including overallotment options of trust certificates, meet the definition of equity instruments and are presented as such. Consequently, there are no derivative financial instruments recognized. Embedded derivatives • Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL. FUNO has determined that it does not hold any embedded derivatives that require bifurcation. f. Investment properties • Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and /or capital gains. Properties that are under construction or development may qualify as investment properties. • Investment properties acquired and leasehold improvements are initially recorded at acquisition cost, including transaction costs related to the acquisition of assets. Investment property acquired in exchange for equity instruments are initially recorded at fair value, as described below. • Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. Fair values are determined by independent appraisals recorded at the following times: i. at the time an indicator that impacts the value of the investment property has been detected, and ii. at least once annually from the acquisition of the property. • Gains and losses in fair value are recorded in the line item “fair value adjustments of investment properties net” in the statement of income in the period in which they arise. • Initial direct costs incurred in negotiation of leases are added to the carrying amount of investment properties. • When FUNO operates a property under an operating lease to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, it is classified and accounted for as investment property. 118 • An investment property is derecognized upon its disposal or when the investment property is permanently out of use and no future economic benefits are expected from its disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between consideration received and the carrying value of the investment property) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognized. • The management of FUNO applies its judgment when determining whether an acquisition of an investment property or a portfolio of investment properties is a business combination or acquisition of assets. Particularly, the following criteria are considered: i. The number of properties of land and buildings acquired. ii. The extent to which significant processes are acquired and in particular the extent of ancillary services provided by the acquirer (e.g., maintenance, cleaning, security, bookkeeping, other property services, etc.). iii. Whether the acquiree has allocated its own staff to manage the property and/or to deploy any processes (including all relevant administration such as invoicing, cash collection, provision of management information to the entity’s owners and tenant information). g. Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Trust has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. Given the nature of certain of its investments in associates, FUNO has designated those as under the equity method. h. Intangible assets 1. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognized separately from goodwill are initially recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. The administrative platform, the Trust’s most significant intangible asset acquired in a business combination, is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 20 years. 2. Derecognition of intangible assets An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized. i. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill At the end of each reporting period, the FUNO reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have 119 suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the FUNO estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. j. Borrowing costs FUNO applies the scope exception with respect to capitalization of borrowing costs to investment properties, which are measured at fair value. k. CBFIs based payment 1. Share-based payment transactions of FUNO Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services to FUNO are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled CBFIs based transactions are set out in Note 18. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled CBFIS-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on FUNO’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, FUNO revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity settled employee benefits reserve. Equity-settled CBFIs-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date FUNO obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service. For cash-settled CBFIs-based payments, a liability is recognized for the goods or services 120 acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the year. l. Provisions Provisions are recognized when FUNO has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that FUNO will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. m. Deposits from tenants FUNO obtains refundable deposits from tenants, mainly denominated in pesos, as security for the lease payments for a certain period. These deposits are accounted for as a financial liability (see financial instruments accounting policy above) and are initially recognized at fair value. If a relevant difference from the fair value and the cost at which the liability was initially recorded arises, it would be considered as an initial rent payment and consequently, it would be amortized over the lease term. The deposit would subsequently be measured at amortized cost. n. Rental revenue Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Properties operated under operating leases are included under investment property in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. Operating lease income, which is similar to the contractual lease payments except for the consideration of incentives granted, such as grace periods, are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term, except for contingent rents (such as inflation), which are recognized when they earned. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the contract, including additional terms for which the lessee has the option to extend, when at lease inception, management has a reasonable certainty that the lessee will exercise the option. Revenues also include reimbursements of operating expenses, maintenance and publicity, and others, which are recognized in the period in which services are rendered. o. Income taxes As further explained in Note 1, the Trust qualifies as a FIBRA under the Mexican Income Tax Law and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes is recognized. The current and deferred tax consequences of a change in tax status are included in profit or loss for the period, unless they relate to transactions are recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. p. Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss. 121 q. Statement of cash flows FUNO presents its consolidated statements of cash flows using the indirect method. Interest received is classified as investing cash flow, while interest paid is classified as financing cash flow. 5. Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of FUNO’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 4, management is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. a. Critical judgments in applying accounting policies The following are the critical judgments, apart from those involving estimates (see below), that management has made in the process of applying the FUNO’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Lease classification • As explained in Note 4, leases are classified based on the extent to which risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset lie with FUNO or the tenant, depending on the substance of the transaction rather than the form of the contracts. FUNO has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these property and thus accounts for leases as operating leases. Business combinations • Management of the Trust applies its judgment when determining whether an acquisition of an investment property or a portfolio of investment properties is a business combination or an asset acquisition. Particularly, the following criteria are considered: i. The number of properties of land and buildings acquired. ii. The extent to which significant processes are acquired and in particular the extent of ancillary services provided by the acquiree (e.g., maintenance, cleaning, security, bookkeeping, other property services, etc.). iii. Whether the acquiree has allocated its own staff to manage the property and/or to deploy any processes (including all relevant administration such as invoicing, cash collection, provision of management information to the entity’s owners and tenant information). 122 • This determination can have significant impact in the accounting for the initial and subsequent recognition of assets and liabilities acquired. The transactions which occurred during the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements were accounted for as asset acquisitions. b. Key sources of estimation uncertainty The following are the key assumptions concerning key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period and that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Valuation of investment properties • In order to estimate the fair value of the investment properties, management, with the assistance of an independent appraiser, selects the appropriate valuation techniques given the particular circumstances of each property and valuation. Critical assumptions relating to the estimates of fair values of investment properties include the receipt of contractual rents, expected future market rents, renewal rates, and maintenance requirements, discount rates that reflect current market uncertainties, capitalization rates and recent investment property prices. If there is any change in these assumptions or regional, national or international economic conditions, the fair value of property investments may change materially. • There have been no changes to valuation techniques during 2015, 2014 and 2013. The management of FUNO considers that valuation techniques and critical assumptions used are appropriate to determine the fair values of its investment properties. 6.

Lease receivables and credit risk management At the inception of lease contracts, FUNO requests a refundable deposit from its customers to guarantee timely payment of rents on the commercial property leases, generally denominated in Mexican pesos, consisting, in most of the cases, of two months of rent, which is presented under the caption Deposit from tenants in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. In addition, depending of the characteristics of the commercial property, FUNO may request a non-refundable deposit. Alternatively, FUNO requests bonds and other guarantees from its customers. For anchor customers and other high credit quality customers the above guarantees may be waived. On a combined basis, and considering only the figures during 2015, 2014 and 2013, Wal Mart and Santander tenants represents 12.70%, 13% and 7% of lease revenue, respectively. Additionally, individual properties comprising the combined properties, may be individually subject to concentrations of credit risk. FUNO estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for unrecoverable amounts receivable. The estimation consist of 100% of past due accounts in legal procedure, 20% of past due accounts under extrajudicial processes and 100% of impairments approved by the Collection Committee. The allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis b. Aging of receivables that are past due but not impaired Currently, FUNO holds monthly collection levels equal to its monthly billing period; business practices and negotiation allow FUNO to maintain its accounts receivable with maturities of no greater than 90 days. Accounts receivable that are in extrajudicial process are not significant, for which no reserve of uncollectible amounts has been recognized. 9.

CAP rate -This is a rate of profitability of a real estate investment property based on the expected income that the property will generate. The capitalization rate has been used to estimate the potential investor return on its investment, and is obtained by dividing the income generated from the properties, after fixed costs and variable expenses, by the total property value. CAP rates used in the Trust’s discounted cash flows range from 7.75% to 9.25% in retail properties, from 7.25% to 9.00% in industrial properties and from 7.75% to 9.75% in offices. The CAP rate is determined by property, considering the geographic location, occupancy and/ or vacancy percentage, remaining lease term, use and type of real estate, quality of the tenants, open and competitive market prices for in similar real estate properties in terms of use and type, income in dollars or pesos (both cases), country risk, inflation, and rental periods or terms. As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, a change of +25 basis points in the CAP rate used for the valuation of the properties would result in a decrease in the fair value of investment properties and investment in associates of approximately $4,403,859, $3,504,335 and $2,920,244, respectively. b. Value per square meter in average leases (GLA) This is obtained based on the use and construction classification of the property, bearing in mind its useful 2,920,244 and rentable area. Value in Mexican Pesos per square meter for average rentals used in the Trust’s discounted cash flows range from $41 to $994 in retail properties, from $15 to $261 in industrial properties and from $56 to $711 in offices. An increase in value per square meter for average rentals would result in an increase in the fair value of investment properties, while a decrease would have the opposite effect. c. Discount rate Is obtained from considering the geographic location, occupancy and/or vacancy percentage, remaining lease term, use and type of real estate, quality of the tenants, open and competitive market prices for in similar real estate properties in terms of use and type, income in dollars or pesos (both cases), country risk, inflation, and rental periods or terms. Discount rates used in the Trust’s discounted cash flows range from 7.25% to 9.25% in retail properties, from 7.25% to 9.00% in industrial properties and from 7.75% to 9.75% in offices. An increase in the discount rate would result in a lower fair value of the Trust’s investment properties, while a decrease would have the opposite effect. 126 1. The fluctuation of the fair value on investment properties of the period is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations under the heading adjustments to the fair value of investment properties. All the investment properties of FUNO are held under absolute control. FUNO obtains valuations by independent appraisers that hold recognized and relevant professional qualifications and have experience in the location and category of its investment properties. Management considers different valuation techniques under the income, market and cost approaches, to estimate the fair value of investment properties and selects the most appropriate considering the particular circumstances of the property and availability of information, seeking to maximize the use of observable data. First, FUNO considers whether current prices in an active market for similar properties in the same location and condition and subject to similar lease and other contracts are available. However, in most cases, it uses a discounted cash flows technique given the availability of information. The discounted cash flows valuation technique requires the projection of future estimated cash flows from a property in operation or under development. Future estimated cash flows include revenues taking into account occupancy rates and uncollectibility, less operating expenses. These cash flows are discounted at an appropriate discount rate, derived from market participants’ assumptions to determine the present value of the cash flows, which represent fair value. 10.

FUNO’s objectives in managing capital are to ensure adequate operating funds are available to maintain consistent and sustainable CBFI distributions, to fund leasing costs and capital expenditure requirements, and to provide for resources needed to acquire new properties. • Management uses certain financial ratios related to debt, equity and earnings distributions to ensure capital adequacy and monitor capital requirements. The primary ratios used for 128 assessing capital management are the Loans to Value (“LTV”) and the Debt Service Coverage ratios (“DSCR”). These indicators assist FUNO in assessing that the debt level maintained is sufficient to provide adequate cash flows for unit holder distributions and capital expenditures, and for evaluating the need to raise funds for further expansion. • FUNO’s Trust Agreement limits its borrowings to the minimum amount between an LTV ratio of 50% and a DSCR ratio of 1.2. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 FUNO’s LTV and DSCR were 32%, 25% and 30% , 2, 4.4 and 8.36 times, respectively. Financial risk management objective • The objective of financial risk management is to meet financial expectations, results of operations and cash flows that will maximize the return to investors in CBFIs, to ensure the ability to make distributions to holders of CBFIs and to satisfy any future debt service obligations. • FUNO’s Technical Committee function provides services to the business, coordinates access to domestic financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of FUNO through internal risk reports which analyze exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. Market risk management • The activities of FUNO expose it primarily to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Trust obtains financing with different conditions, either from third or related parties, usually at variable interest rates exposing it to changes in market rates. Financing negotiated in U.S. dollars expose FUNO to fluctuations in the exchange rate between such currency and its functional currency, the Mexican peso. Nevertheless, FUNO has a natural hedge for financing denominated in U.S. dollars coming from the lease contracts that are denominated in the same currency, since cash flows provided by those leases are used to settle the aforementioned debts. Interest rate risk management • FUNO enters into financing at variable rates, mainly, the 28-day Mexican Interbank Equilibrium Offered Rate (“TIIE”) and London Inter Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). The decision to acquire debt at variable rates is based upon market conditions when contracted. The Trust prepares sensitivity analyses of projected future cash flows to establish the maximum finance charge to maintain profitable projects. Interest rate sensitivity analysis • The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the end of the reporting period. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. • If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, FUNO’s net income and trustors’ capital for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 129 and 2013, would have decreased/increased by approximately $528 million, $363 million and $344 million, respectively. Foreign currency risk management • FUNO conducts transactions denominated in US dollars; therefore it is exposed to changes in exchange rates between the Mexican peso and the US dollar. a. The foreign currency monetary position is as follows: 2015 2014 2013 US dollars (thousands): Monetary assets 341,769 66,473 74,548 Monetary liabilities (1,760,346) (1,712,729) (746,209) Net monetary liability (1,418,577) (1,646,256) (671,661) position Equivalent in Mexican pesos $ (24,597,841) $ (24,257,253) $ (8,775,385) b. The exchange rates, in pesos, in effect as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial position and the date of issue of the accompanying financial statements are as follows: December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2015 2014 2013 2016 US dollars $ 17.3398 $ 14.7348 $ 13.0652 $ 17.4015 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis • As of December 31, 2015, in the opinion of the management, the current exchange rate risk as a function of US dollar-denominated debt service is not significant, given a natural hedge provided by revenues also denominated in that currency. As of December 31, 2015, FUNO obtained three borrowings in US dollars from different financial institutions. As of December 31, 2014, FUNO obtained three borrowings in US dollars from different financial institutions. As of December 31, 2013, FUNO obtained six borrowings in US dollars from different financial institutions. • If exchange rates had been one Mexican peso per US dollar higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Trust’s net income and trustors’ capital for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 would have decreased/increased by $1,418,577, $1,646,256 and $671,661, respectively. Credit risk management • Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to FUNO. Substantially all FUNO income is derived from rental income from commercial property. As a result, its performance depends on its ability to collect rent from its tenants and its tenants’ ability to make rental payments. Income and funds available for distribution would be negatively affected if a significant number of tenants, or any major tenants fail to make rental payments when due or close their businesses or declare bankruptcy. • As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 10 largest tenants occupied approximately 27.1%, 25% and 30% of the total leasable area, respectively, and represented approximately 26.6%, 22% 130 and 28% of revenues attributable to the Trust’s investment property portfolio for the years then ended, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, one tenant occupied 708,114 of 6,637,904 m2 of the total leasable area of FUNO, which represents approximately 8.6% of the total leasable area and approximately 9.5% of the rental revenues for the year the ended. As of December 31, 2014, one tenant occupied 715,389 of 5,951,200 square meters of the total leasable area of FUNO, which represents approximately 12% of the total leasable area and approximately 11% of the rental revenues for the year the ended. As of December 31, 2013, one tenant occupied 709,399 of 4,949,403 square meters of the total leasable area of FUNO, which represents approximately 14% of the total leasable area and approximately 15% of the rental revenues for the year the ended. • FUNO has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. • Credit risk arises from balances of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and amounts due from related parties and financial investments. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the balance of each of those accounts as shown in the statement of financial position. Liquidity risk management • Liquidity risk represents the risk that FUNO will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests within FUNO’s Technical Committee, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of FUNO’s short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. FUNO manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of forecasted rental cash flows and liabilities. The Treasury department monitors the maturity of liabilities to program payments. • The following tables detail FUNO’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The tables have been prepared based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which FUNO may be required to pay such obligations. The tables include cash flows related to both interest and principal.

Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purpose of measuring fair value • The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices (includes listed redeemable notes, bills of exchange, debentures and perpetual notes). • The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding those described above) are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using actual transaction prices from observable markets and quotes for similar instruments. In particular, the fair value of long-term debt, which is considered a Level 3 measurement as per below, was determined using a discounted cash flow model using estimates of current market rates based on observable future curves for TIIE and a credit spread estimated from observable credit spreads for similar entities adjusted as needed. Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. • Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices 134 included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). • Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) 14.

Diluted net income per CBFI considered dilutive shares, as if the shares have been outstanding as of the date they were issued. Weighted average CBFIs considering dilutive CBFIs amounts to 3,495,989,347 CBFIs, 3,260,227,903 CBFIs and 2,038,903,083 CBFIs, respectively.. 20. Income taxes In order to maintain FIBRA status, the tax authority “SAT” has established, per articles 187 and 188 of the Mexican Income Tax Law, that FUNO must annually distribute at least 95% of its taxable income to the holders of its CBFIs. There are permanent and temporary differences between the comprehensive income displayed in the accompanying financial statements, and the fiscal result that serves as base to 142 make distributions to the holders of the CBFIs. Accordingly, the administration made reconciliation between the two bases to determine the amount to be distributed.
