October 23rd, 2016 H.E. Ban Ki-moon Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 Dear Mr. Secretary-General, I am pleased to confirm that The Brewer Group and The Jack Brewer Foundation will have a continued support for the ten principles of the Global Compact on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption and wishes to renew the company’s ongoing commitment to the initiative and its principals. With this communication, we are expressing our intent to implement those principles. We are committed to making the Global Compact and its principles a continual part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and will continue to engage in collaborative projects to advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Brewer Group and The Jack Brewer Foundation will make a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. The Brewer Group works with our clients and partners towards making a difference in multiple SDGs. We have donated over $50,000 of life saving medical equipment to Haiti to treat cervical cancer throughout the country. We work with international education organizations like Montessori Model United Nations to empower children all over the world to learn about other cultures and explore policies to improve the world. We work with professional athletes to empower them to make a difference off the field and attain their educational goals. We work to implement sustainable housing solutions in nations like Haiti, Guatemala and Malawi. We work with our partners to give many developing nations access to medical treatments that would ensure and sustain health and wellness for those with cancer, HIV/AIDS and other diseases. We have also led a campaign to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the communities that they protect and serve through its Trust 2 Protect organization and #Stand2Protect movement. Through The Jack Brewer Foundation, we strive to empower women and children and advance their opportunities in as many ways as possible. We have recently engaged in a major relief effort impacting more than 150,000 Haitians in dire need from the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. I recognize that this expression of continual support by myself as the CEO of The Brewer Group is the first step in the requirements needed for continual participation in the Global Compact. Following this letter, the United Nations Global Compact will receive our annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency and will include a description of practical actions (i.e., disclosure of any relevant policies, procedures, activities) that the company has taken (or plans to undertake) to implement the Global Compact principles in each of the four issue areas (human rights, labour, environment, anti-corruption). Additionally, a measure of outcomes will be presented in this COP in order to further disclose The Brewer Group’s degree of which it has addressed its targets, the indicators that were met, and any other qualitative or quantitative measurement of results. Kind Regards, Ambassador Jack Brewer The Brewer Group The Jack Brewer Foundation United Federation for Peace and Sustainable Development The Brewer Group’s Communication on Progress Human Rights Principles Assessment, Policy, and Goals The Brewer Group’s goal is to ensure that all of our employees and business partners respect and achieve the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The Brewer Group and The Jack Brewer Foundation’s stance on corporate social responsibility (CSR) is, “The Brewer Group actively engages in philanthropic initiatives around the world through The Jack Brewer Foundation (JBF Worldwide), our corporate social responsibility (CSR) organization. JBF Worldwide’s core principle is ‘Empowering From Within,’ and the Foundation empowers staff and clients to make positive changes in their communities at home and abroad.” The Brewer Group is focused on creating sustainable partnerships and empowering individuals to make positive social changes in both the community as well as in the business world.

The Brewer Group has begun a youth engagement program to bridge the gap between young people in various communities with those police officers charged with protecting them. The Brewer Group is fighting for new laws to be implemented protecting both officers and unarmed citizens. The Brewer Group and its affiliated organizations engage in participations with: UNAIDS, AmeriCares, UFPSD (formerly USFMEP), Project Medishare, IDB Youth, Starkey Hearing Foundation, Montessori Model United Nations, Smile Network International, China World Peace Foundation, Africa Rising, and the Joyce Banda Foundation amongst many more. All business partners, suppliers, and manufacturers are expected to adhere to the principles on Human Rights. Any violation of the articles outlined in this universal declaration would lead to The Brewer Group’s disassociation with this organizations and the reporting of the violations to the proper authorities. The Brewer Group has sectors spanning: Biotechnology and Healthcare, Sustainable Technology and Consumer Products, Education, Sports and Entertainment, and Principal Investing. The countries in which we operate/have operated with our respective business affiliations and interests include: United States, Brazil, Mexico, China, Malawi, India, Nigeria, South Africa, Haiti, Egypt, Jamaica, Guatemala, Bahamas, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sri Lanka, Djibouti, Benin, Malaysia, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Brunei, Grenada, Samoa, and Afghanistan. In each of these countries listed, there is the risk of violations of human rights, labour, environment, and corruption. To ensure that violations do not occur, The Brewer Group and our affiliates take a hands-on approach to the implementation, production, and development of each sector and product in each respective region. Our goal is to empower the people of these countries to become more self-sufficient, employ more local people, and develop in a way that is sustainable from a business and ecological standpoint. Often times, as seen in developing countries, the vision for growth is short term, and profits often times over power ethics. Related risks and impact in industry sector and country(ies) of operation Biotechnology and Healthcare: Often times, the dignity of people is overlooked in this sector in regards to access to medical necessities and healthcare. Discriminations exist between race, color, sex, language, religion, and political views in many of the countries listed. Inconsistencies particularly exist in regards to Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stating that, “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.” Sustainable Technology and Consumer Products: The major risks that are associated with this sector in the countries listed include people being subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; everyone has the right to equal pay for equal work; and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, specifically with regards to the manufacturing of the products. Another risk associated with this sector involves the degradation of the environment, ecosystems, and surrounding communities by practicing harmful methods of energy and food production. Without safe systems in place, populations run the risk of negative health effects, reduced nutritional gains, and overall degradation of their quality of life. Education: The major risks that our company and affiliation have in regards to this sector and the declaration of human rights, is the cooperative nature of certain populations in the promotion of unbiased education and cultural exchange. Often times, sex, religion, status, and gender play a major role in whether or not a child has the opportunity to pursue educational opportunities. The Brewer Group’s specific goals in the area of human rights for the upcoming year: ● Improve the accessibility of affordable medications to places that lack proper medical alternatives, or access to medications in general. ● Encourage the advancement of neurological assisting devices for therapeutic, precautionary, and protective services. ● Maintain a supply chain for all affiliations that is in compliance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. ● Empower women to attain greater levels of equality across all sectors of society through our organization’s non-profit foundation and other charitable organizations we involve ourselves with. ● Increase the opportunity for organic, sustainable farming solutions to be used in small to large-scale operation in all economic environments. ● Increase the global capacity for countries and its citizens to access nutritious foods. ● Promote the advancement of research and technologies that are geared towards improving the quality of life in individuals spanning all economic, religious, ethnic, and political barriers. ● Provide aid to those suffering from the aftermath of natural disasters Implementation The Brewer Group has taken the following measures to prevent human rights violations at its work locations: ● A reporting structure has been implemented throughout the workplace which allows for any person to report a violation to their superior, or if uncomfortable with reporting that that individual, they can communicate directly with the CEO. ● Incorporated into the company associates meeting in an overview about the stance of The Brewer Group on human rights, as well as in the disclaimer of company literature.
