The name Buenavista is an apology to the panoraEEUU mic beauty of this place, to its mountains, its geomorphology. Its landscape gathers the scenic of the vegetation and culture. Colombia Buenavista Block, operated by Union Temporal Energy (UTOE) is located in the Surinam basin of the Eastern mountain range and it is divided in three areas: Santander (exParaguay ploration phase), Corrales (evaluation phase) and Bolivar, which is in production and development phase. During 2011 three wells were drilled, and five more during 2012. As of 2013 a drilling of stratigraphic wells campaign was developed, with the purpose of identifying and assessing potential shallow deposits. This campaign validated the continuity of the findings of shallow heavy crude oil and the great hydrocarbon potential of the block. Since December 2013 until November 2014 the exploration group of Omega Energy has carried out a strict seismic interpretation with the accompaniment in the reprocessing, providing as a result more trustable maps, supporting localization of as prospects, and localization of two wells on development which allowed to define id M 21 the extension of Campo Corrales. The success with these wells and the optimal rea m lo ta os sults of the interpretation allowed increase of proven reserves (p1), Probable (P2) Pa Bu an La en Ll and Possible (P3), which were certified.
