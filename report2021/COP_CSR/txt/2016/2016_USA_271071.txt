Autodesk FY2016 Sustainability Disclosures About this document Autodesk is committed to sharing information about our social and environmental performance as well as how our products and services advance sustainability. This information enables Codes, policies, and standards customers, investors, employees, nongovernmental organizations, and others to assess our progress and gain insights from our sustainable business practices that can be applied to Autodesk codes, policies, and standards related other companies and organizations. to sustainability include the following: We published our first Sustainability Report in 2008, and we have released six more since then. • Code of Business Conduct This year, we have streamlined our approach. This document includes the following disclosures: • Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and • Performance summary (see below) Financial Officers • United Nations Global Compact index • Environmental Policy • Global Reporting Initiative index • Human Rights Policy • Partner Code of Conduct Performance data included in this document is based on the Autodesk fiscal year when noted, and the calendar year otherwise. The Autodesk 2016 fiscal year ran from February 1, 2015, through January 31, 2016. Performance data covers the company’s global operations, unless otherwise stated. In some cases, segments in tables do not add up to total due to rounding. Dashes represent that data for that year was not available. To learn more about our commitment to sustainability and our vision for the role of design in addressing the epic challenges our world faces, visit our website. Performance summary We have a tremendous opportunity to help our customers and employees to imagine, design, and create the built world around us. Although our biggest opportunity to improve our shared future is through the designers who use our software, we also work hard to reduce the direct impact of our operations. This Performance summary provides a high-level view of our progress in sustainability over the past five years. Economy Autodesk’s ongoing financial performance underpins the company’s efforts in sustainability. During fiscal 2016, revenue remained essentially unchanged, while net income decreased significantly. This is largely due to a transition in our business model as we move away from one-time licenses toward cloud-based subscriptions. This change will increase the value of our products to customers and help us attract new types of customers. As expected, implementing this strategic business model transition resulted in an increase in deferred revenue that otherwise would have been recognized as revenue in fiscal 2016; while this is positive for the balance sheet, it had a negative impact on both operating margin and earnings per share in fiscal 2016.

We’ve committed to the following targets: Targets1 Progress in FY2016 General Science-based GHG emissions reduction targets: Since fiscal year 2009 (our baseline), we have decreased absolute GHG emissions by 33 • We are committed to following our Corporate Finance Approach to Climate-Stabilizing percent, exceeding our goal for FY2016 of a 32 percent reduction. Targets (C-FACT) methodology through 2020, which aims to reduce GHG emissions in line with an 85 percent reduction by 2050. C-FACT is a science-based approach that helps companies develop GHG emissions reduction targets in proportion to their relative contribution to the economy. Learn more about C-FACT. • LONG-TERM TARGET: Reduce carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions across our value chain by an estimated 43 percent between fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2021. • SHORT-TERM TARGET: Reduce CO2e emissions across our value chain by 32 percent between fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2016, and by 35 percent by fiscal year 2017.

In the Autodesk fiscal year 2014 Sustainability Progress Report, we introduced targets to reduce GHG emissions from hired cars and rental cars. A change in vendors and related systems has impacted our ability to report progress in these areas, in part because of a difference in the baseline average fuel economy for the rental car fleet. As a result, we have discontinued the related targets. These emissions are not significant relative to Autodesk’s overall footprint. 3 Products: Our customer base has a sizeable reach • Rapid Energy Modeling for Existing Buildings • Autodesk® Education Community enables students with great potential to design buildings, infrastructure assesses energy retrofit potential virtually and educators to access more than 80 titles projects, and products that help mitigate and adapt without an onsite visit.

We actively manage these impacts and strive to be transparent about all relevant areas of our business, including 10 categories covered in the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. For the first time, in fiscal year 2016, we estimated GHG emissions from across our supply chain to create a complete footprint and included those emissions in our reduction target. This helps us better understand our environmental impacts, prioritize our reduction efforts, and address GHG hot spots in our value chain. During the year, our absolute GHG emissions decreased by 10 percent compared with fiscal year 2015. Since fiscal year 2009 (our baseline), we have decreased absolute GHG emissions by 33 percent, exceeding our goal of a 32 percent reduction. Supply chain: This category includes procurement related to our products as well as purchases that support our business more generally, such as marketing and employee benefits. It excludes data centers, events, and travel, which we continue to report separately, as shown in the GHG emissions by activity graph on this page.

We provide design-focused nonprofits with direct support, including funding, software (through Autodesk, Inc.), and training. The Autodesk Foundation also supports employees worldwide by matching their charitable donations of time and money to the causes and organizations they care about most, and for disaster response. In addition, Autodesk, Inc., business units provide direct funding for design and engineering programs and projects in their respective industries.
