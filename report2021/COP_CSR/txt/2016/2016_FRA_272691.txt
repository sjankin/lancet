It is that constant need which we are making possible today at OT through our embedded security solutions. Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) agenda is the moral compass that keeps us at the forefront of our dynamic industry. It supports the sustainable growth of our business, and ensures that we move forward with a strong social and ethical conscience, acting upon our responsibility to the planet for future generations, and operating with transparency in strict compliance with the law wherever we conduct our business. At OT, we believe that by managing our social, environmental and ethical objectives, we create long-term value and contribute to the maximization of our financial performance. In 2015, OT identified the opportunities and risks which were most important to our business, to stakeholders, the economy, environment, and society, and therefore merited particular focus in CSR strategic decision-making.

This annual assessment provides a reliable sustainability rating for an increasing number of our customers. In 2015, EcoVadis performed its annual assessment of OT’s CSR performance, with OT receiving a gold recognition and being placed amongst the top 5% of CSR performers assessed by EcoVadis.
