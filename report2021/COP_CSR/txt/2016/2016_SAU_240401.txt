This project will significantly improve our resource efficiency, decrease greenhousegas intensity, improve economic performance, and provide inspiration for similar solutions that can help build a sustainable future for the planet. In the early stages of SABIC’s sustainability program, The first step toward capitalizing on this opportunity we developed a material-loss metric. The measurement involved innovation at United, a SABIC affiliate that helps to reduce the amount of materials we release to produces ethylene glycol in Jubail. To do so, SABIC the environment by identifying ways we could more assisted in building a purification process unit to remove efficiently use resources. Since then, our first focus has impurities from the CO2 vent stream, making the been on the most significant opportunity to reduce output so pure that the gas can be sold to the food material loss: the venting of carbon-based resources, and beverage and medical industries. Our facility, including CO2. which came online this year, is now the world’s largest CO2 purification plant, with the capacity to handle SABIC is uniquely positioned to share byproducts and up to 500,000 metric tons per year. otherwise wasted materials, such as CO2, between our Saudi manufacturing affiliates, because they are in close The second step was our first significant sustainability proximity. We are one of the world’s largest producers project requiring cross-site collaboration. To share of ethylene glycol. Concentrated CO2 vent streams are CO2 from the new purification plant, we built a grid byproducts of the production process. Near the source to deliver the purified stream to other nearby SABIC of these streams, several of our manufacturing affiliates affiliates that use the gas to produce products such use CO2 as a feedstock, presenting an opportunity as urea, methanol, and 2-ethylhexanol. to improve resource efficiency through the integration of materials between sites. This project increases economic returns, enhances the social value of producing more products from the same amount of raw material, and improves environmental emissions. It is an excellent example of how we are building value for all the dimensions of sustainability and creating ‘Chemistry that Matters™’.
