In recent years, social and economic conditions have become increasingly complex and difficult to forecast, for example, the heightening of global geopolitical risk and the slowing of growth in developing nations. Amidst these challenges, we are also seeing the seeds of innovation growing out of trends such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), which comprise what can be called the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this way, the times increasingly demand an approach to corporate management that has the ability to respond to change. A It is for precisely this reason that we are seeking to further strengthen our ability to respond to change by adopting as our corporate vision the goal of leveraging MC’s ingenuity to create new business models that generate value for societies, thereby developing the highest level of management expertise. Our people are everything at MC, and I am confident that the growth of our employees will underpin the development of the company. I want to transform MC into a company that can create sustained business value through ingenuity while also fostering the development of employees who combine a strong sense of ethics, including with regard to compliance, with the foresight and execution skills to deal with change and overcome adversity. Our goal is to enable this unity between personal and corporate growth in order to drive the evolution of MC. We can achieve this by fostering a virtuous cycle in which employees create value through ingenuity in a way that spurs business innovation. In addition, we have identified a series of Key Sustainability Issues (Materiality). We plan to pursue businesses which address each of these issues in order to generate value for societies. ⇒For details about our Key Sustainability Issues, please refer to pages 38 to 41. 10 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 11 Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018 Question 2 Portfolio Sizes ̶ Focus management resources on businesses where we can proactively demonstrate our strengths and functions Maintain ̶ Concentrate in metallurgical coal, copper, and natural gas Q (Accelerated Lifecycle-based Portfolio Re-proﬁling) Resources Non-resources Portfolio Size = Fixed Assets + Investments + Financing + Goodwill How will you rebalance MC’s Resources and To ensure steady progress in the rebalancing of our Resources and Non-resources portfolios from the standpoint of risk and return, we will Non-resources portfolios? work to improve quality in the Resources field by re-profiling assets while maintaining portfolio sizes. In the Non-resources field, we will 2 make growth investments in businesses where we can proactively demonstrate our strengths and functions. We will strive to ensure sound growth by addressing the pressing need to review and rebalance our Resources and Non-resources A portfolios in an appropriate manner so that we can achieve stable management even if current resources prices continue. Specifically, we will work to strengthen downside resilience in the Resources field so that MC can secure a certain level of profitability even during market downturns by focusing our management resources on the three areas of metallurgical coal, copper and natural gas, and by actively re-profiling our holdings to emphasize prime assets while maintaining a certain level of investment and lending. In the Non-resources field, we will undertake growth investments in areas where MC can proactively exert of our strengths and functions, particularly in fields that can be expected to drive growth, for example, raw food materials, life sciences, consumer goods manufacturing, retail, motor vehicles, power generation, real estate development and asset management, while simultaneously pursuing a re-profiling of our portfolio. ⇒For more information about strategies for individual business groups, see pages 62 to 91. 12 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 13 Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018 Question 3 Period for Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018 (three-year total) Total Cash Flow Cash Flow from Operations Cash Flow from Investment Cash Flow Q from Divestment Shareholder Returns What can you tell us about the new approach to Corporate Departments and Business Groups will focus on managing cash flow to maintain business stability and remain flexible amidst capital allocation? economic uncertainty. Over the next three years, we will manage investments and shareholder returns within our total cash flow. 3 We will move ahead with a management approach that emphasizes cash flow in order to build the structures that will enable us to continue our businesses in a stable manner in the face of a fast-changing business environment. Specifically, we will manege investment and return to shareholders within our total cash flow over the next three years. We follow a policy of managing investments in a flexible manner with a focus on cash flow. We have also brought the same perspective used in company-wide management to bear on the management of individual business groups by formulating investment plans based on each group’s ability to create cash flow. This approach will allow us to control cash flow in an agile manner in response to changes in the business environment. Through this approach to capital allocation, we will maintain financial soundness by controlling the level of interest-bearing debt. ⇒For more information about shareholder returns, see Question 6 (pages 20 to 21).

Under the “managing” model, we will leverage MC’s strengths to become more deeply involved in management with the goal of creating new value through innovation in business operations; reforming business structures through alliances, partnerships, coalitions and other means; and raising corporate value through the revitalization of businesses. I believe that the key to implementing this “managing” model lies in fostering the development of more professionals with the highest level of management expertise. I envision professionals who have the foresight to deal with changes in the business environment in a flexible manner, as well as the ability to proactively manage the businesses in which we have invested. There are currently more than 1,000 companies affiliated with the MC Group, so I think it is fair to say that there are a sufficient number of places in which to foster the development of these professionals. Going forward, we will foster a virtuous cycle in which training more professionals with even greater management expertise and empowering them to create new businesses will lead to the creation of even more places where growth can occur. I believe that this approach will create a foundation that will propel us into the next generation and thereby increase the entire Group’s corporate value. ⇒For more information about fostering the development of management professionals, please refer to the section on MC’s Approach to Human Resources Policy (page 46) and other pages detailing associated policies and initiatives (pages 79, 83, 87 and 91). 16 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 17 Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018 Question 5 Business Lifecycle Growth Businesses in which we generate growth by playing a Management Seed Growth Stabilization Maturation resources Stage Stage Stage Stage leading role in their management allocation Stability Businesses that already have solid foundations, and from which we can generate a certain level of stable earnings Growth Stability by proactively demonstrating our strengths High Functional Engagement Pursued Efﬁciency Continue as long as business is growing Aim at building a Incubation Peak Out more efﬁcient fundamental/growth business Peak Out Assign equal priority to missions whose objectives are to exit from peaked out businesses Moderate Pursued Q Incubation Efﬁciency New businesses in the startup or incubation stages where we can apply our existing strengths What does it mean specifically to accelerate a lifecycle-based Cognizant of business lifecycles and influencing factors, we will promote portfolio re-profiling according to our level of functional engagement in portfolio re-profiling? each business. 5 No matter the product, function or business model, it is not possible to remain competitive forever. Rather, businesses always have a lifecycle, and we must remember that the businesses in which MC is involved are subject to a life expectancy. The positioning of these businesses with regard to lifecycle varies over time, and we must emphasize the perspective of asking whether we are carrying out our functions and roles so as to facilitate additional growth of the investee through the evolution of our business models and other means. I believe that by taking responsibility for transforming our own businesses we can return them to a stage at which value can be increased anew. Based on this approach, we will visualize the positioning of our businesses along the twin axes of the business lifecycle and MC’s functional engagement and pursue a re-profiling by considering the direction in which we should transform those businesses, being aware of each one’s positioning. I am confident that by accelerating a “lifecycle-based” portfolio re-profiling as MC’s company-wide portfolio manager, we will be able to cultivate a corporate culture in which employees continually strive to maximize corporate value, and that this culture will serve as a driving force for new innovation. 18 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 19 Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018 Question 6 Period of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018 ＋β ＋α ¥60 ¥60 ¥60 ¥50 Q 16.3 17.3 18.3 19.3 What can you tell us about your approach to We are focusing on dividends as our basic approach to returning value to shareholders and increase dividend flexibly in line with sustainable shareholder returns? earnings growth based on a progressive dividend scheme.

Under this approach, we plan to progressively increase the amount of dividends since we expect to be able to create stable cash flow. In other words, we have introduced a plan to avoid reducing dividends. We will adopt a flexible approach to determining the specific amounts of those dividend increases based on MC’s profitability and A the business environment at the time.

Efforts toward Achieving Sustainable Growth for MC Konno: As the backdrop against which this approach was adopted, MC considers Through Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018, MC has set forth its intent to simultaneously generate economic, environmental and societal value environmental value and societal value to be management objectives rather than simply costs, and this approach epitomizes MC’s corporate philosophy, the Three by proactively pursuing businesses that generate value for societies. We asked some of our Outside Directors and members of the CSR & Corporate Principles. The principle of pursuing value for public society through Environmental Affairs Advisory Committee, who offer their views and advice to the Company from a variety of perspectives on a regular basis, to business activities is one that has been passed down since the Company’s founding, and it has spread widely from top management to the newest of employees. As discuss the direction of MC’s initiatives in the areas of social responsibility, the natural environment and corporate governance. an Outside Director I have seen a variety of business sites, and in doing so, I have experienced how adherence to, and the practice of, these Principles permeates every aspect of the Company’s operations. Nishiyama: In formulating Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018, MC created opportunities to explain and discuss the Strategy’s underlying concepts with its Outside Directors, and reflected their feedback in the final document. With regard to governance mechanisms that contribute to the simultaneous generation of these three kinds of value, MC reviews individual proposals from an ESG perspective, including at the Board of Directors level. Also, in relation to corporate governance, the Governance & Compensation Committee, an advisory body to the Board of Directors, consists of five outside members and three in-house members, giving outside members a majority. — What aspects of Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018 stand out to you? Adachi: One noteworthy aspect is the inclusion of the expression “taking the initiative,” which is frequently used when elaborating on the phrase, “seeking to generate value for societies through business.” I take this wording as a sign of MC’s strong desire to evolve beyond the status quo. It seems to me that efforts to communicate this commitment— this initiative—to external stakeholders will lead to a better understanding of MC’s unique characteristics as a company. Another significant aspect of the strategy is the further evolution from “investing” to “managing.” I believe that in expanding the scope of MC’s business model from trading to investing in businesses, the scale of its operations has changed dramatically. By taking this one step further to shift from investing to managing, MC can continue to expand upon its existing strengths. These include MC’s employees and management resources, as well as their extensive networks. Seeking to utilize these to secure new business opportunities, MC will be generating value that gives rise to an even greater ripple effect on society and the environment. Konno: I agree that the idea of “taking the initiative” is an extremely important one.

In forming their own goals and approaches, companies Addressing the Needs of Society need to make an even greater effort to consider how to incorporate the expectations of their stakeholdTacking Evolving Regional Issues through Business Innovation ers. As the scale of MC’s supply chain continues to expand, the Company’s stakeholders are growing more diverse, and the magnitude of their impact and influence is increasing. In addition, there will surely Key Sustainability Issues be conflicts of interest among different stakeholder groups. As articulated in MC’s vision, I believe that for MC (Materiality) mechanisms for facilitating active dialogue with a diverse range of stakeholders and incorporating their feedback will only become more important in the future. Growing Together with Conserving the Natural Environment Adachi: Director Konno spoke about the pursuit of value for public society, and Committee Member Local Communities Kuroda spoke about the importance of dialogue with stakeholders. The scope of what constitutes “public society” and “stakeholders” is a key issue that demands an even deeper discussion. For example, are only those with a business relationship counted among stakeholders, or should local residents be included ⇒ For more information about the Key Sustainability Issues in this group as well? When we think about environmental issues, shouldn’t the next generation be includFostering Our Employees’ Maximum Potential (Materiality), please refer to pages 38 to 41. ed in the considerations as well? I think that these are issues of great concern not only to MC, but also to many corporations. Kuroda: Particularly because MC pursues a broad range of businesses worldwide, I think that maintaining Konno: As a result of discussing these issues at meetings of the Board of Directors, the key issues awareness of stakeholder needs presents a considerable challenge to the Company as it works to achieve that MC needs to address and their relative priority became clear. For example, to address the pressing growth on a global scale. global issue of transitioning to a low-carbon society, it is important to ensure that the company-wide commitment is reflected in the targets and results of each group and business group, and all the way down to individual actions at the employee level. To achieve this, it is necessary to work toward identifying key issues and translating them into targets in the management cycle. The Key Sustainability Issues are an effective mechanism to encourage this process. I also expect that the Board of Directors will be able to Highlighting Key Sustainability Issues and Connecting Them to Targets use them as a tool for discussing and monitoring key issues for the Company as well. for the Management Cycle Nishiyama: I think the aspect of fostering employees’ maximum potential is noteworthy. Employees are important stakeholders for companies. It is vital to create a win-win relationship with employees by — MC has defined seven Key Sustainability Issues (Materiality). boosting each individual employee’s job satisfaction so that they can grow and generate results.

I believe that we can expect the identification of key sustainability issues to yield major benefits, and I welcome MC’s efforts to define and focus on these key areas as a significant step forward. Kuroda: External stakeholders, including ourselves as members of the CSR & Environmental Affairs Consistently Addressing ESG Issues and Creating Business Value That Advisory Committee, participated in the issue identification process and related discussions. This process Generates Value for Societies included steps to determine precedence and importance based on opportunities for MC’s sustainable growth and the associated risks from not only a corporate standpoint but also from a stakeholder per— Which issues would you like to see MC address as it strives to achieve sustainable growth? spective as well. These discussions gave rise to a clear picture of the issues that are important to both MC and its stakeholders, and laid the groundwork for the Company to set targets to address these issues Kuroda: It goes without saying, but there is a gap between the company’s perspective and stakeholders’ in a prioritized manner. perspective. I think the question stakeholders are asking is what MC will do to help resolve global issues such as global warming and scarcity of food and water resources. In that regard, dialogue with stakeholders is important. 52 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 53 Roundtable Discussion: Efforts toward Achieving Sustainable Growth Kuroda: An increasing number of western companies are effectively implementing a Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle by identifying environmental, human rights and other risks in their supply chains, including CSR & Environmental Affairs latent risks, and then by assessing them and taking preventive measures. In addition, they often cooperate Advisory Committee with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other groups with specialized knowledge and networks. Even though companies may view such organizations as critical of their activities, shared goals present an MC’s CSR & Environmental Affairs opportunity for collaboration. In recent years we are starting to see more and more examples of companies Advisory Committee is made up of and NGOs working together, including collaborations related to the identification and resolution of risks which external experts and provides advice have already come to the surface. However, these cases are still rare in Japan. I look forward to seeing MC on the MC Group’s sustainability take the initiative to show industry the benefits of engagement with stakeholders as it takes on a leading role in developing a vision for how companies can engage with their stakeholders. activities from a range of perspectives. To deepen their understanding of Konno: It is impossible to define a point at which ESG initiatives are sufficient.

Initiatives in the Asia Corporation Pacific Region As of July 1, 2016 Konno: I have heard that overseas institutional investors see Japanese companies as having a strong sense of ethics but low transparency. It seems to me that more than just being transparent, MC needs to dedicate more resources to explaining its operations and engaging in an open dialogue with society. We heard earlier how dialogue with stakeholders is important, and I think that this is an area where we need to focus even greater energy as the Company strives to achieve sustainable growth. Nishiyama: I believe that the entire MC Group will need to dedicate more resources to internal controls and compliance as the regions in which it does business continue to expand, along with the business fields and domains in which the Group is active. People prefer companies that address ESG issues over the long-term, so it is necessary for MC to strengthen both its mechanisms for sustainability and their implementation, and to actively communicate with stakeholders as well. For example, consider Olam International Limited, the agricultural commodities company in Singapore with which MC entered into a capital alliance and operational partnership last year. Olam has created a sustainabilityand traceability-focused value chain that encompasses agricultural production, collection and manufacturing processes, and is actively promoting its approach. It seems to me that MC could even more effectively promote its own stance by working with Olam to achieve sustainable growth. Adachi: Through today’s conversation, I have gained a new appreciation for how MC’s Board of Directors not only gives a voice to shareholders’ interests but also carefully considers other stakeholders as well. Today, multinational companies are increasingly embracing the idea that the board of directors must address ESG issues. This is based on the belief that ignoring the interests of a company’s diverse stakeholders is tantamount to harming the interests of its own shareholders. I think MC’s Board of Directors can do more to actively promote that it is working to meet the expectations of a diverse range of stakeholders. This would be meaningful both for MC and for Japanese companies in general. 54 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 MITSUBISHI CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2016 55 Organizational Structure .............................................................58 Business Groups Overview .........................................................60 Business Service Group..............................................................62 Our vision part 2 Global Environmental & Infrastructure Business Group ............64 Business Groups Industrial Finance, Logistics & Development Group ..................68 Energy Business Group ..............................................................72 Metals Group...............................................................................76 This section introduces the respective business groups’ visions and initiatives.
