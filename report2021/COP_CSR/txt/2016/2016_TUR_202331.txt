Compliance with the relevant EU and Turkish Legislation related to our sector RoHS In 2000, in line with customer demand, our activities about restriction of using lead, cadmium, mercury and bromine-containing flame retardants has begun.

As a result of RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive and the Directive on the harmonization efforts for Turkey, the production is made in accordance with published Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances The new ROHS 2 Directive (2011/65/EU) has taken place to the RoHS Directive (2002/95/EC) which is related with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in the Electric and Electronic Equipment (EEE). Restriction of the lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium compounds, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) which is flame retarder and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) is continuing with ROHS 2 Directive. REACH – Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) Substances of very high concern are the substances that are candidates to REACH Regulation’s “Authorization List”. These substances are cancer-causing (carcinogenic), mutagenic, toxic to reproduction, persistent organic pollutant and bio accumulative substances. This category also includes chemicals that have equivalent risk like “endocrine system disruptors”. There are already 168 substances in the list of SVHC. SVHC List is updated on 17 December 2015 and 5 new substances are added Our products do not contain these substances. We are able to follow this by the declarations of conformity we receive from our suppliers. In scope of the study for the harmonization of REACH Regulation, the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization is expected to issue Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals.
