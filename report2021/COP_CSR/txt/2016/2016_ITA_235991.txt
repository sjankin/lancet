2015 ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 CREATIVE CONCEPT With over 20 million burners and as many valves manufactured each year, the Sabaf Group was once again recognised as the global market leader in this sector in 2015. Our components for cooking appliances can be found in hobs and ovens throughout the world: a genuine touch of Made in Italy in the kitchen. This idea led us to the creative design of our Annual Report this year: it provides a virtual tour of the world through the countries shown in the report, distinguished by the company’s representative products in each region. The photographic design marks a departure from previous Annual Reports, in which vector diagrams were the main graphic element. The materials and props used to design and create the sets result in bold yet complementary colours which dominate the scene: each country has its own reference colour, depicted in the image through the use of special Fedrigoni paper from the Sirio Colour series. Geometry and alignment are achieved using solid shapes with ad hoc designs in which iconographic elements and foods typical of the eight selected countries are carefully arranged, creating evocative settings which allow our minds to wander from Brazil to China and from Italy to Turkey. It conveys a message of unity and collaboration, a tribute to the world and to the various cultures within it.

To make a further leap in quality, we to take a new direction. Our industry becomes more difficult every day: the need everyone at Sabaf to pull in the same direction: individual interests must be concentration of our customers, significant price pressure, and a global situation set aside in favour of cooperation.

The Code aims to promote ethical and sustainable standards as regards working conditions and safeguarding the environment in order to support fair competition in global markets. The manufacturers that adhere to the code voluntarily commit to implementing decent working conditions that respect shared standards relating to minimum age, working hours, hygiene and safety conditions, freedom of association and collective bargaining, as well as environmental regulations. The signatory companies also commit to making their suppliers aware of the principles of the Code of Conduct, and to encourage them to adhere to these principles. The signatory companies ask, through the suppliers, that the principles are recommended to the whole supply chain.

This creates a central entrepreneurial vision that guarantees the the individual’s physical, cultural and moral integrity, even if such decisions would be individual’s dignity and freedom within the framework of a shared code of conduct. efficient, economically beneficial, and legally acceptable. The centrality of the individual is a universal value, i.e. a “hyper-rule” applicable Respecting the value of the individual means, first and foremost, making “being” regardless of place or time. In accordance with this universal value, the Sabaf Group a priority before “doing” and “having”, and thus protecting and enhancing the fosters cultural diversity through the criterion of spatial and temporal equality.

Investments in innovation have enabled the Company to become a global leader in an extremely specialised niche market and, over time, to achieve high standards of technological advancement, specialisation and manufacturing flexibility. The Expansion of the component product line and partnership manufacturing sites in Italy and abroad are designed to ensure that products are based with multinational groups on the highest technological standards available today. They are a cutting-edge model Ongoing expansion of our range is intended to further increase our customers’ loyalty in terms of both environmental protection and worker safety. via greater satisfaction of their needs. Its ability to offer a complete range of components further distinguishes Sabaf from its competitors. This expansion is mainly pursued via in-house research, although possible strategic Eco-efficiency alliances with other leading players in the sector or acquisitions, even in related sectors, are not ruled out. One of the underlying priorities of Sabaf’s product innovation strategy is the quest The Group intends to further consolidate its collaborative relationships with customers for superior performance in terms of environmental impact. Our attention to and to strengthen its positioning as sole supplier of a complete product range in the environmental issues materialises through innovative production processes with cooking components market, thanks to its ability to tailor its production processes to lower energy consumption in product manufacturing, and, above all, products that customers’ specific requirements. are designed to be eco-efficient during everyday use. More specifically, innovation efforts are predominantly focused on the development of burners that reduce fuel consumption (natural or other gases) and emissions (particularly carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide) during use. Enhanced exploitation of intangible assets and intellectual capital Enhanced exploitation of intangible assets is essential to be able to compete effectively Safety in the international market. Safety has always been one of the indispensable features of Sabaf’s business model. Sabaf carefully monitors and enhances the value of its true “intangible assets”, i.e. the Safety for Sabaf is not mere compliance with existing standards, but a management great technical and professional skill of the people working in the company, its image philosophy striving for continuous improvement in performance in order to guarantee now synonymous with quality and reliability, and its reputation as a company attentive end users an increasingly safe product. Besides investing in new-product R&D, the to social and environmental problems and to the needs of its counterparts. Advocating Group has chosen to play an active role in fostering a safety culture, both by promoting the idea of work and relations with stakeholders as “the passion for a project founded the sale of products featuring thermoelectric safety devices, and via a communication on common ethical values in which everyone recognises themselves” is not only policy aimed at promoting the use of products with thermoelectric safety devices. Sabaf a moral commitment, but also a real guarantee of enhanced exploitation of intangible has long been a worldwide promoter in the various institutional environments of the assets. From this perspective the sharing of ethical values is the link between the introduction of regulations making the adoption of products with thermoelectric safety promotion of a business culture oriented towards social responsibility and enhanced devices obligatory. Safety has proved to be a key factor for success, partly because the exploitation of the Company’s intellectual capital. Company has succeeded in anticipating demand for products with safety devices in the European market and in stimulating the spread of such products in developing countries. More recently, Sabaf has become a promoter, together with the Brazilian regulatory authority, of the ban on the use of zamak (a zinc and aluminium alloy) for the production of gas cooking valves due to its inherent risks. Today, however, the use of zamak is still permitted in Brazil, Mexico and in other South American countries, limiting business opportunities in the valves segment for Sabaf, which does not plan to consider the production of valves using zamak. 28 Social responsibility in business processes In order to translate the values and principles of sustainable development into decisions regarding of action and operating activities, Sabaf applies a structured methodology, whose key factors are as follows: 1 2 3 the sharing of training and an internal control and audit values, mission communication; system capable of monitoring and sustainability risks (including ethical and strategy; reputational risks) and of verifying that commitments to stakeholders are fulfilled; 4 5 6 a stakeholder engagement key performance indicators a clear and complete reporting (KPI), capable of monitoring system, able to inform the system, to deal with the our economic, social and various categories of stakeholder expectations of all stakeholders and environmental performance; effectively; to receive useful feedback with a view to continuous improvement. Prudent approach Awareness of the social and environmental implications of Group activities, together with consideration both of the importance of a cooperative approach with stakeholders and the Group’s own reputation, has led Sabaf to adopt a prudent approach to the management of the economic, social and environmental variables that it encounters on a daily basis. Accordingly, the Group has developed specific analyses of the main risks faced by its business entities.

Given the rising internationalisation of the Group, there has been a progressive The sale prices of products are generally renegotiated semi-annually or increase of transactions in foreign currency as a percentage of total Group annually; as a result, Group companies may not be able to immediately pass on revenues. This situation exposes the Group to the risk of economic losses due to to customers changes in the prices of commodities that occur during the year, deteriorations in exchange rates. which has an impact on profitability.

In addition, the Group periodically monitors present/future patenting strategies on the basis of cost/opportunity assessments. 7 RISK RELATED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF TRADE RECEIVABLES The high concentration of sales to a small number of customers generates a concentration of the respective trade receivables, with a resulting increase in the negative impact on economic and financial results in the event of insolvency of a customer. In particular, given the structural difficulties of the household appliance sector in mature markets, it is possible that situations of financial difficulty and insolvency among customers could arise. RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES The risk is constantly monitored through the preliminary assessment of customers and checks that agreed payment terms are met. From November 2014, a credit insurance policy was taken out which covers approximately 60% of the credit risk. Key Change compared to RA 2014 A further portion is partly guaranteed through letters of credit issued by major banks in favour of customers.

SABAF ANNUAL REPORT 2015 SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 95 SABAF and the environment HEALTH AND SAFETY, DIALOGUE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY POLICY ASSOCIATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS Programme and objectives The Group has long promoted the dissemination of information about the lower environmental impact resulting from the use of gas in cooking instead of electricity. The Protecting workers’ health and safety, the environment, and ensuring the efficient and use of gas to generate heat offers far higher yields than those that can be obtained with rational use of natural and energy resources are part of Sabaf’s strategic commitments. electric cooking appliances. In addition, there is worldwide demand for increased power In terms of the processes for the production of gas cooker components, for our and multiple cooking points (plates/burners) to cook food quickly. An increase in electric organisation it is now an ongoing challenge to achieve labour standards that ensure the hobs would cause an increase in peak electricity consumption, typically around meal health and utmost safety of our staff and those who work on our behalf. An integral part times, further increasing electricity demand which is already difficult to meet. of this challenge is reducing environmental impacts and minimising the use of natural resources and energy, starting from the product design stage and through the different stages of production, with a view to the entire operational life cycle of the product. For this reason, Sabaf has adopted and applies an Integrated System for the PROCESS INNOVATION AND Management of Health, Safety, the Environment and Energy, which – in combination ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY with the other Management Systems at the company – provides an effective way to reduce risks, environmental impacts and energy use via the following means: Washing of metals • Ensuring continued full compliance with current laws and regulations and other voluntary standards, using these proactively for ongoing EHS&En process monitoring. The production process for valves requires the washing of metals in several phases. • Assessing EHS&En aspects before entering into the design phase, process changes Traditionally, the metals were washed using systems which use chlorine-based solvents. and purchasing goods and services.

The solution identified involves inserting machinery into the performance goals. production process; this machinery uses a washing system based on a modified alcohol, a solvent which can be re-distilled (and hence recycled). Sabaf is committed to pursuing the following objectives: With an investment of around €1,000,000, the replacement process resulted in the • Preventing pollution and minimising energy use by continuously improving its complete substitution of all of the Company’s washing machinery. processes and products, designing them to maximise the benefits deriving from The environmental impact and management costs have essentially eliminated. minimising their impacts on the environment and energy consumption. • Pursuing efficiencies in the use of natural and energy resources in the production phase, especially as regards water and energy consumption. • Reducing the quantity of waste produced and improving its quality in terms of Product marking hazardousness and reusability. Standards in force require products to be marked with a series of distinctive characteristics. Until now the printing has always been done using an ink-jet system: The environmental management system in place at the Ospitaletto plant (which this system makes it possible to print just three lines, with a pre-set number of accounts for around 80% of total Group production) has been ISO 14001 certified since characters for each line, and with an annual management cost of around €60,000 for 2003. ink, solvents and maintenance.

In the last three years, with an investment of €250,000, all the ink-jet requirements of the standard. systems have been replaced with fibre-optic laser marking systems, thereby eliminating As regards the audit conducted by third parties on the system, CSQ conducted its the management costs. renewal audit at the headquarters at Ospitaletto (May 2015), confirming that the system is effectively applied. In 2008, Sabaf S.p.A. obtained the Integrated Environmental Authorisation (IPPC) from the Region of Lombardy pursuant to Legislative Decree 59 of 18 February 2005. In 2015 the Ospitaletto site was certified compliant with ISO 50001 as regards reducing environmental impacts and restricting the use of natural and energy resources. 96 PRODUCT INNOVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Light alloy valves High-efficiency burners The production of aluminium alloy values offers several advantages over the production For many years Sabaf has been a pioneer in presenting to the market burners which of brass valves: elimination of the hot moulding step required by brass, reduced offer much higher yields than standard burners. After the launch of the Series III, AE lead content in the product, lower weight and consequently lower consumption for and AEO, from 2012 Sabaf introduced a new family of high-efficiency burners, the HE packaging and transport. The process to replace brass valves with light alloy valves burners, which achieve yields of up to 68%. The HE burners are also almost completely continued in 2015. Light alloy valves now account for over 70% of the valves produced. interchangeable with Series II burners. The DCC range of specialist burners was recently completed; these burners have energy efficiency of above 60%, the highest currently available on the market for burners with more than one ring of flame. High-efficiency burners already account for 13% of all burners produced. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Sabaf S.p.A. is classed as a downstream user of chemicals. The products supplied by Materials used and product recyclability Sabaf are classed as items that do not release substances during normal use, therefore the substances contained in them do not need to be registered. Sabaf has contacted Sabaf’s main product lines – valves, thermostats and burners for domestic gas cooking its suppliers to ensure that they comply fully with the REACH Regulation and to obtain appliances – feature high energy yields and optimal use of natural resources. The use of confirmation of compliance with pre-registration and registration requirements for the gas to generate heat offers far higher yields than those that can be obtained with electric chemicals used by them. Sabaf also constantly monitors new legislation derived from the cooking appliances. REACH Regulation, in order to identify and manage any new requirements in this area. Sabaf products are also easily recyclable, as they are made almost entirely of brass, aluminium alloys, copper and steel.

Exchange rate fluctuation risk RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE The Sabaf Group operates primarily in euro. However, transactions also take place in other currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the Brazilian real, the Turkish lira and the SEGMENT IN WHICH THE GROUP Chinese renminbi. Since sales in US dollars accounted for about 12% of consolidated revenue, the possible OPERATES depreciation against the euro and the real could lead to a loss in competitiveness on the markets in which sales are made in that currency (mainly South and North America). At 31 December 2015 the Group had forward sales contracts for a total of 5.2 million dollars, maturing until 31 December 2016. The Administration and Finance Department Risks related to the overall conditions of the economy constantly monitors forex exposure, the trend in exchange rates and the operational and trend in demand management of related activities.

The protracted nature of the European crisis, which has become systematic over the years, has had an impact on the transformation of the white goods industry, the sector in which the Sabaf group Risks associated with product responsibility operates. Indeed, the continuous contraction of demand on mature markets has been accompanied Sabaf products carry a high intrinsic risk in terms of safety. The Group’s great attention by a further concentration of end markets, a steady increase of sales volumes in emerging markets to product quality and safety has made it possible to avoid incidents caused by product and, finally, tougher competition, phenomena that require aggressive policies in setting sales prices. defects. Despite this, it is not possible to automatically exclude incidents of this nature. To cope with this situation, the Group aims to retain and reinforce its leadership position wherever In order to transfer the risk of third-party liability damage arising from malfunctioning possible through: of its products, Sabaf has signed insurance policies with a deductible of up to €10 • the launch of new products characterised by superior performance compared with market million per individual claim. standards, and tailored to the needs of the customer; • expansion on markets with high growth rates; • the maintenance of high quality and safety standards, which make it possible to differentiate the product through the use of resources and implementation of production processes that are not Protection of product exclusivity easily sustainable by competitors; • the improvement in efficiency of production processes. There is a risk that some Group products, although patented, will be copied by competitors; the opening up of trade in countries in which it is difficult to enforce industrial patent rights exposes the Group to a greater risk of protection of its own products. Sabaf’s business model therefore bases the protection of product exclusivity mainly on design capacity and the internal production of special machines used in manufacturing processes, which result from its unique know-how that competitors would find difficult to replicate. In any case, Sabaf has structured processes in place to manage innovation and protect intellectual property. In addition, the Group periodically monitors the patent strategies adopted/to be adopted based on the assessments of cost/opportunity. 5 Proposed dividend. SABAF ANNUAL REPORT 2015 REPORT ON OPERATIONS 113 In order to support this expansion process, the Sabaf Group is committed to defining Sales concentration risks suitable measures, which include the appropriate definition and formalisation of the spheres and responsibilities of management action, careful planning of activities in The Group is characterised by a strong concentration in its revenue, with 50% arising implementing new projects, and a detailed analysis of the regulatory environment in from sales to its ten biggest customers.

In particular, the necessary governance actions have over long periods, albeit usually regulated by agreements of less than one year, which been undertaken with regard to company organisation and systems of liability, control can be renewed and with no guaranteed minimum levels. and coordination. At the date of this report, there was no reason for the Group to foresee the loss of any significant clients in the coming months. Risks related to the potential resistance to change Trade receivable risk on the part of the organisation The Group operates in a market context whose dynamism is reflected on the organisation The high concentration of sales to a small number of customers, described in the and the processes. In this context, the Group may not be able to exploit the opportunities previous section, generates a concentration of the respective trade receivables, with offered by the market due to the potential resistance to change of the organisation. a resulting increase in the negative impact on economic and financial results in the To counter this risk, the Group has commenced initiatives aimed at raising awareness event of insolvency of a customer.

The risk is constantly monitored through the preliminary assessment of customers and checks that agreed payment terms are met. From November 2014, a credit insurance policy was taken out which covers approximately 70% of the credit risk. A further Risks relating to the loss of key staff and expertise portion is partly guaranteed through letters of credit issued by major banks in favour and the difficulty of replacing them of customers. The remainder of the receivable risk is covered by a doubtful account provision considered appropriate.

To mitigate this risk, the Group has launched policies to strengthen the most critical internal organisational structures and loyalty schemes, including the signing of nonRisk of instability in emerging countries competition agreements with key figures. in which the Group produces or sells 40% of Sabaf Group sales are made on markets outside Europe. Furthermore, products sold in Italy can be exported by customers in international markets, making the percentage of sales earned directly and indirectly from emerging economies more significant. The Group’s main markets outside Europe include North Africa, the Middle East and South America. Any embargoes or major political or economic instability, or changes in the regulatory and/or local law systems, or new tariffs or taxes imposed in the future could affect a portion of Group sales and the related profitability. To combat this risk, the Group has adopted a policy of diversifying investments at international level, setting different strategic priorities that, as well as business opportunities, also consider the different associated risk profiles. In addition, the Group monitors the economic and social performance of the target countries, also through a local network, in order to make strategic and investment decisions fully aware of the exposure to associated risks. Risks relating to the difficulties of sufficiently managing the Group’s internationalisation The Sabaf Group is continuing with its policy of expansion abroad, and is undergoing a process of growing internationalisation, with the opening of new companies and production facilities in countries considered strategic for the future development of its business. This process requires appropriate measures, which include the recruitment and training of management staff and the implementation of management and coordination measures by the parent company, the definition of the areas of action and responsibilities of each function involved, and the analysis of the legal context of the countries in which the subsidiaries have their registered office. 114 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT The most important research and development projects conducted in 2015 were In 2015 there was no: as follows: • damage caused to the environment for which the Group was held definitively responsible; Burners • definitive fines or penalties imposed on the Group for environmental crimes or • a specific solution was realised, characterised by an efficiency greater than 67%, of a damage.

These costs also include revaluations undertaken in the past recognised as assets when it is probable that use of the asset will generate future based on monetary revaluation rules or pursuant to company mergers. Depreciation economic benefits and when asset cost can be measured reliably. If it is considered that is calculated according to rates deemed appropriate to spread the carrying value of these future economic benefits will not be generated, the development costs are written tangible assets over their useful working life. Estimated useful working life, in years, down in the year in which this is ascertained. is as follows: Such assets are measured at purchase or production cost and if the assets concerned Buildings 33 have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The useful life of projects for which development costs are capitalised is Light constructions 10 estimated to be 10 years. The SAP management system is amortised over five years.

If there is any such indication, the recoverable amount of said assets is estimated so as to determine the total of the write-down. If it is not possible to estimate Vehicles and other transport means 4-5 recoverable value individually, the Group estimates the recoverable value of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. In particular, the recoverable value of the cash generating units (which generally coincide Ordinary maintenance costs are expensed in the year in which they are incurred; costs with the legal entity to which the capitalised assets refer) is verified by determining the that increase the asset value or useful working life are capitalised and depreciated value of use. The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling price and value of according to the residual possibility of utilization of the assets to which they refer. use. In measuring the value of use, future cash flows net of taxes, estimated based on Land is not depreciated. past experience, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax rate that reflects fair market valuations of the present cost of money and specific asset risk. The main assumptions used for calculating the value of use concern the discount rate, growth rate, expected changes in selling prices and cost trends during the period used for Leased assets the calculation. The growth rates adopted are based on future market expectations in Assets acquired via finance lease contracts are accounted for using the financial method the relevant sector.

The Group prepares operating cash flow such assets is reflected in the consolidated annual financial statements applying the forecasts based on the most recent budgets approved by the Boards of Directors of the same policy followed for Company-owned property, plant and equipment. Set against consolidated companies, draws up four-year forecasts and determines the terminal recognition of such assets, the amounts payable to the financial lessor are posted among value (current value of perpetual income), which expresses the medium and long term shortand medium-/long-term payables. In addition, financial charges pertaining to the operating flows in the specific sector. period are charged to the income statement. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be lower than its carrying value, the asset’s carrying value is reduced to the lower recoverable amount, recognising impairment of value in the income statement.

Reversal of impairment As regards acquisitions completed prior to the date of IFRS adoption, the Sabaf Group loss is recognised as income in the income statement. has used the option provided by IFRS 1 to refrain from applying IFRS 3 – concerning business combinations – to acquisitions that took place prior to the transition date. Consequently, goodwill arising in relation to past acquisitions has not been recalculated and has been posted in accordance with Italian GAAPs, net of amortisation reported up Investment properties to 31 December 2003 and any losses caused by a permanent value impairment. After the transition date, goodwill – as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful As allowed by IAS 40, non-operating buildings and constructions are assessed at cost life – is not amortised but subjected annually to impairment testing to check for value net of depreciation and losses due to cumulative impairment of value. The depreciation loss, or more frequently if there are signs that the asset may have suffered impairment criterion applied is the asset’s estimated useful life, which is considered to be 33 years. (impairment test). If the recoverable amount of investment property – determined based on the market value of the real estate – is estimated to be lower than its carrying value, the asset’s carrying value is reduced to the lower recoverable amount, recognising impairment of value in the income statement. When there is no longer any reason for a write-down to be maintained, the carrying value of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the new value stemming from the estimate of 128 its recoverable amount – but not beyond the net carrying value that the asset would have Post-employment benefit reserve had if it had not been written down for impairment of value. Reversal of impairment loss is recognised as income in the income statement.

If the recoverable amount of investment property – determined based on the market value of the real estate – is estimated to be lower than its carrying value, Use of these formats permits the most meaningful representation of the Company’s the asset’s carrying value is reduced to the lower recoverable amount, recognising capital, business and financial status. impairment of value in the income statement. When there is no longer any reason for a write-down to be maintained, the carrying value of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the new value stemming from the estimate of its recoverable amount – but not beyond the net carrying value that the asset would have ACCOUNTING POLICIES had if it had not been written down for impairment of value.

Such assets are measured at purchase or production cost and if the assets concerned have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The useful life of projects for which development costs are capitalised is Receivables estimated to be 10 years. The SAP management system is amortised over five years.

If there is any such indication, the recoverable amount of said assets is estimated so as to determine the total of the write-down. If it is not possible to estimate recoverable value individually, the Company Reserves for risks and contingencies estimates the recoverable value of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset Reserves for risks and contingencies are provisioned to cover losses and debts, the belongs. In particular, the recoverable value of the cash generating units (which existence of which is certain or probable, but whose amount or date of occurrence generally coincide with the legal entity to which the capitalised assets refer) is verified cannot be determined at the end of the year. Provisions are stated in the statement of by determining the value of use. The recoverable amount is the higher of the net selling financial position only when a legal or implicit obligation exists that determines the use price and value of use. In measuring the value of use, future cash flows net of taxes, of resources with an impact on profit and loss to meet that obligation and the amount estimated based on past experience, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax can be reliably estimated. If the effect is significant, the provisions are calculated by rate that reflects fair market valuations of the present cost of money and specific asset risk. updating future financial flows estimated at a rate including taxes such as to reflect The main assumptions used for calculating the value of use concern the discount rate, current market valuations of the current value of the cash and specific risks associated growth rate, expected changes in selling prices and cost trends during the period used with the liability. for the calculation.

Hedging is done using forward contracts, options or combinations of these instruments. Generally speaking, the maximum duration covered by such hedging does not exceed 18 months. The Company does not enter into speculative transactions. When the derivatives used for Commodity price risk management hedging purposes meet the necessary requisites, hedge accounting rules are followed. A significant portion of the Company’s acquisitions is represented by brass, steel and aluminium alloys.

Credit risk relating to customers operating in emerging economies is generally attenuated by the expectation of revenue through letters of credit. Liquidity risk management The Group operates with a low debt ratio (net financial debt / shareholders’ equity at 31 Forex risk management December 2015 of 26.3%, net financial debt / EBITDA of 1.57) and has unused shortterm lines of credit.

Interest rate risk management The Company borrows money at a floating rate; to reach an optimum mix of floating and fixed rates in the structure of the loans, the Company assesses whether to use derivative financial instruments.

The contract was not designated as a cash flow hedge and is therefore recognised using the “fair value in the income statement” method.
