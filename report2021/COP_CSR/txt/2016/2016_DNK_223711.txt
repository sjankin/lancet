The very first efforts to exploit these options were concentrated around scaling consumption to follow capacity and those efforts were continued in 2015. This basically means reducing excess resource expenditure, thereby saving money for the company as well as minimising impacts on the external environment. With data continually collected by the CTS and correct automatic settings, a high degree of such fine tuning is possible. ELIMINATION OF EXCESS COOLING FOR power consumption for cooling has been reduced by PRIMARY PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT at least 50%. A quite significant reduction. In terms of economy, the main achievement has been to shut off cooling water for our primary production As of yet, control of the valves is performed by opermachines individually, when they are not engaged in ators, but once the automatic valve control has been a production run.
