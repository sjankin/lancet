OUR PERFORMANCE 2015-2016 Enigma continued its drive for sustainability and compliance within the parameters of the UN Global Compact principles and integration with ISO 9001:2008, OHSAS 18001:2007, ISO 14001:2004 and Achilles accreditations. This was achieved while undergoing significant business growth. In March 2016 Enigma achieved a top rating and highest ever score of 151 points in the Security Industry Authority’s assessment scheme for Approved Contractors. This topped last year’s excellent score of 139 and for the first time moved Enigma into the top 5 % of all UK SIA Approved Security Contractors. Enigma maintained its excellent record in the area of Health and Safety for staff, clients and others affected by our operations. Over the past 12 months Enigma continued to refine its carbon reduction strategy (first implemented in 2010) by introducing more stringent monitoring and control measures in regard to waste reduction, recycling and CO2 output from vehicle/office fuel and energy use. Due to our concerted efforts at carbon reduction initiatives Enigma is well on course for a significant reduction in both waste and carbon emissions relative to the annual increase in business growth. This has been achieved partly by an emissions strategy involving more stringent vehicle monitoring; a staff reward system for planning and enacting vehicular mileage reduction; and the strict use (purchase and hire) of green award vehicles. Results show a substantial comparative reduction in Enigma’s overall carbon footprint between April 2013 and April 2016. We have established a long-term sustainability strategy with positive outcomes to be achieved for all strategic KPIs by 2020 (see end Chart). OBJECTIVES FOR 2016 – 2017 Enigma will aim to actively engage its employees and commercial contacts in the implementation of Enigma’s sustainability strategy. The objective is for all stakeholders to share in the responsibility and satisfaction of creating a healthier, more sustainable physical environment and more principled and sustainable social organisation. To assist in this development Enigma will actively encourage awareness programmes and the commitment of all stakeholders through the application of Enigma’s Sustainable Supplier Charter and through the development of Carbon Measurement in all aspects and links of Enigma’s business activities. As part of our community engagement, we will maintain our arrangements with the Social Landlord and Regenerations Charity in London enabling disadvantaged people to gain valuable employment training and certification via our training partner. Enigma will aim to improve financial support to various youth sporting groups in different regions of the UK. Glen Webley Chief Executive Officer Page 1 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 Our Mission …is to achieve profitable growth while making the world a better place. To succeed in our mission Enigma believe that we must plan our business growth based on a comprehensive sustainability strategy which integrates the United Nation’s ten principles relating to human rights, labour governance, the environment and anti-corruption. On Human Rights Principle 1 Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2 Business must ensure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. The aim of the Enigma Group is to communicate to all its employees, business connections and communities in which we operate our commitment to respect and uphold human rights. We endeavour to observe and promote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all people and all nations. The guidelines and conventions of the United Nations and International Labour Organisation on the Rights of the Child are also fundamental to instructing our policy provisions. Commitment • Enigma human rights policy • Enigma Group ethical code for all our suppliers Implementation • Enigma employs a widely diverse workforce who are guaranteed an “equality for all” policy to prevent discrimination in hiring, promotion and work conditions based on race, caste, colour, national origin, sex, age, religion, disability, marital status, actual or perceived sexual orientation, employment status or political affiliation. We endeavour to ensure that employees of subcontractors and our suppliers have similar guarantees against discrimination. Enigma also expects that all of our employees and those of associated companies are able to work in an environment free of physical, psychological and verbal abuse and harassment, and in an environment free of the threats of such abuse and harassment. • Enigma has a published statement on human rights which is implemented through internal management systems and staff training, both introductory and ongoing. In March 2011 Enigma introduced a formal, periodic revision course for employees with more than 12 months company service. This course is now given to each employee at 12 monthly intervals and covers policy statements and job-specific information. It is to now continuously, along with other training and updates, as required. The course aims to ensure awareness of content and of changes to the initial induction training that all employees are traditionally given at the beginning of their employment. • Enigma’s employment handbook and site instruction booklets include all Policy Statements including those based on ethical commitments and legislative requirements. Appropriate procedures for implementation of policy are also comprehensively described. The Policy Statements and procedures are checked and reviewed on an annual basis at a minimum and are upgraded if and when necessary. Page 2 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 • Whereas Enigma has long had a broad mix of employees from varying national and ethnic backgrounds, our gender mix was poor due to the traditional male dominance of our core business. In January 2011 we introduced new recruitment procedures which helped to almost double the number of female employees from 7% to 13% of the total workforce by mid-2011, and 19% by March 2014. • Enigma endeavours to provide enhanced working conditions regarding safety, comfort, and the ability to profitfor its employees. This is a prime consideration when applying for contracts and increasingly this is a strict requirement from clients seeking to contract products and services from providers. It is Enigma’s policy to only seek work contracts from clients adhering to UN principles in their own Corporate Social Responsibility/Sustainability Policy. • Enigma has implemented a proactive information, advice and complaints structure for through the provision of: a) 24 hour local management contactphone and internet b) 24 hour national management contact (through our ARC centre) • To ensure Global Impact principles are incorporated in Enigma’s sustainability strategy and operations, a management committee has been established. This is chaired by our CEO and includes two directors and Enigma’s Compliance Manager. This committee is linked to all operational issues regarding aims of improving work and living conditions under the umbrella of sustainability. The development of sustainable communities and workforce, best practice health and safety procedures, natural resource protection and environmental enhancement, are the essential priorities. All key business areas are represented at the committee which is given external specialist advice from SSAIB and Achilles. The committee in turn reports to Enigma directors who set sustainable practices throughout Enigma. • Enigma’s ethical code for suppliers highlights all ten principles of the UN Global Compact to which our suppliers are expected to adhere to throughout their operations. Enigma has linked this to the ISO. 9001.2008 quality assurance manual, and is documented, audited and reviewed. See Enigma’s Sustainable Suppliers Charter (below). Page 3 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 Page 4 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 On Labour Principle 3 Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4 Business should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5 Business should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. Principle 6 Business should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Commitment • Managing equality and diversity policy • Enigma code of conduct • Enigma ethical code of conduct Implementation • Enigma’s written Code of Conduct and Policy Statements provide a clear outline to all employees, of policies, procedures, and boundaries of various aspects of employment relating to terms, conditions and conduct that must be adhered to. Together they inform that Enigma supports all legislative and applicable common law and regulations concerning an individual’s right to freedom of association and right to Collective Bargaining. They also inform that no employee should be expected to work below national wage and benefit standards, or under forced, unsafe, or unsatisfactory conditions; or that any employee, at any level, should allow anything to compromise their own commitment to Enigma’s health & safety, environment, and social policies. • All employees can access our national ARC centre on a 24 hour basis either to request information and advice, or otherwise to report or raise concerns over possible breaches in policy, conduct and other standards. • Enigma provides all staff with a risk assessment (including hazard identification) and an environmental impact assessment for their particular place of employment. These assessments are reviewed at regular intervals with a compulsory minimum 12 month re-assessment period and comply with British Standards OHSAS 18001:2007 and ISO 14001:2004. • Enigma applies quantitative testing in the recruitment process as an anti-discrimination measure. Two tests are given: one for literacy and the other for industry-specific knowledge. They were introduced in 2011 in order to increase objectivity and to help eliminate undesired (including unintentional) discrimination. From the time of introduction there has significant improvement in our female to male staff ratio. Enigma aims to continue this development of greater gender equality in the company and our HR Department in 2016 has an even balance of male and female staff. • Enigma through their ISO 9001:2008 accreditation has asserted minimum expected ethical standards for suppliers through 2011 to June 2015 (See Enigma’s Ethical Code and Sustainable Suppliers Charter). This is documented, audited and reviewed based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact covering the area of human rights, labour rights, environmental protection, bribery and corruption, and sets out the standards that are expected from all suppliers engaged by Enigma.

In 2013, there was a slight rise in H & S enquiries due to contract expansion involving isolated workplaceswhich has been addressed. Note that almost all enquiries regarding “Unsuitable Workplace Behaviour” and Theft/Fraud involved either client staff or the public. The increase in “Personal Issues” enquiries may be part explained by the introduction of a computerised employee information and roster management system into the Control Room in January 2012. A dual increase seems to have developed in the overall frequency of calls from employees due to the increased role of Control Room staff in altering rosters and reporting personal issues raised by employees to HR and Managers – which was all part of Enigma’s aim to improve access for employees seeking advice and to enable a more comprehensive and rapid response of staff deployment in Contingency/Continuity and Sustainability Planning.

Page 7 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 On The Environment Principle 7 Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8 Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibilities. Principle 9 Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Commitment • Enigma Environmental Policy: The environmental objective of Enigma is to provide effective environmental awareness and control, seeking to continually improve all aspects of its environmental performance within its sphere of operation as far as is economically viable. Implementation • Enigma will endeavour to care for the environment through continual review and improvement to working practices relating to environmental impacts. • Enigma will comply with the requirements of relevant legislation and regulations. • Enigma will encourage the efficient use of energy, materials, products and services together with minimising and eliminating pollution and waste wherever possible. • Enigma will apply health and safety considerations throughout all activities. • Enigma will provide employee awareness training in its environmental policy and procedures. • Enigma has established shared environmental objectives with clients and suppliers. • Enigma employees, directors and consultants are required to carefully consider environmental issues when making decisions in the planning, controlling and execution of work for the company. • In July 2011, Enigma approved the purchase of a fleet of new “green award” cars for managers, supervisors, and mobile response drivers. These cars which included electronic/fuel hybrids have significantly reduced fuel costs and Enigma’s carbon footprint. This reduction is expected to continue over the next few years as new improved additions to the fleet were made in late 2012 and early 2013. Furthermore, in April 2016, a new fleet of cars were purchased by Enigma – 2 x Kia Sportages and 2 x Kia Cee’ds – these cars are specifically designed to be more economical and fuel efficient as part of the ECO dynamics model range. The key to EcoDynamics is the state-of-the-art Intelligent 'Stop and Go' technology, which switches off the engine whenever the car is stationary, cutting down on fuel usage and CO2 emissions. The cars also have energy saving tyres which reduce fuel usage through less road friction, The gearshift indicator advises on the most fuel efficient points to change gear ensuring minimal engine wear and tear. Finally the Kia Cee’d and Sportage models were produced in Zilina, Slovakia; Kia’s first European plant: which meets the highest environmental standards at every stage of the manufacturing process. • Enigma has operated an intensive office recycling programme for several years. This has led to a now very refined division of all office waste (for example: high grade white paper; mixed white paper; newspaper; coloured paper) and a methodical procedure ensuring an almost 100% recycling score for all recyclable waste materials. Page 8 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 • Through a policy change first initiated in 2010, approximately 95% of Enigma employees were receiving information and rota bulletins by email as opposed to post by July 2011. By 30th June 2014, this figure had risen to 100% which also includes Employee Pay Slips and Monthly Newsletters. • As part of its carbon reduction initiatives, Enigma established teleconferencing as the default format for management meetings and by June 2014, the 85% target for inter-branch meets was achieved and has since risen to 92% in 2015. • Enigma’s environmental policy implementation will be based on BS. ISO 9001: 2008 and ISO 14001:2004. • Enigma was first assessed 31st March 2009 for accreditation by Achilles UVDB category B2 and certificated, and has been successfully reviewed annually through to 2016 (Supplier number 056588).

In 2012 the conversion factor given for Diesel was x 2.58 and Petrol x 2.24. (Defra Annex Tables 1b & 6a; also see Calculators National Energy Foundation and Carbon Footprint Ltd for comparable figures). Note that these Conversion Factors differ from those used to determine emissions per km or mile driven per vehicle type and size. 2) The Electricity factor 0.52 is obtained from Defra’s tables, as advised, for Converting Purchased Electricity/ Grid Rolling Average, KgCO2e per kWh, Annex Table 3c. Source: Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Guidelines for Defra/Decc GHG Conversion Factors for Company Requirements, 2012. Enigma has reduced kWh each year between 2012-13 and 201516. Past and Future Strategy: Emissions Defra provide conversion factors for Passenger Road Transport/Units travelled (km and miles) according to car type and size and fuel used. They also provide conversion factors for other modes of transport (air, rail, sea) and road freight. Conversion factors most relevant/applicable to Enigma’s ability to adopt more efficient energy use would include the following (For Total Direct GHG in kgCO2e per mile). Page 10 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 Small Petrol Car to 1.4 litre x 0.265 per mile Medium Petrol Car to 1.4-2.0 x0.334 per litre mile Small Diesel Car to 1.7 litre x0.230 per mile Medium Diesel Car 1.72.0 litre x0.285 per mile Medium Hybrid x 0.187 per mile National Rail (av. per passenger) x0.093 per (0.0582 per km) mile Domestic Air Travel (av. per x0.267 per (0.1668 per km) Greater distances allow passenger) mile increased efficiency London Underground x0.116 per (0.0719 per km) mile From the above data it is evident that average emissions by Medium Hybrid cars are lowest, followed by Small Diesels. London Underground and National Rail are shown to produce less GHG per person than car travel for cars occupied by drivers only. Enigma has used this information, similarly available prior to 2012, to assist in deciding purchases of new vehicles (in 2011, 2012 and again in early 2014, as has been required in our expanding business) and also in organising travel arrangements between London, Newcastle/Middlesbrough and other areas of the UK. Enhanced teleconference arrangements have also been instituted over the past two years. Page 11 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 From January 2010 to December 2014, Enigma’s Emissions tonnage grew from 110.4 to 150.6 tonnes. Enigma’s car fleet grew from six cars to fourteen in 2014, with additional use of short term car hire. New eco rated cars were first bought in 2012. Four of the new cars were Medium Toyota Prius Hybrids; five were small diesels (1.3 litre ecoflex active). Enigma made further purchases of Hybrid cars in 2013 and restricted the use of hired cars to eco models. Enigma also introduced a more rigorous analysis of miles and fuel purchases/ fuel types used for all vehicles. The eco cars have significantly impacted on fuel usage and carbon footprint within a period of rapid growth. In spite of significant staff increases and more than doubling of the vehicle fleet in between 2010 and 2016, emissions increase was only around 30% and the office carbon print dropped 10%. The emissions ratio reduction with vehicles continued as expected in 2014-2016 as newer and more efficient technology and car usage was deployed. In fact, emissions fell across the board this past year, with lower usage of both diesel and petrol, in spite of only a very slight drop in mileage. Further gains may be made in regard to both consumption and mileage requirements. Furthermore, in April 2016, a new fleet of cars were purchased by Enigma – 2 x Kia Sportages and 2 x Kia Cee’ds – these cars are specifically designed to be more economical and fuel efficient as part of the ECO dynamics model range. The key to EcoDynamics is the state-of-the-art Intelligent 'Stop and Go' technology, which switches off the engine whenever the car is stationary, cutting down on fuel usage and CO2 emissions. The cars also have energy saving tyres which reduce fuel usage through less road friction, The gearshift indicator advises on the most fuel efficient points to change gear ensuring minimal engine wear and tear. Finally the Kia Cee’d and Sportage models were produced in Zilina, Slovakia; Kia’s first European plant: which meets the highest environmental standards at every stage of the manufacturing process. Page 12 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 On Anti-Corruption Principle 10 Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Commitment • Enigma Code of Conduct. Due to its primary involvement in the security industry business Enigma, as both a company organisation and a group of people, has a duty to fulfil strict legal and social obligations relating to all forms of corruption and illegality. This duty is accepted in accord with the underlying principles and technical requirements of both UK and internationally acclaimed law. Implementation • Enigma’s Code of Conduct addresses issues of bribery and corruption. As detailed in the Enigma Employment Handbook & the Enigma Instruction Manuals, employees are both protected and encouraged to raise concerns about possible or known acts of corruption. Legal protection is assured under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. • As a provider of both manned and CCTV security services Enigma carries a great deal of responsibility in the management of public behaviour and Data Protection. Enigma staff are expected to act with enhanced sensibility and unquestionable integrity at all times. • Enigma is often obliged to carry out internal investigations and provide reports for incidents of suspected criminality involving the property and viability of businesses belonging to clients. These incidents generally involve theft and unlawful property damage but may also include forms of corruption including trade in illegal services and also stolen and/or counterfeit goods. See Table C for percent of incidents resolved to the satisfaction of both Enigma and Client. Note that this past year has also proved very satisfying in terms of increased business with reduced Incidents of Suspected Criminality being reported.

Page 15 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 Our Sustainability Strategy Enigma first established a Sustainability Management Committee in 2010. It was chaired by the CEO and included the senior management team with advice given by external specialist organisations such as “Kelvin Holmes Associates” who have links to the UK government’s Sustainability Development Commission and “Achilles” who are strongly involved in the UN Global Compact. The SSAIB is also used to gain advice through their Business Leaders Forum in which key players meet regularly to share best practice information and to develop sustainability plans and objectives for Enigma. The Sustainability Management Committee refined the company’s strategic direction and targets using input from all operational groups within the company. To help clarify the company’s sustainability policy vision a long-term strategy model was developed to illustrate the links between Key Performance Indicators and Enigma’s Corporate Objectives. After several intensive discussions thirteen key performance indicators (KPI’s) were established by the committee to measure progress and an independent audit procedure was set up. This was via external auditors using our BS 9001:2008, ISO 14001 2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007 systems. See the Enigma Chart: Value through Sustainability & Strategic KPIs. Our strategy will be delivered by: • Generating a culture that actively encourages and communicates best sustainable practices. • Ensuring the real involvement of all our people, our supply chain and stakeholders. • Conducting our business in accordance with our core values of openness, collaboration, mutual dependency, professional delivery, innovation, sustainable and profitable growth. Health & Safety and Sustainability As part of Enigma’s integrated approach to sustainability, a management based Health & Safety cultural assessment was incorporated in its strategy as part of a structured framework with which to assess Health and Safety across Enigma’s business. This assessment continues to form the structure for driving Health and Safety improvements, including those in Enigma’s supply chain. The assessment is based on four key elements: • Awareness. “All our people and stakeholders have an awareness and understanding of Health & Safety hazards and risks that affect our people and business”. • Competence. “All our people and stakeholders have the competence to undertake their work with minimum risks to Health and Safety”. • Compliance. “Our work activities achieve compliance with legislation, and our people are empowered to take action to minimise Health and Safety risks”. • Excellence. “Enigma is recognised for excellence in the way it manages Health and Safety”. These four elements of Awareness, Competence, Compliance and Excellence form the framework for Enigma to: • Facilitate the management of Health and Safety excellence. • Communicate the Health and Safety policy, objectives, procedures, guidance, plans and performance.
