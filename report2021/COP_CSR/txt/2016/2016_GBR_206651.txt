57 Appendix 1.0 UNGC Compliance 59 iv 1 Introduction The following sets out the overall principles, boundaries, scope and methodologies applied when reporting sustainability data in the Sustainability Report and this Annual Data Report 1.1 Scope  The report covers the period from 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015  Data is reported where Shaftesbury has operational or management influence. This includes all assets 100% owned by Shaftesbury as well as the joint venture at Longmartin. This represents 100% of the portfolio by value.  It should be noted that it is not possible to report performance data for the portfolio broken down by use (offices, retail, restaurant and residential). This is due to the following: o The portfolio is divided into ‘villages’ i.e. Carnaby, Soho, Covent Garden (Opera Quarter and Seven Dials), Charlotte Street (reported as part of Opera Quarter) and Chinatown managed by the different agents – Capita, CBRE and MJ Mapp, which each supply the data for their part of the portfolio. For this reason the data for Covent Garden is reported separately as Seven Dials and Opera Quarter. o Each ‘village’ has a mix of uses which are often in the same building with shared landlord controlled areas and services, hence it is not possible to attribute energy, water and waste data to the specific use classes.  Data is reported for all refurbishment projects above £100,000 capital value, which represents over 90% of the total commissioned projects in the reporting period.  Data from properties acquired during the reporting period are reported from the date of purchase.  In 2014-2015 the total investment portfolio comprised by value o 36% retail o 33% restaurants o 16% offices 1 o 15% residential Of this 4.2% by income was in development.  All the portfolio is located in central London.  Environmental performance data is reported on a like-for-like basis in line with EPRA reporting guidelines.  The detailed scope, boundaries, calculation methodologies and data are provided within each data reporting section. 1.2 Company Overview Village Area Sq Feet Carnaby Shops 181,000 Restaurants 97,000 Offices 251,000 Residential 54,000 Covent Garden Shops 137,000 Restaurants 162,000 Offices 83,000 Residential 126,000 1 Longmartin Shops 67,000 Restaurants 45,000 Offices 102,000 Residential 55,000 Chinatown Shops 89,000 Restaurants 203,000 Offices 39,000 Residential 71,000 Soho Shops 40,000 1 In previous reporting years this was referred to as St Martin’s Courtyard. 2 Village Area Sq Feet Restaurants 55,000 Offices 35,000 Residential 36,000 Charlotte Street Shops 9,000 Restaurants 42,000 Offices 10,000 Residential 21,000 Total 2,010,000 1.3 Reporting Standards 1.3.1 European Real Estate Association Relevant environmental data has been reported, where possible, following the European Real Estate Association Best Practice Recommendations on Sustainability Reporting, September 2014 (EPRA BPR). Below is the list of the EPRA Sustainability Performance measures and where these are reported.

The following parameters have been used to determine what is included within the reporting boundaries in terms of landlord and tenant consumption:  All properties where Shaftesbury has sole ownership and operational control through the managing agents listed below have been included. The joint venture at Longmartin is a 50% equity share but is within Shaftesbury’s operational control and therefore, to accord with best practice, all the data is included within the overall calculations.  Any gas boilers that provide heating to both common and tenanted areas have been included where the heating plant is within the control of the managing agents working for Shaftesbury. These are identified within the relevant data tables.  Twenty properties within Carnaby have been identified this year as including landlord purchased gas. These have not been reported previously and hence year commencement meter readings were not available for 2014-15. These, however, will be included in 2015-2016 report.  All electricity supplies that serve plant e.g lifts, common area lighting and power where the equipment is within the control of Shaftesbury rather 4 than the occupier. In some cases the meters supply occupied areas as well as landlord areas. This is not sub metered so is recorded as part of Shaftesbury’s consumption and is identified as whole building. Buildings that include external lighting consumption are also identified.  Data for usage of air conditioning units, where installed, is supplied for all landlord controlled parts of the portfolio apart from Chinatown where for three buildings: Newport Sandringham, one on Gerrard Street and one on Rupert Street the agent did not supply data.  Water supplies that supply common and tenanted areas of the property where we have responsibility for the water supply.  Waste collected from properties where Shaftesbury controls the waste collection rather than the occupier.  Head office data for energy and waste at 22 Ganton Street. Water data is not available but it is an objective to obtain the data.  Refurbishment site data for material use, energy data and waste generation. Energy data was reported for 14 out of 18 sites (3 were on landlord supply) but water data is not currently reported.  Biodiversity data is collected for 100% of the managed portfolio. 1.4.2 Intensity normalization  Properties are only included in intensity measures where they provide both consumption data for the entire reporting year and a robust denominator i.e. floor area.  With respect to the energy purchased by Shaftesbury, the amount is identified by the managing agents but historically apportioning this to specific floor areas is difficult due to the common part areas not generally being measured and in some cases the energy consumption figures also include external lighting which potentially distorts attempts at normalisation. Progressive measurement of the portfolio since 2013 means that the actual floor areas are now available in Carnaby, Seven Dials and Chinatown. This covers approximately 46% (62 buildings out of 135) of the buildings that have common parts only and provide a representative sample to assess the intensity measure.  Any buildings that have data for whole building consumption can be assessed against the Gross Internal Area measure.  Any buildings that include external lighting within the reporting do not have an intensity measure determined for them. 1.4.3 Third Party Assurance Since 2012, the greenhouse emissions data has been verified by independent auditing firm Planet & Prosperity Ltd and the relevant verification statements are on the Shaftesbury website www.shaftesbury.co.uk. 5 1.4.4 Data Restatement The greenhouse gas emissions require a restatement for 2013-2014 of a reduction of 46.3 tonnes of Scope 1 emissions and an increase of 147.82 in Scope 2 emissions, attributable to the below:  In Carnaby an increase of 84,475 kWh electricity consumption due to anomalous meter readings for four properties in this part of the portfolio. This equates to 41.75 tonnes of CO2e.  In Longmartin, buildings on Mercer Street and Slingsby Place were mistakenly omitted by the agent as these were subject to a separate billing system. This results in an additional 213,332 kWh of electricity equivalent to 105.44 tonnes of CO2e. In addition, gas consumption at the Slingsby Place building was overstated by 250,529 kWh equivalent to a reduction of 46.3 tonnes of CO2e due to mistaken inclusion of tenants consumption.  In Opera Quarter an increase in electricity of 1253 kwh equivalent to 0.62 tonnes – which was misreported last year by the agent. 1.5 Community Investment and Charitable Contribution 1.5.1 Measurement and Benchmarking Shaftesbury joined the London Benchmarking Group (LBG) five years ago. LBG seeks to ensure a consistent approach in the measurement of benchmarking of community investment. We have followed the LGB framework and the principles adopted in relation to our reporting are set out below. 1.5.2 Inputs With only 25 employees, the majority of the contributions are in the form of cash to other organisations and/or activities. The Sustainability Policy identifies how we spend our charity and community engagement budget. Cash We support many different charities which are located in or near our portfolio. We have supported 94 different charitable projects or events this year. Small to large, the individual donations range from £50 £65,000. This enables us to establish long term and effective relationships with local charities and organisations. This year, we have also established 4 charity partners – one for each of our villages. 6 Time Where employees contribute time during working hours, this is recorded on an agreed cost basis rather than actual salary. Management Costs We employ a part time member of staff for whom co-ordination of fundraising events forms approximately 75% of her time. The company secretary also oversees community engagement. The average employee cost calculated for time is applied to these roles to generate a management cost In-Kind We often provide space for charities or educational establishments in our empty properties across our portfolio. This can be for oneoff “pop-up’ events or for longer periods of time. We account only for the cost of providing services to these spaces and not for the rent that would have been incurred if the organisation was paying the market rate for the space. We allocate an LBG agreed benchmark cost per square foot per day. We also pay the cost of any additional services such as electricity of the area that is paid for by us and would otherwise not have been consumed. 1.5.3 Value of Contributions The value of our contributions is presented as a percentage of EPRA pre-tax profit. 1.5.4 Outputs and Impacts Because we support many smaller causes, it is often difficult to capture the outputs and impacts made as a result of our contributions. We have adopted the LBG Guidance where possible as below. Community Outputs Where possible, we have measured and included the number of people directly reached or supported and the number of organisation’s supported by our activities. In some cases we have estimated the number of people impacted but where there is insufficient information to justify an estimate, we have not included a number. Leverage We have where possible reported resources contributed to community organisations and activities that come from outside of Shaftesbury as a result of our own direct contributions, encouragement and/or support. 7 Community Investment Not Included in the LBG Benchmark We have taken into account the two key principles identified within the LBG Methodology when deciding whether or not to include activity in the benchmark data and only activity that is both voluntary and charitable in nature is included. Activity that falls outside these parameters is recorded separately. Mandatory Contributions Where a contribution is mandated by a third party, such as local planning authority via Section 106 Agreements, it is excluded from the LBG Benchmark data we report but we report it in our overall figures separately in this report. 8 2 Overview of Key Performance Indicators Performance Area Key Performance Indicator 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 Yes Regional Yes Listing on FTSE4Good Yes Yes Leader UK Score 4.5/5 Yes Yes Yes Listing on Dow Jones Sustainability Index Yes Score 65% Score 68% Score 61% Stakeholder Engagement Yes Yes Leadership Index Not available Participation in Carbon Disclosure Project Yes Disclosure score 87 Disclosure score 88 Performance B Performance B Yes Yes Participation in Global Real Estate Sustainable Yes Yes 57% 72% Benchmarking 3rd of 9 in peer group 3rd of 24 in peer group Proportion of Employee that are female 45% 52% 52% 56% Employees Proportion of females in managerial grade 50% 50% 50% 50% 25% inc.

We recognise that our key sustainability risks and opportunities can be summarised as follows:  Environment: the re-use and careful management of existing buildings is intrinsically sustainable. In addition, the further reduction in the running costs of the buildings and improving their operational efficiencies is essential to attract tenants as well as meet future regulatory requirements.  Suppliers: working closely with their suppliers enables us to control our potentially most significant indirect impacts and facilitate better standards of service.  Employees: investing in the welfare and development of our employees ensures high standards of performance and low turnover of staff.  Stakeholders: engaging with our tenants, investors and principal advisors ensures that we are aware of their expectations and can respond accordingly. In particular, working with tenants to identify ways in which they can use our buildings more efficiently and operate in a more sustainable manner.  Community: our business strategy is focused on London’s West End, and its long term prosperity depends on its success as an unrivalled destination for domestic and international visitors, a prosperous location for businesses and a pleasant environment for residents. Therefore, the support of charitable and community organisations which focus their activities in the West End is extremely important. The company has a robust Sustainability Policy which is reviewed annually by the Board and is available to the public on the company website. Brian Bickell, Chief Executive, has overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Policy through the supporting Action Plan. Below Boardlevel, individuals are identified for the implementation of specific aspects of the Policy through the annually updated Action Plan and this includes managing agents and project managers working on the portfolio on our behalf. Penny Thomas, as Company Secretary, reports directly to the Chief Executive and the Board and coordinates the reporting and progress of the Action Plan. In support of the overall Sustainability Policy are appended various other policies including those relating to bribery and anti-corruption, equal opportunities, health & safety and whistleblowing. 12 SHAFTESBURY ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SIGNPOST DOCUMENT POLICY CSR Policy includes Environmental Policy commitments www.shaftesbury.co.uk/corporateresponsibility/index.html PLAN CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT Risk Assessment including Legal Register forms part of annual Corporate Responsibility Audit PLAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW Objectives and Targets and Management Annual Corporate Responsibility seminar Programme are reviewed and updated attended by all senior management including annually as the Corporate Responsibility the Chief Executive and first tier suppliers.

This includes the management of our portfolio on a daily basis and the refurbishment of new properties. If not responsibly managed, we could inadvertently contribute to significant environmental impacts, through factors such as the use of energy at these sites, waste produced and materials used. We employ agents to manage the portfolio and project managers to oversee the refurbishment activities. The company has systems set up in order to integrate environment and social / ethical factors into the procurement process of new services and into the ongoing work of our long-term contractors and sub contractors as set out on following page. 3.1.2 Reporting Chain Retained Sustainability Consultant 14 Policy Action Plan Investment Specification & Legal Guide Construction CCS Tenants Pack SRA Data Collation Checklist Due Diligence Checklist Annual Audit Annual Sustainability Seminar Report Verification 15 Management of Sustainability issues in the reporting year throughout the supply chain has included the following: 3.1.3 Contractual Information  Key information relating to sustainability requirements is included within contractual information throughout the supply chain.  Shaftesbury’s Estate Management Services Specification includes clauses requiring the contractor to act in accordance with our environmental and sustainability policies and to ensure all contactors, consultants and advisors engaged on the portfolio are aware of and observe the policies. 3.1.4 Use of Sustainability Policy  Issued to all key advisors.  Included as standard in all contract documentation issued by the project managers for refurbishment projects.  Issued by the project managers to subcontractors working on refurbishment projects above a capital sum of £100,000.  Issued by the managing agents to key subcontractors working on the managed portfolio.  Issued to commercial tenants as part of the tenant’s pack. 3.1.5 Use of Contractor’s Induction Leaflet  Issued by the project managers to all subcontractors working on refurbishment projects.  Issued by the managing agents to contractors working for the managed portfolio. 3.1.6 Annual Sustainability Audit  Undertaken annually each year by external advisors, RPS, and includes interviews with Shaftesbury personnel, managing agents and project managers as well as sample site visits.  The managing agents are required to sign a Management Representation Letter attesting to the quality and robustness of the data they provide and acknowledging their responsibilities for accounting and Quality Assurance. 16 3.1.7 Annual Sustainability Seminar  Annual presentation of findings of the sustainability audit to all Shaftesbury personnel and all project managers, managing agents and other key advisors working on our portfolio, which provides both a training exercise as well as an opportunity to agree achievable objectives and targets for the forthcoming year. 3.1.8 Use of the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS)  All refurbishment schemes above a capital value of £100,000 are required to sign up. Principal contractor companies are also expected to register as a company with the CCS. Compliance with the Code incorporates a number of factors including environmental and social considerations important to the overall sustainability goals.  Compliance with the scheme involves achieving a score of 25/50 and Shaftesbury sets a more stringent target for its contractors of 30/50. 3.1.9 Use of Checklists / Legislation Guides  Issued at the opening meeting of each refurbishment project by the project managers and updated regularly to reflect new legislation and best practice. The checklists are completed during the course of the project and the project team is also required to submit supporting documents, such as the CCS audit report, waste Duty of Care information, Chain of Custody information for timber etc. Checklists include an overall reporting checklist, a contractor’s checklist and a specification checklist. Legislation guides are also provided. 3.1.10 Use of BREEAM  It is a company objective that any new build office development will aim to achieve Building Research Establishment’s Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) Very Good. Whilst we do not require the formal certification of refurbishment schemes to BREEAM, the subcontractor checklists are designed to follow the principles of the scheme and to encourage environmental and social factors to be considered during design, specification and refurbishment works. 17 4 Environment 4.1 Energy Managed Portfolio 4.1.1 Energy Consumption EPRA Elec-Abs & Fuels-Abs Electricity and Natural Gas Consumption for Wholly Owned Portfolio (kWh) Total number of 2014 2015 % properties 2014-15 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 change Head Office 1 70,642 79,471 101,795 84,216 99,797 19% Carnaby 827,184 791,246 843,473 788,808 814,631 3% 66 Carnaby (Gas) 67,015 Seven Dials 39 792,693 717,995 774,995 893,770 856,967 -4% Chinatown 113,736 135,243 165,691 255,205 293,212 15% Usage 38 Chinatown (Gas) 10,854 9,988 -8% (KWh) Opera Quarter (Gas) 279,523 155,454 292,698 170,765 220,026 29% 41 Opera Quarter (Electricity) 224,659 235,178 243,324 214,401 240,728 12% Soho 20 35,628 28,539 26,186 68,702 50,196 -27% Longmartin 740,454 730,414 529,279 736,609 759,510 3% Longmartin (Gas) 12 185,532 170,044 182,377 47,192 48,908 4% Longmartin (Solar) 2,086 5,642 5,322 7,046 8,707 24% Total 217 3,272,137 3,049,226 3,165,140 3,277,568 3,469,685 6% Total without Solar 3,270,051 3,043,584 3,159,818 3,270,522 3,460,978 6% 18 Energy Usage for Wholly Owned Portfolio and Head Office 3,600,000 3,500,000 3,400,000 3,300,000 Usage (KWh) 3,200,000 Energy Totals 3,100,000 3,000,000 2,900,000 2,800,000 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Year Breakdown of Portfolio Reporting Structure Total number of properties 2015 2015 Common parts 36 152,163 External Lighting Chinatown Whole Building 2 141049 (Electricity) Whole Building (gas) 1 9988.00 19 Total number of properties 2015 2015 Common parts 20 50196 External Lighting Soho Whole Building (Electricity) Whole Building (gas) Common parts 12 48,481 External Lighting Charlotte Street Whole Building (Electricity) Whole Building (gas) 1 56,071 Common parts 13 110,103 External Lighting 16 82,144 Covent Garden Whole Building (Electricity) Whole Building (gas) 2 163,955 Common parts 13 15,772 External Lighting 25 825,908 Seven Dials Whole Building 1 15,287 (Electricity) Whole Building (gas) Common parts 41 563,534 External Lighting 18 113,183 Whole Building 3 12,036 (Electricity) Carnaby Whole Building (gas) 2 67015 common parts meter 85957 external lighting & 5 common parts split external lighting meter 39921 Common Parts Longmartin External Lighting 12 759,510 Whole Building (Electricity) 20 Total number of properties 2015 2015 Whole Building (Gas) 2 48,908 Total Common Parts 135 1,026,206 Total External Lighting 71 1,820,666 Total Whole Building 6 168,372 (Electricity) Total Whole Building 8 345,937 (Gas) Total 225 3,361,181 NB: Excludes Head office and Longmartin solar. Data Commentary Shaftesbury moved offices to 22 Ganton Street in February 2014. The data reported is the first full year and has shown a 19% increase against last year. The use of energy within the managed portfolio is in the main the responsibility of tenants with the exception of common areas which include stair well lights and occasionally lifts. A number of buildings particularly in Carnaby and Seven Dials include external street lighting as indicated in the table above. Proportionately the 71 buildings with external and/or Christmas lighting are using the largest amount of purchased electricity (1,820,666 kWh). Twenty properties within the Carnaby part of the portfolio have been identified this year as including landlord purchased gas. These have not been reported previously and year commencement meter readings were only available for two of the buildings for 2014-2015. These, however, will be included in 2015-16 report. Overall energy consumption has increased by 6% which can be attributed to increases throughout the portfolio reflecting increased tenant activity such as the increase in gas consumption in Opera Quarter is attributable to increased occupancy at on building in Charlotte St and St Martins Lane. The decrease of 27% in the Soho part of the portfolio is attributed to the fact that this area has now stabilised in terms of refurbishing and letting. The following restatements are made for electricity and gas consumption for 2013-2014:  At Longmartin, one building (Mercer Street/Slingsby Place) was mistakenly omitted by the agent as it was subject to a separate billing system and the building had not been included in the energy broker’s brief for collation. This equates to an increase of 213,332 kWh.  Also at Longmartin, gas consumption at a building in Slingsby Place was overstated by 250,529 kWh equivalent to a reduction of 46.3 tonnes 21 of CO2e due to mistaken inclusion of tenants consumption.  Opera Quarter 2013-2014 data restated for 1,253 KWh of electricity and 51KWh of Gas due to anomalies in the data provided by the energy broker.  In Carnaby, 2013-2014 data is restated for four buildings due to anomalous meter readings provided by the agent.  2014-2015 data for a building at Lowndes Court new meter added so readings go from January to September. This was averaged and multiplied by 12 to provide an estimate for the year’s consumption. 4.1.2 Like for Like Energy Consumption EPRA Elec-LfL & FuelLfl Number of Number of properties properties reported 2014 2015 % reported on 2014 2014 2015 Difference on 2015 (total No. difference (total No. properties) properties) Head Office 1(1) 1(1) 84,216 99,797 15582 18.50% Carnaby 54(62) 54(66) 774391 813495 39104 5.05% Seven Dials 37(38) 37(37) 892594 856967 -35627 -3.99% Chinatown 36(36) 36(36) 255205 293212 38007 14.89% Usage (KWh) Chinatown (Gas) 1(1) 1(1) 10854 9988 -866 -7.98% Opera Quarter (Gas) 3(3) 3(3) 170765 220026 49261 28.85% Opera Quarter (Electricity) 37(39) 37(41) 213196 239447 26251 12.31% Soho 20(20) 20(20) 68702 50196 -18506 -26.94% Longmartin (Gas) 2(2) 2(2) 47192 48908 1716 3.64% Longmartin (Electricity) 11(12) 11(12) 736609 759510 22901 3.11% Total 201(214) 201(219) 3,253,724 3391546 137823 4.24% 22 2014 2015 % difference 40.00% 30.00% 20.00% 10.00% 0.00% -10.00% -20.00% 2014 2015 % difference -30.00% -40.00% Data Commentary Totals do not include any data for properties that were removed or added for 2015 reporting, they only show data for properties reported in both 2014 and 2015 Overall the portfolio shows a small like for like increase of 4.24% with the largest increase in Opera Quarter attributed to the increased occupancy. 4.1.3 Air Conditioning Total CO2e Tonnes 2012 2013 2014 2015 Carnaby 2.90 3.22 33.14 9.81 23 Total CO2e Tonnes 2012 2013 2014 2015 Seven Dials 0.62 Chinatown Head Office 1.10 0.09 0.34 0.42 Longmartin 8.22 7.76 1.09 Totals 4.00 11.53 41.25 11.94 Data Commentary The air conditioning emission data shows a significant decrease this year over last due to the replacement units installed last year at Longmartin and Seven Dials and the consequent emissions associated with installation at that time.

Since 2013, progressive measurement of the portfolio means that the actual floor areas are now available in Carnaby, Seven Dials and Chinatown. This covers approximately 46% (62 buildings out of 135) of the buildings that have common parts only and provide a representative sample to assess the intensity 2 2 measure and the emissions intensity figure has been obtained of 49.87kgCO2e/m ( 0.050 tonnes CO2e/m .) This is a slight increase on last year’s 2 2 2 figure of 45.78 kgCO2e/m (0.046 tonnes CO2e/m .) For the small number of whole buildings reported the figures are 11.30 kgCO2e/m (0.011 tonnes 2 2 2 CO2e/m ) for electricity consumption and 45.81 kgCO2e/m (0.045 tonnes CO2e/m ) for gas consumption consistent with last year’s performance. 4.1.8 Staff Travel 2012 2013 2014 2015 Number of Journeys 20 60 34 60 Total Distance (km) 39,204 145,406 104,063 68,535 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 10.90 60.52 46.09 19.89 (tonnes CO2e) 30 Data Commentary Since the Head Office is within central London, and the entire portfolio is within 10 minutes of the Head Office employees walk or use public transport both for commuting and business travel.

No new schemes were in progress during 2014 – 2015. In total nine properties in the portfolio have been BREEAM certification which equates to a total percentage by floor area for the portfolio of 5.5% 4.2.2 Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) EPRA Cert -Tot Managed Portfolio Approximately 70% of the portfolio based on lettable floor area and number of buildings now has an EPC at the end of the reporting period with a breakdown below. The Energy Act 2011 requires that properties at the time of letting should be an EPC of Grade E or above by 2016. There are still a proportion of properties under the threshold or have not yet been assessed. The majority of those that have not been assessed are under long term leases which have not undergone a lease transaction since 2008 and therefore have not triggered the requirement for an EPC.

The food composting facility aimed at restaurant tenants was less successful this year comprising only 1% of the total. The remaining 52% of waste has been diverted from landfill at an energy from waste plant with the contractor Veolia. Waste is not quantified in the Chinatown, Soho, and Opera Quarter parts of the portfolio and is collected by Veolia on behalf of Westminster City Council which maximizes diversion from landfill and uses an energy from waste plant for non-recyclable waste. 38 Two waste storage areas are managed in Chinatown at South Service Yard and Horse and Dolphin yard but waste is not quantified. A new initiative in 2015 is a reduced number of bins in South Service yard to help encourage increased recycling by tenants.

The improvement can be attributed to a proactive tenant engagement programme in this part of the portfolio addressing waste management and recycling. The remainder is diverted from landfill to energy from waste. 4.4.2 Waste Refurbishment Sites Total Weight Total weight to Total Weight Removed Property Recycled Landfill % Recycled (Tonnes) (Tonnes) (Tonnes) Total Weight (Tonnes) 1300.80 1267.86 32.94 % Recycled (Average) 97.20% Data Commentary Data provided for 17 of the 18 refurbishment sites.

In the managed portfolio monitoring of water usage is predominantly in Carnaby, Seven Dials and Longmartin. Overall consumption has decreased although there have been changes in properties reported for Carnaby due to a significant review of the data collection process. This has identified that there were a number of anomalies with properties that had been previously reported such as the incorrect meter being read or the landlord was not responsible for the supply. Additional meters and properties have been identified that will now be included for next year’s reporting. Like for like consumption has shown an overall decrease in particular at Longmartin. This is due to actual rather than estimated data being collected for the second half of the reporting year. Like for like on water is significantly different for Carnaby to last year especially for Carnaby as several properties appear to be incorrectly reported. 42 Whole building data is reported for Newport Sandringham, which is currently showing a consistent year on year performance. Other water usage in Chinatown applies to South Service Yard for steam cleaning the bin area and maintains constant usage. Horse and Dolphin Yard is also steam cleaned but usage is not metered. Shaftesbury is not responsible for any trade effluent discharge consents on any of its sites including the refurbishment sites. All waste water goes to standard sewerage system, unless considered to be contaminated with oil in which case is collected by a specialist contractor. Water intensity is variable throughout the portfolio but a year on year comparison for the Carnaby and Seven Dials element shows a reduction. 4.6 Resource Use 4.6.1 Head Office 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Paper Usage (tonnes) 1.27 1.49 2.17 2.29666667 2.06 Proportion from recycled supply (%) 94 99.7 96.8 86.0 86.2 Data Commentary Paper usage is the only resource measurable in the Head Office and has shown a small decrease for 2015.

Of the 17 schemes analysed 11 used both 100% of the façade and 100% of the primary structure as the work was predominantly internal refurbishments. Of the remainder only two schemes – Denman Street and Shaftesbury Avenue used less than the target of 50% of the façade reused and 80% of the building structure, but in both cases a significant proportion of existing building materials were reused. 44 4.6.3 Refurbishment Projects – Reused Timber Retained Retained Retained Retained Retained Retained Retained Retained Floor Retained Roof Roof Floorboard Partitioning Panelling Banisters Other Overall Windows % Doors % joists Staircases Structure % Joists% s% % % % Shaftesbury 75.00% 0.00% 95.00% 95.00% 100.00% 100.00% 60.00% 70.00% N/A N/A 30.00% 69.44% Avenue Exeter 100.00% 70.00% N/A N/A 100.00% 100.00% 55.00% 80.00% N/A N/A 75.00% 82.86% Mansions Tower Street 100.00% 30.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 60.00% n/a 100.00% 100.00% 87.78% Exeter 100.00% 70.00% N/A N/A 100.00% 100.00% 55.00% 80.00% N/A N/A 75.00% 82.86% Mansions St Martin's 90.00% 90.00% 90.00% 95.00% 95.00% 95.00% 75.00% 0.00% 80.00% 90.00% 90.00% 80.91% Lane Wardour 100.00% 0.00% 90.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 55.00% 80.00% n/a n/a 75.00% 77.78% Street Wellington 95.00% 20.00% n/a n/a n/a n/a 55.00% n/a n/a n/a n/a 56.67% Court Exeter 100.00% 100.00% N/A N/A 100.00% 100.00% 55.00% 80.00% n/a n/a 75.00% 87.14% Mansions Horse & 100.00% 5.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% N/A N/A N/A 5.00% 13.75% Dolphin Yard Newport Place and 90.00% 20.00% 100.00% 90.00% 100.00% 0.00% 40.00% N/A 100.00% 100.00% 20.00% 66.00% Lisle Street Rupert Street/ Wardour 90.00% 5.00% 100.00% 100.00% N/A N/A 30.00% N/A 20.00% 10.00% 0.00% 44.38% Street Neal Street 100.00% 0.00% 100.00% 100.00% 80.00% 75.00% 40.00% N/A 0.00% 0.00% 40.00% 53.50% Chandos 100.00% 0.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 75.00% 25.00% N/A 100.00% 100.00% 40.00% 74.00% Place n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d Garrick Street Carnaby Street, N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Common Parts 100.00% N/A 95.00% N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A 40.00% 78.33% Silver House Marlborough 100.00% 10.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 50.00% 100.00% 100.00% 75.00% 25.00% 78.18% Court 45 Data Commentary As previously, of the 17 schemes assessed a number have retained and reused a significant portion of timber during refurbishment.

As part of the initial stages of the project, we have undertaken an inventory of all the existing habitats which are quantified in the table above. Additional initiatives going forward for next year include the location of planters on service roofs in Carnaby and Seven Dials and extending the window boxes and hanging baskets in Charlotte Street . Additional features included as part of refurbishment schemes during the reporting year include bird boxes at Newport Place and Marlborough Court and a green roof and bird boxes as part of the Rupert Street/Wardour Place project. 49 4.7.2 Silver Leaf Award As part of the refurbishment of the new Head office at 22 Ganton Street in February 2014 the creation of a roof terrace for the use of employees was developed which included 2 sedum roofs, 4 green walls, 2 bird boxes, an invertebrate feature, numerous flowering planters and bird feeders. The specification included an irrigation system in the design for the walls and a planting mix of Heuchera Villosa “Purple Palace”, Carex Morrowii, Euonymus Fortunei and Skimmia Japonica. The sedum roofs are a Bauder Extensive Roof System using a sedum blanket. Enterprise Plants Ltd which designed and installed the feature won a eFIG (trade association of the interior landscape design industry) Silver Leaf Award in 2015 for the project. 4.7.3 Soho Green Infrastructure Project The company is also a sponsoring partner of the Soho Green Infrastructure Audit in conjunction with other landowners the final report for which is soon to be published.

Three employees are part time. Due to the small number of employees it is inappropriate for the company to have complex human resources systems with a large number of key performance indicators, therefore the above are the key parameters measured. In the forthcoming year we will be a signatory to the RICS Inclusive Employer Mark and as such will be further embedding the key principles of staff development, retention and engagement. 51 5.2 Health and Safety 2012 2013 2014 2015 Number of reportable injuries 0 0 0 0 Work related fatalities 0 0 0 0 Number of Enforcement Agency prosecutions or fines 0 0 0 0 Number of prohibition notices 1 0 0 0 Employee accidents and incidents 0 0 0 0 Number of employee days off work from injury 0 0 0 0 Data Commentary We have maintained our record of zero notifiable Health and safety incidents throughout the managed portfolio and on its refurbishment sites. In addition no prohibition or improvement notices were raised against the refurbishment sites. Fire safety audits are undertaken throughout the portfolio. In addition, a programme of extractor duct surveys are undertaken for restaurant tenants to further reduce fire risk. 5.3 Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS) Summary Table 2012-13 2013 -14 2014-15 Average score (1st & 2nd 31.6/40 & 34.6/50 33.6/50 34/50 Visit) Number of schemes 87% 87% 87% achieving target Number of schemes 8/22 7/15 4/15 Beyond compliance 52 Individual Site Performance 1st visit 2nd visit Compliance with Target Shaftesbury Avenue 32 33 Yes Exeter Mansions 33 Yes Tower Street 32 Yes Exeter Mansions 31 Yes Denman Street 36 Yes St Martin's Lane 30 Yes Wardour Street 29 No Wellington Court 34 Yes Exeter Mansions 32 Yes Horse & Dolphin Yard 32 35 Yes Newport Place and Lisle Street 33 35 Yes Rupert Street & Wardour Street 35 35 Yes Neal Street 30 Yes Chandos place 30 Yes Garrick Street n/d n/d Carnaby Street, Common Parts N/a N/a Silver House 27 No Marlborough Court 33 Yes Average 34 35 Data commentary All refurbishment schemes above a capital value of £100,000 are required to sign up to CCS. Principal contractor companies are also expected to register as a company with the CCS. Compliance with the Code incorporates a number of factors including environmental and social considerations 53 important to the overall goals of corporate responsibility Compliance with the scheme involves achieving a score of 25/50 and the company sets a more stringent target for its contractors of 30/50. The average score achieved is 34/50 with two schemes scoring below the target score although above the CCS compliance score. Four schemes achieved a score on either the first or second visit above 35/50 which is beyond compliance. The Carnaby Street project did not provide a score due to the fact the scheme completed before a visit had been undertaken. Given the nature of our sites and the inherent difficulties of providing the level of welfare facilities required by CCS, this continues to be an excellent performance by the contractors. This year, it was frequently noted that there could be a measurement of carbon footprint and suggestion of use of a checklist for addressing key issues such as dress code and smoking rules. It is intended that these issues will be considered where possible going forward. 5.4 Community Engagement 2012 2013 2014 2015 Value of Community £404,000 £543,453 £511,466 £515,000 Investment Value of Public Realm £211,000 £22,500 £557,000 £272,000 Investment How we contribute Cash £319,236 (61.99%) Staff time £92,973.50 (18.05%) In kind contributions: product equipment & rooms £31,404.65 (6.10%) In kind: Pro bono £26,372 (5.12%) Management costs £45,000 (8.74%) Why we contribute 54 Charitable gifts £144,597.65 (30.77%) Community investment £321,294.66 (68.36%) Commercial initiatives in the community £4,093.84 (0.87%) What we support Education £191,283.15 (51.27%) Health £6,975 (1.87%) Economic development £18,804 (5.04%) Environment £15,151.84 (4.06%) £15,151.84 (4.06%) Arts/culture £37,404.25 (10.03%) Social welfare £103,483.91 (27.74) Leverage Other contributions from employees £10,943 (9.73%) Contributions from customers £32,223 (28.64%) Contributions from other organisations £356 (0.32%) Other £69,000 (61.32%) 55 Data Commentary Shaftesbury is a member of the London Benchmarking Group and continues to use its methodology for reporting in community investment and charitable giving.

We became a signatory in February 2015 and have reviewed and updated our Sustainability Policy to reflect our commitment see www.shaftesbury.co.uk. Our COP is made through our sustainability reporting – particularly the sustainability section of the Annual Report 2015, Sustainability Report 2015 and the Annual Sustainability Data Report Against Action Plan 2015.
