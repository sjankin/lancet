Serving Our Present, Caring for Our Future UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT & GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE REPORT Communication in Progress and Global Citizenship, 2016 Cleveland Clinic compiles our annual sustainability report for our patients, caregivers, communities and global stakeholders. As a leader in the healthcare industry, we hold ourselves accountable for our social, environmental and economic impacts. We develop this report to highlight both our accomplishments and communicate our challenges as we strive to reach our goals. As a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, Cleveland Clinic has pledged to promote sustainability policies and practices to advance our organization in ways that benefit the economies and communities we serve. This year marks our seventh consecutive Communication on Progress and reflects our work in the 2015 calendar year. In addition to addressing the 10 principles of the U.N. Global Compact, this report is in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 guidelines – the world’s most common standard for sustainability reporting. To align our reporting process with our environmental stewardship goals, we have developed an interactive online report. Here we include our GRI Index and table of U.N. Global Compact Principles with the appropriate links to our online report: Serving Our Present, Caring for Our Future. Please view the full report at clevelandclinic.org/ungc. Dear Patients, Caregivers and Community Members, We are pleased to present our seventh Communication on Progress as part of the United Nations Global Compact. Cleveland Clinic shares the UN Global Compact’s principles of human rights, environmental responsibility and corporate integrity. This report uses the Global Reporting Initiative’s standard disclosures to measure our performance in these areas and is in accordance with G4 core guidelines. Today’s healthcare providers need to be more efficient, accountable and accessible. Cleveland Clinic has made significant progress in each of these areas. We have reduced the cost of providing services by analyzing expenses and adopting evidence-based purchasing models. We were among the first major medical centers to include patient survey ratings of individual physicians online. We increased our telemedicine presence and opened more urgent care walk-in clinics throughout our community. Our efforts to enhance accessibility allowed us to see a record 6.6 million outpatient visits in 2015. We continue to improve sustainability through strategic purchasing, construction and recycling. We have joined with local governments and community groups to promote weight loss and smoking cessation. Cleveland Clinic Stephanie Tubbs Jones Health Center’s Mobile Food Pantry provides free, nutritional meal options, promotes healthy eating and improves health outcomes for community families. We urge leaders at all levels of society to promote nutrition, exercise and greater personal responsibility for health. In 2015, Cleveland Clinic provided medical services to more patients from more places than ever before. We have been recognized among the World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute, honored as a top five hospital by DiversityInc and ranked as a Top 25 hospital by Practice Greenhealth. We are proud to share the information in this year’s Communication on Progress. Thank you for your interest. Sincerely, Delos M. Cosgrove, MD Cleveland Clinic President and CEO Cleveland Clinic: Serving Our Present, Caring for Our Future 2 Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality While all sustainability topics discussed in our online report are important to our leadership, our stakeholder engagement process has helped us determine what sustainability topics matter most, or how “material” they are to our operations, and where they matter most within our organization and externally beyond our walls. This materiality process has enabled us to prioritize the topics that require the most focus for our long-term success. We engage our patients and caregivers through internal surveys, we conduct ongoing inperson interviews with our executive team, board members and representatives from key external stakeholder groups, and we invite many of our stakeholders to attend facility openings, addresses by Cleveland Clinic executives and other Clinic-hosted events open to the public and other officials. We also periodically travel to the seats of federal, state and local governments to provide briefings on issues of importance to healthcare providers. The primary purpose of these discussions in 2015 was to prioritize the importance of each of our sustainability topics and find collaboration points for mutual benefit. Some of the external groups we engaged for this report include: • American Heart Association • Evergreen Cooperatives • American Lung Association • Health and Human Services • Our top suppliers • National Institute of Health • City of Cleveland • North Union Farmers Market • Cleveland Foundation • Ohio Hospitals Association • Department of Energy • Practice Greenhealth • Environmental Protection Agency • The White House All interviewed stakeholders were given a list of sustainability topics based on the Global Reporting Initiative’s aspects list and engaged in open dialogue on all topics. The internal interview team ranked each topic discussed on a low to high scale of 1 to 7, and then the mean of all stakeholder answers was utilized to generate vertical and horizontal points on the graph. The opinions of our patients and caregivers were weighted with additional consideration.
