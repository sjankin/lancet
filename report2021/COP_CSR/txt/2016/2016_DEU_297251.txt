UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2016 Reporting period: January 1st 2016 to December 1st 2016 www.jfhillebrandgroup.com UN GLOBAL COMPACT OUR COMMITMENT Dear reader, In 2011 JF Hillebrand Group became an active member of the UN Global Compact, joining companies from across the globe in making a commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. Today, across our global portfolio of logistics companies, the UN Global Compact serves an important purpose in providing consistent guiding principles for our company to follow in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Since our first Communication on Progress in 2012, we have worked to systematically integrate the principles of the UN Global Compact into our core business strategy. During the past year, we have undertaken numerous actions at a global and local office level to ensure that these principles are integrated into our daily operations. Sustainable transport remains a key objective, and we aim to be at the forefront of sustainable transport in the industries where we operate. While we continue to make strides in reducing our own environmental impact, climate change is a challenge we share not only with other companies in the transport and logistics sector, but with society as a whole. Only together, and with robust commitment from organisations and bodies worldwide, we will make a difference. In the following report, which will be shared with our staff and stakeholders, we report on the progress which we, as a company, continue to make. We recognise our responsibility to our staff, to our clients, to our industry, and indeed to our society. We are proud to support the UN Global Compact and remain committed to making a real difference in our global community. Yours sincerely, Mr. Christophe Bernard CEO, JF Hillebrand Group AG.

JF HILLEBRAND GROUP UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2016 ENVIRONMENT IMPLEMENTATION • JF Hillebrand Group fully considers and supports environmentally friendly initiatives when managing business on behalf of our clients. Our expertise and extensive market knowledge enables us to meet customer requirements with bespoke solutions and initiatives which can help lower carbon emissions throughout the world. • We continuously strive to improve our environmental performance, through initiatives and best practice, either alone or in partnership with others. • Strategic involvement in non-profit forums such as the Container Owners Association (COA) with the objective to minimise industry-wide pollution risks through constant analysis and reporting on incidents. • Existing logistics initiatives within JF Hillebrand Group are: – Increased use of “Short-Sea” shipping – we use feeder services into smaller regional ports, as close as possible to the final delivery point. Utilising feeder options minimises road miles and eases congestion at ports and container terminals. – Use of domestic coastal shipping – we utilise feeder services where appropriate to reduce the use of road transport. – Inland waterways – where possible, we use barges and inland canal routes to cut down on road miles. • Development of technologies and solutions to minimise environmental impact: – Bulk transport solutions via our flexitank systems. Bulk transportation allows shippers to significantly reduce transportation costs, and dramatically reduce the associated carbon emissions in some cases by up to 50%. Furthermore, importing liquids in bulk and bottling them at destination using recycled, lightweight glass or other materials further reduces carbon emissions. In addition, we have addressed the carbon footprint of the flexitank itself. – We have proactive and long-term Equipment Recovery Management plan to leverage recycling opportunities for our flexitank products. Our single layer flexitank materials are 100% recyclable. – We have invested in recycling facilities and actively assist our clients in the design and implementation of local flexitank recycling solutions. – The flexitank material is shredded, baled for granulation and cleaned before being pelletized and manufactured into new products. – We actively manage the collection of steel bulkheads (used for flexitank shipments), which are refurbished and reused throughout our network. – We aim to reduce to zero the number of flexitanks used in landfill. – We have developed our own VinLiner thermal liners as an environmentally friendly alternative to shipping in temperature controlled reefer containers (which require approximately 30% to 40% more energy to refrigerate on the basis of the same transported tonnage). JF HILLEBRAND GROUP UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2016 ENVIRONMENT – Our VinLiner product is produced from a fully recyclable material. We also have a VinLiner recollection/ recycling programme, with a target that 100% of VinLiner Pallet Covers will be produced from recycled VinLiners. – Development of a Carbon Calculator tool on the JF Hillebrand website, enabling shippers to calculate and compare their carbon emissions via different transport modes. Providing innovative tools such as the carbon calculator helps to foster a culture of environmental awareness amongst our customers and staff, in every country in which we operate. – Development of IT tools Kegspediter, LogiTrax and EcoBev, designed to help clients manage supply chains as efficiently as possible. – EcoBev beverage disposal service is the only green solution for beverage disposal in the USA. – Kegspediter solution increases efficiency of keg usage and helps brewers minimise their environmental impact. • Development of a best practice “How to go green at work” document with guidelines to be implemented in each JF Hillebrand Group office and manufacturing plant, including: – Waste separation. – Recycling waste paper and sourcing paper from renewable sources. – Recycling plastic. – Reducing printing. – Conserving energy. – Switching energy supply to renewable sources. – Use of lower emission or electric company cars. – Use of energy efficient office and IT equipment. – Constantly searching for new ways to limit environmental impact. • Implementation of local office initiatives across our entire network, including: – Earth Hour in March 19th in collaboration with the companies located in our building (Singapore). – “Welcome manual” to save printed pages per newcomers (France). • We are active members of industry environmental bodies and organisations including: – The Containers Owners Assocation – The European Petrochemical Association – The Responsible Care – The Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG, a B2B initiative managed by BSR/Business for Social Responsibility) JF HILLEBRAND GROUP UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2016 ENVIRONMENT MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES • We received independent ISO 14001 (Environmental) accreditation for environmental initiatives. • We have received independent ISO 22000 and HACCP (hazard analysis critical control points) accreditation, adopting a systematic approach to reducing physical, chemical, and biological hazards/risks in production processes. • We are a SmartWay® Logistics Company Partner (applicable to our SLG division). • We have actively encouraged environmental best-practice throughout our network and have invested in technologies for environmental benefit. This has improved energy efficiency in all offices as a result of local initiatives and measures. • We recycled 60% of our LLDPE flexitanks, across our top 12 import countries (in the third quarter of 2016). • We recovered and reused 49% of the steel bulkheads used in flexitank transportation, thanks to our worldwide bulkhead recovery program. For our top 25 import countries this figure stands at 61% recovery. • We have successfully developed environmentally-minded logistics services for our customers and clients. • We centrally monitor, collate and disseminate information relating to our environmental initiatives.
