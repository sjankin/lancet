Moreover, its stock price has experienced a steady rise since the renewal of the highest price in July 2015 and we received the highest credit rating among global electric utilities by the world’s three credit rating agencies, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. This is incredibly important as the world not only recognises our stable electricity supply and our efficient management performances, but also the sustainable future value of KEPCO. “KEPCO is establishing a new future with clean energy.” The new energy industry has recently drawn more attention than ever, and a new market, technology and industry have been being created with the acceleration of convergence between technology and industry. The waves of such change and innovation require a conversion to a more clean and efficient future energy. KEPCO is building an eco-friendly electricity environment by taking the lead in the technological development and commercialization of new energy businesses such as the establishment of the ESS (Energy Storage System) for matching the world’s largest frequency, 236MW; the fostering of eco-friendly energy-independent islands including Ulleungdo; and the expansion of the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles to 3,660 chargers by 2018. Moreover, KEPCO conducts 37 projects in 22 countries such as the Middle East, North, Central America and Africa, which presently includes the UAE Nuclear Power Plant, and is diversifying business models not only in the traditional areas of thermal and nuclear power but also in renewable energy and new energy business exports. We aim to build a global KEPCO belt that connects all continents in the mid-to-long-term through these achievements. “KEPCO is creating an Energy World where values are shared by everyone.” Since the KEPCO HQ changed its location to Naju in December, 2014, KEPCO has been successfully carrying out the “Bitgaram Energy Valley” project to turn the Gwangju Jeonnam Region into a hub for the electric power energy industry. With an aim to attract 500 energy-related companies by 2020, agreements for investment in the Energy Valley have been concluded with 133 companies, as of June 2016, and we are building “Bitgaram Energy Valley” into a coexistence role model that shares values with local communities, for example, the expansion of localized R&D investment through industry-university-research collaboration. Through operating an export guarantee system for SMEs, KEPCO runs various programs for mutual growth with SMEs including helping to locate an overseas market, enhancing joint R&D and boosting technology capabilities. In addition, the world’s first international exposition for new electric power technology, ‘BIXPO 2015,’ was successfully held last year attracting about 30,000 visitors and ‘BIXPO 2016’ is scheduled for this November. With the new slogan of ‘Beyond the Top, Leading KEPCO’, KEPCO aims to be a future-oriented leader in the new energy environment beyond the world’s No.1 electric utility. KEPCO will implement sustainable development by leading the global energy market with a leap in innovation beyond ourselves. I appreciate your continual support for KEPCO as we work together for a better, eco-friendlier tomorrow. Thank you.

The Board of Directors is composed of seven executive directors (standing) including the CEO and eight non-executive directors (non-standing). The Chief Director is appointed among non-executive directors to collect opinions on the overall management in a fair manner. Non-executive directors are appointed from among a collection of experts in the finance, labor, mutual growth and energy sectors and they contribute to the improvement of the level of sustainable management through management proposals and advice.

When appointing the CEO, KEPCO receives applications for the candidate. The CEO is then recom-mended by the Nomination Committee, consisting of non-executive directors and non-government members, requested by the Minister of Trade, Industry, and Energy, and finally appointed by the President for a three-year term. An executive director is appointed by the CEO after the resolution of the shareholders’ meeting for a two-year term. The Standing Commissioner is recommended by the Nomination Committee, approved by the Steering Committee, requested by the Minister of Strategy and Finance, and appointed by the President. Non-executive directors also serve a two-year term and are recommended by the Nomination Committee, approved by the Steering Committee, and appointed by the Minister of Strategy and Finance. To ensure diversity and proper representation by the BOD members, we are diversifying the scope of institutions that recommend candidates for external directors by asking the Minister of Gender Equality and Family to recommend candidates for the role of female executives. The company reinforces the independence of the committee by excluding the participation of standing directors in the Nomination Committee. KEPCO operates the detailed standards for candidates detailed in the operation regulations of the committee to ensure professionalism, which includes a complete understanding of the power industry and extensive experience in management. 12 Company Sustainable Five Performance Appendix Overview Management Core Issues Data Operation of Board of The Board of Directors deliberates on important decision-making matters such as management goals and budget Directors in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and the BOD regulations.

The reappointment of non-standing directors depends on the result of the performance assessment. The directors’ remuneration is decided within the range approved at the general shareholders’ meeting, and non-executive directors receive expenses for their work in accordance with the internal regulations. In order to vitalize the activities of the BOD, KEPCO has prepared various systems such as a self-assessment system Vitalization of BOD for the operational performance of the BOD, the publication of a monthly brief to distribute management information, and workshops to reinforce the professionalism of newly appointed non-standing directors.

With the micro grid system, the company developed the business model for a ‘Carbon Zero Island’ and ‘Energy Independent Island’, which would produce energy without carbon emissions and reduce energy supply expenses. In 2014, based on this development, KEPCO signed an agreement for the joint establishment of a micro grid with Powerstream, Canada for the first time in North America. The company also set a SPC with local government and private enterprises to participate in the Ulleungdo ‘eco-friendly energy-independent Island building project’ in 2015. With the performance of the micro grid demonstration in Jeju and Jeonnam, KEPCO is aiming for a zero-diesel generation by 2020 by composing an optimal energy source mix. Additionally, this business model will be applied to 62 islands under KEPCO’s management. Micro Grid in Gasado, Jennam Groundbreaking Ceremony of Ulleungdo Eco-friendly Energy-Independent Island Special Canada Micro Grid Completion In June 2016, KEPCO held a completion ceremony of the Micro Grid in Penetanguishene, Ontario, Canada. The aim of the Canada Micro Grid project was to establish a micro grid for Penetanguishene, a small town with 404 households and 7.2MW installed capacity but without a distribution automation system. With a KEPCO-type micro grid total solution, the city is equipped with a more efficient electric power system by installing a KEPCO-developed micro grid, 500kWh ESS and a Korean automated switch. Renewable Energy: Efforts to Achieve National Goal As a representative public energy company, KEPCO has continuously sought measures and developed projects to achieve the national renewable energy goal (11% by 2035). Despite the finite national territory and climate conditions, KEPCO has carried out various renewable energy projects such as a 2.5GW offshore wind power facility in the Southwestern Sea, which is a government-led project, photovoltaic power generation projects in rooftops of schools and the Miryang and Technopolis clean energy supply projects in Daegu to achieve a national GHG reduction goal. KEPCO will also expand the domestic business development and overseas market based on the technology and track record accumulated through the renewable energy business. Installation of World’s Largest Frequency Regulation ESS The Energy storage system (ESS) is a new technology that stores electricity for later use which, when needed could be used in diverse areas including demand control, renewable energy expansion, improvement of electricity quality and frequency regulation. In 2013, KEPCO organized an exclusive management team, and established and demonstrated 4MW ESS in Jeju Jocheon Substation for the first time in Korea. We established a phased-plan to build a 500MW ESS (for frequency regulation or F/R) over four years (2014-2017) in 2014. Based on this, we successfully installed Korea’s first 52MW F/R ESS in Seo-Anseong substation and Sin-Youngin substation and they have been in commercial service since July, 2015. An additional 184MW ESS in Gyeongsan Substation ESS was established including 48MW ESS in Gyeongsan substation in 2015, and KEPCO now possesses and operates the world’s largest 236MW ESS. It is expected to improve the generator output by replacing F/S reserve power, which was handled by the existing generating facility, and to save about KRW 60 billion of electricity purchase expenses annually. In addition, KEPCO expects that fostering the battery-related domestic industry will create new jobs and lay the foundation for entry into the overseas market. 39 Preserving the Environment Our Approach Clean energy is essential for the sustainable life of the next-generation. By recognizing the necessity to share responsibility for the environment, KEPCO aims to realize the sustainable energy by increasing energy efficiency with the application of eco-friendly smart technology to the overall value chain of the generation -T&D (transmission & distribution)-sales. In addition, we will set a master plan and actively develop technology for the reduction of GHG emissions. 3.84 Our Plan Investment in the Environment • Establish a company-wide environment management system and provide regular feedback • Construct eco-friendly power facilities such as eco-friendly steel towers KRW trillion and the expansion of underground facilities • Reduce GHG emissions continuously and minimize wastes discharge • Establish a carbon asset management system Additional GHG Emission 50 281,000 Reduction compared to the 2015 Goal % Rate of GHG Emission Reduction compared to Average Emission in tons 2007~2009 KRW 920.5 billion RPS Mandatory Implementation Cost 2016 Sustainability Report KEPCO pursues eco-friendliness in all areas of the electricity supply value chain and fosters a clean environment with the development of low-carbon, green technology and the improvement of energy efficiency.

Expenses of GENCOs’ Environmental Investment All six GENCOs’ business offices have acquired and maintained the ISO 14001 certification. Expenses related to the environment totaled KRW 531.5 billion including KRW 153 billion for environmental facility investment, KRW 331.4 billion for environmental facility operation, KRW 27.9 billion for waste treatment cost, KRW 6.1 billion for environment-related R&D, KRW 100 million for maintaining the ISO 14001 certification and KRW 13 billion for others. Construction and Operation of Coexisting Generation Facilities with Local Communities GENCOs conduct an environmental impact assessment on the surrounding the environmental state and traffic of the construction site for new construction or the expansion of plants as well as the post-environmental impact assessment for five years after completion to report the results to the government annually. Reduction in Pollutant Discharge by Improving the Efficiency of Domestic and Overseas Generation Facilities The GENCOs have expanded the use of clean energy sources, and installed and operated desulfurization, the DeNOx facility, and dust collection, to reduce SOx, NOx and dust. In addition, comprehensive wastewater treatment facilities are operated to collect wastewater in one place for physical and chemical treatment and the entire desulfurized gypsum produced from coal-fired power plants is recycled for the raw material needed for cement. For the operation of overseas plants, KEPCO strives to comply with the environmental standard in each country and reduce pollutants from plants by improving generation facilities and applying eco-friendly technology. As a result, the Illijan Plant in the Philippines was recognized as the best environmental company by the Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines in 2013. It is planned to not only reduce environmental pollutants, but also enhance operating profits through the plants’ efficiency improvement project including the desulfurization facility enhancement of the Saudi Arabia Plant.

For the eco-friendliness of the electricity transmission & disDistribution Stage tribution stage, we continue to make efforts such as securing objectivity and transparency in the selection of the location of power facilities; conducting environmental impact assessment; expanding eco-friendly power facilities, coexisting with local communities; efforts to reduce T&D loss rate; and protecting the ecosystem and managing electromagnetic fields. Implementation and Disclosure of the Environmental Impact Assessment for Biodiversity Protection In order to construct transmission lines and substations, consultation with relevant institutions and environmental impact assessment must be conducted prior to business implementation. KEPCO complies with the Environmental Impact Assessment Act, conducts assessments before the construction of all transmission lines and substations, and discloses the results on the Environmental Impact Assessment Support System (www.eiass.go.kr). We exclude regions with high biodiversity value. At the stage of the environmental impact assessment, we investigate habitats by focusing on protected species (endangered species), indigenous species, specific species, and species that inhabit the area in groups; predict the likely impact; and prepare measures to reduce the impact. At the construction stage, managers responsible for the content of the consultation are appointed, and the relevant contents are verified and inspected using a post environmental impact assessment. At the stage of the completion of construction, we restore habitats damaged by the construction to the original condition as much as possible through discussions with local governments. We have also reinforced the tasks for the environmental impact assessment by placing a total of four external environmental experts in the headquarters and construction offices and enhance the environmental mindset of executives and employees through various efforts such as publishing guidelines for the environmental impact assessment in T&D facilities and the management manual for the compliance of legal matters, sharing violation cases of environmental regulations and implementing education for the prevention of any recurrences. Expansion of the Eco-friendly Power Facility Construction KEPCO continues to expand the construction of eco-friendly power facilities by developing eco-friendly equipment and the construction method with the least impact on the surrounding environment. To this end, we use more aesthetically pleasing tubular steel poles or apply eco-friendly coating on steel towers, and we have developed and operated epoxy mold insulated switches, replacing SF6 gas for preventing the release of GHG. Through efforts to revise laws and regulations on the installation of power facilities, we reduced the depth of underground wiring pipes, shortened the period for road excavation and minimized any inconveniences to pedestrians by mandating to secure space for the installation of ground equipment within buildings. Furthermore, KEPCO has been transforming the aesthetic urban landscape by mandating communication lines to be buried along with distribution lines. Processing PCBs in Waste Transformers To meet the national implementation plan of the Stockholm Convention, KEPCO has established and operated a systematic management system for the complete eradication of PCBs (Poly Chlorinated Biphenyls). Waste transformers to be disposed are strictly controlled in accordance with the PCBs management procedure and those with 2 ppm and over in the concentration level of PCBs are processed by companies that specialize in PCBs that processed 260,000 units as of 2015. We will implement a strict safety management for PCBs from removal and storage to analysis, the disposal and sales of transformers and carry out economical and stable processing of PCBs through the constant discovery of new construction technologies. 43 2016 Sustainability Report Sales Stage Establishment of New Demand Control Strategy based on Stable Electricity Supply and Demand KEPCO has contributed to stabilizing the electricity supply and demand by systematically and actively managing electricity demand. As the supply and demand have recently stabilized, we are implementing a new demand control strategy and promoting a switch to market-oriented autonomous demand management from the conventional supply and demand measures for emergencies. In accordance with the direction of the government’s policy to foster new electric power businesses, we have discovered a new demand control business model using new electric power technology, ESS and promoted the development of a new demand control business model in cooperation with SMEs and the efficiency of demand control. KEPCO also contributes to a reduction in the total national energy amount by expanding investment in an efficiency enhancement project and providing demand control consulting services that induce the reasonable electricity consumption of customers with the provision of electricity information via electricity big data. With the further expansion of the AMI supply, we plan to develop and demonstrate a demand management business model involving the people’s participation and expand measures that allow the people to participate in demand control in real time. Strategies for Coping with Climate Change At COP21 in Paris, France, Korea set the national mitigation target by 37% from BAU (business as usual) by 2030. Of the total national GHG emission of 690 million tons (as of the end of 2013), KEPCO and GENCOs take up 1.42 million tons (0.2%) and 220 million tones (32%), respectively, and we will implement activities to bring GHG emissions down to the similar level of the master plan for the reduction of GHG emissions. Under the master plan, KEPCO set a vision of Korea’s best optimal green energy company and plans to perform a leading role to achieve the GHG emission reduction target by setting a carbon management system; securing GHG reduction core technologies including CCS; reinforcing R&D cooperation; preoccupying the global climate market.

We will satisfy the government’s policy to reduce the national GHG and contribute to achieving the national GHG reduction target as early as possible through the COK11. In addition, KEPCO aims to revitalize the economy through job creation and new business expansion, and to continue expanding the electric power industry environment by pioneering the overseas market in cooperation with SMEs. Conference of KEPCO Group Companies to Cope with Climate change Establishment of the Carbon Management System To analyze the current status of company-wide GHG emissions and manage carbon assets, KEPCO is establishing CAMS (Carbon Asset Management System) and plans to complete the setting of the system by the latter half of 2016 to establish a portfolio for analyzing data on CER (certified emission reduction), monitoring data on GHG on a real-time basis, and managing the optimal CER. We will also prepare the joint measures of the electricity sector in accordance with the implementation of the emission trading system by advancing CAMS and building a system connected with the electricity group companies from 2017. Emission Trading System (ETS) As part of the GHG target management system in 2014, KEPCO was assigned a 40% reduction target compared to the base year (2007~2009) and secured the early reduction of the amount. This amount of reduction can be utilized in supplementing CER, which could be insufficient after the implementation of the Emission Trading System (ETS). The government allocated annual CERs to KEPCO for the period of the first plan, from 2015 to 2017, and the ETS implementation cost is estimated to be about KRW 19.5 billion for the first plan period. Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) Reduction of The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which took effect from 2012, is a system used to supply a certain GHG Emissions rate of the total generation amount with renewable energy for GHG emission reduction and the further development of renewable energy. KEPCO made up for KRW 920.5 billion in the total expense of the GENCOs in 2015 due to PRS implementation and the mandatory supply ratio of PRS in 2015 was 3%.

Through the continual development and application of GHG reduction technologies, we reduced the emissions by 50.4%, in 2015, compared to the average emission amount of 2.64 million tons during the base year (2007~2009), This was achieved with a significant reduction in the GHG emissions by increasing the collection rate of SF6 gas, which accounts for about 80% of the total GHG emission amount to 97% from 80%. In 2015, KEPCO reduced about 8000 tons of GHG emissions through the trial application of a technology that recycles SF6 after its collection and purification and plans to expand the application to all branch offices. Additionally, we will develop an insulation material which could decompose or replace SF6 to achieve zero SF6 emissions, in the long term. Process of SF6 Gas Collection SF6 GAS SF6 GAS Collect SF6 Gas in Analyze and Purify Gas Store and Transport Recycle (Transformation Power Facilities (Unit : Cylinder) GIS, GSB and etc.) Global Certificate for GHG Emission Reduction Carbon Trust Standard (CTS) KEPCO’s efforts and performance to reduce GHG emissions were recognized by the Korea Productivity Center and Carbon Trust, the UK’s non-profit organization established to pursue the shift to a sustainable low-carbon economy, and the company acquired its first CTS (Carbon Trust Standard), a global certificate for carbon management, in 2013. Two years later, we once again passed the review with stricter standards for GHG emission reductions and the assessment for recertification.
