KIRIN REPORT 2015 ACCELERATING VALUE-DRIVEN GROWTH Kirin Holdings Company, Limited ︵ LEAD STORY 1 OUR VALUE, YOUR HAPPINESS The Kirin Group makes a wide-ranging contribution to people and society by creating and providing new value in the fields of “food and well-being.” —We deliver value that is not available from any other company. The Kirin Group conducts global activities in its core businesses of alcoholic beverages, nonalcoholic beverages, and pharmaceuticals and bio-chemicals, which engages in operations centered on biopharmaceuticals. The Kirin Group strives to meet a broad array of consumer needs, such as needs for beverages that are healthy yet delicious; familiar brands that are full of the appeal of local regions; casual, lowalcoholic beverages that everyone can enjoy; and pharmaceuticals for diseases that lack effective treatments. In addressing these needs, the Kirin Group is making a wide-ranging contribution to society by proposing new value related to “food and well-being.” We are implementing the Kirin Group’s unique CSV, which combines the creation of both social value and economic value.

To cultivate a deep understanding of our customers and to provide the value they want through our products and services, we must continually strengthen our business platform. Accordingly, the Japan Integrated Beverages Business is building a brand portfolio that remains centered on the customer while extending beyond the boundaries of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages businesses. To heighten the customer brand experience, we are taking steps to enhance marketing capabilities throughout the Group. In addition, over many years the Group has cultivated advanced fermentation technologies. These technologies, which are continually enhanced through ongoing technical innovation, are the foundation not only for the provision of safe, secure, and delicious products but also for the advanced biotechnologies of Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Moving forward, Kirin will be able to create new value that meets the expectations of society and customers by improving and integrating the technologies of Group companies. Our creation of value, which is supported by the ability to understand customers and technical expertise, is realized through efficient supply chain management (SCM). The Kirin Group believes this competitive edge in “invisible assets” will be the cornerstone of sustained growth. 2 KIRIN REPORT 2015 Growth Reliability potential OUTCOME Stability Creating social value + economic value Social issues OUTPUT Products and services Customer expectations SCM Marketing Technology Foundations for Value Creation FOCUSED INPUT Invested capital KIRIN HOLDINGS COMPANY, LIMITED 3 ︵ LEAD STORY 3 FROM VOLUME TO VALUE Targeting the realization of sustained growth, we will shift from a focus on volume to a focus on value. —The Kirin Group sincerely faces its management challenges. For more than 10 years, the Kirin Group’s consolidated sales have recorded growth due largely to the acceleration of overseas business development through aggressive M&A activities. However, the rate of increase in our profits has not kept pace with the growth in our sales. The reason is that, as we expanded our overseas operations, we began to neglect our traditional strength—the creation of new value for consumers. Moving forward, in fields where society requires further value creation, the Kirin Group must leverage the superiority of its technologies and other business platforms to achieve concurrent gains in three areas—growth potential, stability, and reliability. —That is what we must do to enhance corporate value. 4 KIRIN REPORT 2015 Consolidated Sales and Operating Income Consolidated sales (left) Consolidated operating income (right) (Billion yen) (Billion yen) 2,500 200 Consolidated sales ¥ 2,196.9 billion 2,000 160 1,500 120 Consolidated operating income ¥ 124.7billion 1,000 80 500 40 0 0 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 FY KIRIN HOLDINGS COMPANY, LIMITED 5 ︵ 4 LEAD STORY VALUE-DRIVEN PRIORITIZATION Our growth will be driven by initiatives to address social issues related to well-being and other fields. On that basis, we will focus the allocation of our management resources on businesses in which we can leverage our strengths. —The Kirin Group has stepped up its implementation of more efficient management resource allocation. Under our new long-term management vision, the New Kirin Group Vision 2021 (New KV2021),* we will strive to further raise our profitability and efficiency by dramatically increasing the focused allocation of our limited management resources to fields in which we can establish a substantial presence. 2016 MTBP will be the first step toward this goal. Among our core businesses, our highest priority will be to strengthen the profit foundation in the beer businesses, with a special focus on Japanese beer operations. We will also execute restructuring to revitalize low-profit businesses and take steps to achieve outstanding growth in the Pharmaceuticals and Bio-chemicals Business. In these ways, we will do our utmost to achieve sustained growth. In addition, under New KV2021, we are working to address social issues related to well-being and other fields. We have made clear that our growth will be driven by the creation of value from the consumers’ perspective. To that end, the Kirin Group will continually strengthen its business foundation and work to generate Group synergies. * Based on the KV2021 long-term management vision, New KV2021 is our long-term management vision newly developed in 2016 with the purpose of redefining our 2021 Vision and strategic frameworks. 6 KIRIN REPORT 2015 Positioning of Each Business for Structural Reforms or Aggressive Investment Low profit High profit “Outstanding Growth in “Restructure and Revitalize Pharmaceuticals and Low-Profit Businesses” Bio-chemicals Business” through cost structure reforms through R&D investment Pharmaceuticals and Bio-chemicals business Growth market Brazil business “Strengthen Profit Base of Beer Businesses” Expand business through capital expenditures Myanmar beer business Japan alcoholic beverages business Japan non-alcoholic beverages Mature market business Oceania beer, spirits, and wine business Australia dairy and drinks business Activate market and further improve profitability through investment in marketing KIRIN HOLDINGS COMPANY, LIMITED 7 Our Philosophy THE KIRIN GROUP— FOCUSED ON PEOPLE, NATURE AND CRAFTSMANSHIP TO REDEFINE THE JOY OF FOOD AND WELL-BEING We pride ourselves on offering products based on what people want.

Since that time, the Group has made sustained progress with a focus on offering products with higher added value, implementing business diversification and globalization, and enhancing management. Moving forward, the Group will continue to value the pursuit of innovation, a customer orientation, and a focus on quality, which have been a part of the Group’s corporate DNA since its founding. Kirin’s resilience enables the Group to respond to evolving markets and customer needs and is a key strength in Kirin’s endeavors to increase corporate value.

In this section, Kirin Holdings President & CEO Yoshinori Isozaki provides frank replies to tough questions and clarifies the steps that the Group is taking to return to a growth track. 20 KIRIN REPORT 2015 Interview with the President & CEO Q. Beginning with fiscal 2013, operating income declined for two consecutive years, and, looking 1 back over the 10-year period from fiscal 2004, growth in profits has not kept pace with growth in sales. That was the situation when you became president & CEO of Kirin Holdings in March 2015. What is your view of the challenges faced by the Group? A. There were problems with the efficient allocation of our management resources and with our ability to respond to downturns in the business environment. I believe that we could have done more to leverage our competitive edge in the ability to create value.

In these ways, we had a series of marketing failures. Kirin Holdings needed to move quickly in response to this situation, and we did not have a governance system that was suitable for that task. KIRIN HOLDINGS COMPANY, LIMITED 21 KIRIN’S GROWTH STRATEGIES Q. 2 Given the understanding of the issues that you described, what reforms did the Kirin Group implement in fiscal 2015, and what results were achieved? Also, what challenges remain to be addressed? A. Through selective investment, we were able to put a stop to the downward trend in our share of the Japanese beer market, which had continued to decline for five years. In addition, we were able to further increase our share in the functional products category, which is expected to record strong growth over the medium to long term. At the same time, we began to implement rigorous structural reforms at Brasil Kirin.

How will the Kirin Group achieve sustained growth in this type of market environment? What will be the Group’s growth drivers? A. We will achieve sustained growth by continuing to focus our investment on our core brands and by expanding added value to meet diversifying needs. Shifting the competitive axis from volume reinforcing our presence in the functional products to value category. At the same time, to meet consumer As suggested by your question, the overall scale of needs for beer with a variety of tastes and the perthe Japanese beer market is not expanding.

KIRIN HOLDINGS COMPANY, LIMITED 23 KIRIN’S GROWTH STRATEGIES Q. 4 What is the rationale for the fact that the Kirin Group’s operations extend beyond alcoholic beverages and non-alcoholic beverages to include the Pharmaceuticals and Bio-chemicals Business? Also, what level of growth potential do you see in the Pharmaceuticals and Bio-chemicals Business, and what type of strategy will be followed to ensure its sustained growth in the future? A. The Pharmaceuticals and Bio-chemicals Business, which is one of the Kirin Group’s core businesses, leverages its ability to create value to address diverse medical needs, and I expect to see strong growth in this business. Moving forward, we will expand R&D investment and work to maximize growth potential over the medium to long term.

KIRIN HOLDINGS COMPANY, LIMITED 25 KIRIN’S GROWTH STRATEGIES Q. 6 What do you think is necessary for the Kirin Group to enhance its corporate value over the medium to long term? Also, would you describe the Group’s fundamental approach to increasing shareholder value? A. Sustained enhancement of corporate value will result from the ongoing provision of added value that addresses social issues, the continual strengthening of the foundations for the provision of that added value, and the generation of Group synergies. We will also focus on raising shareholder value, including stock price appreciation. To that end, we will continue to give priority to enhancing shareholders’ returns and will strive to steadily meet the quantitative targets set out in 2016 MTBP.

Kirin Holdings is working to enhance corporate governance in order to increase corporate value. To that end, the Company is taking such steps as appointing an outside director as Chairman of the Board and appointing a female officer to the Board of Directors. In April 2016, Toshio Arima, an outside director, became Chairman of the Board, and Kimie Iwata transitioned from outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member to outside director. These two directors engaged in a conversation and provided their opinions about Kirin’s corporate governance. 36 KIRIN REPORT 2015 Changes in the Kirin Group during the Directors’ Tenure time to address, and they will not be resolved quickly. Arima: Kirin is a company that is taking a sincere approach However, as an outside director, I will be taking a close to management. Since I joined the Company, I have had a look at these issues. high opinion of the corporate culture, in which officers and employees accurately recognize important management The “New KV2021” Long-Term Business Plan and themes and issues and work to tackle them in a straightthe New Medium-Term Business Plan forward manner. However, I also think that there have Iwata: I was very impressed with the “New KV2021” been some issues where the approach may have been too vision. “Creating social value” and “creating economic refined and not aggressive enough. President Isozaki has value” are positioned as having equal merit in terms of indicated the importance of “practical strength,” and this management success. This is a clear declaration that the concept could apply to driving success in the face of Company will achieve both.

In that regard, growth is to grow together with society. Moreover, the perhaps the approach could have been more aggressive in strategic framework incorporates Kirin’s distinctive some areas. However, looking at the recent reversal in the approach to CSV. CSV management is indispensable for market share for beer and the structural reforms at Brasil sustained growth, yet there are a surprisingly small Kirin, I am pleased to say that I am starting to see positive number of companies that have a deep understanding of changes, such as the assignment of precise priorities to the essence of CSV management and are working earmanagement issues and the implementation of finely nestly to implement it.

However, on the other Arima: I feel the same way about the vision.

These are issues that will require some will be given shape in the creation of value. KIRIN HOLDINGS COMPANY, LIMITED 37 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE should lead to action. I think we should strive for discussions that make absolutely clear what the next step will be. Another issue is the way in which discussion points are selected. I think that the Company should have a framework for holding discussions that incorporate, from an outside viewpoint, important topics such as challenges and risks that Kirin faces but are not readily visible from an insider’s perspective. Arima: I am paying considerable attention to time frames. Companies must manage their businesses and succeed in the face of competition. The use of Tohoku peaches is, in a sense, only a relatively small initiative, but I think of this as part of the process of building a business model through the accumulation of these types of initiatives. If a methodology can be identified, then it can be implemented in a variety of directions. In addition, society also benefits when employees are active outside the Company in areas other than business activities, such as volunteering. Iwata: This year, I transitioned from outside Audit & Progress in Kirin’s Governance Supervisory Board Member to outside director. In 2012, Iwata: I believe that Kirin is doing an excellent job in I became Kirin’s first female Audit & Supervisory Board regard to governance.

With a focus on diversity, the Company is the “Company with Audit & Supervisory Board” system of working to increase the number of outside directors and to governance, Kirin has established committees that conduct include more women. I will strive to understand what is a wide range of discussions. I think that the Company has expected of me in this setting. Thus far, I have expressed an extremely advanced governance structure. In particular, my thoughts in a natural manner, and there will be no at meetings of the Board of Directors the atmosphere is change to this basic position now that I have become an conducive to free and open expression by the outside outside director.

At Kirin Company, the manufacturing departments, plants, and distribution departments of the operating companies work closely together to provide customers with a steady supply of safe, secure products at low cost. In addition to the technologies and know-how that we have cultivated, we are aggressively introducing new technologies and facilities. In this way, we are working to create new value. In particular, in the midst of a shift toward customers enjoying products in individual ways, it is necessary to provide a diverse array of products and services, and the establishment of SCM for that purpose has become an important task. In addition, in recent years the operating environment in the pharmaYASUYUKI ISHII ceutical industry has changed dramatically. To respond to the Japanese Executive officer in charge of government’s measures to control healthcare expenditures, the reevaluSCM strategy ation of manufacturing costs has become a necessity.

Since the enforcement in Japan of the “Basic Act on Measures to Prevent Damage to Health Due to Alcohol” in June 2014, related parties have collaborated to formulate a basic plan for the prevention of alcohol-related social problems and health issues resulting from the inappropriate use of alcoholic beverages. This plan stipulates that companies that manufacture and market alcoholic beverages have an obligation to cooperate in countermeasure activities instituted by national and regional public institutions and, in their business activities, to act with consideration for the prevention of the occurrence, progress, and recurrence of alcohol-related health problems. Accordingly, the Kirin Group will step up the rigorous implementation and reinforcement of the voluntary advertising standards that it has implemented to date. We will also implement initiatives to eliminate drunk driving accidents through the “Steering Wheel Keeper” campaign and to prevent alcohol consumption by underage consumers, pregnant women, and nursing mothers. 2016 educational poster for responsible drinking created by Kirin “Beer the Beautiful Truth” Initiatives In August 2015, Lion announced that it would independently include nutritional information on the bottles and boxes for all of its beer products, thereby marking a first in the Australian beer industry. Currently, Lion includes information useful to customers on its beer products, such as sugar, preservatives, calories (kilojoules), and carbohydrate content. This initiative was implemented with the support of an independent advisory committee that includes comprehensive care physiLabel cians, certified nutritionists, fitness specialists, and beer brewing specialists. In particular, the creation of support sites and alcoholic beverage fact sheets received the support of comprehensive care physicians and nutritionists, and the fact sheets were not only used to provide information to customers online but were also distributed to Australian nutritionists. These new labels are the first stage in a long-term initiative called the “Beer the Beautiful Truth” campaign, which will address misunderstandings about beer and provide correct information. One of the facts that this campaign will communicate is that Lion’s Australian beers do not use preservatives and almost all of its beers have reduced sugar by 99.9%.
