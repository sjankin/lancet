Sustainability matters are regarded as an increasing opportunity for many stakeholders such as customers, suppliers and other groups and organisations. The Group commits to demonstrate continuous improvements in environmental, social and economic sustainability to these stakeholders. Sustainability strategy The AR Packaging business strategy to increase sales and profitability in selected segments is realised by creating sustainable packaging solutions which generate added value to customers and the end consumer. Competitiveness and a reduced Importance to stakeholders environmental footprint is ensured by improving the Group’s operational excellence and cost-efficiency through specialisation and investments in key technologies as well as reviewing and optimising its manufacturing footprint. The company aims at not having any negative impact in the communities where it operates. In a decentralised organisation the responsibilities lie within the local operations and their experts, while being monitored and sponsored by Group management. The sustainability reporting system Sustainability data are collected from 17 production plants by using a 360report software, where the three newly acquired plants were successfully integrated in 2015. The software covers the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G4), COP reporting linked to our membership in UN Global Compact and reporting for the Carbon Disclosure project (CDP). Importance to organisation The software also provides the possibility to structure important reporting indicators, as not all aspects of GRI structure have the same importance in sustainability reporting. Therefore, the stakeholder issues that are significant to our organisation and the industry in which we operate can be prioritised.

Cholet also improved the sorting of materials in offices and shop floors through a number of actions such as training, placecards and a plant policy with new targets on sorting and waste – always with sustainability in mind. Sales of the additional sorted renewable waste generated 2.600 EUR. WASTE PROJECTS 31 energy consumption Projects that aim to enhance energy efficiency are continuously in progress at all of our plants. Reducing energy consumption is not only an environmental consideration with positive effects on our carbon footprint and emissions but it is also significant in terms of reduced production costs and increased competitiveness. ISO 50001 certification at the Augsburg Augsburg plant has reduced the energy consumption (power, and Frankfurt plants gas and fuel) per ton board by 32.2% since 2013, which equates to about 142.000 EUR per year.

The 50001 certification. The overall energy consumption, e.g. power measures instigated have been a resounding success, where the usage in absolute figures was reduced in 2015, by 15% (7 % per ton due to reduced production volumes.) The main projects realised were part transfer from centralised heating to the use of decentralised high performance heating ventilators (117 MWh savings per year) and new air compressors with heat recovery (125 MWh savings per year). Based on machinery improvement, the compressed air pressure could be further reduced with a positive impact on energy consumption.

This corresponds to a cost saving of 50 TEUR. In additon to other measures, the A & R Carton Lund plant achieved a reduction in power consumption by 5% ( 700 MWh ). Comparable reduction results with the same approach were also realised at the Frankfurt plant. The Cholet plant started to define an energy policy in 2015 by setting targets for energy reduction. Already in 2015 a 10% reduction in energy consumption was achieved. Our newly merged plant in Graz, Austria won a “klimaaktiv” award, commissioned by the federal ministry for agriculture, forestry, environment and water economics.

Two plants are located in or adjacent to protected areas. The other 15 plants are not located in protected areas, adjacent to protected areas or in areas of high biodiversity value without protection status. In general, none of our products or activities have an impact on biodiversity in protected or unprotected areas with high biodiversity value. The plant in Frankfurt, Germany, is located in an official flood protection zone next to a brook. In 2015, the local authorities reviewed the so called “100 year flooding limits” which led to several new requirements for the plant. A new flood risk management system was introduced and existing technical flood protection was extended and improved after an investment of about 7.000 EUR. For example, new wall systems for doors, which will be installed in case of flood emergencies, should protect buildings and in sensitive areas such as supplies and varnish storage and heating installation. The plant in Augsburg, Germany, will be adjacent to a drinking water protection area. Licensing requirements and orders will be respected and controlled by authorities.

Currently, only Scope 3 emissions which are associated with the extraction and transport of primary fuels (referring to Scope 1) and emissions due to losses in distribution and transmission (referring to Scope 2) are tracked figures for AR Packaging. Other potential Scope 3 emissions are not in focus, but the aim is to start reporting in the next few years with initial focus on transport, distribution and business travels. EMISSION AND REDUCTION OF CARBON FOOTPRINT 38 CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT (CDP) Together with some of our major customers including Philip Morris International, Nestlé and Imperial Tobacco Group, we are reviewing the climate change impacts of our supply chain through the internationally recognised CDP disclosure process. CDP is an independent notfor-profit organisation and responding to CDP is free of charge. CDP 2014-2015 CLIMATE PERFORMANCE BAND (RANKED ON A A-E SCALE) Where a company’s total disclosure score is 50 or more, the response is also assessed and ranked in a performance band.

Background: a member of the sensory panel must be able to identify the five basic types of taste and must also have the ability to notice differences and various intensities between the prepared tests. These skills should be regularly trained to reach and improve sensitivity in testing samples. Implementation of odour pens: a trained sensory panel should be able to detect off-odour and also to describe it. With the help of odour-pens, which are filled with typical odour causing chemicals that are present in boards, inks and adhesives, the panel members are able to identify contamination. Each panelist receives his personal Sensory Passport, where every participated test will be noted. After completing 20 tests, a 10 EUR reward will be given. graz health Microbiological overview of production area. Food packaging is exposed to physical and chemical hazards, and microbiological risk is a also very important topic. With support from an external laboratory, the Graz plant introduced a microbiological overview of the production area. The first step included a Microbiological Air Measurement, which was performed in various locations. The very satisfactory results were below the limit for dairies. Furthermore, all finished products were tested for bacteria, mould/fungus and pathogenic germs after our converting processes. Neither these findings showed any contamination. Comparable processes and regular analysis are already implemented at several AR Packaging plants.

No migration of unwanted substances into traces of mineral oil in both food and its packaging. food was detected or exceeded set legal limits. Mineral oil traces can derive from various sources, ranging from Although local authorities increased the inspection frequency the direct treatment of food with oil, via lubricants, to direct and analyses of food products in several segments (e.g. fast absorption from the environment.

FOOD SAFETY AND HYGIENE MANAGEMENT 42 functional barrier solutions for improved food safety As a clear response to food safety concerns, AR Packaging, with its in-depth barrier expertise, can offer several functional barrier solutions to its customers. To protect food from external contamination and unwanted influences, a functional barrier is the best solution. AR Packaging combines barrier expertise in coating, laminates and films with unique know-how in tight and direct food contact packaging. Examples of functional solutions offered to our customers: The Group’s Performance Packaging segment, which The Safeboard® technology has been developed by the The Group company Flextrus offers barrier extrusion focuses on tight barrier and direct food contact Group in France.
