This is one of the reasons that we in 2009 joined the UN Global Compact. This report expresses our continued support to the initiative and the ten principles for responsible management concerning human rights, labour rights, environment and anti-corruption. We believe that the community and enterprise are inseparably interwoven. It is our ambition to create solutions that support people, community and environment. We want to participate in solving the challenges which face the world and thus contribute to a sustainable development of the community. In our capacity as consultants we have the possibility of rendering a positive impact on a sustainable world. We offer consulting on sustainable building, energy, water, environment and work environment. Based on our vision, Masterminding Sustainable Progress, we constantly strive to deliver sustainable solutions to the benefit of our customers, the environment and ourselves as a commercial enterprise. We have decided that from 2015 we will report according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G4). We want to do that because we want a more structured and systematic approach to our CSRreporting. Therefore, as from next year we are looking forward to intensifying and further targeting our CSR-efforts.

COP Report 2014 en.docx 9 14 CASES The New University Hospital in Aarhus – WORKING ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY COORDINATION The New University Hospital in Aarhus (DNU) is one of the largest and most complicated construction projects of recent times. The systematic integration of working environment from design to completed building has been highly prioritised and working environment considerations have been integrated into the very earliest phases of the design process. ALECTIA is responsible for safety and working environment on the DNU project. The initiatives that have been selected for the safety work have resulted in an accident frequency of half of the average in the construction industry in Denmark. COP Report 2014 en.docx 10 14 GIANT DATA CENTRE AT THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK AT RISØ The future giant data centre at the Technical University of Denmark at Risø sets new standards for viable heat recovery and high energy efficiency. When the data centre is complete, it will supply six times more excess heat than the Technical University of Denmark at Risø will be able to use itself. Work is therefore being carried out to identify a viable business model for the resale of this excess heat, e.g. to the district heating network. ALECTIA is the consultant on this project.
