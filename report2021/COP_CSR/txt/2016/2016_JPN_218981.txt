Addressing this issue by increasing the aftermarket product lineup will be effective for storing inventory more efficiently, increasing the consolidated base inventory turnover rate, increasing sales and shortening the lead-time. A quick response is extremely important in the aftermarket business. The lead-time from receiving an order to delivering the product differs depending on each product model type, however the target of “NTN 100” is to shorten the average lead-time of all products to half the current time. A delivery system is already in place in Japan, Europe and the Americas where products can be shipped out within 24 hours, and this system will be expanded to emerging countries and other regions on a global scale. A Warehouse for Aftermarket 23 NTN’s Vision 2 -2 Strengthen MRO Activities MRO is short for Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul, and is a type of agreement that covers all maintenance work for equipment operating at customer worksites.

Furthermore, we have also established production systems in demand areas so that we 200 can supply products to customers all over the world. On the other hand, the rapid increase in share has led to 150 dropping selling prices. And with the rising prices of materials and personnel expenses in recent years, the manufacturing costs of driveshafts are also on the upward trend. 100 One of the most important themes of “NTN 100” is expanding profits of our driveshaft business. Aiming to be “’NTN driveshafts’ achieving World’s No. 1 customer satisfaction 50 level,” we are committed to strengthen our infrastructure in terms of quality, costs, delivery and technology and will reform business structure. 0 2001 2006 2011 2015 ( Years ended March 31) ３ -1 Expand Profits of Driveshaft Business In our company’s automotive business, the “NTN 100” endeavor targets improvement of the operating margin from the present 4% to 6% in three years. Particularly important is the improvement of the profits of our driveshaft business, and out of many factors, we aim to focus efforts in reducing proportional costs and expanding high value-added products. To reduce proportional costs, we will further accelerate local procurement In addition, we will promote our near net shape processing method which eliminates all unnecessary materials to the maximum and material reduction measures which may even require changing parts design. In the future, we also hope to expand our lineup of high value-added products for premium cars including products with features such as high functions, high efficiency, ultra-light weight, and ultra-high angle, improve product mix and improve the margin with increased profits. On the other hand, we anticipate reduced selling price levels and increased fixed costs as a factor of decreased profits. We will therefore continue efforts to control discount and raise the prices of low-profit items, as well as pursue production efficiency by adjusting production load between production bases to enable use of excess man-hours, review production methods, and also reduce equipment costs by introducing new manufacturing technologies.

NTN’s driveshafts are important safetyrelated parts supporting the underside of automobiles. Given that they are directly related to human life, quality problems must never occur. As the NTN Group’s production bases continue to expand all over the world, we will establish a quality “NTN 100” Strategy assurance system with consistent “Made by NTN” global standard. In the U.S., local plants are lacking production ability to meet the sharply growing demands. Presently, we are able to realize stable supply by exporting products from Japan. However, we are considering reinforcing production capacity in the U.S. based on future demand trends. To build up even more stable supply capacity, we are currently striving to increase the capacity of production bases around the world. We are focusing efforts to achieve early stable operations of our two new production bases in China and Mexico, and we will adjust production load between production bases through these two bases. In this way, by establishing a system which enables stable supply from anywhere in the world, production and delivery time risks can be avoided. The construction of efficient supply systems is also effective for holding down investments. Research and development systems are also important for promptly reflecting local needs in products. NTN believes that in the future, there will be a need to build development systems in five regions in the world, namely the present Japan, U.S., France, and China, added with other Asian region. CSR Activities Supporting “NTN 100” For products, we will work on developing our next generation driveshaft module and offering them in a series. NTN is a manufacturer of both driveshafts and hub bearings. Making use of our strengths, we will line up a new series of module products that integrate hub bearings and driveshafts applying Electron Beam Welding (EBW) and Press Connect Spline (PCS).

This reduction of 60 billion yen will come from the approximately 35 billion yen generated with improvements to FCF over the three-year period, combined with the current balance of approximately 25 billion yen. Asset compression will improve the current inventory turnover ratio of 3.8 to 4.5 to generate a large amount of FCF. To achieve this, the proper stock standards will be clarified for each plant, and a system capable of cross-functional flow will be established, Environmental Activities Supporting “NTN 100” covering each region and each business headquarters, as well as head office departments. Other portfolio assets, including shares and other assets, will be sold off where possible to improve FCF further. In addition to the reduction in interest-bearing debt a reduction in obligations for retirement benefits will also be enacted. During the three years of “NTN 100,” pension assets are planned to be built up by at least 7 billion yen. If FCF is improved beyond planned figures or if funds acquired from selling off assets are greater than expected, a further buildup of assets will be considered. Assets of 5 billion yen have already been built up at the end of March 2015. Financial actions to improve net income to net sales The most important factor for improving net income to net sales is improving the net operating margin at each business sector. The highly profitable aftermarket business will be expanded in line with the “NTN 100” business strategies. The industrial machinery business is suffering from lower margins due to a slowdown in demand for applications including construction machinery and agricultural machinery, with the low operating ratio of production plants leading to an increase in fixed costs. Sales will be expanded over the next three years to raise the operating ratio of plants and improve margins. In the automotive business, efforts are being made to focus on improving profits of driveshafts, which is part of the “Manage Profitability” policy. Standards for making investment decisions will be reviewed to improve capital efficiency. Investment decisions will be Financial Section made with a focus on priority fields in line with “NTN 100” strategies. Returns for shareholders The NTN Group will provide ongoing long-term and reliable returns of profits to shareholders. Improvements to FCF will ensure sufficient funds for dividends, and a 30% will be considered the baseline of dividend payout ratio. The dividends for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 is planned to be 10 yen, however, we will aim for 30% dividend payout ratio swiftly. 30 Review of Operations Aftermarket Academy Initiatives NTN established the Aftermarket course provided positive feedAcademy and runs technical back, stating that “the course courses for end users and was designed with the end distributors with the aim of user’s worksite in mind, and it increasing sales in the aftermarwas extremely valuable.” NTN ket applications.

Moreover, to position as an integrated report, I suppose that it should be considered with “integrated thinking.” It is stated that “NTN contributes to build a sustainable society by taking its business activities as creation of a diverse range of value through a diverse range of capital investment” in this report. I regard this as a commitment for society and evaluate it. In fact, high-efficiency natural energy business and service solution business relevant to wind turbines, tunnel, bridge and others, are mentioned in NTN’s new medium-term management plan “NTN 100”. I consider these businesses could be regarded as integrated thinking, which natural “NTN 100” Strategy capital and social value creation lead to the company’s profit. In addition, I am convinced of the indication “Bearings themselves are “eco-products” that help reduce environmental impact”, and Takeshi Mizuguchi also the significance of developing products contributing to the environment is stated in the first Professor, Faculty of Economics, Takasaki principle of the Environmental Policy. However, this report does not represent the outcomes that City University of Economics how NTN’s products contribute to environmental value creation as a whole.

I hope to see more efforts in adopting feedback from various ranges of experts outside of the company.

Segment Information 1. Outline of reporting segments The Group’s reporting segments are divisions of the Group for which separate financial information is available, and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the highest management decision-making body (the Board of Directors meeting of the Company) in order to allocate management resources and assess performance of operations. The Group’s main business lines consist of the manufacture and sales of bearings, CVJs and precision equipments for the aftermarket, general industrial machinery market, and automotive market. Business activities in Japan are controlled by the Company (the Head Office), and overseas business activities are controlled by the General Manager responsible in each region. Business entities in each region prepare their own plans and strategies to conduct business activities while analyzing profitability and the investment efficiency of operations. Accordingly, the Group has four reporting segments based on geographic business segmentation controlled by the Head Office or the General Managers: Japan, the Americas, Europe, and Asia and other areas. Each reporting segment engages in the manufacture and sale of “NTN 100” Strategy bearings, CVJs, and precision equipments and other products. 2. Calculation methods used for net sales, income or loss, assets, liabilities and other items on each reporting segment The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in the significant accounting policies in Note 2. Intersegment sales and transfer are recorded at the same prices used in transactions with third parties. (Accounting standards for retirement benefits) The Company and its domestic subsidiaries adopted Section 35 of “Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Statement No. 26 of May 17, 2012) and the main clause of Section 67 of “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Guidance No. 25 of March 26, 2015) effective from April 1, 2014. As a result, the methods for calculating the retirement benefit obligation and service cost have been revised in the following respects: the method for attributing projected benefits to each period has been changed from the straight-line method to the benefit formula method, and the method for determining the discount rate has been changed to use a single weighted-average discount rate reflecting the expected timing and amount of benefit payments. The impact of this change on the segment income in the “Japan” segment is insignificant.
