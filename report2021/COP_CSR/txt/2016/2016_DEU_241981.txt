We want to be a source of growth and life through nutrients and minerals. We have more than 14,000 employees working each day to mine and process raw materials. The products and services that we provide help to improve nutrition, health and quality of life. Our level of vertical integration is exceptional. Raw materials and related sectors are fundamental to our continued growth. LEGACY TAKES US TO ANOTHER LEVEL This year, we are all looking forward to one of the most important events in the history of our company – the commissioning of our new potash mine, ‘Legacy’, in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Over four billion Canadian dollars were invested during the five-year construction time in order to strengthen our raw material and production base and enough steel was used to build five Eiffel Towers. Legacy is taking us to another level. We will have access to high-grade resources for generations to come and our average production costs will fall significantly. K+S will be the only potash supplier in the world with production sites on two continents and we will be able to tap into markets in which we are not yet adequately represented. Soon we will see the results of our effort. Potash continues to be an essential nutrient for all plant growth to feed the world. 6 PROSPERITY DOESN’T JUST HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY As a company that mines raw material, we acknowledge that long-term commercial success is not based solely on compliance with laws and legislation. Public acceptance is also essential. At the same time, however, we need a new social consensus acknowledging that industrial added value is the foundation of our prosperity. One can really sense that more and more limits are being set in terms of our industrial and technological development, often due to a fear of being regarded as anti-environment. However, what we need now more than ever is an appropriate balance between ecological and economic requirements. In summer 2015, we commissioned our new Analysis and Research Centre. This has created jobs in an economically underdeveloped region and means we can optimise production processes under realistic conditions. This is mainly to further reduce quantities of unavoidable residue resulting from potash production, which is economically advantageous for us as well. And yes, it is true. Industry is sometimes unpleasant in terms of noise, smell, and effects on the environment. But, as our new Analysis and Research Centre shows, we are working very hard to minimise the level of interference and impact on nature and people. We are offsetting it where possible and are developing solutions that enable us to avoid this impact in the first place. This conforms to our understanding of sustainability. We take the links between economic, ecological and social interests seriously, which we demonstrate for the first time in an integrated annual report covering the 2015 financial year. We have signed up to the Global Compact in September 2015. This underlines our support for the ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. 7 2015 FINANCIAL YEAR: A GOOD RESULT In 2015, all raw material markets suffered from price decreases, some of which were significant. These were mostly triggered by increasing economic difficulties in the major emerging market countries. The potash market was not unaffected, but price decreases were not as strong. In Germany, important permits for the handling of unavoidable potash-mining residue could not be obtained in time or for the necessary quantities. In addition, winter set in late in both Europe and North America, so 2015 was not without challenges. Nevertheless, our performance last year was very respectable. Despite increasing price pressure in the raw material markets and global economic downturn, in comparison to the previous year and in line with our forecast, there was a significant increase not only in revenues, which rose to € 4,175.5 million (2014: € 3,821.7 million), but also in the EBIT I figure, which rose to € 781.6 million (2014: € 641.3 million). Above all, this is thanks to the dedication and hard work of our global team of over 14,000 employees. The long-term development of K+S has been remarkable, with a fourfold increase in revenues since the year 2000. Not taking into account tax, depreciation and amortisation, there has actually been a fivefold increase in EBITDA. Canadian competitor PotashCorp has also clearly seen the company’s growth potential. They approached us in the spring of 2015 with an unsolicited offer to buy K+S at € 41 per share. Following a detailed review, both the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board of K+S Aktiengesellschaft decided that the proposed transaction did not reflect the fundamental value of K+S, and was not in the best interests of the company. Considering what we have achieved already, in the long term we see much more potential in K+S remaining an independent company. 8 GEARED FOR GROWTH The only way for us to enjoy sustainable success as a raw materials company in the future is by delivering long-term, economically viable solutions and not only focusing on short-term yields. Our task is to position K+S so that we are well prepared for the constantly changing requirements of the years to come. Above all, that means working on what we can influence directly – our processes, structures and our costs. In 2015, as part of the ‘Fit for the Future’ programme, our IT unit became leaner and central production control was introduced for locations in Germany in the Potash and Magnesium Products business unit. There was also a Group-wide increase in efficiency. Further measures are lined up for 2016 and we have put together a strong team to implement them. Our goal is to make improvements and savings that are sustainable in the long term, and together we will achieve this goal! Cost savings, however, will not be enough. We need to become more flexible and use our specialties and broad product range to distinguish ourselves even more from the competition. In the Potash and Magnesium Products business unit, this will happen by strengthening our potash specialties, for example through product innovations in the area of fertigation, i. e. liquid fertilization. In 2015, despite the unusually warm weather at the end of the year, the Salt business unit delivered its best result to date, but we will not stop there! In line with our ‘Salt 2020’ strategy, we are continually striving to improve profitability and become less dependent on the winter business. Almost 60 % of revenue is already generated from food grade salt and products for industrial applications such as the production of medicines, plastics and glass. Above and beyond this, we want to further strengthen our global presence, and see a lot of potential in the Asian market. 9 EBITDA GOAL FOR 2020 The Legacy Project, ‘Salt 2020’ and ‘Fit for the Future’ are the cornerstones of K+S Group’s growth. They will allow us to significantly reduce our debt within a short time period. Our Group’s goal to reach EBITDA of around € 1.6 billion by 2020 is of course ambitious in the light of falling raw material prices and high product availability. Nevertheless, we will continue to work towards it. We stand behind the company and will continue to present a strong K+S!

In addition, there are further retirement pension plans for which no provisions need to be recognised, as there are no further obligations apart from the payment of the contributions (defined contribution plans). These comprise both solely employer-financed benefits and premiums for converting employees’ remuneration into pensions. Employers and employees made contributions under the supplementary pension plan that has been closed in the meantime and is operated through the BASF pension fund.

These are known as repo transactions and are secured investments. The collateral, which cannot be used in other ways, is agreed upon with the contracting party using a ‘basket’, defined mainly by investment class, ratings, countries and currencies. The aforementioned criteria determine the loan value at which the collateral will be taken into account; in other words, when the rating decreases or the transferability of the respective collateral is reduced, the loan value is also reduced and additional collateral must be provided. The given framework of the potential collateral depends on our internal monitoring, which, fundamentally, takes into account the rating and the value of the particular credit default swaps. 182 2.6 NOTES The relevant payment obligations from finance lease contracts are due as follows: OBLIGATIONS FROM OPERATING LEASES (NOMINAL VALUES)  TAB: 2.6.64 2015 2014 LEASING LIABILITIES TAB: 2.6.63 in € million  Minimum leasing payments  Interest component received  Leasing liabilities – due in following year 41.0 31.2 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 – due in the years 2 to 5 132.6 93.5 in € million – due after 5 years 67.3 86.9 Due in up Total 240.9 211.6 to 1 year 1.8 1.1 0.9 0.5 1.0 0.6 Due in 2 – 5 years 5.2 3.4 2.9 1.7 2.3 1.7 Due in more In the case of both finance leases and operating leases, there are some rental extensions than 5 years 2.9 1.3 1.0 0.6 1.9 0.7 and/or purchase options available, as well as a small number of price adjustment clauses.

Transaction risk A transaction risk is a currency risk that may arise in connection with existing receivables or liabilities in a foreign currency if a transaction in a foreign currency is to be converted to the Group currency and thus represents a risk in terms of payment. Translation risk A translation risk is a currency risk, which may arise as a result of translating profit, cash flow or balance sheet items to other periods or reporting dates, which are accrued in a currency other than the Group currency. This is therefore a non-cash risk.
