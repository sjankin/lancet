Our approach to health and safety is guided by our belief that job-related illnesses and injuries are unacceptable. The fatal accident in February 2015 involving of Mr. Yahaya Mumuni – an employee of a contractor company at Bogoso – was a tragedy that we believe could have been prevented. Golden Star did have systems and procedures in place to help prevent this type of incident; however, the incident investigation found that these protocols were not adequately implemented. In response to this, we have revamped our efforts to help ensure that our employees and contracting partners understand and effectively implement these protocols. We aim to achieve this by providing additional training to our staff and contractors, with a particular focus on the contracting company that was involved in the incident. HEALTH AND SAFETY ACHIEVEMENTS Our Wassa operation was recognised at the National Mining Industry Awards in Ghana as the ‘Best Performer in Occupational Health and Safety’. Wassa was also recognised as the ‘Best Improved Mine’ and the ‘Best Mine Based on Occupational Injury Statistics’, as well as winning the National Mines Safety and First Aid competition for the third successive year. More importantly, our Wassa operation had achieved more than 10 million lost time injury (LTI) free workhours – the equivalent of 628 days of the team going home LTI-free. The Prestea Underground Mine has been LTI-free since April 2013 . These are achievements that we pride ourselves on as a company as it demonstrates that we can deliver quality work and go home safely to our families each day.

The clinical screening exercises were held in workplaces and 23 communities across our catchment areas. The Clubs surpassed their goal by screening some 4,049 women – an increase of 1,550 participants from the previous year. The initiative was supported by contributions from the Club’s generous collaborators and supporters including the GIZ, AEL Mining Services, the Ghana Health Service, International SOS (our health services provider), and Primus Catering. Breast Care International – a Ghanaian NGO – helped provide training and capacity-building for local Ghana Health Service staff in clinical breast screening, in line with the SDG Goal 3 for strengthening capacity to manage national health risks. In an overwhelming act of support and generosity, spouses of some of our employees and Board supported the initiative by producing original artworks that were exhibited and sold in support of the program.

FLORENCE ABRESI AND MS. RUTH COBBINAH As our operations are a key source of economic stimulus for the communities in which we operate, we recognize the important role we can play as an enabler for local economic development. With this in mind, we strive to provide local employment and procurement opportunities wherever possible. To enhance local hiring, we advertise job vacancies in local communities and all ‘unskilled’ positions are reserved for local communities. We have local training initiatives in place, such as the Community Youth Apprentice Program (CYAP), which helps community members acquire competencies to fill skilled positions. With over 59% of our workforce and third-party contractors hailing from local communities as well as 74% from the Western Region, the success of this approach is apparent. In 2014, we set a goal of developing a local procurement policy for our business. The draft policy has been developed and reviewed by internal specialist personnel ahead of finalization for the Executive Committee’s consideration. By focusing on local procurement participation, Golden Star has maintained a high 78% of its procurement expenditure to Ghanaian companies despite large International capital purchases made for equipment to support our underground mine developments. “I have been in the catering business for over 15 years.

The program incorporates capacity – Ms. Florence Abresi of Bondaye building and business development aspects with an overall aim of retaining and enhancing the benefits that flow from our operations for the benefit of local stakeholders. The program will act as a pilot to “With the inception of the Prestea South Nsuta guide and inform our future endeavours in this arena.

FIDELIA KWAPONG ARTHUR WITH WASTE RECYCLING TRUCK “When the Prestea South project commenced in July 2015, I secured a contract with another third party contractor as a food service provider. I currently serve an average of 30 staff per day. My restaurant used to be located close to a community refuse dump which was poorly managed but Golden Star is rehabilitating the land to convert it into public space. This has significantly changed the environment that I operate in and it is already having a positive impact on my business.” – Mrs. Nyame of Prestea 10 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 11 Community We support a broad range of community development initiatives for local stakeholders. By doing so, we can leave a legacy of enduring benefits for communities. So critical are partnerships to the success of the sustainable development agenda that a specific SDG goal was set to address the role of partnerships. A key focus of our efforts continues to be our multi-stakeholder partnerships to build upon our shared vision, values and goals for sustainable development, particularly the improvement of health and wellbeing, lives and livelihoods. PREVENTATIVE HEALTH INITIATIVES The health system in Ghana is focused mostly on curative care, which involves treating the symptoms of illnesses. There is less of a focus on preventative care, which aims to prevent illnesses before they arise, so reducing the need for treatment and the burden to already constrained systems. In 2015, we embarked on an initiative with one of our longtime partners, the German International Development Agency (GIZ), entitled Prevention is Better than Cure, with six other partners in the fields of health service provision, health care infrastructure, medical and diagnostic equipment and health insurance. As part of our contribution to the partnership, we financed the design, construction and equipping of a teaching clinic at Akyempim that has been purpose-built for preventative health programs, including family planning and individual health status initiatives. The clinic, associated preventative health programs, and national insurance initiatives that will be run from the facility, will serve as a pilot project for a much larger initiative with national reach that will, in later phases, extend through the quasi-Government health institutions in the country. HELPING BABIES BREATHE Post-natal mortality is a significant health challenge for Ghana and in 2015, the country was far behind the post-natal mortality target that was set as part of the Millennium Development Goals. According to district data, post-natal mortality is a particularly pressing challenge in our catchment communities. “The neonatal resuscitation training was a tremendous In 2015, we participated in an initiative entitled Helping Babies opportunity to upgrade my skills in handling deliveries and Breathe with another of our longtime partners, Project C.U.R.E.

Combined with low levels of education on hygiene issues locally as galmasey. Galamsey operations have very few – if any – within communities, this can result in vast amounts of refuse environmental controls in place, which has resulted in wide-scale accumulating in close proximity to communities causing health and degradation of land and water bodies across Ghana. In 2012, the sanitation issues for local residents. Minerals Commission estimated that there were 1 million people engaged in illegal mining in the country. In the central part of Prestea, there was an unregulated waste disposal site at the head waters of the main local creek that posed a Prior to commencing our Prestea surface operations, we ceded a major sanitation issue for the town’s residents. In 2015, in a major prospective section of our concession to the Minerals Commission, project of collaboration, Golden Star, the District Assembly and which then made concessions available for registered and legal traditional leadership identified an interim disposal site and are small-scale mining. This and our alternative livelihoods initiatives, developing plans for longer-term waste collection and management namely the Golden Star Oil Palm Plantation (GSOPP) and Golden Star by the community.

PRESTEA REFUSE SITE BEFORE Our Prestea operations are in areas previously damaged by galamsey. As such, we have the opportunity to improve environmental outcomes in these locations. Through progressive rehabilitation and preferential use of more heavily-impacted areas, our reclamation programs will seek to reinstitute stream courses and re-establish vegetation.

As part our approach, we aim to avoid, reduce, and mitigate negative impacts, while providing and enhancing positive impacts for stakeholders. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Publically reporting on our environmental performance helps drive continual improvement for our business. In 2015, there were zero reportable environmental incidents at our operations. Approximately 99.75% of our water quality samples met or surpassed regulatory guidelines. A full 100% of our air quality samples met regulatory criteria. Additional key performance indicators related to our environmental performance can be found in the ‘Year at a Glance’ section of this report. WATER MANAGEMENT Water is one of the most important issues from a business, regulatory, and stakeholder perspective. Therefore, we have a variety of programs and policies in place for water management and conservation. We aim to reuse and recycle as much water as possible to reduce our water requirements. At Bogoso, we operate a process water treatment plant that uses a variety of technologies – including reverse osmosis – to improve the quality of water for discharge to the environment. At Wassa, our water discharges meet quality requirements with treatment systems, such as wetlands and settling ponds. Specific studies have been conducted in relation to our current and future underground operations that show that there is limited potential for either project to impact the community water supply. This is because the host rocks have very low permeability and community water supplies come almost exclusively from aquifers near the ground surface, whereas our mines are located much deeper.

This responsibility is embedded in our company-wide Policy on Community Relations and Human Rights. We adhere to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which outline our responsibility to conduct due diligence on human rights matters, including in relation to our business relationships. The Guiding Principles also outline the requirement for the establishment of a grievance mechanism related to human rights, which we have implemented through our existing community relations programs. We also adhere to the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, which are guidelines established specifically for extractives companies to address human rights issues related to security provision. To support this commitment, we require that private and public security personnel undergo an induction process related to the Voluntary Principles. The Guiding Principles and the Voluntary Principles both help ensure that we do not negatively impact the human rights of our stakeholders. At the same time, our operations and corporate responsibility initiatives can also have a positive impact on human rights. For example, by providing local employment and business opportunities, we help enable local stakeholders obtain access to food, water, shelter, and an overall adequate standard of living. Our investments in local schools help enable local stakeholders to enjoy the right to education. Our investments in health stewardship initiatives help enable stakeholders to enjoy the right to health. These are but a few examples of the countless ways in which we can help promote the enjoyment of human rights. 18 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 19 Anti-Corruption Anti-Corruption ROYALTY PAYMENTS As part of our commitment to working against corruption, we 2015 Q1 2015 Q2 2015 Q3 2015 Q4 2015 Total commit to supporting the Government of Ghana’s commitment to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) by publically GSBPL reporting our payments to the Office of Administration of Stools Lands (OASL), traditional authorities and all levels of government.
