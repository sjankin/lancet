FUELING YOUR FUTURE TOWARDS WORLD GO GREEN ANNUAL GROUP REPORT JUNE 2015 – MAY 2016 BATC DEVELOPMENT BHD COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 2016 REMARKS BY GROUP EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN Dato’ Seri Mohd Safie M. Jaffri Group Executive Chairman BATC Development Bhd Energy security and independence are vital to national security and to the socio-economic development of any country. The rise and fall of a nation depends on the strength and sustainability of their energy resources. Unfortunately, the passionate pursuit of energy resources and the high level of dependence on fossil fuel have caused climate change and global warming which must be addressed immediately. I call upon all leaders in the world to work towards a mutual agreement to coordinate and unify the clean energy and biofuel policies and ensure the market’s stabilization in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of clean energy and biofuel to the industry and consumers while securing a steady income to producers and a fair return on capital for those investing in this industry. BIONAS is willing and able to issue investment to meet the demand of any country for biofuel or waste to energy projects in their respective countries. BIONAS takes proactive steps by collaborating our expertise and technology with any party to make climate action a reality. 002 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 2016 STATEMENT BY GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ZURINA AMNAN Group Chief Executive Officer BATC Development Bhd 10th May 2016 To our stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that BATC Development Bhd reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption.

In 2011, it’s paid up capital was raised to RM100.0 Million. In 2009, the company has started venturing to other countries with more than 40 countries at present. Not included the sales by its joint venture companies in other countries, Bionas’ audited sales in 2008 was RM20.0 Million, 2009 at RM32.0 Million, 2010 at RM61.0 Million, 2011 at RM72 Million and 2012 at RM88 Million. The sales for year 2008 to 2009 were from Jatropha seeds, seedlings, fertilizer and pressing mills; and the increased sales for year 2010 to 2012 were from ‘samples’ of biofuel additives. After the products registration was approved by U.S Environmental Protection Agency (U.S EPA) on January 29, 2013, the company has secured a significant amount of commercial biofuel contracts in many countries and this will contribute to a drastic increase in sales volume for year 2013 to 2015 estimated to reach up to RM5.0 Billion. The Company has developed eight (8) new clean energy and biofuel products for diesel, gasoline, heavyfuel, jetfuel , energy and power plant industries from various feed stocks including Jatropha, Algae, Canola, Rubber seed oil, Cotton seed oil and Used cooking oil. Bionas clean energy and biofuel products are offered at the same price or lower than the international fossil fuel prices. 007 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 2016 ABOUT BIONAS DATO’ SERI MOHD SAFI’E M.

The key success factor for Bionas lies in the application of its technology for the production of bio-fuel as well as the implementation concept in developing its plantations. The applied technology and implementation concept is proven to be effective and has been the driving factor for the growth of the Company.

We strive to find ways of conducting businesses using smart approaches and most of our R&D work centers on finding ways to minimize or eliminate the impracticalities. Today, we have successfully formulated and synthesized a very stable mixture of bio-fuels with Nano Emulsion and Polarization Technology which requires blending & storage tanks to mix bio components and fossil fuels. Even though most of our additives are Jatropha based, we have the technology to formulate “Drop-In” additives derived from other types of feedstock. As bio-fuels and renewable fuels are comparatively new to existing fossil, we do not wish to be seen as competitor to the oil majors. Instead we opt and prefer to collaborate with the oil majors, national oil and energy companies to further enhance their existing products and turning them into renewable fuels. We firmly believe that through collaboration with the oil majors we would be able to speed up the promotion and use of renewable energy, minimize or eliminate investments required for infrastructure setups and utilizing the oil majors’ industry knowledge & experience, retailing, and supply chain. Through our technology, we believe this could also reduce the use of fossil thus prolonging the life of oil reserves. 0022 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 2016 BIONAS PRODUCTS REGISTRATION, CERTIFICATION & TEST REPORTS The Company’s products registration with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 0023 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 2016 Certificate of Fuel Additive Registration from Department of Energy, Ministry of Energy, Philippines to Bionas Philippines Corporation 0024 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 2016 Permanent Registration for M30 Bio-Petrol and B30 Bio-Diesel issued by the Ministry of Energy, Philippines for Bionas Philippines Corporation 0025 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 2016 Test result by PUSPAKOM (Malaysian Government Vehicle Inspection Agency) with 94% Emission Reduction.

Biogas 1. Power generation; 2. Combustion, obtaining energy, such as: boiler combustion (the value of heating: 5500 ~ 5800 kcal / m3) 2. Heavy oil Widely used in industries such as steel and iron factories, ceramics or chemical industries or hotels, restaurants etc. as fuel oil, or used for heavy oil generators to get electricity. 3. Crude carbon black Can be used for construction bricks, or widely used as industrial carbon black N774, N660, N330 or color carbon after deep-process. 4. Syngas Used as fuel in burning room, saving energy 5. Metal Can be sold directly 6. Non-Standard Can be used for vehicles mixed together with Diesel oil standard diesel oil or used for vehicles directly after blending with additives. 7. Carbohydrate Landfill, bricks for plants etc 8. Fertilizer Can be sold directly 0065 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 2016 WORLD CLEAN ENERGY HUB TURKEY – CLEAN ENERGY HUB FOR GLOBAL SHIPPING LINES 1. Bionas Turkey produces B25 Bio-Heavy fuel = 75% HFO + 24.975% Water + 0.025% Bionas Additive. Proven reduced emission up to 90%, 75% less vibration and 25% savings on fuel consumption. 2. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), United Nations Regulation 13 on NOx Emission Control Areas (NECA), under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, bringing in stricter controls on emissions of SOx, NOx and PM. 3. Turkey’s Bosporus Straits are a major shipping “choke point” between the Black and Mediterranean Seas. Turkey shall enforce the New Fuel Sulphur Regulations For Vessels In Turkish Ports, Inland Waterways and Territorial Waters. New fuel sulphur requirements to be imposed on the sale and circulation of marine fuels in Turkish ports, as well as on Turkey-flagged vessels in the Emission Control Areas (ECAs) specified under MARPOL Annex VI. 4. Turkey will be the production hub for clean energy (B25 BioHeavy fuel) as the solution for the global shipping lines to comply with NECA regulation. 5.
