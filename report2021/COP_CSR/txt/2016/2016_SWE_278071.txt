By using renewable energy and a more efficient use of energy, our products can help make a fossil-free society a reality. By maintaining our profitability, we can continue to have a positive impact in the local communities where we operate. For NIBE it has long since been natural to contribute to a sustainable society in the ways we can. As our mission is to provide sustainable energy solutions, the climate and energy issue is always in the core of our business. Some of our products can accelerate the transition to into independence of fossil fuels by utilising renewable energy in various applications. Other products help make machines and equipment more energy efficient, thus contributing to the reduction of total energy requirements. Yet other products must eventually be phased out and replaced with even better, more climate-friendly products. The climate threat and a growing population are the external factors that affect us the most: The global community thus needs to use less climate-changing energy totally even though there are more people. This presents a huge challenge that must be met sustainably, yet it also brings us great opportunities. Today, nearly 50 per cent of our sales come from products that are rated as low carbon economy (LCE) products. We want to increase this percentage to at least 60 per cent over the next five years. One short-term hindrance to meeting our goals is low gas and oil prices, which might make our customers hesitate to invest in new renewable energy technologies. In 2015, we had several product launches that took us another step forward as a global provider of innovative energy solutions, and we continued our focus on research and development. In addition to our high-tech laboratory in Markaryd, during the year we inaugurated an advanced development laboratory in Kasendorf, Germany. Our activities by definition adversely affect the environment, and we are continuously working to minimise and improve them using a systematic approach. In 2015, we came even closer to our goal of having our production companies environmentally certified – two more companies received their ISO 14001 certificates. The remaining 20 are working to obtain their certificates in 2016. In the best of worlds, the overall environmental benefits of our products in use would be greater than the adverse environmental impact of our operations. With the help of more life-cycle analyses of our products, we hope to tip the scale over to the positive side in the future. A key area is our own working environment. In 2015, we improved our accident frequency from 10.6 to 8.5 per million hours worked. We are also continuing, with full force, to boost our efforts so that we can minimise risks, prevent injuries and increase safety for our employees. Since 2014, NIBE has been a member of the UN Global Compact and has thus committed itself to living up to the 10 basic principles of responsible and sustainable business practices. Just as we recognise the need to work sustainably and comply with internationally accepted guidelines, we recognise the need to ensure a sustainable supply chain. That is why we are intensifying our efforts to assess suppliers against our criteria, based on the UN Global Compact’s 10 principles. We have made much progress in our sustainability work in 2015, and we feel we are on the right path. Having gained in-depth insights, we now aspire to raise the bar and do even better. That is how we will work from 2016 onwards. Gerteric Lindquist Managing Director and CEO 4 NIBE · 2015 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 1 Targets and achievements We have a number of Group-wide targets linked to our focus areas.

We create value by developing innovative products and solutions that meet the highest demands for energy and resource efficiency. In 2015, 10 out of 25 product groups were classified as “low carbon economy” products (see p. 7). This is equivalent to 49% of our sales, or SEK 6.5 billion. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT We buy from suppliers who share our values, principles of business ethics and high aspirations in terms of sustainable development. In 2015, we created value for our suppliers by purchasing direct materials for approximately SEK 5.4 billion. PURCHASING In the production process great value is created when responsibility, professional competence and excellence interact to produce high-quality products for a demanding market. In 2015, sales per employee were SEK 1.25 (1.13) million, an increase of 11 %. PRODUCTION We strive to transport both materials and employees in a way that takes the greatest possible consideration of people as well as the environment. In 2015, we paid just over SEK 270 million to external shipping companies. TRANSPORT NIBE’s products are designed to create long-time value for our customers and end users by a reliable functionality and low energy costs to the benefit for borth the economy and the environment.

A complete system from NIBE’s Danish company, SAN Electro Heat a/s, will reduce energy needs by 50%, or about 400 MWh, each year. Six strategically located weather stations provide local weather information every hour, with a three-hour forecast that can be accessed from a PC, tablet or smart phone. The entire system can be controlled remotely, and any errors can be reported automatically so that they can be corrected before they become a traffic problem. This will help reduce disruptions and improve the level of service. And it will increase confidence in public transportation, perhaps even getting more people to leave their cars at home.

Since then, we’ve been working worked hard and focused to achieve a good through safety committees and a good dialogue working environment for all our employees.” Safe workplaces Our aim is to have a business with no accidents. It is therefore gratifying to know that we improved our accident frequency from 10.6 to 8.5 per million hours worked in 2015. This means that we have already achieved our first interim target by a good margin. The new interim target is six accidents per million, to be reached by the end of 2018. We are well positioned to achieve this target in view of all the initiatives being taken within the Group. Many companies have already made great progress, with safety audits, risk assessments, training, incident reporting and specific measures to improve the physical working environment. Several of the companies have also seen the connection between good housekeeping and improved health and safety performance, so several 5S projects were launched with positive results. Some companies, such as Eltwin A/S, Backer Alpe Monterrey and WaterFurnace International, have set their internal targets to zero accidents, which is exemplary. Backer Facsa S.L. proves that this is a realistic target because they did not have a single accident in 2015. Kaukora, which had 65 accidents per million hours worked in 2015, has appointed a dedicated resource with the experience needed to improve its working environment. The company has also installed TV screens throughout the facility showing reported incidents and reminders to work safely. We look forward to reporting their improved results next year. As a Group, we will continue to pursue a healthy culture of safe workplaces and stable productivity. Our concern for people means that workplaces without accidents will remain in focus until we achieve this goal. 18 NIBE · 2015 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Care for natural resources Our operations shall with utmost care economize with natural resources. This means using less water and less raw materials as well as reusing and recycling more. Although we have already achieved a great deal, we want to improve still further throughout our value chain. Material use is a key issue for all our production facilities, while energy use is important even for companies that have only office and/or warehouse facilities.

We also focus on reducing waste, using less material and better materials, and phasing out harmful chemicals. Our products have a mostly positive environmental impact when they are used, considering that they result in lower energy consumption and lower carbon dioxide emissions than their alternatives. End-of-life products must be dealt with correctly to ensure a maximum recycling rate. In our reporting of direct environmental impacts we include our production units. We don’t have a basis for reporting the environmental impact of transportation and supplier activities as a result of our orders. Our greatest direct environmental impact is from the use of raw materials, atmospheric emissions, discharges into water and waste. Our greatest indirect impact is from transportation and our suppliers’ environmental impact as a result of our orders. Waste Waste categories % of total use In 2015, 16,800 (15,500) tonnes of waste were generated, of which 1,650 (1,620) tonnes were hazardous waste.

At the 2015 event, 110 people gathered under the theme “Stay Together”, where values, working conditions and principles of business ethics were items on the agenda. All suppliers were encouraged to sign a Code of Conduct based on the agenda items. An awards ceremony for best quality and best delivery reliability was also held, and five suppliers received the “Top 5 Quality Suppliers in 2015” award.
