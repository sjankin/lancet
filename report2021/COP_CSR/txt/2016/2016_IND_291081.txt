Page 7 of 13 Environmental Safety • A procedure for leak detection at pre-determined intervals of CFC based refrigerants in all refrigeration and air-conditioning systems on board are being complied. (Record of same is being maintained in vessels’ Planned Maintenance System). • In order to reduce the disposal of lead and other hazardous substances into the sea/land; lead – acid batteries and other batteries are returned to the manufactures. • As per International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships 2001, the Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on existing tankers (less than 20 years) have been replaced by non-harmful anti-fouling systems since 31st December 2007 onwards. Liner Vessels The Liner ships of the Company are sometimes engaged in the carriage of Hazardous and dangerous goods, both in the break bulk as well as container vessels. The company has developed an in-house manual which caters to shipment of International Dangerous Maritime Goods Code (IMDG) cargoes in containers. This document also highlights the company’s policy and procedures in respect of carriage of hazardous and dangerous goods and also their procedures adopted in implementing such carriage. The officers connected with dealing of hazardous goods are trained by attending various workshops and seminars and their knowledge is updated on matters involving carriage of hazardous goods. Frequent interaction with our partners in the container line, owners of vessels, other bodies have benefited SCI in developing hazardous cell.

SCI is technical consultant to Andaman & Nicobar Administration for acquisition of 2x1200 Passenger vessels from M/s. Cochin Shipyard Ltd. SCI has requested shipyard to calculate the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) on voluntary basis, even though as per IMO, EEDI regulation is not applicable to these vessels. This shows that SCI is committed to the UN Global Compact Initiative. On a recently acquired VLCC from a Chinese Shipyard, SCI had voluntarily incorporated stringent LR “ECO” notation concerning environmental protection. Towards conserving energy and Fuel Efficiency, in addition to the earlier four SCI tankers, one more tanker and one bulk carrier has been audited by Classification, thereby taking due steps towards economising on Fuel and Energy Efficiency. All ship repair workshops are strictly instructed that they should not use ASBESTOS material in any form during repairs/renewals on board vessels, as use of ASBESTOS is prohibited on ships in any form as per MSC 1/Circ 1426 and SOLAS regulation. For promoting green and sustainable energy, SCI has undertaken installation of 350 KW of Solar Power Plant at its Maritime Training Institute, Powai, Mumbai. SCI, in phases, is installing energy efficient LED Lights at all its office buildings. Till now LED lights have already been installed on 2 floors of Shipping House, Registered Office at Mumbai. Further, SCI has also replaces its Neon Lights sign board with energy efficient LED lights. Further, SCI had undertaken energy audit through M/s. TQ services (a Tata Group company) to assess measures to reduce power consumption at its registered office and other regional offices. The report was submitted on 10-10-2015. In addition to above, SCI provided technical consultancy to Geological Survey of India (GSI) towards acquisition of Oceanographic Research vessel “Samudra Ratnakar”. This vessel will be operating mostly in Indian territorial waters and Page 9 of 13 need not meet all environmental regulations which are applicable to international sea going vessels. Despite that SCI ensured that vessel complies with DNV’s CLEAN design requirements. Further, these vessels are fitted with Ballast water Treatment Plants on voluntary basis. Even the EU requirements of low sulphur fuel are applied on these vessels on voluntary basis. Principle 9: Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. The company is committed to doing business consciously and responsibly and believes in setting up sustainable systems to protect the environment. The business of transportation of goods by sea brings the operations of the company very close to delicate marine ecosystems and the atmosphere. Implementation of EcoEco-friendly technologies SCI has been taking initiatives in incorporating various measures such as • Installation of ballast water treatment plants in all new vessels being ordered well ahead of regulation coming into force to minimise transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens. • Vessels are built with a green passport and carry the inventory of Hazardous Materials. • The company while acquiring new building vessels ensures full compliance with the stringent international regulations of design and operating systems in force. • The design and equipment of these vessels further greatly reduce the environmental impact from emissions to air and also discharges to the sea. These vessels have been assigned the optional notations such as “CLEAN” or “ES”. • SCI’s recently acquired VLCC has been awarded a notation of “FP” by LRS. • Company has put in place leak detection system at pre-determined intervals of CFC based refrigerants in all refrigeration and air-conditioning systems on board. • Ballast Water Treatment Plant has been fitted on voluntary basis on the new Oceanographic Research vessel. • SCI also encouraged a Chinese Shipyard M/s.
