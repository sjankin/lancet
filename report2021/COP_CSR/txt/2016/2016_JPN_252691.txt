Itsuaki Tonouchi, President and C.E.O Rubycon Corporation The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact In October 2011, Rubycon Corporation expressed the support for the universal principles about Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-corruption upheld by United Nations, and officially joined the UN Global Compact. Rubycon Corporation contributes to society thru business activities, by supporting 10 principles of the UN Global Compact. 3 Consumer Issues Rubycon products contribution to society << Rubycon products contribute to society through power electronics technologies >> Urgent global themes such as energy issues are faced by societies. Core technologies to control energy with countermeasures to avoid escalation of global warming with power electronics are of primary importance. Rubycon is proposing capacitors to various power conversion devices to contribute higher efficiency, longer life and miniaturization. << Conductive Polymer Aluminum Solid Electrolytic Capacitor >> Conductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitors have a wider temperature range, are more compact, have lower ESR, and higher resistance to ripple current than other aluminum electrolytic capacitors. These features enable high-efficiency power supply design and can contribute to the reduced number of parts. The net result of this capacitor technology is energy savings improved efficiency. << Example of parts reduction with conductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor >> << Power Film Capacitor >> Voltage and current of main circuits have been increased to improve efficiency in power electronics. Most notably, in applications such as solar/wind power and automotive. Demand of large film capacitors (referred to as power film capacitors) is increasing. We are addressing deposition technology and low ESL (inductance) designs to improve efficiency and improve miniaturization. 4 << Screw Terminal Type Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor >> Screw Terminal Type Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors are used for main circuit of power electronics together with power film capacitors. We are downsizing dimensions and raising withstand voltage with our independent development of new electrolytes and adoption of high capacitance etched foil. Stud screw type capacitors have efficient heat radiation structure and high resistance to ripple current, so as to contribute to efficient packaging and downsizing of equipment. We are further addressing to develop new electrolyte and foil for higher voltage use, which is important to circuits for the next-generation power electronics semiconductor. << Electric Double Layer Capacitor >> Electric double layer capacitors use electric double layer produced on the boundary between the electrode and electrolyte (as dielectric) for storing electric charges. This capacitor realizes quick charge-discharge cycles as well as long life since there aren't chemical reactions to store charges. This capacitor is ideal for applications requiring momentary large current such as power assist and energy regeneration. If the capacitor is used as the main power for rechargeable equipment, maintenance is reduced. 5 Security of Product Safety We, at Rubycon, closely check compliance and non-use of banned substances in planning phase of product development, in order to secure product safety. We also describe safety instructions in our catalog and delivery specifications. We perform reliability tests with various processes to secure safety of products to be manufactured. We conduct reliability tests in various phases, including process design phase to secure correct materials, specifications and production conditions. During the mass production phase we check reliability of all products through regular sampling, also during the product development and planning phases. Such tests include reliability and the general process is confirmed in addition to safety, so as to maintain the reliability of Rubycon products. We are striving to supply safe and reliable products now and in the future. << COC: Claim 0 Campaign >> We, at Rubycon, accept every complaint from customers with sincerity in order to improve customer satisfaction and quality related with product safety. We have started quality improvement activities as the manufacturer responsible for our products, so as to attain our goal Claim 0. We started Claim 0 Campaign (COC) in May, 2012. In the result of the forth year, 60% reduction in the complaint rate (number of complaints/output) has been kept. We are addressing to COC activities to attain Claim 0. * ppm (Parts Per Million) denotes complaint rate. << Improvement of Customer Satisfaction >> Rubycon has the quality policy of manufacture to win customer satisfaction that provides customers with relief and trust through 5 pillars of organizational power, cooperation power, analyzing ability, quality control ability, small group activities. We are addressing Customer Satisfaction through quality to contribute to the society and the future.

On the basis of our internal regulations, we are developing such activities to our group companies through mutual improvement. We have published Rubycon Group Code of Conduct conforming to EICC (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition), and are providing it to all employees and group companies. If any compliance violation is found, we will seek accurate facts to determine the cause followed by strict action to prevent recurrence. Internal Audit We have a designated audit department under the president's direct supervision to audit fair and proper performance of internal activities in accordance with relevant statutes, operation policy and internal regulations. The department will further provide advice to improve and correct our business as well as the risks for compliance in organizational activities. This audit covers all organizations in each company group. Risk Management In addition to Risk Management Activities conducted since 2012, we are strengthening internal systems and reviewing relevant internal regulation since inquiries from customers on code of conduct and ethical risk management are increasing. We will also assess effectiveness of disaster contingency plan as well as reviewing BCP (Business Continuity Plan) for disaster and unexpected contingency. Protection of Intellectual Properties (Measures against Counterfeit Products) We, at Rubycon, have participated in the IIPPF (International Intellectual Property Protection Forum) so as to cooperate with various entities and companies for eradicating counterfeits. Protection and Control of Information Misuse of information important to corporate management will have significant impact on relations of trust with partners and their management.
