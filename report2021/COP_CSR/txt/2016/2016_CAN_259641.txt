Sincerely, Pierre Langlois Chief Executive Officer Econoler 2 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) 2 COMPANY PROFILE Econoler is a consulting firm specialized in the design, implementation, evaluation and financing of energy efficiency projects and programs. The firm also has experience in renewable energy, energy performance contracting, climate change mitigation and carbon financing. In addition to its international headquarters in the City of Québec, the firm has offices in Montréal and Toronto (Canada), Tunis (Tunisia), Cotonou (Benin), Lomé (Togo), Abidjan (Côte-d’Ivoire), Mexico (Mexico), Suva (Fiji) and Hanoi (Vietnam). Econoler’s North American and European subsidiaries include: Econoler USA, Inc. (Washington, D.C.), Econoler S.A. (Sofia, Bulgaria) and IFS2E (Paris, France). Company’s Administration Structure The firm currently operates four divisions: International Projects, Canadian Operations, Program Evaluation and the Econoler Training Centre. Each department is overseen by a director reporting to the President and CEO. Econoler relies on its team of specialized staff and a worldwide network of associate consultants and partners contributing to the implementation of its projects. The firm places a special emphasis on partnering with local firms and experts. They are led by a project management team comprised of a technical director in charge of the quality of the firm’s outputs and a project manager who oversees contractual and legal obligations to both clients and subcontractors. Lastly, technical directors and project managers report to Econoler’s Director of Operations. International Experience Econoler has been operating for the past 32 years in industrialized, emerging and developing countries on more than 3,000 assignments worldwide. Most of these projects have been carried out for utilities, private firms and governments, as well as for major multilateral and bilateral organizations. 3 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) 3 DESCRIPTION OF PRACTICAL ACTIONS Econoler is keenly aware that properly fulfilling its corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays a major role in maintaining its standing as a leading energy-efficiency consulting firm in a rapidly growing and increasingly competitive global market. The firm wants the UNGC principles to become some of the core values driving our staff’s and our firm’s tireless pursuit of professional excellence. For this reason, Econoler joined the UN Global Compact in 2013. Over the past year, we took actions to develop a set of ethics policies setting out our positions on workplace anti-discrimination, environmental protection, anti-corruption and human rights. Our specific actions related to each major aspect are reviewed below. 3.1 Labour Econoler is committed to creating and maintaining a physically and psychologically healthy and safe work environment, where no current or prospective employee is at a disadvantage because of their age, colour, disability, gender, marital status, national or ethnic origin, race, religious belief or sexual orientation. Physical, mental and sexual harassment will automatically result in dismissal. In 2014, Econoler commissioned a Banque de Développement du Canada (BDC)1 expert to assess its business structure and human resources practices. One of the key recommendations made by this expert is to attract and retain adequate and qualified human resources. Indeed, since Econoler is always expanding, high-quality HR will help create a healthy, supportive and productive work environment. Based on the BDC recommendations, Econoler has been proactively developing an internal training program tailored for the need of its new and old staff. The company is currently preparing for its 35th celebration that will be held in September 2016 during which the staff from all around the world (Bulgaria, Fiji, Benin, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, Washington and Montreal) will convene towards the headquarters in Quebec City for a 1-week event that will include a comprehensive training program and celebrations. In addition to providing its staff members with a competitive healthcare insurance package, Econoler also makes many efforts to create a pleasant and supportive work environment by organizing sport activities, social gatherings and the monthly staff lunch party. Econoler guarantees an objective treatment of all decisions pertaining to the selection of local subcontractors that are purely based on experience, education and merits. Econoler does not hesitate to hire junior resources should their profile comply with the project requirements and is often their first international experience opportunity, which will benefit them to acquire future relevant professional experience in the future. Econoler complies with minimum wage standards in every country where it is active and always make sure to provide a remuneration assuring a decent quality of life, in addition to covering travel expenses and per diem to all local experts. 1 The Banque de développement du Canada: http://www.bdc.ca/EN/Pages/home.aspx 4 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) 3.1.1 Goal The ultimate goal of Econoler’s labour policy is to create and maintain a safe, healthy and pleasant work environment, where every employee is treated equally to enable them to achieve their professional aspirations. This goal is not only applied to Econoler’s permanent staff, but also to the project sub-contractors and partners. 3.1.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating Econoler’s department directors access the services and inputs of its staff so as to improve their management skills and knowledge of each staff member’s professional profile. Employees can use an anonymous complaint mechanism to comment on their work relations and environment and report issues and problems. 3.2 Environment As a leading international energy-efficiency and renewable-energy consulting firm, it is only natural for Econoler to make every effort to engage in and promote environmentally sustainable practices. We have adopted a green policy and incorporated concrete actions into our environment-management and daily operations, and participated in a number of voluntary international environmental initiatives, as highlighted below. › Our office space has undergone energy retrofits featuring high-efficiency lighting, presence detectors, setback thermostats and other devices that allow us to reduce our energy consumption. Employees have been made aware of the importance of saving on energy resources. › We encourage the use of electronic documents to minimize printing. When printing is needed, our office has a dedicated printer to reuse sheets with an unused side. › All our office devices are ENERGY STAR labelled. › We have a recycling system in place for paper and other recyclable items and a battery collection bin. Our old computer equipment and components are also recycled by a specialized firm. In addition to our daily environmental-friendly operations at the office, Econoler voluntarily provided funding for the work of registering emission reductions as part of an energy efficiency project in Yemen (registered as PoA 9557 on January 31, 20132) from 2010 to 2013, in collaboration with the World Bank’s Carbon Finance Group, and the Dutch government, with which Econoler signed an agreement on the carbon credits of this project. In 2014, Econoler agreed to support a new international development project together with the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and the Institut de la Francophonie pour le Développement durable (IFDD). As a voluntary 2 Clean Development Mechanism website: http://cdm.unfccc.int/ProgrammeOfActivities/poa_db/1NM5O6Y38049SXHR7ZGUDWTJFKBPVE/view 5 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) consultant, Econoler is also helping implement a major West-African regional initiative involving the development and implementation of energy efficiency codes for buildings and regulations on minimum performance standards and energy labelling. 3.2.1 Goal The ultimate goal of Econoler’s environmental policy is to limit the company’s carbon emissions and environmental impacts by adhering to strict environmental principles and practices. 3.2.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating At Econoler, we closely monitor our performance in reducing carbon emissions as part of the international voluntary initiatives and communicate the results to relevant stakeholders. 3.3 Anti-Corruption Since our professional activity spans diverse national and cultural contexts around the world, including countries where the rule of law is weak, Econoler is committed to avoiding and denouncing any form of corruption and bribery. We prohibit offering, giving, solicitation or acceptance of any bribe, whether in cash or in other forms of inducement, or engaging in any other corrupt practices. Econoler strictly follows its anti-corruption principles and steers clear of any proposal that lacks transparency, particularly at the stage of project development. If any abnormal situations arise in the course of project implementation, Econoler does not hesitate to denounce them and report them to relevant authorities. 3.3.1 Goal The ultimate goal of Econoler’s anti-corruption policy is to ensure the moral decency, ethical integrity and legal soundness of the assignments undertaken by strictly avoiding association with any corruption or bribery practices. 3.3.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating Econoler’s staff is required to report any issues and questions regarding potential abnormal situations to our Development Director, especially at the early stage of project development. When such suspicions are confirmed, the firms or actors in question are put on a black list. Econoler’s staff is well informed about our anti-corruption policy and any misconduct on their part will result in their dismissal. 3.4 Human Rights Econoler is dedicated to protect human rights in its work environment and within its work agreement with external consultants (local sub-contractors and partners). The company ensures that workers are provided with safe, suitable and sanitary work facilities. 6 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) Econoler has a tolerance-zero policy on all types of harassment (physical, verbal, sexual or psychological) which is clearly expressed in its Employee Handbook (last update August 2015): Harassment is unacceptable behaviour and is expressly prohibited. Employees engaging in any form of harassment, sexual or other, will be strongly disciplined through appropriate corrective measures, including termination of employment. The firm is committed to maintaining a work environment free of harassment with a view to protecting the dignity as well as the physical and psychological integrity of employees. 3.4.1 Goal Provide a safe, pleasant and harassment-free work environment to all employees and external consultants equally. 3.4.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating Employees who have reason to believe to be the victim of harassment may file a complaint, verbally or in writing, with their immediate superior or the Deputy Managing Director. Any complaint will be treated in strict confidence and in the event that the accusations are found to be true, appropriate actions will be taken, as appropriate, as quickly as possible. 7 160 Saint-Paul St., Suite 200, Quebec City, QC G1K 3W1 CANADA | Tel.: +1 418 692-2592 Fax: +1 418 692-4899 www.econoler.com
