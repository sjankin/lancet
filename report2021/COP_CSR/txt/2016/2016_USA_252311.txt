Our Pledge 1.1 Corporate Citizenship and a Sustainable Future CH2M celebrated a decade of reporting and transparency last year in our corporate citizenship and sustainability efforts. As CH2M Chairman and CEO Jacque Hinman shared in her speech to the Corporate Eco Forum, the secret to CH2M’s success starts with The Power of AND. We always consider a full, additive list of “ands” – raising the social, economic, and environmental priorities in our work and serving the interests of our clients and all stakeholders to make the world a better place. As an industry leader and one of the first in our sector to publish a sustainability report, we are passionately committed to corporate citizenship; affecting the environment, society, and the economy in positive ways; and helping clients create a healthy, vibrant future for generations to come. As we provide services that include consulting, planning, design, engineering, program management, project delivery, and operations and maintenance for our public and private sector clients, we find that each client interaction gives us a special opportunity to infuse business with our values by offering sustainable solutions to our clients’ most pressing infrastructure and natural resource challenges. The foundation of our corporate citizenship pledge is our Sustainability Policy, which includes commitments to environmental stewardship and the United Nations (UN) Global Compact’s precautionary principle. As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, CH2M is committed to ensuring that our business policies incorporate and support the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles. This report serves as our 2015 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress report. CH2M Chairman and CEO Jacque Hinman endorses the CEO Water Mandate to help address the global water crisis. We make it a priority to include transparency, anti-corruption, and good corporate governance as a part of our sustainability efforts. For more information about the UN Global Compact and the CEO Water Mandate, visit www.unglobalcompact.org. 1-1 1 OUR PLEDGE 1.2 Letter from the CEO At CH2M, we stake our reputation and market leadership on delivering sustainable, socially inclusive solutions via engineering, program and project management addressing the most significant challenges in the infrastructure sector. Never before have the livelihoods of so many changed by such measures as we’re seeing in this decade of rising prosperity and a burgeoning, global middle class. Global megatrends like urbanization and increasing CH2M Chairman and CEO Jacque Hinman demand for water, energy, and transportation drive unprecedented and escalating needs for infrastructure and natural resources. CH2M serves where these megatrends converge: in response to such challenges, we deliver the most sustainable and effective solutions — for the ultimate purpose of improving lives and the condition of our planet. Our overall business strategy is explained in our 2015 Summary Annual Report, summarized in this illustration. We’re organizing around our clients, focused squarely at the intersection of the highdemand, megatrend markets we are uniquely positioned to serve. As we do this, we recognize that a foundation of ethics and integrity, corporate citizenship, and employment excellence will bring the most talented, skilled professionals to our clients’ challenges, globally and locally. 1.2.1 Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship Strategy I shared our sustainability vision and strategy at the Corporate Eco Forum gathering last June in my speech, The Power of AND. The Power of AND means living our passion for sustainability and corporate citizenship while maintaining our technical excellence, strengthening our business, and returning greater value to the bottom line. It would have been easy to stop halfway through that list, but the difference between being a follower and a leader is willingness to implement the Power of AND. Here’s how we use the Power of AND: • Choosing to work with clients whose values, including safety and worker welfare, align with ours • Reducing our carbon footprint by 25 percent by 2017, regardless of business growth or setbacks 1-2 1 OUR PLEDGE • Committing to improve our financial performance, safety record, workforce diversity, business growth, and turnover rate • Investing in our communities, including sustainability and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education • Increasing our leadership and commitment in areas such as climate change and natural infrastructure We commit to continuing to work with forward-looking clients and partners to put technology to work for our shared future. 1.2.2 Looking Back: Our 2015 Sustainability and Citizenship Performance We’ve received a record number of honors and awards from our clients and the industry such as the prestigious Stockholm Industry Water Award and the World Environment Center’s Gold Medal Award for International Corporate Achievement in Sustainable Development, and we’re honored to share these awards with our clients and partners. We also achieved record safety performance, were named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the eighth consecutive year by Ethisphere® Institute, and were ranked in the top 5 percent of global companies for our ethics and integrity by Covalence. Last year, we delivered US$122.8 million of third-party certified sustainability solutions across our projects worldwide. 1.2.2.1 Focusing on People and Communities We are engaged in multiple partnerships to advance sustainable communities, natural infrastructure, and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, such as The Nature Conservancy, Engineers without Borders (USA), Let’s Talk Science (Canada), Think Science Programme (UAE), and Bridges to Prosperity. We continue to be a significant corporate sponsor of Water For People, raising over US$2 million to increase access to safe water and adequate sanitation around the world. Working with respected governmental and nongovernmental partner organizations, we’ve worked hard to foster collaboration to advance worker welfare around the world—hosting industry roundtables, developing technology to improve working conditions, and helping connect workers with their families back home. In 2016, we’ll test a new mobile app for migrant workers on select projects in Qatar. We believe that one of the best ways to ensure client satisfaction is to recruit, hire, and retain the best and brightest in the business, so we take our investment in our people seriously. CH2M employees received an average of 16.3 hours of training per person last year, a 39 percent increase over 2014. In our 2015 employee engagement survey, our people identified CH2M’s three key strengths: health & safety, work environment, and continuous improvement. Keeping our people safe is a high priority, evident in the continuing decrease in our recordable incident rate (9 percent), to a level 53 percent lower than the U.S. industry average. Still, we are not satisfied, and have set a goal to reduce recordables by another 10 percent in 2016. 1.2.2.2 Responding to Natural Resource Challenges Water and energy are two of those megatrends that drive our business; they form a natural intersection with our sustainability work over the past year. Our people continued to look for creative ways to save money and conserve resources for clients, such as identifying cost-effective energy projects for the U.S. Department of Defense, with potential annual savings exceeding $23 million, nearly 1 million MBTUs of energy, and 330 million gallons of water. We saved our water and wastewater clients US$9.9 million last year, reducing fuel use by 111,000 gallons of fuel and redirecting 4,200 tons of wastewater biosolids for beneficial reuse. Pioneer Natural Resources, a large, Texas-based energy company, is using recycled water in the Permian Basin—an arid area with limited water—to reduce its reliance on fresh water sources. CH2M designed and helped install the water pipeline system that is helping Pioneer to improve its water strategy while extracting needed energy resources. 1-3 1 OUR PLEDGE In partnership with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and The Nature Conservancy, we launched the Natural Infrastructure for Business Guide (NI4Biz). The guide provides a roadmap—developed by business, for business—for incorporating resilient, hybrid infrastructure approaches to protect corporate assets while enhancing nature with climate-smart solutions. I invite you to check out NI4Biz and join us in building more case studies that demonstrate the value of growing economic and environmental outcomes simultaneously. Further, our award-winning work with The Nature Conservancy for the community of Howard Beach, New York, the Urban Coastal Resilience study, illustrated how to incorporate ecosystem functions and a hybrid engineering approach of grey and green infrastructure to build coastal and economic strength at the same time. The sustainability and corporate citizenship strides we make with our partners and clients are huge, and it is critical to our integrity and culture that we take the same measures within our own walls. Last year, we stayed on track to reduce our carbon footprint 25 percent by 2017, were named a Climate Leader for Excellence in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Management (Goal Setting) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reduced potable water consumption on our Denver-area campus by 320,000 gallons, and advanced recycling and electronic waste disposal strategies in our offices worldwide. 1.2.3 Looking Ahead: Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship in 2016 and Beyond Our clients face increasing public, regulatory, and financial pressure to improve their sustainability performance, and they call on us to help. We’re focusing on the need for resiliency as the challenges of accommodating more people, providing water supplies, and dealing with the impacts of climate change converge. And of course we’ll continue to walk the talk in our own operations, through energy and water efficiency, and integrated, lean, environmentally and socially responsible supply and value chains. We commit to transparency, setting specific measurable goals, and demonstrating results. Recently, we became a collaborating partner with IMPACT 2030, committing to help combat the world’s most critical issues such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. IMPACT 2030 aims to convene hundreds of partner companies, mobilize private sector volunteer networks, and collaborate with stakeholders in civil society, the United Nations, government, and academia. Finally, we’re preparing future sustainability leaders through programs like the CH2M Residential Programme (UK), which lifts up social mobility for people with economic disadvantages. By partnering with local residents in the developing world, sending employees into schools to promote STEM education, and bringing students into our offices and projects to expose them to STEM and sustainability opportunities, we hope to create positive role models for future generations. Jacqueline C. Hinman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 1.3 Sustainability Strategy From a business perspective, sustainable development presents a range of issues and risks. It also brings the opportunity to offer new value and services, and improved delivery systems and technologies to our clients. Our employees infuse CH2M with the sustainability-inspired principles, knowledge, technologies, tools, and methods 1-4 1 OUR PLEDGE needed to achieve better management of our company and better long-term solutions for our clients. Such solutions respond to critical global issues, business realities of our clients, and values that are important to employees and partner organizations. 1.3.1 Key Sustainability Impacts and Effects CH2M’s business is planning, designing, building, and managing the infrastructure that touches human lives daily. We support clients in creating infrastructure for cities, national governments, and private sector clients with an emphasis in water, transportation, environmental & nuclear, and energy and industrial solutions. Often, the lines between our sustainability impacts and effects, and those of our clients, are blurred. We incorporate sustainability principles, such as ethics, human rights, worker safety, and resource efficiency, as routine parts of doing business. However, the results of this work, particularly reporting for waste, energy, and resource savings, belong with client organizations. Examples of sustainable projects delivered throughout our service portfolio can be found on our Web site. CH2M’s value chain, from the regulatory setting, suppliers, and subcontractors upstream of our work, to the business partners and clients downstream of our organization, involves a range of stakeholders and a multitude of social, environmental, and economic issues. When we enter into an agreement with a client to set tough goals and make investments for resource efficiency and worker welfare, we create opportunities for innovative partnerships, increasing career opportunities and development for our employees, raising expectations throughout the supply chain, and showcasing new possibilities for doing work with host governments and regulatory agencies. Ultimately, these actions create a better place for the client’s constituents, customers, and communities. Considering sustainability throughout our value chain, even when we cannot directly track, measure, or take credit for those impacts or benefits, constitutes a systems-thinking approach to our footprint. This means that CH2M often engages in spirited and productive dialogues with clients on how to drive sustainability improvements throughout the value chain, particularly on large projects and programs. To make connections among players in our value chain and uncover opportunities to improve sustainability, we ask questions like: • To what extent can we ask suppliers and contractors to enter into agreements that reach beyond the regulatory, governmental, and cultural context? • What roles do our business, joint venture, and nonprofit partners play in our culture, and in driving sustainability change with us? • How does our company culture affect or influence everyone else in our value chain? How does our clients’ culture influence us? 1-5 1 OUR PLEDGE Asking these questions and taking a systems-thinking approach to our value chain means that we engage many different disciplines when prioritizing our sustainability challenges and opportunities. Our materiality chart illustrates how we lay the foundation for human progress, aligning our business priorities with what our stakeholders and the planet need from us as a proactive corporate citizen. Our highest priorities include topics like ethics, health and safety, environmental compliance, and investing in our people (attraction and retention, and training and development). Issues towards the upper right reflect dual importance to CH2M and our stakeholders. For example, climate change risk and resilience are key drivers for our infrastructure business and critical issues for preserving global health and economies. Similarly, worker welfare could affect future business opportunities and is critical to human rights. All of the aspects listed on the materiality chart are included in our sustainability reporting because they have been identified as important to CH2M, our employees, and our clients. Our progress on these aspects is summarized in the sustainability trends, risks and opportunities section, with details provided in each section of this report. Throughout the report, the main processes in place to manage and address performance are described for each sustainability aspect. Our overall performance is monitored through our Sustainability group, as described in Governance and Corporate Citizenship. 1-6 1 OUR PLEDGE 1.3.2 Sustainability Trends, Risks, and Opportunities Globally significant social, technological, and ecological shifts create greater opportunities to deliver sustainable, socially inclusive solutions for clients, serving growing development demands. As global population growth combines with crumbling and nonexistent infrastructure, increasingly scarce natural resources, demands for energy and water, and the already devastating effects of climate change, it becomes increasingly clear that everything in our world is connected. Businesses and governments must work together, across boundaries and jurisdictions, to create a thriving economy that will sustain a safe world for the generations that follow. By 2030, the world will include 40 megacities of 10 million-plus people, growing from 28 today, driven by unprecedented urban migration of a burgeoning, global middle class. As cities, old and new, grapple with demands of rapid growth and limited capital, they face a stark “chicken or egg” reality, since a city cannot effectively compete for economic investment if it cannot fund essential infrastructure. There is no greater resource-management demand than that for the world’s water—from coastlines that have too much water to communities without enough to drink. To combat climate-related flooding, we are advancing innovative approaches that incorporate natural infrastructure to create more resilient communities. And to replenish potable water supplies, we are pioneering new treatment technologies that remove excess minerals and pollutants, restoring used water to pristine purity. Through the next decade, the global transportation network—composed of roadways, railways, airports and waterways that move people and goods—will get the lion’s share of infrastructure investment in cities old and new. Annual infrastructure spending is slated to double from 2012 levels to US$9 trillion by 2025, including a US$305-billion spending package passed last year in the United States, the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation” Act. The global environmental market also is expected to grow in the coming decade, bolstered by the agreement reached in December 2015 at the UN’s 21st Conference of Parties on climate change in Paris (COP21). The agreement is ushering in increased demand for climateand sustainability-inclusive solutions in an environmental market that today already tops US$1 trillion annually, while nuclear cleanup and decommissioning services also remain strong. Ranked as the world’s top environmental firm, CH2M leads in the management of sustainability, remediation, and environmental management programs for public jurisdictions and industries, such as energy, chemicals, and manufacturing, and technology. At the same time, the convergence of digital technologies and a massive shift in the global energy market are driving an industrial renaissance and the globalization of supply chains. In manufacturing, these trends are yielding many increases in productivity as well as flexible production models, including machine-to-machine systems and make-it-anywhere 3D printing. In concert with these trends, CH2M is delivering process innovations for diverse industries, ranging from multi-facility management for a global industrial conglomerate to modular development of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturing plant. With these efforts, our clients realize greater efficiencies from energy to production, ultimately boosting the capacity of existing facilities while reducing waste and maximizing asset returns. Given these trends, risks, and opportunities, as well as our materiality analysis, the top sustainability topics most relevant to our organizational strategy are ethics and anti-corruption, health and safety, environmental compliance, economic performance, climate change and carbon emissions, and the linked issues of attraction and retention of employees, along with their training and development (we need top talent to solve these complex challenges). Although each of these issues is managed under separate leadership, the functional teams communicate and collaborate through our overall governance and corporate citizenship management approach, which reflects the interconnectedness of these topics. 1-7 1 OUR PLEDGE These top sustainability topics are listed in the following table, along with what we have learned during the past year and the actions we plan to take going forward.

Integrated talent compensation, learning, and other processes, management technology solutions will give CH2M better and will improve our ability to manage insights into employee availability, development, resources, starting from recruiting and performance, and mobility, which will increase retention continuing throughout an employee’s career. and reduce costs from recruiting and attrition. 1.4 Ethics and Business Conduct CH2M was founded by remarkable professionals who put honesty and integrity above all else. Each generation since has built on that solid footing, as new companies have joined the CH2M family. CH2M’s unwavering commitment to management with integrity and corporate responsibility dates back to the early days of our history, when the company’s cofounder, Jim Howland, authored the Little Yellow Book. The Little Yellow Book, known and beloved throughout the organization for its commonsense advice and simplicity, is legendary among CH2M’s current and former employees. Its simple wisdom is often quoted in company meetings and casual conversations as a way to confirm the core values of how CH2M does business. As a companion to the Little Yellow Book, we developed our Employee Ethics & Business Conduct Principles (our employee code of conduct). This work builds on the simple and 1-9 1 OUR PLEDGE lasting concepts of the Little Yellow Book, and translates them into clear policies and aspirational, values-based guidance about the behavior expected from those who work for CH2M. The principles guide our employees through complex ethical decisions that must be made every day in the everchanging global marketplace. Our Employee Ethics & Business Conduct Principles is a living document, which is periodically updated to reflect our changing business and evolving regulatory environment. It combines all CH2M ethics and compliance policies and offers tools and practical advice. Both new and seasoned employees, wherever they are based and from top to bottom in the organization, review the principles annually, and take a training course and quiz on the key components embedded in the document. As a condition of employment at CH2M, employees must affirmatively attest to their commitment to following these principles. The standards encompassed in the Employee Ethics & Business Conduct Principles are published in the eight languages most commonly used by employees. They are also available on our intranet and Web site. The Ethics and Compliance team, within our corporate legal function, is responsible for program implementation. In addition, as part of our continuing commitment to educate employees about our anticorruption policies and raise awareness about the different forms of corruption, we published our Anticorruption Compliance Guidance brochure. For our suppliers, subcontractors, and business partners, we established and implemented a set of ethics and conduct principles that complement the employee ethics and conduct principles in 2011. Our Supply Chain Ethics & Business Conduct Principles and a companion Supplement for U.S. Government Work serve as the standard of expectations for entities that wish to work with CH2M. Our suppliers, subcontractors, and business partners must agree to comply with Our Supply Chain Ethics & Business Conduct Principles when registering and submitting their qualifications as potential business affiliates. The terms and conditions of agreements to perform work with us for our U.S. government customers directly incorporate the policies in Our Supply Chain Ethics & Business Conduct Principles. 1.4.1 Employee Reporting and Communications Knowing that vigilance, transparency, access without fear of retribution, and oversight are imperative to confirming that our employees around the world have the information and support they need to make difficult ethical decisions, we have instituted a variety of employee reporting tools and educational programs. The GuideLine, our confidential hotline, is a versatile phoneand Web-based tool that employees and members of our supply chain can use to seek guidance, discuss ethical concerns, or report potential violations of laws or policies. The GuideLine is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, anywhere in the world, offering users the ability to report concerns without fear of reprisals. The Web-based hotline tool can be accessed in more than 200 languages. All contacts through The GuideLine are investigated and addressed by a team of trained professionals whose objective is to make sure that the company does the right thing and delivers services to our clients with integrity. During 2015, the total number of hotline contacts received (224) was slightly lower than the rolling 5-year median of 231 contacts and a rolling 5-year average of 232 contacts. Contacts are categorized by concern, such as ethics and integrity, accounting and fraud, human resources, and safety. In 2015, CH2M, like many companies, saw more reports related to human resources than any other category (this includes the subcategories of bullying, discrimination, retaliation, and workforce violence). To promote prompt and appropriate response to these reports, the Ethics and Compliance and Human Resources (HR) teams hold regular meetings to review the reports received, status of investigations, and lessons learned. 1-10 1 OUR PLEDGE By increasing employee awareness of our expectations regarding how CH2M does business with integrity, and by including open discussions about the importance of ethics and integrity for CH2M, we are seeing greater employee engagement across all of our global operations. This is evidenced by an increase in the use of The GuideLine, for example, to report concerns and ask questions on the best ways to address ethical challenges. We are encouraged by these increases because they speak to greater awareness among our employees about our expectations in the ethics and compliance arena and the confidence employees have in our confidential reporting system. Moreover, the rise in contacts to The GuideLine gives us an opportunity to assist our employees in proactively making sound decisions, instead of expending time and energy on a reactionary basis. Senior leaders in the firm provide regular messages about our business ethics through featured news stories, e-mails, reminders, links, in-house social media, and face-to-face and direct communications, keeping our ethics program highly visible. In addition, CH2M has declared May as “Ethics Month,” and we take the opportunity through increased communication to heighten ethics awareness among our employees. As Chairman and CEO Jacque Hinman has said, “By continuing to emphasize our core value of respect for people, partners, and the planet, as well as our other Little Yellow Book values, we have the opportunity every day to serve our clients and communities with distinction.” Another important component of the ethics program at CH2M is our ethics ambassador program, re-launched in 2015. This program provides employees with direct access to local senior leaders, who understand how business is done in local geographies and are able to translate our expectations about doing business with integrity into local commercial contexts. Our ethics ambassadors are respected by their local peers. They are perceived as safe and reliable sources of information and guidance. The new program includes training and a new group of ethics ambassadors, covering every major office and project site. They are an additional resource for ethics questions and guidance, offering a reliable way to connect our employees in the field to their home offices, where ethics policies are set and preventive measures are enforced for compliance. We regularly conduct an ethics survey to test our employees’ knowledge and familiarity with our training, awareness, and methods of receiving and handling employee reports received through The GuideLine. Our last survey, conducted in June 2013, indicated that the vast majority of our employees (over 90 percent) are familiar with our ethics materials and how to contact The GuideLine, and they believe CH2M is serious about its commitment to ethics and integrity. Our next survey will be conducted in 2016. 1.4.2 Anti-corruption Policies and Procedures CH2M has operations in more than 90 countries on five continents, where we support private and public customers and do work for the United States and other national and local governments. Because we do business in some of the most difficult places on the planet (as rated by the global organization Transparency International), our anti-corruption program is a cornerstone of our Employee Ethics & Business Conduct Principles. We train our employees and educate our supply chain on how to avoid corruption pitfalls that are common in many places around the globe. Wherever our work takes us, we follow our company’s core values for ethics and integrity. As a matter of principle, we neither seek nor are interested in attracting business through corrupt means. CH2M conducts rigorous legal, ethical, and risk-based assessments of our supply chain as part of our supplier qualification processes. Our procurement procedures and policies on gifts, entertainment, and hiring political consultants govern how we engage with anyone who could provide access or influence in helping us secure work. Before a political consultant is hired, we require thorough due diligence and senior executive review. As part of our risk management process, we engage with each of our business groups to keep them aware of the risks of corruption in jurisdictions where they work. This process includes providing training 1-11 1 OUR PLEDGE and easy access to tools and advice. For those business groups with extensive project commitments in countries known for high corruption risk, we perform specialized training and periodic audits. We routinely engage with our business groups in open and frank communication about the risk of corruption, how to recognize red flags that might be evidence of possible corrupt business activities, and what to do when employees become aware of corruption risk. CH2M’s anti-corruption policies are reviewed and updated periodically to reflect the latest developments in laws and best practices on the subject. This is particularly important in countries that rank high on the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. We provide training on issues raised in the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK’s Bribery Act, and other similar anti-corruption mandates from jurisdictions where we do business, through a combination of Web-based and in-person training. Additional anti-corruption training is provided as part of our project-specific risk management and mitigation planning. All senior employees also receive training focused specifically on corruption, conflicts of interest, and ethics and compliance in general. When a corruption-related allegation is reported through The GuideLine or other tools, it is investigated by a multidisciplinary team that includes representatives of legal, internal controls, and, when necessary, forensic accounting staff. After obtaining the relevant facts through document review, inperson interviews, and review of available computer data, the investigation team arrives at an independent, unbiased conclusion regarding the veracity of the complaint. Disciplinary and retraining actions are taken quickly by management, if necessary, based on the recommendations made by this specialist team. 1.4.3 Government Participation and Lobbying Public policy creates business opportunities and challenges that affect CH2M and our customers. Our Government Relations team promotes the business and professional interests of CH2M, its employees, and its customers, both in the U.S. and abroad, at national (including U.S. federal), state, provincial, and local levels. The team focuses on our business interests, important issues to the engineering and construction industry, and issues that affect the general quality of our communities. These government affairs professionals are responsible for managing firmwide legislative initiatives, educating our employees about our ethics and compliance programs associated with political advocacy, supporting business development, managing the company’s political action committees, and working with leading professional societies and relevant nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We are actively engaged in staff-level briefings and consultations in the U.S. and foreign legislatures; executive branch agencies; and state, provincial, and local governments to address the realities of resource limitations and sustainable solutions to our communities’ needs. Our Government Relations team actively tracks key legislation and regulatory efforts in the areas of water, wastewater, and water resources, among other important issues. Our employees also serve in leadership positions in professional organizations that take positions on these issues. The Government Relations team, in coordination with the Legal Department, carefully evaluates all political consultants with whom the company partners. We are cautious and conservative when selecting individuals who perform lobbying or business development roles on our behalf. We will do business only with those who share our zero tolerance policy for corruption. 1.4.4 Global Engagement To promote ethics principles as our business imperative and provide industry leadership on this important issue, CH2M became a founding signatory of the World Economic Forum’s Partnering against Corruption Initiative, a member of the UN Global Compact Working 1-12 1 OUR PLEDGE Group on the 10th Principle, and a member of the Construction Industry Ethics and Compliance Initiative. As a testament to these proactive measures and the quality and ethical commitment of our dedicated employees, Ethisphere®* Institute named CH2M one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the eighth consecutive year (*World’s Most Ethical Companies” and “Ethisphere” names and marks are registered trademarks of Ethisphere, LLC). Additionally, in 2012, CH2M qualified for inclusion in a global, Geneva-based, ethics and reputation analysis service that provides monthly reports and rankings on multinational companies. Using six major international treaties as its framework—including the UN Global Compact and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises—and applying 45 criteria, ranging from lobbying and political contributions to community volunteerism and financial support, Covalence tracks over 500 of the world’s largest companies. In December 2015, Covalence again ranked CH2M in the top 5 percent of the global companies for its ethics and integrity; we worked to maintain our ranking through the end of the year. The firm ended the year ranked No. 25, and No. 2 for the construction and materials sector. Covalence was founded in 2001. Its director and cofounder, Antoine Mach, has been recognized as one of the world’s most influential people in business ethics (according to the research-based Ethisphere Institute). 1.5 Human Rights CH2M is committed to maintaining the highest level of human dignity on any project we touch. As a result, we place great importance on ensuring the welfare of workers involved in the projects we supervise or advise on, and we have a zero tolerance policy for human trafficking, child labor, and forced labor. On some infrastructure projects, there is little to no local construction labor, so non-native workers must be recruited into the country. These individuals often endure hardship in their journeys back home. As a project manager and consultant on many projects around the world, we rarely employ construction workers, but we focus on ensuring that our subcontractors and partners uphold the highest standards. Thus, we are taking concrete steps and collaborating with key stakeholders to improve conditions for these migrant workers. As part of this process, we are working closely with fair labor expert, Verité, to implement our own worker welfare policy, which was approved by the CEO and launched in spring 2015. The provisions and requirements of our policy apply to CH2M and all contractors within our supply chain who are working on projects on behalf of CH2M. In addition, we share this policy with our clients, and strive to collaborate with other firms in our industry to encourage adherence to the practices outlined in the policy. We are continuously improving our services to clients in the worker welfare area by engaging with relevant stakeholders and drawing from international best practices. CH2M aspires to be at the forefront of our industry, acting as a catalyst for change, both on our projects and in the wider communities in which we work. In the following paragraphs, we highlight some initiatives where we are actively seeking to improve conditions for migrant workers in the construction sector. 1-13 1 OUR PLEDGE 1.5.1 Procurement in New Worker Welfare Policy Following our Worker Welfare Policy, we have introduced new screening procedures for our supplier community. After the policy was approved in 2015, CH2M screened 100 percent of its suppliers in the Middle East throughout the year, ultimately approving 47 percent to be eligible to work with CH2M based on their worker welfare policies and performance. During the screening process, if the suppliers do not comply fully with our policy, we review their worker welfare practices and management plans and their commitment for continuous improvement. In most cases, we can work with the supplier to help them achieve our standards. If suppliers do not comply with our policy in an agreed-upon timeframe, we cancel the contract based on worker welfare shortcomings. As part of this process, CH2M has screened new suppliers and assessed current suppliers for alignment with our Worker Welfare Policy. For example, when CH2M identified noncompliance from one supplier of janitorial staff in the Middle East, CH2M terminated this contract and directly hired the workers. 1.5.2 Technology Development On major infrastructure projects, standard worker feedback mechanisms include written forms as well as hotlines. CH2M believes that technology can be used to create more effective mechanisms, and in 2015, we formed a partnership with Humanity United and Caravan Studios to collaborate on a new mobile technology, whereby workers may anonymously submit feedback on their living and working conditions. This information will immediately be available to the supervising engineering and construction firms via a program management dashboard which allows companies to act on worker complaints in a timely manner. We will pilot this technology on select projects in 2016 and, ultimately, seek to foster adoption of the tool across the industry. 1-14 1 OUR PLEDGE 1.5.3 Industry Collaboration In partnership with the Institute for Human Rights and Business, CH2M has hosted a series of high-level roundtables to promote industry collaboration on human rights issues. Participants have included representatives from over 15 major engineering and construction firms, various international human rights groups, and high-level government officials. CH2M is supporting a research initiative to determine the best path forward for formalizing this effort into a new industry organization focused on human rights and worker welfare in the engineering and construction industry. CH2M also co-organized three roundtables in collaboration with Business in the Community to share best practices on human rights across multiple industries, including discussion of the UK Modern Slavery Act. 1.5.4 Public Policy Engagement Throughout 2015, CH2M strategized with key government officials in the United States, United Kingdom, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on ways to improve the conditions of migrant workers in the construction sector. We support the UK government’s introduction of legislation on modern-day slavery, and have worked to raise awareness about the Modern Slavery Act 2015 across our sector—collaborating with the UK government to co-host industry roundtables dedicated to educating other engineering and construction industry companies on how best to comply with the Act’s requirements. 1.5.5 Governance CH2M’s Worker Welfare Policy has been championed at the highest levels of the organization, all the way up to, and including, our chairman/CEO and board of directors. In 2015, CH2M’s board of directors expanded the scope of its Governance Committee to include corporate citizenship. The committee monitors the company’s worker welfare activities, along with other material issues. Understanding the importance of third-party verification, we engaged fair labor consultant, Verité, throughout 2015 to advise on policy implementation and provide training to key leaders on opportunities for improvement. CH2M takes Verité’s feedback into account and makes adjustments to its management and implementation approaches to maximize effectiveness. 1.5.6 Training CH2M has launched an internal employee education program aimed at informing staff of worker welfare challenges and what to do if abuses are observed. This includes regular news stories, visuals, and targeted trainings. CH2M also included a segment on the Worker Welfare Policy in its annual Ethics Training, which was completed by over 19,000 employees around the world in 2015. In collaboration with Verité, CH2M has conducted a series of in-person workshops to implement the new Worker Welfare Policy. In 2015, this included in-person training of 40 senior staff across multiple functions and geographies in the Middle East, as well as a workshop for 20 procurement, legal, and HR leaders at CH2M’s headquarters. We also sponsored Verité’s participation in two gatherings of the engineering and construction industry to provide a platform to share their knowledge on this critical issue. As part of our internal training at CH2M, we empower employees at all levels to seek guidance from senior management, directly or through our confidential hotline, and to report any suspected human rights violations without fear of retaliation. On joining CH2M, new employees receive a copy of our Employee Ethics & Business Conduct Principles, which clearly includes our expectations about fair labor practices, trafficking in people, and other important ethics principles related to how CH2M does business. In furtherance of our human rights and labor practice expectations, we distribute Supply Chain Ethics & Business Conduct Principles, a companion document to our Employee Ethics & Business Conduct Principles, to our major suppliers. Additional training on human rights is provided for employees who 1-15 1 OUR PLEDGE are likely to confront these issues in specialized ethics and compliance training; training hours are reported in Training and Development. 1.5.7 Thought Leadership Because of our commitment to worker welfare and engagement with the human rights community, CH2M is regularly invited to speak at and participate in panel discussions focused on human rights and ethical supply chain management worldwide. 1.6 Economic Performance In 2015, the gross revenue of all CH2M companies was US$5.36 billion, excluding joint ventures. Including the CH2M portion of revenues from unconsolidated joint ventures, the total gross revenue was US$5.4 billion. Approximately 33 percent of CH2M’s 2015 revenues were from operations outside of the United States. Operational financial data are available in the company’s 10-K and relevant Security Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. After debuting on the FORTUNE 500 list at 436 in 2009, CH2M ranked 480 in 2015 (down from 437 in 2014). CH2M is a largely employee-controlled professional engineering services firm, with an internal stock market. In the past, our common stock was only available to be owned by current and retired employees, former employees, and directors, through our various employee benefit plans. In 2015, our stockholders approved certain amendments to CH2M’s restated certificate of incorporation, so that third-party investors can invest in our common or preferred stock, including preferred stock that is convertible into common stock. In June 2015, Apollo Global Management, LLC, a large private equity investor, purchased 3.2 million shares of our Series A preferred stock, for approximately US$200 million. In response to the challenges faced in 2014, CH2M implemented transformative changes in 2015 to make our business more focused, nimble, and efficient. We continued our restructuring program (including evaluations of certain business lines, workforce reductions, facilities consolidations, and corporate overhead cost reductions). We incurred US$60.6 million of costs related to the restructuring program during 2015. While we do not expect to incur additional restructuring costs in 2016, we expect to continue to benefit from annualized cost savings resulting from these restructuring efforts. Additionally, a write‐down on a fixed-price transportation project affected our financial performance in 2015, but we are taking action to limit losses and recover costs from this project through the claims resolution process. Economic highlights in 2015 included consistent, strong performance in our business areas of environment and nuclear; industrial and urban environments; oil, gas, and chemicals; and water. Our reduced cost structure and transformational initiatives contributed to solid, profitable financial performance in 2015. CH2M’s leadership team is committed to improved performance, and optimistic about our plans and potential to grow revenues and earnings. Moreover, we strengthened our balance sheet, cash flows, and credit capacity throughout the year, which means we increased flexibility to invest in our future. CH2M’s financial management approach is described in the Governance section of our Web site. Portfolio risk management is conducted by CH2M’s Risk Committee, which focuses on the company’s risk at large and proactively anticipates and mitigates material risks that may affect CH2M’s business and its stockholder value. Our Audit Committee is appointed by the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors to oversee the integrity of our financial statements; the independence, qualifications, 1-16 1 OUR PLEDGE and performance of our independent auditor; and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. CH2M’s Compensation Committee, also appointed by the Board of Directors, has overall responsibility for approving and evaluating all compensation plans, policies, and programs as they affect the CEO and senior executives. The Compensation Committee also reviews employee benefit plans and employee stock programs. 1-17 This page intentionally left blank. Fostering Employee Excellence 2.1 Improving Worker Welfare Around the World In burgeoning construction markets worldwide, millions of workers travel from one country to another to build infrastructure for transportation, water, and other major projects. These workers can pay high recruitment fees in their home countries to land these jobs. Additionally, they are at risk of being exploited by unscrupulous contractors and may get paid late, or less than promised, for their work. They also might lack the ability to change their jobs, while living in poor accommodations. Because of these poor working conditions, human rights and fair labor groups have shone a spotlight on companies working in the construction sector. While we do not recruit or employ construction workers in the Middle East, and rarely employ them elsewhere, we understand that these workers are perceived to be in our supply chain. Throughout 2015, we continued a multifaceted initiative to improve worker welfare and human rights, especially in the Middle East. Applying our industry leadership and strong health, safety, and environment (HSE) record, we are working with industry, governments, and nongovernmental organizations to improve the conditions of migrant construction workers around the world in the ways described below. Fostering industry collaboration: Engineering and construction firms, international human rights organizations, and governments have limited opportunities to engage and collaborate with one other. But we believe that collaboration is an effective way to bring change on these human rights issues. We organized and cohosted two engineering and construction industry roundtables in London with the Institute for Human Rights and Business. These roundtables focused on worker welfare and human right and were supported by the UK Home Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the Department for Business, Innovation, and Skills. The roundtables are part of a broader effort we are CH2M’s Tawny Chritton facilitating an industry leading to form an industry organization dedicated to roundtable in London in April 2016 these issues. The events have been attended by more than 15 leading international engineering and construction groups, a number of leading human rights and labor rights organizations, and high-level government officials. Additional roundtables are planned for 2016. The 2016 roundtables examine the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act and discuss steps to promote worker welfare and prevent the exploitation of construction workforces globally. In addition to the London roundtables, our colleagues attended and spoke at various business and human rights conferences around the world to share and learn best practices. 2-1 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE Developing technology to improve working conditions: In September 2015, Tawny Chritton, one of our worker welfare professionals, traveled to Kathmandu, Nepal, to attend TechCamp Nepal, a workshop on technology and migrant workers organized by Humanity United, a private foundation established by Pierre and Pamela Omidyar. At this event, we pitched an idea featuring mobile technology to help engineering and construction firms better understand the conditions of migrant construction workers in the Middle East. Out of more than 20 ideas pitched at TechCamp Nepal, Humanity United selected this project as one of three to fund. The technology would allow construction workers to submit anonymous feedback in their native language about their living and working conditions through a mobile application, which would be provided to program managers. These data are immediately available to the firm overseeing worker welfare on the project via a customized dashboard. The company can use the information to notify contractors or the client of areas of concern, intervening where appropriate. For CH2M and peer companies, this new program management tool will help ensure that worker welfare standards, which are embedded in construction companies’ contracts and host country labor CH2M’s Tawny Chritton and team at technology conference in regulations, are met. Nepal. This technology, designed and piloted in collaboration with Caravan Studios and Humanity United, will be tested on select CH2M projects in Qatar in 2016; it will then be made available for use by other companies and partners. Beyond helping improve conditions for migrant construction workers, it will also allow for more effective program delivery from engineering and construction firms overseeing major infrastructure projects. Connecting workers with their families back home: In September 2015, Construction Week Qatar recognized our commitment to improving worker rights with a “Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative of the Year” award. This award demonstrates our firm’s commitment to corporate social responsibility and worker welfare in Qatar and other locations. We won the award with our partner, Qatar’s Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (ictQatar), in recognition for our leadership on ictQatar’s Better Connections Program. With Phase I launched in January 2015, the program provides Internet access and technology training to low-income migrant construction workers, so they may stay in touch with their families and loved ones back home. The Better Connections Program has set up and equipped 100 new ictQatar facilities at worker Team receiving Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative award accommodations, reaching thousands of 2-2 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE migrant workers across Qatar. Other Better Connections partners include the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (our 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar client), Qatar’s National Human Rights Committee, Qatar Foundation, and Microsoft Qatar. For more information on our global worker welfare activities, visit the Human Rights section of this report. 2.2 Health and Safety CH2M is deeply dedicated to health, safety, and the environment (HSE) because we recognize our people and environment to be both our responsibility and the structure of our firm. Our simple standard is that everyone comes home safely, every day, on every project. We look out for each other, capturing our people’s hearts and minds through an intensive, ongoing focus on safety, well-being, security, and environmental impacts, in the office, out in the field, and at home. Our formal HSE management system is integrated into our business and project delivery processes. Based on the American National Standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management System (ANSI Z10-2012), our HSE foundation is to promote the company’s health and safety culture. Our management systems map, illustrates additional safety management systems, and the status of conformance and compliance throughout regional operations. Our HSE policy is part of a management systems approach to implementing health and safety. Our executive leadership promotes a culture of health and safety throughout our firm and expects employees to take responsibility for their own behavior and the behaviors of every employee around them. Such diligence results in few HSE incidences and receipt of a number of awards for CH2M’s safety performance in 2015, listed in the Awards section. To help make our health and safety culture concrete for projects and employees, we use an educational and operational program known as “Target Zero.” Embedded in our training and in every project we take on, Target Zero’s name says it all: we strive for zero safety incidents, zero injuries, and zero adverse environmental impacts. By infusing our culture of awareness and incident prevention into all our projects, we help manage risks for our employees and our clients. We regularly promote our Target Zero culture through our HSE communications program, by producing and distributing communications that highlight our progress with key programs, such as office safety, ergonomics, and environmental compliance. All employees are empowered and expected to provide feedback on our health and safety program. Every June, we celebrate safety month. And each week in 2015, we published information and activities on specific topics, including wellness tips for diet, exercise, and mental health; hearing and noise awareness; emergency preparedness in the office; and travel safety, locally and abroad. We publish short summaries of incidents, including near misses, called “Lessons Learned,” so that our employees can apply information in a timely way to prevent similar occurrences. To reach a wide audience or target specific groups of employees, we use a combination of intranet stories, posters, videos, and e-mails. We maintain a library of communications on the HSE Web site to help employees stay informed and maintain a focus on safety. To herald our Target Zero achievements, we honor 2-3 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE exemplary HSE performance of individuals, groups, and projects, by presenting HSE awards and sharing these accomplishments throughout the company. In 2015, CH2M celebrated additional successes through our wellness challenges, using an online campaign called “ShapeUp.” Employees around the world participated in two challenges, Walk the Wonders, in the spring, and Face Off, in the fall. Over 2,000 employees on more than 400 teams, across 7 countries (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, UAE, Puerto Rico, Australia, and Qatar) logged over one billion steps, or almost 600,000 miles. Employees also lost over 600 pounds during the Face Off challenge. Additionally, in each of our more than 100 North American offices, a trained office safety coordinator conducts comprehensive monthly inspections to verify that regulatory compliance and minimum physical standards are met. Outside of North America, office safety coordinators are either office staff or health and safety team members. Verification of these measures is tracked with a comprehensive, master HSE-task tracking log. Office safety coordinators regularly conduct severe weather drills, verify that offices are prepared for emergency security situations, and make safety information and personal protective equipment available to employees and guests. In conjunction with geographic facilities managers, coordinators also help with office moves and reconfigurations, select subcontractors, request safety plans, and provide direction and oversight during such events. Our office emergency responders, which typically represent 10 percent of an office population, are trained in first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and automated external defibrillator use. They serve as both medical first responders and fire wardens. Another important aspect of our HSE efforts is ergonomics. To promote employee ergonomics awareness, communications are published throughout the year. Employees may request ergonomics support at any time through an online ergonomics evaluation form or by calling the ergonomics phone message system. Ergonomics requests are reviewed each day, with a goal of responding to employee requests within 48 hours. Employees receive assistance with adjustments to their work stations, obtain needed equipment, and receive information on alleviating any discomfort they may be having. They also complete periodic ergonomics evaluations. In 2015, we performed more than 4,000 ergonomics evaluations, addressing over 1,400 reported ergonomics concerns for discomfort. Our goals continue to be avoiding or eliminating discomfort related to employees’ work stations and enhancing employees’ health and safety, work productivity, and quality. 2.2.1 Injury Rates The 2015 employee recordable incident rate (recordable incidents per 200,000 hours worked) for CH2M’s global family of companies was 0.3, which is 63 percent lower than the U.S. industry average of 0.8 (based on 2014 data published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics for Engineering Services, North American Industry Classification System Code 541330). The 2015 employee lost-time (days away and restricted duty cases) incident rate (lost-time incidents per 200,000 hours 2-4 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE worked) for CH2M’s global family of companies was 0.13, which is 74 percent lower than the U.S. industry average of 0.5. No CH2M company had any occupational fatalities, whether of employees or subcontractors. CH2M applies U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordkeeping standards in calculating global incident rates. 2.3 Workforce Distribution The scope of this report includes the entire CH2M family of companies, as shown in the total employee distribution numbers. Our workforce numbers peaked in 2012 as a result of CH2M’s acquisition of Halcrow. In 2013, our staff numbers went down because of decreases in our temporary/flex staff and project demobilizations in various markets. In 2014, our employee population grew in the first half of the year; however, we implemented a restructuring program to achieve business objectives in the second half of the year. This program led to a decline of approximately 1,200 employees through a voluntary retirement program for eligible U.S. staff, staff reductions worldwide, and restructuring initiatives. In 2015, our employee population continued to decrease just over 3 percent overall. While some geographic regions (Europe) and business groups (Transportation and Water) experienced growth, this was offset by declines in other areas of our business that resulted from continued restructuring, market conditions, and strategic changes. In 2015, CH2M’s total employee population of 22,007 (excluding joint ventures and contractors) included approximately 2,800 direct-hire craft employees. Of these craft employees, approximately 12 percent are represented by unions. Most of the employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are found in CH2M’s joint-venture partnerships, which were created to manage specific 2-5 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE projects. Including our joint-venture population, we have 3,957 craft employees, about 37 percent of whom are represented by unions. 2.3.1 Workplace Culture Throughout our history, culture—our beliefs, actions, attitudes, and reputation—has helped shape CH2M. Back in 1978, our cofounder Jim Howland created the Little Yellow Book to capture the cultural beliefs on which the firm was built. Our culture is why we are as committed as ever to our guiding principles: safety and wellness, sustainability, inclusivity, integrity, and ethics. These are infused into our brand and our core values and behaviors. Culture is the backbone—and the connective tissue—supporting and reinforcing our goals, from our business to brand strategy. A strong company culture increases employee loyalty, fosters greater teamwork, boosts productivity, encourages creativity, and reinforces positive behavior. It helps CH2M attract and retain the best talent, leading to greater commitment, increased employee satisfaction, and better client relationships. Most important, it brings us together as one company. Our goal is to continue to make our culture strong for generations to come, honoring the company’s heritage while providing the flexibility needed for future growth and expansion. It is through our shared values, and how we live them through our everyday behavior, that we make our culture real. From the voices of teammates all across our company, we created the following cultural characteristics to help activate and cultivate our values in a way that feels right: • Respectful: We treat people the way they deserve to be treated and strive to always do the right thing. • Collaborative: Working together, we encourage diverse opinions, backgrounds, and ideas. • Entrepreneurial: We have confidence in our abilities to make the right decisions and have a strong sense of ownership. • Compassionate: We care deeply about the well-being of people, including teammates, clients, and the members of the communities where we work. • Positive: We genuinely enjoy our work, encouraging those around us to do the same, and make a point to smile every day. 2-6 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE 2.4 Workforce Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion At CH2M, we believe that our differences make us extraordinary, and we are deeply committed to continuously creating a culture of inclusion that inspires us to make meaningful contributions to our team and our clients as we lay the foundation for human progress together. Global diversity, equality, and inclusion are integral parts of our culture, supporting our business growth while allowing us to attract, develop, engage, and retain the best talent and be able to serve the needs of an increasingly global and diverse customer base. In 2015, we strengthened leadership diversity, with women and people of color constituting 31 and 14 percent of CH2M management respectively, versus industry averages (16 and 9 percent). We also increased the number of women on our Board of Directors to 31 percent and were recognized as a 2020 Women on Boards Winning 'W' Company for 2015. CH2M tracks gender and age for all its employees. In 2015, 41 percent of our workforce was made up of non-U.S. employees. For our U.S. employees (which compose 59 percent of our global workforce), we also track race for hiring and attrition. By understanding these metrics, we can actively put outreach strategies in place to more effectively attract, engage, and retain women, people of color, and individuals of many ages and life experiences. The following graphics compare the diversity of CH2M employees from 2012 through 2015, including analysis of employees across regions and by gender, age groups, and racial demographics in the United States. 2-7 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE 2-8 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE In addition, CH2M’s eight employee network groups foster employee engagement and help employees share information, ideas, experiences, and resources. These groups provide peer support, career development, and mentoring opportunities, in addition to raising awareness, through a variety of discussion groups and activities that are open to all: 2-9 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE • Harambee (“working together” in Swahili) – Black employee network • Enlace (“link” in Spanish) – Hispanic/Latino employee network • LIFE (Leadership Inspiring Full Equality) – Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and allies employee network • SHARE (Sharing Across Respective Ethnicities) – Employee network for employees of all ethnicities to collaborate and learn from one another • Women’s Network • A.C.E. (Assist.Connect.Educate.) – Employee network providing support for those with ”What is Your Superpower” activity at the 2015 JuMP disabilities and their caregivers conference in the United Kingdom • VetNet – Employee network for veterans • JuMP – Junior and mid-level professionals network Each of these groups has a senior executive sponsor to guide and reinforce the importance of these efforts and provide mentoring to staff who may not otherwise have access to senior leadership. CH2M has always focused on hiring the best and brightest; actively recruiting diverse talent is an instrumental part of that process. Our recruiters are accountable for sourcing and maintaining active pipelines of diverse candidates, with their performance evaluations tied to measurable goals. Recruitment managers also receive monthly diversity hiring reports so they can monitor the progress in meeting our recruitment goals, enabling them to consult with their teams and make adjustments as needed throughout the year. Diversity outreach is a key focus of CH2M. In 2015, we used over 20 national advertising sources that are affiliated with another 70+ channels specifically targeted toward underrepresented groups, including veterans and differently abled individuals. Each year, we carefully evaluate the overall effectiveness of these channels and adjust investments to maximize outreach results. We go significantly beyond government-mandated good-faith efforts to attract diverse candidates to the company. In addition, we remain actively involved with the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers, Women’s Transportation Seminar, Society of Women Engineers, and Conference for Minority Transportation Officials. Several of our diverse employee network groups have recruitment and retention subcommittees, indicating that there’s an increased focus on contributing to recruiting and hiring the best talent across all career levels. Our emphasis with these and other strategic organizations is to build deeper and more meaningful partnerships that can continually improve our ability to develop the most diverse workforce possible. CH2M has been recognized as a leading employer in diversity, equality, and inclusion, as evidenced by the honors listed in the Awards section. 2.4.1 Expanding the Work of CH2M’s Employee Network Groups In 2015, the CH2M employee network groups continued to position their work to ensure alignment with our strategy. Harambee, Enlace, and the Women’s Network held leadership meetings to focus on attracting, engaging, and retaining the most valuable talent, supporting the firm’s approach to client centricity along with our diversity, equality, and inclusion strategy. These meetings included network 2-10 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE group leaders and committee chairs, executive sponsors, members of the Corporate Leadership Council, and invited guests, including clients. “Aside from creating a healthy work environment where all employees feel safe and respected as individuals, these programs are also strategic business imperatives extremely important to the company’s business success,” said Faye Tate, Director for Global Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion. 2.5 Employee Turnover By closely measuring our employee turnover rates and analyzing exit survey results across the company, we work hard to understand the fluctuations of voluntary and involuntary turnover to better support our employees’ and company’s success. After a couple of challenging turnover years because of change and restructuring, CH2M’s overall employee turnover decreased to 22 percent in 2015, while voluntary turnover decreased to 12 percent, resulting in our lowest overall and voluntary turnover rates of the past 4 years. Factors such as acquisitions, changing workforce demographics, and changes to our target markets and geographies play a part in turnover fluctuations. 2-11 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE 2.5.1 Integrating New Staff To reduce employee turnover and support engagement and job satisfaction, CH2M is committed to providing stellar early experiences for new employees. We integrate new employees by preparing them to join the company, orienting them once they have started working, and integrating them into their teams and the firm. Preparing – As soon as candidates accept their offers of employment, a dedicated coordinator assists their transition into the company and makes sure everything is ready for them on their first day. This person then stays connected with them through the first month to help make sure they settle in well. Orienting – When joining a new company, there is a lot to learn. We believe it is vital that all employees receive proper orientation so that no matter their location or project, they feel connected to the entire company. We offer a variety of orientation options, depending on location. Employees have access to at least one orientation opportunity, including a self-exploratory new employee Web site, a self-guided orientation presentation, and in-person orientation sessions when possible. Integrating – To help supervisors welcome and integrate new employees, we equip them with essential tools, like checklists and templates. Supervisors prepare integration plans designed to set clear expectations; identify key people, training, resources, and tools to help new employees be successful; and provide a framework for early career development conversations. Results from our supervisor and new employee 2-week and 2-month surveys indicate a high degree of satisfaction with the program overall. The feedback helps us focus on opportunities where we can make our new employee experiences even better. We have been able to directly correlate new hire satisfaction in these surveys with longer-term employee engagement. Our efforts to provide a great new employee experience, from day one, translates into more satisfied employees in the long term and, thereby, more satisfied clients. 2.5.2 AlumniConnect Finding the right talent to work on our clients’ projects is essential for CH2M’s future. Knowing how difficult finding new talent can be, we are investing in keeping connected with the talent we already know. Our Alumni and Retiree Relations Program fosters this connectivity by engaging with alumni and retirees through our online talent community, the Alumni Connect Group. The Alumni Connect Group offers former and current professionals and retirees a social media experience where they can keep up to date on company and people news, view open job positions, and stay connected with former 2-12 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE colleagues, friends, and mentors. The Alumni Connect Group LinkedIn community has over 3,200 members. The alumni talent community is anticipated to become an increasingly more important and costeffective alternative to traditional, expensive sourcing options, like job boards. Research also shows that rehiring alumni improves efficiency and reduces costs, ultimately increasing productivity and profitability for the organization. Alumni hires are already familiar with the company’s culture and processes, so they are easily integrated back into the organization. They bring knowledge, skills, and abilities already tailored to CH2M’s and our clients’ needs. Former employees also bring valuable experience from their work outside of the firm. Many of our most successful employees have been rehired after leaving the firm for a period of time. 2.6 Training and Development CH2M’s Talent Management and Development team is devoted to building tomorrow’s talent today. We recognize that our employees are our most important assets and that each of us must grow and learn or we—as individuals and as a company—risk falling behind. Our mission is to engage, develop, and empower our employees to advance their careers through targeted development opportunities and innovative learning systems and solutions in support of achieving our business strategy. Career development and learning at CH2M is a shared responsibility between employees and their managers, but employees ultimately own their careers. We believe career development is essential for job satisfaction, as well as enhancing relationships and experiences with our clients, colleagues, and communities. We encourage employees to choose to learn every day. They are supported by a learning community composed of a vast network of colleagues. Employees can take many different paths to career development. At CH2M, we encourage employees to learn through experiences on the job, supplemented by mentoring, coaching, and formal learning. We also conduct succession planning and talent reviews to identify employees for potential critical leadership roles, building a talent pipeline for our future needs. We now extend talent reviews deeper into the business to get the right people in the right roles at the right time. We consider both performance and potential for advancement, taking a proactive approach to engaging and retaining our critical talent. 2.6.1 Training CH2M regularly expands its learning program to meet employees’ needs as they strengthen their skills and guide their careers. We give employees training aligned to the company’s values and customer focus. Employees have access to thousands of technical and professional e-learning courses, virtual classrooms, and traditional instructor-led opportunities, and we continue to build on this important educational platform. Our employees tell us that their richest and most rewarding learning experiences come from the challenging conditions they face on projects, as they stretch outside their comfort zones and are guided by colleagues who mentor and coach them over the courses of their careers. Governed by executive leadership, our “CH2M Schools” provide structured learning opportunities in four areas: client solutions and sales, project delivery, technology and innovation, and leadership and 2-13 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE management. The schools foster a company-wide culture of career growth for all employees and use a leader-as-teacher model in which employees serve as on-the-job faculty. The program’s formal structure dates back to our history of providing opportunities for employees seeking career development in their current disciplines or who would like to cross into new specialties. Employees at all levels of the organization move up, down, and across to gain experience and round out their capabilities. As we progress our programs, we continue to expand the balance of formal and informal learning to include experiential, on-the-job, social, and nontraditional forms of learning to engage our diverse and globally dispersed employees. 2.6.1.1 Leadership and Management Development The School of Leadership & Management focuses on preparing leaders at all levels to meet the specific challenges of their roles. These high-potential leaders are a particularly crucial piece of our leadership pipeline. Our Leadership Excellence through Accelerated Development (LEAD) program identifies and accelerates development of our high-potential leaders. It prepares them to avoid the pitfalls that lead to failure, take on senior leadership roles, and realize their promise as drivers of CH2M’s future success. The following are goals of the program: • Create a strong bench of well-prepared leaders. • Enhance organizational effectiveness through our leaders. • Encourage participants to experience personal leadership opportunities that are outside their comfort zones. • Expose participants to new experiences that help build their resumes and personal networks. • Develop, retain, and provide long-term career engagement of participants. The LEAD program provides curricula designed to accelerate development of leaders who have demonstrated skill, potential, and aspiration for roles requiring strategic, operational, and leadership capabilities in two distinct areas: • Emerging Leaders of Individual Contributors • High-Performing Leaders of Managers Each program takes place over 6 months and includes 3 phases, focusing on self-leadership, team leadership, and company leadership. In 2015, we also launched the Manager Essentials Program, which provides access to practical, online resources and engaging, facilitated workshops. Specifically designed for managers and project managers, this new program uses a unique, two-pronged strategy, including online, self-service resources and facilitated workshops, to deliver highly effective training: • Convenient and useful online resources are accessible whenever a manager needs them. These practical and engaging resources, identified and developed by subject matter experts, come in a variety of forms, including videos, articles, and job aids. • Interactive workshops are facilitated by knowledgeable instructors and designed to deliver meaningful learning experiences. These workshops use a combination of presentations, discussions, and exercises to help managers expand their knowledge base and build indispensable skills. We use the two different approaches to encourage manager development in eight key areas: • Coaching our people • Delegating and planning work • Developing our people • Engaging and retaining our people 2-14 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE • Hiring • Knowing our business • Leading our teams • Managing performance 2.6.1.2 e-Learning As an example of our growing e-learning portal, the “Automation Design Library” hosts more than 6,000 separate videos. This system provides just-in-time learning and support for engineers who use a wide variety of complex, automated engineering design tools. 2.6.1.3 Environmental and Health & Safety Training Our environmental training program includes courses related to field and construction services, as well as stormwater, chemicals, waste, air, wetlands, and natural and cultural resource management. Field project managers are required to take the CH2M environmental program awareness course, at a minimum. Our HSE training courses range from construction site safety to ergonomics and behavior-based loss prevention. Some courses are mandated by regulation, while others exceed compliance, resulting in increased benefits for our employees. We completed 149,386 hours of HSE training in 2015. In 2015, CH2M employees received an average of 16.3 hours of training each, representing 359,626 hours logged through our CH2M Schools curriculum and business group courses. This represents a 39 percent increase over 2014 (259,065 total training hours). CH2M’s executive team actively supported this level of investment, despite overall pressure on the company’s financial performance, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to promoting learning and development. 2-15 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE 2.6.1.4 Sustainability Training CH2M’s focused employee engagement program for sustainability includes training for staff. Training is offered through the HSE curriculum for both environmental management system (EMS) ISO 14001 and environmental stewardship, at work and at home. EMS training is required for staff members with implementation responsibilities; it is available to all employees who are interested. Among our employees, as in the world at large, people have different definitions of “sustainability.” To create a common understanding of how sustainability applies to our projects and the challenges our clients face in this space, we sponsor communities of practice within and across multiple disciplines. These communities sponsor learning opportunities, where subject matter experts inside and outside the company are invited to share innovations and new ideas with interested staff. This gives people the opportunity to expand learning and personal networks and become engaged in offering sustainable solutions to our clients. By creating a deeper understanding of sustainability, we aspire to help clients operate more efficiently and sustainably from an economics perspective, while improving environmental and social performance. As described in the Client Services Footprint section, CH2M is a charter member of the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI), and we have a growing roster (more than 75 in 2015) of employees credentialed as ISI Envision™ Sustainability Professionals (ENV SPs). These ENV SPs plan and evaluate the sustainability aspects of infrastructure projects using the rating system. All of this training and awareness then extends to colleagues and clients when our ENV SPs share information and perspectives about infrastructure sustainability. We have also invested in additional advanced training, and now have two Envision trainers approved by ISI and one ENV SP with training in ISI’s verification process. In 2015, our trainers completed interactive 8-hour classroom training for CH2M employees in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Tampa, Florida; Fayetteville, Arkansas; and Virginia Beach, Virginia. We also supported a classroom training offered for municipal officials in Simsbury, Connecticut. Our active Envision training program continues into 2016, with additional training for our staff and clients, as interest in Envision grows. 2-16 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE 2.6.2 Performance and Career Development Reviews CH2M has a goal for 100 percent participation in our annual performance management process, which culminates in a formal review discussion between supervisors and each of their employees. In 2015, 88 percent of employees completed performance evaluations with their supervisors. We continually strive to improve participation and the quality of the review conversations. In February 2016, CH2M launched MyJourney, our new talent management software that replaces the former performance evaluation, development plans, and skills inventory tools. The new tool helps employees, managers, and leaders establish performance expectations and develop goals that align to our company strategy, while supporting employees’ professional aspirations. MyJourney is used to complete annual goal setting and manage ongoing performance evaluations. It has the capability to provide real-time feedback to employees, managers, and peers. A key benefit of MyJourney is the ability to create a talent profile, giving employees an opportunity to showcase their experiences and skills throughout their CH2M career. 2-17 2 FOSTERING EMPLOYEE EXCELLENCE 2-18 Our Planet 3.1 Environmental Compliance As an industry-leading environmental company, CH2M places a high value on protecting the environment. As our HSE policy states, “It is our vision to create a culture that empowers employees to drive this value into all global operations and achieve excellence in HSE performance.” This is accomplished through our Target Zero culture, which includes a target of zero adverse environmental impacts from CH2M operations. Through our project delivery system and HSE program, we implement systematic environmental risk management practices in a manner that adds value to our clients, firm, staff, and projects, with the ultimate goal of achieving Target Zero. CH2M’s environmental performance has been exceptional, especially considering the variety and complexity of the projects we deliver. In 2015, CH2M had zero environmental fines or penalties. Our commitment to Target Zero and full implementation of our environmental program starts with leadership. Designated senior leaders from every business unit are trained on our environmental program and cascade Target Zero expectations throughout their organizations. With help from a network of environmental professionals around the globe, our environmental program provides tools, training, and resources to help projects and operations understand and comply with applicable environmental requirements wherever we work. Our environmental performance is the result of our educated, equipped, and empowered employees, who care about achieving Target Zero and protecting the environment. 3.1.1 Environmental Spills CH2M uses a proprietary online tool, called the Hours and Incident Tracking System (HITS), to internally report, track, and trend spills and near-misses. Subcontractor spills are also included. Most of the releases documented in HITS are small in volume and occur on impervious surfaces and within containment systems. Root causes and corrective actions are noted in HITS, and discussed and implemented by the project teams. For significant spills, our environmental managers investigate the cause and issue formal lessons-learned statements to educate staff and prevent further incidents. Significant spills are defined as those that exceed regulatory reporting thresholds, as established by the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). On CH2M projects in 2015, we had two significant spills: 100 gallons (0.38 cubic meter) of 12 percent sodium hypochlorite solution, and 210 gallons (0.79 cubic meter) of 40 percent sodium permanganate solution. Although classified as “significant,” the spills had no critical impact to the environment. 3.2 Environmental Management CH2M’s environmental performance is managed, monitored, and improved through formal EMS programs, guided by ISO 14001:2004, in the following locations: North America (United States and Canada); the United Kingdom; Ireland; Romania; Italy; Hong Kong; Australia; Argentina (Buenos Aires, Campana, Bahía Blanca); Mexico; the Middle East (Dubai, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, and Doha), and India (Noida, Mumbai, and Hyderabad). The management systems map illustrates our EMS programs and the status of conformance and compliance throughout regional operations. The majority of CH2M employees are included within the scope of the EMS programs in these geographies. Throughout the world, environmental regulatory compliance is addressed by our firmwide HSE team. The overall performance and scope of each formal EMS program are described in this section. Most of CH2M’s environmental aspects and impacts are managed through these programs in accordance with 3-1 3 OUR PLANET local regulations and opportunities, such as recycling and water conservation. Select programs, like the carbon emissions inventory, are managed at a corporate level. Although each region sets its own reduction goals and the means to accomplish them, we have one overall carbon reduction target for CH2M’s global operations. 3.2.1 North America EMS Since 2005, the North American EMS team has worked toward continuous improvement throughout our United States and Canadian operations. The North American EMS includes annual goals for performance, as well as procedures for day-to-day 2016 EMS Goals: North America Offices operations, such as decreasing the amount of Internal CH2M Footprint materials we use, increasing recycled content and improving other sustainability metrics on items we • Eliminate single-use disposable plastic at purchase, and seeking other ways to reduce our our North America area offices by the end environmental footprint.

We achieved this goal, with electricity at our headquarters at 8,513 MWh by year-end. We are striving for an additional reduction of 850 MWh at our headquarters by 2017. • In our Operations Management sustainability program, we set out to support client projects in reducing fuel and energy consumption. Our 2015 goals included reducing fuel consumption by 20,000 gallons (76 cubic meters) and energy consumption by 3 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) on behalf of our clients. We surpassed these goals, achieving a fuel reduction of 27,000 gallons and electricity reductions exceeding 20 million kWh. As described in the Client Services Footprint section, our Operations Management sustainability program continues to achieve measurable outcomes for our clients. Our 2016 goals illustrate how we plan to manage our environmental program going forward for both our internal footprint and externally on our projects and services. In addition to our paper and energy 3-2 3 OUR PLANET reduction targets, we have set an aggressive goal of removing all single-use disposable plastic from our North America area offices by 2018. Single-use plastic is a widespread consumer good, and we believe we can enhance our office environment and communities where we live and work by moving away from products that provide short-lived purposes with long-lasting impacts. This goal is aggressive and will require transformative action – a willingness to embark on concrete steps alongside our staff and suppliers. The goal for carbon emissions reduction is set at the corporate level. Externally, our Operations Management sustainability program continues to support client projects in reducing fuel and energy consumption. Our 2016 goals include reducing fuel consumption by 20,000 gallons (76 cubic meters) and energy consumption by 5 million kWh on behalf of our clients. 3.2.2 Europe EMS In 2013, we launched and rolled out our environmental objectives across Europe. We set 2016 EMS Goals: Europe Offices goals to either decrease our impacts or improve our understanding of the environmental impacts we • Continue reducing carbon emissions for have over a 3-year period, from 2013 to 2015.

We also intend to review lease and rental vehicle selection for relevant environmental factors, including emissions and fuel efficiency. In 2015, CH2M’s business in the UK was affected by the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) Regulations 2014. The UK government established ESOS to implement Article 8 (4-6) of the European Union (EU) Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU). ESOS applies to large businesses, which are required to undertake ESOS assessments every 4 years. An ESOS assessment is an audit of the energy used by a qualifying business’ buildings, industrial processes, and transportation in order to identify cost-effective savings measures. ESOS is administered by the UK Environment Agency. CH2M’s UK operations qualified as a large undertaking on the qualification date, which was December 31, 2014. To satisfy the ESOS requirements, we have conducted 14 surveys of our UK offices, involving an approved ESOS lead assessor. CH2M has complied with the ESOS requirements for the first compliance period from July 17, 2014, to December 5, 2015. Our ESOS assessment will now be used as part of the UK sustainability program. Although participants are not required to implement the identified energy-saving opportunities, CH2M will track energy-saving 3-3 3 OUR PLANET opportunities as part of our continual improvement and active management of energy use across our UK business. Throughout 2015, we continued to work on these environmental goals, which we rolled out in 2013: • Reduce carbon emissions for our office-based activities by 5 percent by the end of 2015 • Decrease paper consumption to 3,500 sheets per employee per year • Reduce water use to less than 1,585 gallons (6 cubic meters) per employee per year (following industry and government good practice benchmarks as a reference) • Allow local waste reduction and recycling targets to be set and include waste reduction initiatives in a suitable tracker Water consumption in Europe has been reduced over the last 4 years, and we met our goal of reducing 1,588 gallons (6.01 cubic meters) in 2015. We also achieved our paper consumption goal: we decreased to 3,241 sheets per employee in 2015. Our EMS programs keep our employees involved in environmental management and help them understand how environment relates to home and work, in the office and on projects. Regular external audits from our certifying bodies confirm certification. Additionally, we are audited by other external parties, such as Achilles Verify, who provide confirmation of our system’s performance on behalf of our utility sector customers. In our most recent audit performance from Achilles Verify, we achieved a score of 100 percent. We continue to measure and report on environmental and sustainability measures, including reporting to our clients to help them better understand their own supply chain sustainability. In 2015, we supported the Environment Agency in its supply chain sustainability analysis program, using Trucost's data collection portal. CH2M has also participated in the Corporate Assessment of Environmental, Social and Economic Responsibility (CAESER), a system used by the UK government. CH2M was required to use the CAESER online self-assessment, designed to measure sustainability performance, by providing details of our approaches to the main themes of environmental, socioeconomic, equality, and diversity. On completion of the self-assessment, ratings were awarded to highlight areas of risk and opportunity. CH2M will continue to report when required, using the CAESER tool; the results will feed into our program. 3.2.3 Asia-Pacific EMS Our Asia-Pacific region has ISO 14001-certified programs in Australia and Hong Kong, as shown on the management systems map. Our Hong Kong business operations have held ISO 14001 certification since 2007 for our consulting, engineering design, planning, and project management services. Projects continued to be delivered in accordance with ISO 14001, as verified by internal audits and the annual external third-party surveillance audit. The Hong Kong EMS sets goals to reduce the carbon footprints from both office and project operations. Environmentally friendly measures have been implemented, including use of motion-sensor-controlled lighting after office hours to reduce energy wastage, and an electronic documentation system to reduce paper use, reuse paper, and recycle paper. Electronic waste is disposed of through licensed contractors. The office also uses sustainable products: paper certified by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification for printing, and FSC-certified paper for business card printing. All Hong Kong projects use an environmental checklist at project kickoff to consider environmental aspects. 3-4 3 OUR PLANET 3.2.4 Middle East, North Africa, and India (MENAI) EMS CH2M has EMS programs in four of our Middle Eastern and three Indian offices. As a result of an external assessment of our EMS programs on UAE and Qatar projects and in regional offices in late 2014, the Middle East EMS program was recommended for certification for ISO 9001 (Quality), OHSAS 18001 (Health & Safety), and ISO 14001 (Environment). A third-party surveillance audit, conducted in November 2015, resulted in continuation of the certification. This proves to our clients and other parties that our management systems meet rigorous standards. In 2015, we set EMS goals at the beginning of the year to improve performance and implement best practices across Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah in the UAE; Doha in Qatar; and the India offices. By the end of 2015, we achieved most of the goals by reducing paper consumption by 26 percent, from 2016 EMS Goals: MENAI Offices 30 kilograms (66 pounds) per person to 22.2 kilograms • Use less than 22.3 kilograms (49 pounds) (49 pounds) per person; increasing paper recycling of paper per employee from 52.3 to 62 percent (an increase of 10 percent); and reducing electricity consumption from 2,671 to • Purchase 20 percent of all paper with 2,065 kWh per person (23 percent reduction). recycled content • Increase volume of paper recycled by 5 On average, 3.8 percent of our paper had recycled percent as compared to 2015 levels content for 2015. This decrease of 25 percent over 2014 is because the local market lacks good-quality • Achieve electricity consumption at a level paper made from recycled content. However, the of less than 2,065 kWh per employee majority of the virgin paper purchased across the 3-5 3 OUR PLANET Middle East is FSC certified. The Middle East offices also recycled 17,793 kilograms (39,227 pounds) of paper and 799 printer cartridges, in addition to recycling cardboard, plastic, metal, and glass. We established new goals for 2016 to improve our environmental performance and seek continuous improvement. We are seeking to stabilize paper consumption, increase purchase of paper with recycled content, increase our paper recycling, and decrease electricity consumption at our offices in UAE, Oman, Qatar, and India. 3.2.5 Australia EMS Australia holds external ISO 14001 certifications for CH2M Australia (since 2007), CH2M HILL Australia Constructors Pty, Ltd. (since 2010), and Halcrow Pacific (in 2015). The system addresses the environmental management requirements for offices and projects, with implementation of environmental requirements achieved through the project delivery system. The Australian EMS implements policies to manage business efforts to reduce and recycle paper; manage electronic waste; and reduce energy use and carbon emissions, including both internal and project business travel. Through 2015, the triennial recertification audits reconfirmed compliance. The Australia EMS office program continued to recycle batteries, mobile phones, and fluorescent light tubes; minimize energy consumption; and make responsible paper purchases. Similar initiatives are in place on established project sites. Project HSE plans address environmental aspects and impacts relevant to the work. 3.2.6 Latin America EMS Our Latin America region began work on its EMS in 2012 and successfully launched the program in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2013. In the same year, the office received an external ISO 14001:2004 certification, confirming the success of its waste recycling program, which includes electronic devices, plastic, paper, glass, and printer toners. Through 2014, external surveillance audits reconfirmed compliance. In 2014, the Latin America EMS continued an aggressive rollout in the rest of the region, achieving external ISO 14001:2004 certification in Campana, Argentina; Bahía Blanca, Argentina; and Mexico City, Mexico. At the end of 2014, Buenos Aires achieved the safety certification for OHSAS 18001. During 2015, our Campana, Bahía Blanca, and Mexico City offices became compliant with regional certification. In 2015, the Latin America EMS focused on office activities and environmentally responsible delivery of projects, such as: • We included environmental aspects of design in our training plans as a step forward in the scope of our EMS. In our first stage of implementation, we focused only on office activities; we have included project delivery in the second phase, starting in Argentina and Mexico. • In 2015, the Mexico City area office green team launched a campaign to eliminate plastic water bottles. Water purifying systems were installed to reduce the use of single-use plastic bottled water and 5-gallon water cooler dispensers, which also provided economic savings compared to traditional alternatives. Disposable plastic cups were replaced with glass and ceramic cups in the office break and meeting rooms. Using the slogan “small steps that change the world,” staff members were engaged through an educational campaign and awarded reusable biodegradable water bottles. Since the implementation of this program, the Mexico City area office has avoided the purchase and ultimate disposal of over 6,000 plastic water cooler dispensers and 4,800 plastic single-use bottles. Education and outreach continues to reinforce the local commitment to the success of this program. 3-6 3 OUR PLANET • We supported the work of the Discar Foundation in Argentina, which provides programs to help the disabled collect toners and printer cartridges for recycling (sponsored by MT Corporate recycling company). • We featured articles about sustainability and the environment in regular newsletters and posters to raise awareness. • We shared our EMS evaluation process with an increasing number of clients from different markets, as they include EMS requirements as an important part of their evaluations. Our Sao Paulo, Brazil, office is compliant with ISO 9001, and we are working toward launching an EMS during the first quarter of 2016. 3.3 Water Use Our company history is built around clean water. The business started with clean water projects and continues to bring clean water to many communities across the globe. Given this history, we commit to conserving water in both spheres of our company’s activities: the facilities that we manage ourselves for our own business needs and the water treatment or supply facilities that we operate on behalf of our clients. Consistent with the firm’s commitment to conserve natural resources and water, as stated in the CH2M Sustainability Policy, we continue to track and report on water consumption for facilities that CH2M owns or operates on behalf of its clients. As a service provider, CH2M’s direct water use consists of the water consumed in our corporate headquarters and the area offices from which we operate worldwide. Our ability to monitor and report our water use depends on office location. In most of our leased space, for example, we do not directly pay water bills or manage the facilities, so it is difficult to implement conservation technologies or quantify the results of water conservation efforts. We do, however, directly measure water use when we can, such as at our corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado, where we operate our facilities as part of the leasing terms. CH2M views conservation as an ongoing process. We will continue to incorporate advancements in water-efficient technology in decision making for our direct operations. We have long encouraged practices that use water wisely, which aligns with company values. As part of our environmental policies, we purchase waterand energy-saving appliances for our kitchen areas. We have also eliminated bottled water in vending machines at our corporate headquarters. We seek to avoid the additional environmental footprint needed to package and transport water. Instead we use the safe, healthy, municipal water systems, which we design and construct every day, and that do not require the use of additional resources. 3.3.1 Corporate Headquarters CH2M uses both potable and reclaimed, non-potable water to support the water needs of our corporate headquarters. Potable water is used to meet human and building cooling needs, while non-potable water is used for irrigation and landscaping. Water use at the corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado, has been documented since 2008. In the spring of 2013, all urinals in the men’s restrooms across campus were replaced from conventional 1-gallon-per-flush systems to pint-flush urinals (0.125 gallon per flush). This change helped to 3-7 3 OUR PLANET significantly reduce potable water consumption on campus, dropping the potable water use on campus from 6,247,000 gallons (23,647 cubic meters) in 2013 and down to 5,699,000 (21,573 cubic meters) in 2014. Total potable water consumption on campus decreased again in 2015 by 320,000 gallons (1,211 cubic meters) from 2014 to a total of 5,379,000 gallons (20,362 cubic meters). In an arid climate like Denver, Colorado, implementing creative water-saving irrigation solutions is imperative. Reusing reclaimed water for irrigation reduces demand on surface water and groundwater supplies. In 2015, non-potable water consumption remained relatively steady with 2014 values, recording a slight increase of 103,000 gallons (390 cubic meters), which corresponds to a 2.5 percent increase. The past few years have seen a decrease in the campus population, with a corresponding decrease in water use. Implementation of the pint-flush urinals also resulted in per capita water decreases. In 2015, we appear to have crossed a threshold with per capita savings. The per capita water use in 2015 was 4,246 gallons (16.1 cubic meters), which is the highest per capita value since we began tracking the data in 2008. Population at our corporate headquarters has decreased compared to previous years, yet the campus cooling water use has remained relatively consistent. This has resulted in the total water use on campus being divided by a fewer number of people, leading to higher per capita values. 3-8 3 OUR PLANET 3.3.2 Water Use in Europe In Europe, our objective is to reduce water consumption, following good practice guidance, and monitor both actual absolute reductions and the ratio of water per employee. Our overall goal was to reduce water consumption per employee to less than 6.4 cubic meters (1,690 gallons) by the end of 2015. In the United Kingdom, we recorded water consumption data at 12 offices. We have continued to review water consumption at nine offices in mainland Europe. Actual data were recorded at four of these offices and estimated at the remaining five. We do not use large volumes of water compared to other business sectors. We have reduced our consumption per employee, from 8.2 cubic meters (2,166 gallons) in 2012 to 7.3 cubic meters (1,928 gallons) in 2013, a reduction of 10 percent. This figure reduced to 6.9 cubic meters (1,823 gallons) in 2014 and has further reduced to 6.0 cubic meters (1,588 gallons) in 2015. This means that our 2015 consumption was 0.4 cubic meter (105 gallons) below good practice benchmarks. We will endeavor to maintain this performance in 2016. 3.3.3 Water Conservation Strategies for Clients Beyond our office facilities, CH2M’s culture of sustainability reflects our approaches to delivering consulting, program management, design, construction, and operations solutions for our clients. Our water experts work with clients to develop proactive strategies for sustainable water management, including water supply, stormwater management, and sanitation. In partnership with our clients, we help optimize efficiencies in their processes to reduce material consumption and generate positive financial metrics, as well as social benefits. CH2M provides full-service operations, maintenance, and management to municipal and industrial sites, treating approximately 6.4 million cubic meters (1.7 billion gallons) of water and wastewater every day through our Operations Management group. Recognizing the importance of developing best management practices for sustainable operations, CH2M integrates sustainability into our operations and maintenance processes to mitigate the environmental impacts of our services, enhance and protect ecosystems, and actively engage in the communities that we serve. Our sustainability practices were formalized in 2010, with a sustainability pilot program focused on our North American Western Region facilities. Throughout these projects, we have varying levels of control of the operations, from simply “turning the dials” to implementing facility improvements and upgrades. Our program is focused on engaging passionate CH2M employee champions at each facility, working 3-9 3 OUR PLANET with clients to find ways to improve operations in whatever area is most appropriate for that site. The National Association of Water Companies recognized our program with a first place Innovation Award in 2011. Building off the initial successes of this program, we expanded the sustainability program across our Operations Management North American portfolio. We continued to track wastewater treatment performance across the operations management portfolio of projects. A comprehensive look at the overall quantity and quality of wastewater treated in 2015 at the 85 client water resource recovery facilities managed throughout North America shows that we treated 337 million cubic meters (89.1 billion gallons) of wastewater for the entire year. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for site‐specific treatment vary across our portfolio of facilities. Standard NPDES permits require that 85 percent of all biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), or organic matter, is removed in the treatment process to prevent oxygen depletion in the streams. The average BOD process removal for our client facilities in 2015 was 98 percent, benchmarking our treatment averages at 13 percent above the NPDES national average. Standard NPDES permits also mandate an 85 percent removal rate of all total suspended solids (TSS), or organic or inorganic solid material, during the treatment process to mitigate adverse impacts to aquatic life in receiving streams. The average TSS process removal for our client facilities in 2015 was 97 percent, putting our treatment averages at 12 percent above the NPDES national averages. Additionally, 83 million cubic meters (22 billion gallons) of this effluent was beneficially reused, representing 25 percent of the total wastewater treated in 2015. Day‐to‐day treatment plant operation is conducted in collaboration with our clients, and we respond to their management and budget directives. In this shared operational control environment, we have rich opportunities to bring local innovations to a broader group of facilities across the United States, where these innovations fit with our clients and their communities. 3-10 3 OUR PLANET 3.4 Community Water Preservation and Engagement We engage clients and communities in providing clean water and sanitation services, and improving water operations. We donate time, expertise, and funds to organizations and efforts that work to address world water issues. We also provide industry leadership toward collaboration and innovation for sustainability of people, systems, and the planet. In fact, in March 2016, Singapore’s national water agency, PUB, selected CH2M as one of three recipients for its Watermark Award for our legacy of advocating water sustainability through community outreach activities and partnership on numerous milestone projects. These projects lead the way in the area of water stewardship, encourage the community to take ownership of Singapore’s water resources, and contribute toward its water sustainability. 3.4.1 Helping Clients Help Communities One of the most important ways that CH2M changes the water landscape is by addressing global water challenges and increasing sustainability through our project work. We help our clients make the best choices for their communities and ecosystems, and the environment overall. Our project work helps water systems operate more efficiently and cost effectively, emphasizing potential water reuse along with innovative energy options. We are an advocate of the one water concept—recognizing that water from all sources should be managed cooperatively to meet social, economic, and environmental needs regardless of its origin. In many parts of the world, and in the United States, there is either too much or too little water. To that end, CH2M is working with clients to address all water challenges. 3.4.2 Engaging Global Communities CH2M’s water professionals continuously look to protect and enhance resources for future generations. We do this professionally, by offering financial support and expertise to worthy organizations, and personally as our employees donate their own time and money to support access to clean, safe water supplies. Toward these goals, we invest professional expertise, volunteer time, and financial resources in organizations and events, such as Water For People, UN World Water Day, World Water Monitoring Challenge™, World Water Week, Engineers Without Borders USA, and WaterAid. Using frameworks (such as the UN Global Compact’s CEO Water Mandate), our client projects, and the participation of our employees in civil society organizations, CH2M contributes to collective efforts aimed at positively affecting global water challenges through policy. 3.4.3 World Water Week and Stockholm Industry Water Award In August 2015, CH2M was the first engineering company to accept the 2015 Stockholm Industry Water Award (SIWA), for our more than 50 years of leadership in developing state-of-the-art technologies for potable water reuse. Receiving the SIWA, a prestigious and internationally acclaimed award, provided a special opportunity for us to share our story and the incredible work we have been doing with our clients since the 1970s to advance methodologies to clean and reuse water, on a global stage. The CH2M team accepting the 2015 Stockholm Industry Water Award in Sweden. 3-11 3 OUR PLANET The Stockholm International Water Institute presented the Stockholm Water Prize, the Stockholm Junior Water Prize, and the Stockholm Industry Water Award during World Water Week at a royal banquet in the Stockholm City Hall in the presence H.M. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. CH2M was recognized for inventing, implementing, and refining methods for cleaning used water to bring it back to drinking water quality. But, since this water is only valuable if people actually use it, we also put significant and successful effort into building public understanding and acceptance. We pioneered application of social science research to better understand the underlying reasons why people reject the notion of reuse and what might be done to change that mindset. This research, combined with demonstrations, education, and transparency, has dispelled myths around the use of treated wastewater and paved the way for a surge in interest in and acceptance of potable reuse. 3.4.4 Providing Industry Leadership By disseminating important information for global collaboration and participating in professional and civic organizations, CH2M actively seeks to advance existing knowledge, stimulate ideas, and support a framework for sustainable water management. Our employees participate in hundreds of different professional, civic, and social organizations that address water issues globally and locally; a few examples are provided in the remainder of this section. We serve in industry leadership positions that encourage developing and using innovations in water technologies, raise awareness of water challenges, guide policy development, and positively affect change. 3.4.4.1 Value of Water Coalition As one of the founders of the Value of Water Coalition, CH2M has been an active partner in educating the public about the importance of water as an essential and invaluable shared resource, and building the case for investment in water infrastructure and water resources. During 2015, the coalition continued to grow, as many of CH2M’s clients joined the organization from the public and private sector. The primary goal of the coalition is to educate the public and elevate the level of discourse around water quality, availability, reliability, and pricing. The coalition also seeks to convene public, private, and nonprofit leaders to accelerate the pace of thought leadership on water issues, as well as to cultivate new partnerships, collaborations, and champions for the value of water. The Value of Water Coalition aggregates news and publishes blogs on its Web site, sharing content through various social media outlets: Twitter (@TheValueofWater), YouTube (The Value of Water Coalition), Google+ (The Value of Water Coalition), and SlideShare (Value of Water). Senior CH2M leaders continue to serve on the coalition and its parent organization board, the U.S. Water Alliance. 3.4.4.2 Global and Local Water Tools Developed in conjunction with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the Global Water Tool (GWT), which launched in 2007 and was updated in March 2015, assists companies in mapping their water use and assessing risks relative to their global operations and supply chains. The GWT has become the internationally accepted tool for companies to account for water use within their operations, calculate water metrics, and identify areas of high water risk through external mapping. This tool has been used by more than 300 companies worldwide to report their water use. A second tool, the Local Water Tool, was developed in conjunction with the Global Environmental Management Institute and released in 2012. It provides guidance on local, site-specific water risks, impacts, and opportunities. CH2M provided supporting nomenclature, data continuity, and software codes to ensure compatibility between the Global and Local Water Tools and the user’s ability to transfer data between the tools. The free tools continue to be enhanced with new, customized versions, including those for the oil and gas industry and power utilities. Together with the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association and the WBCSD, CH2M is developing the updated sectorial customization for the oil and gas industry. In 2013, we developed a new version of the tool for the cement sector. This tool 3-12 3 OUR PLANET allows cement companies to assess the risk of operating in water-stressed regions and helps them manage water use more efficiently and sustainably by producing maps and charts that identify water scarcity and biodiversity hotspots. The Global and Local Water Tools facilitate collaboration across sectors, and among stakeholders in a particular watershed. Such collaborations are vital to helping businesses adapt to the changing climate and use resources in the most effective and sustainable ways. 3.4.4.3 Access Water Blog CH2M’s Access Water is an ongoing program, launched in late 2009, designed to “provide innovation and insight on all things water all year long.” Access Water is a place to share best practices and exchange ideas within the water industry. CH2M’s water experts, our clients, and members of the public process thoughts, share tools and innovations, and highlight banner projects. Exchanges occur through blogs, videos, a quarterly client newsletter, reader commentary, and social media channels, including our Facebook™ page, Twitter™ account (@CH2M), and LinkedIn™ page. Access Water has successfully increased awareness and generated productive dialogue on a variety of water issues, helped staff with career growth and development opportunities, and created business opportunities for CH2M through our client readership and industry conference promotion. Access Water has been recognized by the American Academy of Environmental Engineers for its innovation, effectiveness, and creativity in conveying important environmental messages. It has also been recognized for providing future value to the water engineering profession. 3.4.5 Individuals Making Differences Our staff includes innovative, driven people who really care about making a difference. Whether supporting the strategic pillars of STEM education, environmental stewardship, or personal community interests, CH2M employees make a difference, not only for the projects they contribute to daily while in the office, but also for organizations where they donate their time, talent, and resources. 2015 was a big year for our water business, as we celebrated several industry recognitions for our leadership in addressing the critical and intertwined challenges that face everyone who influences or is influenced by the water cycle. Our Chairman and CEO Jacque Hinman was named to Global Water Intelligence’s Top 20 Women in Water list. And Dr. Glen Daigger, former chief technology officer, was named Water and Wastewater International’s Most Influential Person in Water. The following highlights showcase a few noteworthy employees who are also exhibiting leadership in the water industry. • Jim Lozier, our global technology leader for desalination, was named the 2016 Water Quality Person of the Year by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and American Membrane Technology Association. Jim is an internationally recognized authority on membrane technologies for potable water treatment, desalination, and water reuse. He is a member of the American Desalting Association, American Society of Civil Engineers, AWWA, and the Arizona Water Environment Association. • Dr. Russell Ford, our global service leader for drinking water infrastructure, is on the WateReuse Research Foundation’s (WRRF’s) Board of Directors, working to advance the science of water reuse, recycling, reclamation, and desalination. Dr. Ford also serves as the AWWA representative to the Standards Council and will serve his second term on the Water Science and Research Division. 3-13 3 OUR PLANET • Larry Schimmoller, global technology leader for water reuse, is contributing significantly to the water reuse industry. One of his blog posts on using a triple-bottom-line analysis to avoid the costly overtreatment of reclaimed water reflects his work to help the WRRF. He served as principal investigator for the WRRF project, “The Cost of Over-treating Reclaimed Water.” Larry is a member of the WRRF’s Research Advisory Committee and the WateReuse Association’s Potable Reuse Committee. • Leofwin Clark, vice president and sales director, serves as the president of the Water Design-Build Council (WDBC) and formerly served as the organization’s first vice president and treasurer. He shares best practices in design-build to educate owners and promote collaborative delivery in the water and wastewater industry. CH2M is a charter member of the WDBC, a not-for-profit association established in 2006 to educate best practices in design-build and construction management-at-risk procurement delivery. • Duyen Tran, director of sustainable operations, won the prestigious National Association of Water Companies 2014 Living Water Award, recognizing exemplary private water industry professionals. Duyen, who calls herself “green before green was cool,” puts it this way: “I’m passionate about water and wastewater. I didn’t recognize the importance of clean water until I actually worked in the wastewater field and understood how and what we do helps prevent pollutants from entering our drinking water. So I made it my passion not only to make a difference in my career, but also to help young professionals who want to make wastewater their career choice.” Duyen has been an active member of the Water Environment Federation (WEF) since 1990. She’s served in several leadership positions at the WEF, including as WEF House of Delegates Speaker and a member of the WEF Board of Trustees. She is a past speaker of WEF’s House of Delegates. She’s also served as president of the Arkansas Water Environment Association (AWEA) and received AWEA’s Arthur Sidney Bedell Award in 2014. She was named wastewater manager of the year by both AWEA and the Northwest District of the Arkansas Water Works & Water Environment Association. • Quirien Muylwyk, business development and technology manager for our Canada region, was named the 2015 recipient of the AWWA Golden Spigot Award for her help developing and distributing technical and educational resources that inform the water community on the latest issues and best practices in the water profession. Quirien has been an active leader in AWWA for years, serving as past chair of the AWWA Distribution System Water Quality Committee and current chair of the Water Quality and Technology Division. Additionally, she is a member of AWWA’s Technical and Education Council and chair of the Conference Planning Committee. • Dr. Glen Daigger, retired senior vice president and chief water technology officer, is a recognized leader in the global water industry. He was named Water and Wastewater International’s 2015 Most Influential Person in Water and most recently selected as the top leader in 2016 Water and Wastewater International’s Top 25 Leaders. Glen served as the International Water Association President, completing his second term in 2014. Now Professor of Engineering Practice in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Michigan’s College of Engineering, Glen is teaching courses 3-14 3 OUR PLANET and helping the university advance the practice of water. Although retired from CH2M, he continues to serve as a special advisor on water projects. 3.5 Paper Consumption As a service-based business that depends on paper for countless communications, business proposals, and client deliverables, paper represents a significant portion of CH2M’s materials consumption. Paper consumption includes primarily white paper for use in copiers and printers. We are committed to using technology to reduce paper use, which represents much of the solid waste and material consumption in our offices. Around the world, we are working toward implementing measures for our offices to consume less paper (for example, double-sided printing wherever feasible and on-demand pin printing in North America, United Kingdom, Qatar, and the UAE). In the Middle East offices, paper consumption was reduced to 22.2 kilograms per person (49 pounds), and in North America, paper was reduced by 92 tonnes (101 tons). 3.5.1 North America Paper Consumption The North America EMS has been tracking paper consumption since 2008. For the last couple of years, we have been taking active measures to reduce paper consumption and increase purchase of paper with recycled content. In 2015, we set a goal to decrease paper consumption by 36 tonnes (40 tons) and increase purchase of paper with recycled content to 82 percent. We surpassed our paper reduction goal and achieved a 92-tonne (101-ton) reduction. Paper use reduction was accomplished through various activities, including cost allocation, continued internal communications about reducing paper use, ongoing focus on internal reprographics centers, and requirements that personal identification numbers be used on multifunction printers to reduce waste from printed pages that are never retrieved by the sender. Reducing our paper consumption resulted in significant reductions in wood use, net energy, and GHG emissions. In 2016, we are striving for an additional 36-tonne (40-ton) reduction in the amount of paper we consume. In North America, we purchase approximately 90 percent of our paper through a firmwide master contract. The remaining 10 percent, obtained from myriad regional and local suppliers, is not tracked systematically for reporting. In 2015, we surpassed our goal of 82 percent of all paper having recycled content, with 85 percent of all purchased paper containing recycled content. We achieved this increase through paper standardization, communication, and close monitoring. We have removed recycled 3-15 3 OUR PLANET content purchase rates as a goal because it has now become a best practice. We will continue to monitor recycled content rates to evaluate the effectiveness of our purchasing practices. The actual post-consumer recycled content in the various kinds of recycled paper we purchase ranges from 30 to 100 percent. In 2015, we purchased a total of 223 tonnes (246 tons) of paper, which contained 57 tonnes (63 tons) of recycled fiber by weight. 3.5.2 Europe Paper Consumption Our goals in Europe were to reduce paper consumption, following good practice guidance, and to monitor both actual absolute reductions and the ratio of paper use per employee. In the United Kingdom, paper consumption data were recorded in 14 offices. The data for 2010, 2011, and 2012 were rebaselined to exclude four joint-venture offices, which are outside of CH2M’s operational control. In 2014, we saw a decline in UK paper consumption of 5 percent, compared with 2013. In 2015, we saw an increase in paper consumption, to an average of 3,227 sheets per employee; however, this amount is still less than the good practice industry benchmark (and EMS target) of 3,500 sheets. 3-16 3 OUR PLANET UK offices manage paper usage through internal communications to raise awareness. They link these communications with internal cost reduction and waste minimization programs—good management of resources makes good business sense. CH2M also rolled out a print management system in 2014, which continues to help optimize paper use in our business. Across the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, paper consumption was 3,241 sheets per employee in 2015. 3.6 Recycling Recycling is a key element of our corporate culture. Most of our offices have formal recycling programs for general items, such as paper, plastic, aluminum, and glass. Our offices and employees are aware of our commitment to expand our “Reduce, Recycle, and Reuse” program wherever possible. 3.6.1 Recycling in North America While municipalities across the United States have various types of recycling available, our policy is to recycle whatever we can where we work. In 2014, 80 percent of our offices recycled paper and provided shredding services (which subsequently recycle), and in 2015, we achieved our goal to increase that coverage to 100 percent in our area offices. In 2016, we will continue to strengthen our paper recycling programs in area offices that need enhancement. In addition, several of our offices make composting available so employees can take compost home for their gardens. In cooperation with food supplier Sodexo and a food recycling company, our corporate campus offers composting from the café kitchen out to the cafeteria. We also compost coffee grounds from the break rooms on each floor. Sodexo provides compostable to-go containers that make composting easier for staff. In addition, our office in Bellevue, Washington, began food composting in 2015. At our corporate headquarters, we provide recycling bins for pens, plastic bags and comingle paper, aluminum, technology, batteries, and light bulbs and ballasts. We also recycle furniture through donations and use in other offices. We recycle as much material from renovations as possible through donations to Habitat for Humanity, as well as using a metal recycler. The following are examples of outstanding recycling success stories in 2015: • Our Vancouver, Canada, office landlord provides an extensive recycling program, free of charge, for paper and cardboard, organics, multi-materials, batteries and electronics, light bulbs, and garbage. The landlord also sponsored a “Shred Fest,” where employees were encouraged to bring their personal documents from home to be confidentially shredded and recycled for free. In addition, the landlord offered a full day dedicated to free recycling for electronics, metals, plastic, household items, and expanded polystyrene. • Our office in Sacramento, California, has donated hundreds of binders to various schools. As one of our engineers who made a delivery to a school full of disadvantaged kids commented, “It was so satisfying to get to help them and keep this stuff from being thrown away.” 3-17 3 OUR PLANET • As part of an office move in Spartanburg, South Carolina, employees recycled 561 lamps, 1.6 tons of commingled material, 5.4 tons of cardboard, 23.5 tons of paper, and 3.9 tons of scrap metal from their cubicles and offices. In addition, they donated 167 chairs, 1,340 binders, 8 white boards, 10 bookshelves, and 9 cabinets to schools and faith-based organizations. The office also held auctions for equipment, memorabilia, and furniture that could not be donated. We also have national agreements in place for recycling the following: • Batteries: Recycling batteries keeps heavy metals out of landfills and mitigates potential groundwater contamination. It also saves resources because recovered plastic and metals are used to make new batteries. In 2015, our North American offices recycled 1,096 kilograms (2,417 pounds) of batteries. • Pens: Old pens, highlighters, and markers are collected and shipped to TerraCycle for plastic recycling. For each item recycled, CH2M receives US$0.02, which is donated to Engineers Without Borders USA in Denver, one of our strategic nonprofit partners. In 2015, we recycled 7,116 writing instruments. The pen recycling program kept old pens out of the landfill and turned them into new plastic items, while we donated US$142 directly to Engineers Without Borders. • Shredded Paper Recycling: In addition to our regular paper recycling program, we securely shredded and recycled 212 tons (192 tonnes) of paper with our shredding vendor, Iron Mountain. 3.6.2 Recycling Outside of North America 3.6.2.1 Europe We continue to encourage local offices in Europe to set their own waste reduction and recycling targets. At our larger UK offices, we have worked with our waste contractors to install containers that allow greater segregation and recycling of waste, including plastics, paper and cardboard, glass, batteries, and newspapers. In parallel, many UK offices do not need trash bins at each desk and, instead, replaced them with waste and recycling hubs at strategic locations. We also have a program to promote recovery and recycling of toner cartridges. Waste paper produced by our UK offices is segregated and recycled wherever possible. We also segregate, and securely handle and dispose of confidential waste in accordance with applicable security standards. In 2015, we securely disposed of and recycled almost 51 tonnes (56 tons) of confidential waste paper. In addition, the disposal of offsite, stored, archive documents has resulted in a further 13 tonnes (14 tons) of waste paper being securely disposed of and recycled. 3.6.2.2 Asia Pacific Offices in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand diverted 1,909 kilograms (4,200 pounds) of electronic waste from the landfill through company-approved reuse and recycling services. 3.6.2.3 Middle East The Middle East offices recycled 17,793 kilograms (39,227 pounds) of paper waste and 799 printer cartridges, in addition to recycling cardboard, plastic, metal, and glass. 3.6.2.4 Australia The Australia EMS program continued recycling paper, batteries, mobile phones, and fluorescent light tubes. The EMS team accomplished its goal of purchasing 100 percent of its paper stocks as 100 percent recycled content or carbon-neutral paper. It will continue to purchase all standard, white office paper with 100 percent recycled content. Paper waste is minimized through awareness communications and enhanced copier functionality, and waste paper is recycled. Australian offices recycled approximately 680 kilograms (1,497 pounds) of electronic waste, up significantly from previous years because of office 3-18 3 OUR PLANET restructures and a relocation. Similar initiatives are in place on established project sites. Project HSE plans address environmental aspects and impacts relevant to the work. 3.6.2.5 Latin America We separate recyclables, plastics, and electronic waste. In 2015, in both Argentina and Mexico, we recycled 167 kilograms of plastics and 1,401 kilograms of electronic waste (which included 614 kilograms of print cartridges). Paper recycling has increased throughout Argentina and Mexico since 2013. 3.6.3 Electronics Recycling Electronics waste recycling presents a large problem on a global level, as well as a business concern from a security perspective. For a number of years, our Information Technology (IT) group has recycled large electronics, such as servers, desktops, and laptops. In 2007, we began an electronics recycling program in North America to capture compact discs, cords, mobile phones, and other small devices that were not included in our corporate computer leasing programs. Collection bins are placed in public areas in our offices, so employees can easily dispose of these smaller electronic waste products. In 2014, we achieved electronic waste recycling in 100 percent of our North American area offices. Globally, 86 percent of offices outside of North America recycle electronic components, up from 84 percent in 2014. In 2015, we recycled 31,989 kilograms (70,523 pounds) of electronic waste in North America and 49,752 kilograms (109,685 pounds) around the world. 3-19 This page intentionally left blank. Preserving the Environment 4.1 Grassroots Project Sustainability Program Goes Viral 4.1.1 Where It All Began: Fayetteville Nature lovers and bird watchers do not usually flock to wastewater treatment plants, but they do in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Invasive vegetation surrounding the Paul R. Noland Wastewater Treatment Plant had choked out native flora and reduced biodiversity. CH2M employees who manage operations at the plant helped to revitalize the 13.3acre plot into a wildlife habitat and create a 1-acre xeriscape garden, which uses treated effluent and minimizes the need for mowing. While operating and maintaining Fayetteville’s two wastewater facilities, we are advancing the City’s dream of becoming a national sustainability leader. Before sustainability was the thing to do, the CH2M team recognized the need to think beyond the contract to help our client break new ground in the industry. Since 2007, we’ve worked with the City to implement sustainability improvements that decrease emissions, reduce fossil fuel use, diminish waste, and cut annual operating costs. Staff transport materials by bicycles or electrical golf carts; use load-shedding generators to ease electrical grid stress during heightened demand; implemented a more efficient dissolved oxygen system; and designed an innovative biosolids drying program that uses solar energy and natural gas to produce biosolids fertilizer, giving the City a cost recovery revenue stream. CH2M’s Fayetteville team We helped Fayetteville reclaim land around the plant by removing invasive species and preparing the grounds; planting native wildflowers, grasses, shrubs, and trees; zoning around the creek to allow room for wildlife to prosper; and adding a community parking area, kiosk, and bluebird trail. This innovative public-private partnership project was the first City-owned property to be certified by the National Wildlife Federation as a Community Wildlife Habitat in Arkansas. “[CH2M’s] passion for services and In 2008, the project was a finalist for the Arkansas Department quality of work is second to none. of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Award. They are such an integral part of our team. I couldn’t imagine not having 4.1.2 Capturing the Passion of Our Employees their talent and expertise working on behalf of our city and our citizens. We In 2010, CH2M’s Operations Management Services business, look forward to this relationship which maintains, operates, and manages facilities on behalf of continuing for many more years into clients, named its first sustainability director, Lindsay Ritter. the future.” Building on the grassroots sustainability partnership between – Don Marr, Chief of Staff, Fayetteville and CH2M staff, Lindsay drew on the expertise and Fayetteville, Arkansas passion of OM employees like Fayetteville project manager 4-1 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT Duyen Tran, and support from two people who saw sustainability as key to our success: OM President Elisa Speranza and Marketing & Communications Manager Susan Mays. Lindsay developed a sustainability pilot program with a five-step process to engage employees and implement the program at 45 municipal water and wastewater treatment facilities we manage. The pilot program captured the passion and ingenuity of our people to implement sustainability improvements through repeatable, recordable processes. Offering flexibility to achieve meaningful, site-specific sustainability progress, the program helps our clients achieve their goals. In that first year, we saved US$1.2 million, reduced Now in its sixth year, our sustainability electrical use by 1.4 million program has: kilowatt-hours, reused • Saved US$9.9 million 2.1 billion gallons of effluent, • Reduced or avoided electrical use diverted 5,600 tons of waste, by 59 million kilowatt-hours saved 12,000 gallons of chemicals, and won the 2011 • Reused 55 billion gallons of National Association of Water beneficial effluent Companies Management • Diverted 31,000 tons of waste, Innovation Award. including biosolids reuse and After those outstanding results, recycling materials we implemented the program in nearly 200 facilities across • Saved 111,000 gallons of fuel North America by engaging passionate CH2M sustainability • Contributed more than champions and teams at each facility. Focusing on continuous 13,400 community volunteer hours improvement, each project sets two sustainability goals each year to promote sustainable best management practices. 4.1.3 Champions Translate Sustainability Strategy into Results “Don’t call it sustainability,” he says, “call it a challenge.” Sustainability champion Mark Copley believes challenges are opportunities to learn and, the more he learns, the more of an opportunity he has to teach. Mark says, “I feel fortunate to be in a role that immerses personal values into work…At the core of what we do is to protect the river. I identify with that, and it motivates me to excel in my role.” Project sustainability champions receive training in applying triple-bottom-line principles, using our EMS, working with clients to set and implement goals, and measuring impacts. This volunteer position enables employees who have a Sustainability champions passion in sustainability to participate, resulting in a diverse group of champions with varying backgrounds and disciplines. This employee-driven, project-specific program brings positive economic, environmental, and social outcomes to our clients and the communities we serve. While the total impact of our sustainability program is substantial, the impact our efforts make on each project tells a greater story. 4.1.4 Preserving Water in Rio Rancho Water is a precious resource, particularly in arid New Mexico. Half the state’s population is centered around Albuquerque and Rio Rancho, placing immediate demands on the supply where CH2M operates and maintains Rio Rancho’s water and wastewater treatment plants. 4-2 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT CH2M’s entire New Mexico sustainability team, representing six projects in the state, is working to build a healthy future for their communities by protecting the state’s water supplies. One way they do this is by volunteering their time and expertise each year at the Rio Rancho Children’s Water Festival. The festival provides fun, hands-on water education to students and teachers. It also helps teachers integrate water education into their curriculum. Since the festival began, more than 5,000 students and teachers have received water education. After attending, children educate their families about how to conserve water, which has resulted in the City’s residential water use decreasing by 32 percent. As a reward for their efforts to meet their clients’ sustainability goals, the CH2M team won the Rocky Mountain Water Environment Association Award for sustainability in 2014. 4.1.5 Creating and Nurturing Sustainability Leaders The Fayetteville project and OM sustainability program have produced great sustainability leaders like Duyen Tran, who is now our award-winning director of OM sustainable operations. Lindsay Ritter is now global practice lead for asset and operations management; Elisa Speranza is senior vice president of innovation and corporate citizenship; and Susan Mays is global brand manager. We’re thankful for their leadership in promoting sustainability before it became popular, saving millions for our clients and preserving our most important resources. 4.2 Carbon Emissions and Energy Use CH2M has invested the resources to understand, manage, and report on its energy use and carbon footprint. We calculate and document carbon emissions that fall within our organizational and operational boundaries annually. In addition to the global carbon emissions inventory, individual regions track and manage their energy use and emissions through environmental management programs, tailored to their locations and opportunities. Some regions began tracking emissions as early as 2003, as reflected in previous sustainability reports. This section contains energy use and carbon reduction programs from the following CH2M geographies: • Global operations • North America (United States and Canada) • Europe • Asia Pacific and Australia • Middle East, North Africa, and India (MENAI) • Latin America 4.2.1 Global Carbon Emissions Inventory CH2M completed its first global GHG emissions inventory to assess our company-wide carbon footprint for Scopes 1 and 2, and selected Scope 3 emissions, in 2011. The Scope 3 emission estimates include air business travel, ground business travel, employee commuting, electricity transmission and distribution losses, contracted solid waste disposal, and offsite wastewater treatment. 4-3 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT We chose to establish 2012 as our baseline year for assessing performance toward company-wide emission reduction targets. Specifically, in 2014, CH2M endorsed a new strategic commitment to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG footprint by 25 percent from 2012 to 2017, regardless of company growth. This will be accomplished by reducing our carbon emissions steadily year over year, leading up to our 2017 goal. This aligns with what we believe is required to effectively combat climate change. Reducing GHG emissions in Alaska When CH2M acquired oil and gas company VECO in 2007, we got over US$200 million in capital assets in Alaska and Russia—real estate and 1,200 pieces of equipment and vehicles. Most of our buildings, equipment, and 30 industrial facilities are in extreme locations, such as Deadhorse, Alaska, along the North Slope. When we began tracking our GHG emissions in 2011, it became clear that our Alaska operations contribute heavily to our carbon footprint; extremely low temperatures in Arctic locations make it more difficult to implement environmental improvements. But changes we have made are reaping environmental benefits and cost savings that will continue for years to come: • LED lighting: By converting one of our main equipment shops (30,000 square feet) to new LED lighting, we will improve safety and task lighting for our shop employees, with increased and sustained lumens. We will reap the benefits of our investment in approximately 2 years because of the high per-kWh price for electricity on the North Slope. Maintenance will also drop dramatically, with bulbs projected to run at least 11 years, and we will no longer need to have hazardous material collection points and disposal fees for metal halide bulbs. We will continue to replace traditional lighting with LEDs as funding becomes available. • Equipment: All of our new fleet is compliant with the EPA’s Tier 4 emissions standards. On our ExxonMobil Point Thomson project, almost 100% of the construction equipment we used met these standards, at the client’s request. We have been replacing 10 tractors per year, out of our 100-tractor fleet, with Tier 4-compliant equipment, and over one-third are now Tier 4. We are also continuing to replace our diesel-powered vehicles (once less expensive to operate) with gas vehicles when the project circumstances can provide that fuel. Gas trucks not only cost less to purchase and maintain, but they are also more environmentally friendly and heat up much faster in the Arctic (less need for idling time). In addition to obvious GHG reductions, this allows us to reduce consumption of US$5/gallon fuel, and results in lower purchase cost, less maintenance, more reliable startups, and a safer workplace. These investments express our commitment to reducing our GHG emissions in a part of the world where we use the most energy. They also reflect our passion and technical innovation in improving the safety and quality of life for our employees and the environment in one of the harshest, coldest parts of the world, where it takes a huge amount of resources and energy for our clients to operate. 4-4 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT Like most service-based businesses that occupy leased offices, we typically do not manage those buildings, or directly meter or pay for power. We face challenges in reporting our energy use and related carbon emissions, yet we find value in understanding our emissions and how we can be most effective in reducing our footprint. Thus, for most of our leased space, we estimate energy consumption by using data published by the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides average energy use for various types of buildings across various climate zones. The carbon emission inventory provides CH2M with information to develop future strategies for managing resources. Although we cannot, at this time, directly measure and quantify the benefits of our facilities’ energy conservation programs, we nonetheless actively manage our energy use. As a matter of policy, CH2M purchases Energy Star-certified equipment and electronics for our North American offices. For offices in other regions, we purchase equipment that uses less energy and is certified under programs that endorse energy efficiency. Where we can, we implement direct programs to reduce energy use. We operate three buildings at our Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®)-certified headquarters campus and regularly assess our energy conservation practices. Where CH2M has an EMS in place, we implement procedures to reduce energy used in offices and have active “turn it off” campaigns. In accordance with the World Resources Institute and the WBCSD’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative— A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition, 2004) guidance (GHG Protocol), we are restating our previously reported 2012 through 2014 global carbon emissions in 2015 to account for methodology/emission factor updates, revised or newly available data records, and an updated data management system. With these changes, CH2M’s estimated global carbon emissions for Scope 1 direct and Scope 2 indirect combined prior to application of carbon offsets and RECs were: 84,552 tonnes (93,203 tons) for 2012; 84,473 tonnes (93,116 tons) for 2013; 75,808 tonnes (83,564 tons) for 2014; and 74,270 tonnes (81,869 tons) for 2015. This represents approximately a 2 percent decrease in total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from 2014, a 12 percent decrease in total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from 2013, and a 12 percent decrease in total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from 2012. Our company-wide strategies for achieving additional emissions reductions to meet our target are discussed in the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target section. Specific, additional actions taken by each of the regions are described in the remainder of this section. 4-5 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT In 2015, the largest single source of carbon emissions included in our inventory (38 percent of the total Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) was employee commuting. The second highest (18 percent of the total) was electricity consumption in facilities. 4.2.2 Boundary and Methodology Using the GHG Protocol as guidance, we applied the operational control approach in defining our organizational boundaries for reporting. Operational control refers to the authority to develop and carry out the operating or HSE policies of an operation or a facility. Using this approach, our company accounts for 100 percent of emissions from operations over which we or our subsidiaries have operational control (including leased space and vehicles). 4-6 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT CH2M calculates emissions based on actual data, where available, and estimates emissions according to standard protocol guidelines where data are incomplete or unavailable. Conducting an inventory allows us to better understand emission sources and refine data collection processes. CH2M continues to refine the inventory and data collection processes and anticipates continual enhancements as more staff are aware of the importance of keeping accurate data records for emission sources. 4.2.3 North America Carbon Emissions In our North American offices, energy-conscious employees, managers, and landlords take steps to reduce our carbon footprint. In 2015, 21 percent of our U.S. leased offices were located in Energy Star-certified buildings. Our Energy Conservation Best Practices document gives us ideas for conserving energy in our offices and talking with landlords about energy conservation. It also provides examples and success stories from various offices. We directly manage the facilities at our corporate headquarters in Denver. As our largest single location, the Denver campus provides us the opportunity to take positive actions in managing our environmental footprint. All four of the Denver campus buildings are LEEDand Energy Star-rated. They feature waterefficient fixtures, have motion sensors to control lighting, offer comprehensive recycling options, and use recycled and local building materials. We track our energy usage monthly in Energy Star’s Portfolio Manager System. We view energy conservation as an ongoing process. Historically, we have been able to reduce energy consumption in our Denver campus buildings. In 2015, we uncovered an increasing electricity consumption trend at our company headquarters and set out to stabilize our consumption at 8,706 MWh (2014 levels). We achieved this goal, with electricity at our headquarters at 8,513 MWh by year-end (2 percent decrease from 2014). We are striving for an additional reduction of 850 MWh at our headquarters by 2017, through the implementation of a pilot program. Xcel Energy, our utility provider, will be including one or more CH2M headquarters buildings into their pilot Demand Response program. The program is designed to reduce electrical energy by optimizing the cooling systems performance during peak electrical demand periods. Also under consideration are a data center energy assessment and development of a retrocommissioning program to ensure that computerized control systems provide optimal working conditions during the heating season. Natural gas usage decreased by 31 percent, primarily from a decrease in space heating, as reflected in lower heating degree days. The Denver campus continues to seek opportunities to reduce energy consumption and implement energy-efficiency projects going forward. 4-7 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT 4.2.4 Europe Carbon Emissions In Europe, our objectives in 2015 were to: • Reduce office carbon emissions by a target of 5 percent by the end of 2015, and monitor emissions as a ratio per employee. • Track business travel carbon emissions as a baseline for subsequent years, and implement a plan to realize reductions. We recorded consumption data at 14 offices, and we continued to record emissions from our company car fleet. In 2011, we began reporting carbon emissions associated with UK business travel, which represents approximately 47 percent of our UK carbon footprint. In 2013, we extended our recording to include our 11 offices in mainland Europe and air miles flown by employees in these offices. 4-8 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT In 2014, we implemented some of our plans for more efficient use of office space, which continued into 2015. These actions have contributed to a decrease in carbon emitted per employee in the United Kingdom, from 1.27 tonnes per employee in 2013 to 1.20 tonnes in 2015; this is a decrease of approximately 6 percent. In the United Kingdom, our total Scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions decreased by 3.5 percent from 2014 to 2015. Europe has seen a steady decrease in electricity and natural gas consumption since 2013. From 2013 to 2015, office electricity and heating emissions decreased by approximately 10 percent, exceeding our objective. 4-9 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT In the UK, electricity consumption at our area offices decreased by approximately 210,000 kWh, or 5 percent, between 2014 and 2015. Heating consumption decreased by approximately 397,000 kWh, or 16 percent, compared to 2014. 4-10 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT 4.2.5 Asia Pacific and Australia Carbon Emissions Our Australian EMS team has long tracked and managed our operations’ carbon footprint. We continue to measure the carbon impacts of our activities in 2015; office electricity consumption is our main carbon contributor. As in previous years, electricity conservation measures have included removing unnecessary lights, selecting energy-saving IT hardware, and encouraging staff to switch off unnecessary lighting. In 2015, the Sydney office underwent a lighting retrofit to significantly improve energy efficiency. The Hong Kong office has implemented environmentally friendly measures to reduce its carbon footprint. It has reduced electricity use by 6.8 percent in 2015. 4.2.6 Middle East, North Africa, and India Carbon Emissions The MENAI offices continued to reduce GHG emissions in 2015, with a 40 percent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 2014 to 2015. The decrease was caused by office consolidations. 4.2.7 Latin America Carbon Emissions We continue to manage electrical energy consumption in the Latin America Region by asking employees to turn off their computers after they finish work and turn off lights and air conditioners when leaving a meeting room or office. We have also trained maintenance staff to minimize lighting in unused areas. 4-11 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT 4.3 Carbon Emissions Reduction Target Most global GHG emissions are from the corporate sector, so it is a responsibility of the corporate sector to reduce their carbon footprint over time. The de facto target for global climate policy is to limit the average global temperature rise to no more than the critical threshold of 2 degrees Celsius (°C), as compared to preindustrial temperatures. CH2M has made setting and achieving a meaningful internal carbon emissions reduction goal an imperative component of our business model to do our part in Lake Tahoe, Nevada mitigating climate impacts. In parallel, we are helping communities adapt to the current and predicted future effects of changing climate through climate risk and resilience services, and natural capital solutions. As a result, in 2014, we made an award-winning commitment to reduce our carbon footprint 25 percent by 2017 for carbon emissions from fuel and electricity (Scopes 1 and 2). We will mitigate or reduce our footprint year over year, starting with a baseline year of 2012. We have made this commitment to reduce our absolute carbon footprint despite our forecast for growth of our operations over the goal period. Our goal is more aggressive than the absolute numbers represent, since we are basing it on 2012 net emissions—after the purchase of offsets and RECs—rather than total emissions. During our baseline year, we mitigated 17 percent of our 2012 carbon footprint, in part, by purchasing carbon offsets and RECs. Therefore, our 2017 goal actually represents a 39 percent reduction from our 2012 total carbon emissions. 4-12 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT We have committed to a total GHG reduction of 25 percent, equivalent to an average reduction of 5 percent annually. This is, in part, because a study by the Carbon Disclosure Project and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) indicated that, if each company in the U.S. corporate sector reduced its carbon footprint by an additional 3 percent each year, our global temperatures would stay below a 2°C increase. Collectively, we would lower GHG emissions in 2020 by 1.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) from 2010 levels. Also known as “The 3% Solution,” this is one of the several methods that support science-based target setting. Since CH2M has such a high stake in the future health of cities and infrastructure worldwide, we believe a 5 percent commitment better matches our values. We are aware of the Science Based Targets initiative, which is a joint initiative effort of the Carbon Disclosure Project, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute, and WWF. The initiative represents setting a more sophisticated process for establishing targets in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase below 2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. A key goal of the initiative is development of GHG reduction targets specific to individual industrial and commercial sectors, in recognition that some sectors can feasibly achieve greater than 3 percent reduction, where this target may be more challenging for others. CH2M will continue to monitor this work and reevaluate our goal as appropriate. In early 2015, the U.S. government recognized CH2M’s commitment to reducing our carbon emissions. We participated in the White House Roundtable on Greenhouse Gas Reductions, part of President Obama’s initiative to address climate change. The roundtable spotlighted companies like CH2M that are demonstrating leadership by committing to reduce their GHG emissions. President Obama issued a new Executive Order that will cut the federal government’s GHG emissions by 40 percent from 2008 levels over the next decade, and increase the share of electricity the federal government consumes from renewable sources to CH2M staff at the Climate Leadership Awards banquet 30 percent. Together, the combined results of the 4-13 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT federal government actions and supplier commitments will reduce GHG emissions by 26 million metric tons by 2025 from 2008 levels, the equivalent of taking nearly 5.5 million cars off the road for a year. The EPA recognized CH2M for excellence in GHG management in the fourth annual Climate Leadership Awards program, in collaboration with the Association of Climate Change Officers, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, and The Climate Registry. The Excellence in Greenhouse Gas Management—Goal Setting Certificate recognizes organizations that publicly report third-party verified, organization-wide GHG inventories and publicly commit to aggressive GHG emissions reduction goals. To encourage continued progress across the federal supply chain, the Obama Administration released a new scorecard to publicly track self-reported emissions disclosure and progress for all major federal suppliers, who together represent more than US$187 billion in federal spending and account for more than 40 percent of all federal contract dollars. Designed to assist federal agencies in preferentially selecting low-carbon contractors, the scorecard lists contractors with more than US$1 billion in federal business and shows their level of commitment to emissions reductions in classic stoplight style: red is no commitment, yellow is on the way to one, and green is success! In our sector, we are one of only a couple of contractors who have two green dots, one for disclosing emissions and one for having an emissions reduction target. Elisa Speranza accepting our award from EPA Assistant Administrator Janet McCabe In November 2015, CH2M was recognized by the White House for signing the American Business Act on Climate Pledge to demonstrate our support for action on climate change, including a climate change agreement in Paris. In addition, by signing this pledge, CH2M demonstrated an ongoing commitment to climate action by reducing our emissions and taking other actions to build a more sustainable business. 4.3.1 Our Progress CH2M is firmly on track to meet our 25 percent carbon emission reduction goal by 2017. Both total Scope 1 and 2 emissions and net emissions (emissions after the purchase of offsets and RECs) have declined since 2012. Our net emissions, the focus of our carbon reduction goal, declined 17 percent from 2012. 4-14 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT Our total carbon emissions have declined every year since 2012, as we have consolidated our business’ physical footprint and implemented direct carbon emissions reduction programs. Since our goal is to sustain net carbon reductions, regardless of fluctuations in our business size, and although our internal reductions have proved greater than our original projections, we have continued to invest in carbon offsets and RECs to make annual progress toward our 2017 goal. In 2013, our carbon offset and renewable energy investments resulted in a total emission offset of 16,388 tonnes of CO2e (18,065 tons), or 19 percent of CH2M’s total Scope 1 and 2 emissions for that year. In 2014, offsets and RECs resulted in a total emission offset of 14,377 tonnes CO2e (15,848 tons), or 19 percent of total emissions. In 2015, offsets and RECs resulted in a total emission offset of 16,984 tonnes CO2e (18,722 tons), or 23 percent of total emissions. The year-over-year effect of the reduction in total emissions, plus the additional investments in offsets and RECs that decrease our annual net emissions, results in the 17 percent progress toward our overall goal. 4.3.2 Our Management Approach CH2M’s energy use and carbon emissions continue to be managed both globally and locally, as each region sets goals for reductions through its own programs. The most significant driver for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions is leased floor space in our offices; therefore, our carbon footprint generally tracks with company growth. Directly reducing energy use—and measuring the results of those reductions—is difficult in leased facilities where we lack management control and do not pay for power separately from the lease. As a matter of policy, we proactively work with landlords to participate in turn-it-off programs and purchase Energy Star or comparable appliances, electronics, and other equipment to reduce emissions associated with energy use, even though we cannot measure the results of doing so. We apply three general methods to reduce our footprint: • Direct reductions in facilities we own or operate • Investment in a portfolio of carbon mitigation projects • Investment in renewable energy 4-15 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT 4.3.2.1 Direct Reductions At our corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado, we track and report energy use. The entire campus is Energy Star certified and we previously remodeled to increase daylighting, improve building automation systems, and upgrade light fixtures. Likewise, at our facilities on the North Slope in Alaska, we have previously implemented a number of projects to reduce energy use and fuel consumption, and more are planned. These local and regional efforts, as well as international efforts, are described further in Carbon Emissions and Energy Use. 4.3.2.2 Carbon Mitigation Projects To make sure that carbon-reducing programs are implemented globally and achieve our goals, we invest in a diverse portfolio of carbon mitigation projects that align with our business. We invested in three different projects in the United States and internationally: • Verified carbon units for the Afognak Island Forest Conservation project in Alaska. The 10-year project, located 200 miles southwest of Anchorage, protects more than 8,000 acres of pristine coastal habitat. It is also near our primary oil and gas business. • Verified carbon units for an industrial wastewater gas to energy project in the Midwest United States. • Verified carbon units for projects to reduce emissions of gases with high global warming potential from industrial magnesium production in Michigan and Canada. 4.3.2.3 Renewable Energy To address energy use, we purchased 2015 vintage RECs from Green-e certified wind power facilities in the United States and made investments in green power through Bullfrog Power in Canada. 4.3.3 REC Accounting for Net Zero Power Consumption With the 2014 GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance, World Resources Institute and other organizations have abandoned the “avoided emission” concept that historically has driven REC accounting. As with our 2014 inventory, consistent with the new guidance, the unbundled REC purchases are now combined with an equal quantity of grid power purchases to yield a “net zero” power consumption. For transparency, we apply our RECs to reduce net power consumption at our largest area offices in the continental United States, beginning with our largest power consumption location and working down, regardless of grid power intensity for those locations.

CH2M employees commute to work and they travel to conduct both client and internal business—by personal vehicle, fleet and project vehicle, rental car, airplane, bus, ferry, rail, bicycle, and on foot. For an organization like CH2M, which seeks to bring technical experts to projects all over the world, travel is a difficult metric to shift. Travel that brings our best minds to global projects might actually produce a greater benefit to sustainability megatrends by developing new, more innovative sustainable solutions arising from direct collaboration. Travel is an imperative and essential part of our business, but we continually question whether we can get the same collaborative and innovative work done in a different way. By offering a suite of videoconferencing and virtual meeting tools, we have sought to reduce travel, find ways to build effective teams while controlling travel costs, and improve work-life balance by allowing employees to travel less. CEO and Chair Jacqueline Hinman and other executives offer quarterly updates using video conferencing. Employee commute modes vary significantly in different countries around the world and in different communities within the same country. At a global level, we sponsor a 1-week awareness campaign, “Try It Week,” every year, on alternative transportation modes, along with a bike-to-work day. Additional, region-specific measures are described in the remainder of this section. CH2M’s efforts to minimize business travel fall into two main categories: air and ground business travel and employee commuting, which includes teleworking. 4.4.1 Air and Ground Business Travel As we bring technical expertise to projects all over the world, we need to balance the benefits of bringing the right person to the job with the reality of the footprint from corporate air travel. The North America and Europe EMS programs track business travel, and the EMS teams work to raise awareness of when travel is appropriate and when virtual meeting technologies could be applied effectively. The CH2M Travel Department continues to promote awareness and responsible choices through program communication, company policies, and integration of suppliers that employ sustainable business practices. By the end of 2015, our consolidated Global Travel Program consisted of North America, Europe, MENAI, and Latin America. In 2016, we plan to complete the implementation of Asia Pacific Region. When our global program is complete, we will be able to exchange information that could improve current practices. 4.4.1.1 North America The CH2M Corporate Travel Department tracks both indirect (overhead) and direct (client-billable) miles flown for annual reporting. Flight data are collected from all reservations booked through our designated travel management companies; these encompass more than 90 percent of tickets issued to U.S. and Canadian employees. Travel by employees includes U.S., Canadian, and international destinations. In 2015, we realized a decrease in total air travel of 8 percent. Indirect travel, which consists of trips selected by the company rather than dictated by client project needs, totaled 33.25 million miles (53.51 million kilometers), a decrease of 1.9 million miles (3.06 million kilometers), or 5 percent, over 4-17 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT the previous year. Direct travel, dictated by client projects, decreased by 10 percent from 55.46 million miles (89.25 million kilometers) to 49.91 million miles (80.32 million kilometers). In 2011, CH2M began collecting data on U.S. employee rental car travel. Rental data cannot be identified by indirect and direct travel purposes, so both are included. Business ground travel by North American employees for 2015 totaled 12.6 million miles (20.3 million kilometers). Business ground travel mileage decreased by 1.4 million miles (2.25 million kilometers), or 10 percent, over the previous year. We attribute the decrease to the reduction in indirect travel. 4.4.1.2 Europe In 2015, we continued tracking carbon emissions related to business travel across Europe. We continued to report carbon emissions associated with employee business travel, recording air and rental car miles. In Europe, we saw a less than 1 percent decrease in total air miles. Total air miles decreased from 9.96 million miles (16.03 million kilometers) to 9.94 million miles (16.00 million kilometers). 4-18 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT In the United Kingdom, we saw a reduction in business travel carbon emissions of 8 percent between 2013 and 2014, as a result of less client-related and office-to-office business travel. Total car miles decreased by 20 percent from 2014 to 2015. 4.4.2 Employee Commuting CH2M’s fourth annual employee commuting survey was conducted in 2013 in 295 offices globally (a large increase from 41 offices in 2012). Even with the survey expansion to more offices, during the 4 survey years, we observed that commuting habits and preferences had not changed significantly. The survey results showed that the top three alternative forms of transportation are public transit, teleworking, and carpooling. We have learned that commuting choices vary significantly, depending on local availability of transit options and facilities, as well as family obligations (such as caring for children or elders), both of which contribute to highly individual choices. Therefore, we decided we would perform the survey every 5 years (the next survey will take place in 2018). As we make plans for program revisions in 2016, we will evaluate additional opportunities to partner with local organizations that can offer benefits, such as vanpooling and guaranteed rides home for emergencies. We will also look at integrating more strongly with our employee wellness programs. In addition, we will determine the appropriate frequency and methodology for employee commuting surveys. Offices around the world are encouraged to use creative ways to promote employee commuting. In Campana, Argentina, for example, we provide a minibus to transport 55 employees from the county to the office and back home. 4.4.2.1 North America While more than 60 percent of employees surveyed in the United States commute by single-occupancy vehicle, 35 percent of employees chose to commute using the top three alternative forms of transportation: teleworking, public transit, and carpooling. All U.S. employees have access to an alternative transportation assistance program to use pretax dollars to pay for transit passes. Employees who commute via bicycle also have access to a bicycle benefits program, which allows enrolled U.S. employees to receive a voucher for US$10 to $20 per month for bicycle-related equipment or repairs. In 2015, our North America Alternative Commuting team supported volunteer employee transportation coordinators working on office alternative commuting programs, to see which types of programs are most effective before setting goals and targets. Several of our larger offices already have volunteer employee transportation coordinators who work with local transportation management associations to provide commuter information and benefits, such as a guaranteed-ride-home program if employees 4-19 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT have an emergency or unplanned change in their commute home on a day in which they commute using an alternative to single-occupancy vehicles. Sun, fun, and cycling Bike to Work Day was a huge success in San Diego, California. The CH2M office in San Diego was not only psyched to cycle, but also teamed up with the San Diego Chamber of Commerce to host a pit stop to support cycling commuters citywide! The popular pit stop had 216 riders stop by to chat and pick up information, free event items, and extra fuel with snacks and water, along with some positive energy and encouragement. CH2M offered Bike to Work Day t-shirts, CLIF bars, bicycle lights, bicycle maps, handouts on alternative commuting options, information on bicycle and road safety, coconut water and regular water, grocery bag holders, and hand sanitizer. Former Mayor of San Diego Jerry Sanders and San Former Mayor Jerry Sanders, CH2M employee Diego County Supervisor Ron Roberts also stopped by. Kyle Hegger, and County Supervisor Ron Roberts The CH2M pit stop team was interviewed for the local morning news. 4.4.2.2 United Kingdom While the majority of employees in the United Kingdom commute by single-occupancy vehicle, the top three alternative forms of transportation are using the train/underground, carpooling, and bicycling. Several employees use a more sustainable commuting alternative, with our London office topping the list because of the wide variety of mass transit options available in that urban location. A large number of employees in our Swindon office also choose more sustainable forms of commuting, despite its rural location. The top forms of sustainable commuting for employees in Glasgow are train, carpooling, or bus. Employees in Worcester choose to bicycle, walk, or carpool to commute to the office. During 2015, the Glasgow office’s Green Travel Group provided subsidies for eligible employees to obtain discounted bus and rail tickets, affirming our commitment to promoting public transport, which reduces our overall carbon footprint. In addition, the Glasgow office installed an electric vehicle charging point for drivers of electric or hybrid electric vehicles. We offer all employees the chance to lease a bike (of a value up to £1,000 including value-added tax) on attractive terms through the UK government’s Cycle to Work scheme. This allows employees to pay for the leases from their pre-tax salaries and benefit from reduced tax and National Insurance charges (a UK Social Security tax). If they do not need new bikes, they can use the arrangement to purchase safety equipment. In 2015, we enrolled 80 employees; the scheme will continue to be offered to employees in 2016. Employees’ bicycle commuting efforts avoid 3,000 car journeys and save almost 5 tonnes (6 tons) of CO2 each month, based on empirical evidence supplied by the scheme vendor. 4.4.3 Teleworking and Flexible Work Schedules CH2M’s teleworking program helps reduce our environmental impact. In 2015, 198 new teleworkers were added, reducing our leased footprint and saving energy. CH2M also offers flexible work schedules, allowing employees to work full-time hours in fewer days, and reduce the amount of commuting. 4-20 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT 4.5 Client Services Footprint 4.5.1 Mitigating the Environmental Impacts of Our Services In collaboration with our clients, CH2M offers sustainable design services that improve our built environment. For more information about these services, the projects where we have actively helped our clients reduce their impacts on the built environment, and the people who make it possible, visit the CH2M Web site. We offer sustainable solutions across a broad range of services, from remediation to climate change adaptation, and work throughout the energy-water-food sustainability nexus. From all of that work, we have selected a few service areas to focus on in this report. We discuss specific service areas where we have implemented programs to measure our environmental impacts and metrics across a portfolio of projects and programs. We also report on projects and programs where we have operational control. In this section, we also explain the sustainability impacts of our green building design and construction practice and facility operations and maintenance. 4.5.2 Green Projects After decades of successful green building design, we established a database in 2010 to document our green projects and track their progress toward third-party certification. We include projects that are pursuing a third-party independent green building certification such as LEED, Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM), Greenroads™, GreenMark, Estidama, Global Sustainability Assessment System, and Envision. As new certification programs, such as PEER and WELL, come online we are incorporating those certifications into our database as well, and applying them to the overall level of sustainability work we deliver over the year. In 2015, we provided over US$122.8 million of work, delivering third-party certified sustainability solutions across our projects worldwide, and made a global impact we are proud of. Furthermore, our revenues for the 2014 calendar year resulted in CH2M being ranked number eight on the Engineering News-Record Top 100 Green Design Firms list for 2015 (up from number nine in 2014). We recognize that the certified projects in our portfolio only tell a part of our sustainability story. Much of our most innovative work in sustainability falls outside of certification programs, and it is that work that best exemplifies our leadership. From supporting the removal of toxic materials from product supply chains, to establishing net-zero energy and waste strategies for industrial campuses, the sustainability work we embed in projects goes far beyond complying with checklists and following prescriptive requirements. Whether a project is pursuing certification or not, we take a holistic approach to building design and operations that enables optimized system performance and easier-to-manage capital investments for all of our clients. For the last 4 years, we have been working in partnership with the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and a consortium of global manufacturing companies (LEED User Group for Industrial Facilities) to develop pathways for compliance with the LEED rating system standards. Using this internationally recognized rating system has allowed the manufacturing sector not only to gain recognition for the green building strategies implemented on its projects, but also to provide a standard method for determining building performance across an industry portfolio. CH2M is proud to be a founding member of the LEED User Group for the Industrial Facilities Building Sector and to play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of how industrial facilities affect the greening of the built environment. In 2015, the user group developed a pilot credit for evaluating energy performance using alternative metrics and established a methodology for developing a whole building water usage calculation for complex systems with multiple water pathways. In both cases, the work of the user group has made it easier for manufacturers of any industry to determine their performance relative to their competition. 4-21 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT 4.5.3 Assisting Clients with Facility Operations Management CH2M continued implementing our unique, site-driven sustainability program across the facilities and water and wastewater treatment sites that we operate and maintain on behalf of our clients, separate from our North American EMS. Because we operate these facilities, we have a rare opportunity to be part of the day-to-day decision-making at varying levels of responsibility based on the contracts. Our award-winning sustainability program leverages the passion and ingenuity of our project employees to develop site-specific sustainability goals, such as efficiency improvements, community projects, and wildlife habitat improvements. Our 2015 annual results included fuel and energy reductions, beneficial reuse of biosolids, waste diversion, ecosystem enhancements, and cost savings. With 2015 marking the program’s sixth year of implementation, the impact of our efforts to make operations more sustainable for clients continues to grow. Since program inception, we have generated significant electricity reductions, reused 55 billion gallons (20 million cubic meters) of effluent, and recorded over 13,000 volunteer hours. 4.5.4 Zofnass Program for Sustainable Infrastructure and Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure In today’s environment, the conditions and constraints under which infrastructure must perform are increasingly challenging. The collaboration between the Zofnass Program for Sustainable Infrastructure at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design and the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI) provides several resources and tools to address those challenges. CH2M has been a key player in the collaboration since the inception of the Zofnass Program in 2008. As a founding member of the Zofnass Program’s Sustainable Infrastructure Advisory Board (SIAB), we also became a charter member of ISI 4-22 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT after it was formed, continuing our commitment to embed sustainability throughout our infrastructure practices. The Envision rating is system is the flagship product developed by the Zofnass Program and ISI. The rating system is the first to provide a holistic, cost-effective framework for evaluating and rating the environmental, community, and economic benefits of large infrastructure projects; it recognizes projects that incorporate sustainability throughout the project life cycle. The system applies to all types of infrastructure planning and design: energy, water, waste, transportation, landscape, and information. Through our in-depth involvement with Envision, we have found that the rating system helps leaders, planners, and engineers more completely account for the tangible and intangible outcome of promoting green and sustainable infrastructure. It provides the missing link to economically, environmentally, and socially assessing natural capital. Throughout 2015, we introduced dozens of clients to the benefits of using Envision. Many clients have applied the tool informally or have completed assessments with our experts to explore how the tool functions. We also completed a focused initiative with Alexandria Renew Enterprises in which, through our Envision training program, we trained more than 20 client staff members to become credentialed ENV SPs and will complete a full project certification in 2016. As a member of the Zofnass Program SIAB, we have also brought together our experience, clients, and partners to engage in the program’s ongoing work to develop and promote methods, processes, and tools that quantify sustainability for infrastructure. We have presented at two Zofnass symposia in 2015 and have contributed two essays to the 2016 publication Planning Sustainable Cities: an Infrastructurebased Approach. 4.6 Natural Capital “Finding infrastructure solutions that balance environmental, economic, and social needs has never been more challenging. So planners and engineers have never had a greater opportunity to contribute their ingenuity,” said Dr. John Mogge, technology director of CH2M’s Environmental and Nuclear Business Group. As he describes in Investment Grade Green and Sustainable Infrastructure, the United States can view the US$1.2 trillion, 5-year infrastructure funding shortfall as a challenge, or as an opportunity to tap into “investors who see green and sustainable infrastructure as worthy of their investment.” For more than 30 years, CH2M has played a leading role in adapting innovative approaches to water quality, flood control, and stormwater management challenges around the world. Back in 1991, we pioneered the concept of regional low-impact development approaches in Guiding Growth: Building Better Communities and Protecting our Countryside, dispelling the myths of porous pavement durability with our initial installations that date back to 1983. Now, as the need for resiliency and infrastructure reinvestment escalates and global economic challenges continue, we must change the game more quickly and include ecosystems as a part of engineering design, alongside visionary partners, collaborators, and forward-thinking clients in all sectors. 4.6.1 Power of Nature: Natural Capital, Ecosystem Services, and Green Infrastructure Directly or indirectly, all companies use natural capital, which is the earth’s stock of air, land, water, and biodiversity, to support economic growth and job creation. Ecosystem services, such as water supply, pollination, soil fertility, the water filtration functions of riparian areas, and the storm protection provided by coastal wetlands, are the valuable and economically important goods and services that natural capital provides to business and society. Across CH2M’s projects, we use a valuing nature lens to 4-23 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT reduce impacts on natural capital and help our clients achieve sustainable access to valuable ecosystem services. One way we value nature is to actively promote green infrastructure solutions, which harnesses the power of natural capital to provide ecosystem services—work that nature historically provides for free— to address water quality, climate adaptation, environmental remediation, and resource availability challenges. Relative to traditional gray infrastructure, these solutions can enhance natural capital and their construction, operation, and maintenance and can have a significantly lower environmental footprint. CH2M offers a wide range of green infrastructure solutions, including natural water filtration systems, stormwater engineering, treatment wetlands, green roofs, alternative caps and covers, and rain gardens. 4.6.2 Power of Partnerships: Transforming Engineering Practice Engaging nature as a partner is a departure from standard engineering practice. In the early 20th century, dilution was the solution for water quality issues. As that approach failed and riverine ecosystems suffered from untreated wastewater loads, engineers innovated chemical and mechanical treatment systems and defended communities against flooding with levees. That is when our industry adopted the engineers’ mantra: “Build it strong, build it stout, using things you know about.” It is important to remember that this approach worked: we cleaned up the problems of the past and built an entire regulatory framework around these technologies, from municipal ordinances to national laws. As communities and companies face the challenges associated with climate change, failing infrastructure, and not enough money to fix it all, we are partnering with skilled visionaries to change the way we approach infrastructure solutions. It is time to incorporate nature into our calculations and gain multiple pathways to resiliency. We committed to providing natural capital and green infrastructure solutions to our clients through the launch of the Corporate Eco Forum’s Valuing Natural Capital Initiative. This initiative demonstrates the business value of nature, galvanizes action, and drives investment in natural infrastructure around the world. Our strong belief in the value of nature is also why we became a founding charter member of the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure. In 2014, we helped launch the Natural Capital Business Hub in concert with over 40 global companies, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the Corporate Eco Forum. To demonstrate our commitment, we pledged to report on at least five high-impact green infrastructure projects each year to build awareness and promote green infrastructure solutions. The following five projects and partnerships represent a fraction of the efforts undertaken by CH2M annually. 4.6.2.1 WBCSD: Natural Infrastructure Is a Great Deal for Business In Paris during the climate agreement negotiations at the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21), the world’s attention was riveted on climate change. At the same time, WBCSD launched NI4Biz.org. CH2M created the guide in collaboration with TNC, drawing on the experience of a number of corporations that have chosen to value nature and implement green infrastructure solutions. The NI4Biz guide was developed by business, for business. The guide raises awareness about natural infrastructure approaches, defines the business case for investing in natural capital through robust case studies, and provides a decision tree and support tools for helping business decide when and how to integrate natural infrastructure to their sites. Not only is green infrastructure a cost-effective way for businesses to protect assets, meet regulatory requirements, and achieve a number of other objectives, but it is also key to climate adaptation and mitigation. Press coverage for NI4Biz illustrates the benefits to companies of adopting this approach, as well as the benefits for nature: 4-24 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT • “In the business context, saving nature for nature’s sake does not work,” said Neil Hawkins, Chief Sustainability Officer for Dow Chemical. “A constructed wetland in Texas delivered $200 million in value to Dow while also providing several hundred acres of migratory bird habitat.” • “Green infrastructure is simply a good deal,” said Mark Tercek, CEO of TNC. “It often costs less than gray infrastructure, performs better, and delivers a whole bunch of co-benefits for free.” • “The real strength of this tool is it’s evidence-based,” Brandy Wilson, CH2M Global Sustainability Director, said. “These aren’t ideas, but things companies are doing right now to solve their infrastructure problems, save money, and also benefit the environment and community that they serve.” Investing in nature, as Tercek pointed out in his blog, is gaining traction as a climate solution. As we work with WBCSD and TNC to share the news about NI4Biz throughout 2016, we see it as a clear opportunity to transform engineering practice and engage companies and communities in natural infrastructure outcomes. 4.6.2.2 Dow Sarnia Site Remediation: Soil Is Not a Waste; It’s a Resource During World War II, the Dow Sarnia site manufactured synthetic rubber for the war effort. Manufacturing operations for all kinds of chemicals and materials continued at the site for nearly 70 years. After the site’s closure, Dow retained CH2M to assist with site cleanup and closure activities. Rather than following traditional disposal methods and taking the problem somewhere else, Dow and CH2M worked together to manage materials in place through a constructed temporary onsite soil treatment operation, as well as used naturally occurring soil bacteria, plants, and trees to accelerate contaminant removal. The work provided opportunities to further research new approaches and technologies. In the ultimate natural partnership, a landfill was turned into a wetlands recreational and educational amenity for the community. Dow and CH2M planted more than 400 trees at the Sarnia site, further building on the parties’ commitment to environmental health by using the trees to control groundwater elevations and minimize the spread of contaminated soils in the area. Throughout the project, the Dow-CH2M team refused to think of contaminated soil as waste, but rather as a resource. Treating soil onsite reduced the carbon footprint of the Sarnia site, minimized exposure of harmful materials to neighboring communities, and allowed for significant cost savings when compared to the cost of transporting materials for disposal at an offsite hazardous waste facility. To continue to shape future, leading-edge remediation technologies, Dow and CH2M joined with a consortium of Canadian universities to move bench-scale remedial technologies into viable commercial applications. 4.6.2.3 Exeter Flood Defense Scheme: Restoring Rivers and Wetlands through Good Design In the United Kingdom, river and wetland restoration is often rendered as part of large-scale flood defense schemes, as an enhancement or added benefit. Often these scheme elements are the first casualties during the value engineering process and where budget savings are needed. However, recent changes to government funding for habitat restoration and creation in the UK have supported a more integrated approach to large infrastructure and flood schemes where delivery of challenging habitat targets can be achieved. Trews flood relief channel (Exeter) incorporating wetland habitat 4-25 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT The Exeter Flood Defense Scheme (Exeter FDS), which incorporates major upgrading of existing flood protection, is a good example of how well integrated design can work within the constraints of an urban environment. Incorporating new and restored wetland habitats has been a vital part of scheme design, promoted by the Environment Agency and supported by their project partners. Once funding was secured, the Environment Agency-CH2M team collaborated to develop integrated designs that would both protect Exeter from flooding as well as safeguard new areas of wetland and river habitat. Exeter FDS has provided a model of how flood risk management-habitat restoration project partnerships can be successful in the UK, and other schemes are already in development using a similar approach. 4.6.2.4 TNC: Protecting Coastlines and Enhancing Ecosystems As TNC’s Jen Molnar wrote in Bringing Nature into the Engineer’s Toolbox, “Scientists are comfortable with–and often relish–ambiguity and investigating the unknown. Engineers use knowledge to solve problems and deliver new products and solutions. They seek to create innovative solutions by building on established evidence…Now the conservation community is wisely working directly with engineers– not just to reduce impacts, but to jointly find solutions for both people and nature.” We’re jumping on that opportunity through our collaborative agreement with TNC, a global nonprofit leader in science and conservation. Investing together in projects and thought leadership opportunities that establish the business case for natural infrastructure is another way we work to transform engineering practice. In 2015, we had three key projects that reflect the nature of our work: • Facing rising sea levels and more frequent storms, the world’s coastal communities and infrastructure need long-lasting solutions. TNC and CH2M published guidance on how regions can integrate nature-based solutions that will withstand the test of time and climate change. “Coastal Risk Reduction: Integrating Natural Defenses into a Sustainable Coastal Risk Management Framework” recommends that coastal regions develop strategic coastal resilience plans to reduce the environmental and socio-economic risks of coastal hazards in a sustainable manner. The document will assist communities and organizations responsible for coastal zone management to collaborate on plans that cross administrative boundaries, in recognition that nature does not recognize, or reflect, such boundaries. • In Rhode Island, the Narrow River estuary is home to many shore and wetland birds and a variety of other wildlife; it is also eroding quickly. Scientists from TNC, ecologists and engineers from CH2M, and wildlife refuge managers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) assessed the Narrow River’s degrading shoreline and gathered for a workshop to look at what had been attempted in the past and how to make it better going forward. At the workshop, we collaboratively tackled tough questions like what resilience means for this site, and how to define natural infrastructure to create a new design. • TNC and CH2M staff worked together to restore intertidal marsh habitat in Mobile Bay, Alabama, and reduce erosion through design and installation of 6,000 feet of oyster reef. We engaged over 300 volunteers in the construction of the structure to increase community investment and familiarity with, and ownership of, the natural solution. 4.6.2.5 Lower Woodsford River and Floodplain Enhancement: Restoring Dynamic River Processes and Improving Connectivity In the 1970s, Woodsford Farm received grant aid to increase production through dredging, drainage, and embankment creation. Changing priorities with the farm and challenges with floodplain arable farming influenced their decision to take 15 hectares (37 acres) of land out of production. Working with the Farm Manager, the Environment Agency’s Lower Woodsford project restored 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) of the River Frome SSSI (Dorset) and enhanced 15 hectares (37 acres) of floodplain, including planting over 20,000 trees. 4-26 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT The removal of stone revetment and lowering of embankments has reintroduced natural river processes to encourage Assisted Natural Recovery within the main river channel, while a network of floodplain channels and scrapes and ditch reprofiling maximized floodplain habitat opportunities. This floodplain restoration has restored hydrological connectivity between the river and floodplain. The material gained during construction of scrapes and channels was used for a flood bund to protect a National Grid highvoltage pylon, and some of the stone removed from the river was used as revetment protection. The ecological design was led by CH2M and a Lower Woodsford floodplain scrapes collaboration of agencies and environmental bodies, including Environment Agency, Natural England, Dorset Wildlife Trust, Forestry Commission, and the Woodland Trust. The support of a very passionate landowner enabled the successful delivery and realization of habitat potential throughout the site. 4.6.3 Power of Investment: Financing for Success In collaboration with TNC and a wide variety of stakeholders, we analyzed multiple approaches to protecting coastal communities from intense storms, such as the community of Howard Beach in Queens, New York. Our task was to develop natural and traditional gray infrastructure alternatives for coastal engineering after Superstorm Sandy struck New York City in 2012, including financing options. In 2016, we received a Diamond Award from the American Council of Engineering Companies of New York for this work, which we hope will inspire the same type of work going forward and the recognition that engineering is not enough; economic solutions have to be part of the picture. In 2013, we joined forces with Encourage Capital (formerly, EKO Asset Management Partners) to bring new financing solutions to communities seeking natural infrastructure or hybrid solutions for environmental issues like stormwater management. Through the creation of Green Path Partners, we are breaking new ground in looking at innovative public-private financing for these projects. 4-27 4 PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT 4-28 Our Partners 5.1 Stakeholders, Memberships, and Partnerships CH2M has many stakeholders in its success, including clients, employees, shareholders, business and joint venture partners, suppliers and subcontractors, professional and nonprofit organizations, and the communities where we live and work. Based on our value chain relationships, we know that working with these various stakeholders on sustainability goals helps to improve performance for everyone. Our two primary stakeholder groups are our employees and clients. Employees are actively engaged through local volunteer efforts, our Sustainability Community of Practice, EMS, intranet, and online social media group by providing direct comments and suggestions to our executive sponsor for sustainability, global sustainability director, business group sustainability leaders, and regional HSE teams. Our clients seek to improve their supply chain sustainability and, as dedicated partners with them, we strive for disclosure and transparency in metrics that are important to our customers. More information about our value chain and these relationships is provided in Key Sustainability Impacts and Effects. Many of CH2M’s projects and clients require reporting on sustainability progress as a part of the bidding process. Many more clients neither make such information a requirement for bidding nor score it, but they do request it to ensure that bidders’ values align with theirs. In turn, we drive sustainability into our supply chain by assessing selected vendors and subconsultants for their safety, environmental, and ethics programs. We also work with joint venture partners and others, and often select these partners based on matching cultures and values. CH2M engages with a multitude of other stakeholders, such as professional societies, nongovernmental organizations, and communities and governments where we work. In these activities, we provide financial support and technical expertise, as well as learn from others about how we might improve our organization and approach. Professional organizations are rich sources of partnerships to accomplish sustainability objectives in the marketplace outside of our own operations. Working with organizations that promote green building and sustainable infrastructure—as well as with more traditional engineering and scientific societies that are beginning to embrace sustainability—is a critical area that the company recognizes and where we direct funding. Such organizations include: • American Society of Civil Engineers, along with a multitude of other engineering and scientific professional associations • Zofnass Program for Sustainable Infrastructure, Harvard University • U.S. Green Building Council, Emirates Green Building Council, and European Green Building Council, among others • Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment • Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management • Water Environment Federation 5-1 5 OUR PARTNERS • Global Social Investing Council • IMPACT 2030 • American Water Works Association We partner with nonprofits directly and through our CH2M Foundation, which focuses on environmental stewardship, global access to water and sanitation, and STEM education. Other nonprofit partnerships, such as corporate networks and compacts that share a mission of creating a safer, more abundant world for the next generation, are directly tied to sustainable business. Examples of our partnerships, such as with Bridges to Prosperity and the Social Mobility Foundation, are described in Fostering Employee Excellence and Engaging our Communities. Many of these partnerships inform improvements to CH2M’s approach to sustainability. Our partner organizations include: • UN Global Compact • The Nature Conservancy • World Business Council for Sustainable Development • Water For People • Engineers Without Borders USA • Bridges to Prosperity • Business Roundtable • Green Business Executive Network • Business in the Community • World Environment Center • Corporate Eco Forum • Social Mobility Foundation • Emirates Foundation • Humanity United • Institute for Human Rights and Business The lists above are not exhaustive, but focus on the most prominent relationships in terms of the sustainability and corporate citizenship programs. CH2M engages with the communities where we have offices and where we complete projects. Avenues for engagement include our efforts in sustainable communities. CH2M selects and engages with stakeholders using a variety of methods appropriate to the group and the relationship. Some focus on in-office education about environmental topics, such as water and energy conservation. Others focus externally, engaging in community cleanups and volunteer projects. All activities support CH2M’s culture of environmental stewardship and community caring. Clients drive several aspects of corporate citizenship through contractual requirements, supplier sustainability surveys, and bid document requests. Contractual requirements often align with high-level, global concerns, such as ethics, human rights, safety, and climate change and carbon emissions. Supplier sustainability surveys typically ask for information on a range of other citizenship issues, such as waste management, energy and water conservation, career development and training, volunteerism, philanthropy, and corporate governance. Many clients include these types of issues on requests for proposals. Client sustainability surveys and questionnaires are compiled and analyzed for issues that are important or emerging. Our supply chain sustainability surveys enable a dialogue with key suppliers about sustainability to further the programs of both entities. We plan to undertake a more formal engagement process in 2016, asking targeted stakeholder groups for feedback on our materiality analysis and sustainability report. Once we have engaged with our partners, the feedback will be incorporated into our next Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship Report. 5-2 5 OUR PARTNERS 5.2 Supply Chain: Procurement for Client Projects As is typical in the engineering and construction industry, the supply chain for CH2M projects consists of suppliers and subcontractors that provide a wide variety of goods and services. These goods and services vary from project to project and may include materials, engineered equipment, fabricated products, professional and technical services, and construction services. Strategic sourcing decisions are made at the project level and may include local, domestic, or global sourcing; large or small and disadvantaged business enterprises; and a variety of supplier types, such as manufacturers, fabricators, distributors, brokers, and others. Our supply chain database includes over 26,000 active registered vendors, with approximately 17,000 tied to our automated ranking system, and a total contract value of US$2.2 billion in 2015. We have suppliers in all regions where we operate. Procurement provides a valuable tool for us to lessen our environmental impact and influence supplier behavior. For our company operations, we have committed to working with supply chain partners to reduce impacts and create markets for sustainable goods and services. For our client projects, we have established a methodology and toolset for identifying and selecting suppliers and subcontractors that 5-3 5 OUR PARTNERS have robust sustainability programs, suppliers that have products that achieve project sustainability targets, and subcontractors that will implement acceptable sustainability solutions on our construction sites. We expect all members of our supply chain to endorse our values on business ethics, environmental sustainability, labor and employment, and fair-trade practices. Our Supply Chain Ethics & Business Conduct Principles outline our expectations for our suppliers and subcontractors. Most of our suppliers are screened for compliance with the ethics and business conduct principles. CH2M’s procurement organization separates management of direct (client) and indirect (overhead) expenditures. Indirect Procurement implements sustainability screening on long-term, high-value agreements, such as technology, services, paper, office supplies, and furnishings; this screening is described in Supply Chain: Purchasing for CH2M Operations. Direct Procurement offers approaches to assist engineers and construction designers in selecting more sustainable construction materials, equipment, and services, in collaboration with clients and consideration of budget constraints. Nearly half of our direct procurement spending is in subcontracting, which involves equipment and labor. Approximately one-third of our spending is on services, and the remainder of our spending is composed of equipment, materials, and other categories. The majority of CH2M’s procurement spending lies within direct procurement agreements. Our supplier qualification and performance management system capabilities were significantly enhanced in late 2015; they will be implemented globally across the supply chain in 2016. Benefits of the new system include the ability to collect comprehensive sustainability capability attributes for use in sourcing decisions, contract formation, and supply chain performance management. The sustainability capability information collected includes planning, products and services, energy, carbon, and transportation. Capabilities to measure and report on actual sustainability performance against contract requirements include stakeholder surveys and supplier scorecards. There have been no significant changes to the supply chain itself since 2012, either as a result of organizational changes or major acquisitions. 5.3 Supply Chain: Purchasing for CH2M Operations CH2M actively manages our supply chain for environmental, social, and economic sustainability issues, as described in Supply Chain: Procurement for Client Projects. Our procurement organization separates management of direct (client) project firmwide agreements from indirect (overhead) procurement firmwide agreements. For our environmental procurement program within our EMS, we focus on indirect procurement because we have substantial control over these agreements rather than acting through client contracts. These agreements are international and the scope of this disclosure is companywide. In a global supply chain, consisting of hundreds of supplier relationships, we focus on suppliers that are willing to partner with us to reduce our environmental impact. These suppliers work with us to establish meaningful, effective, and industry-relevant contractual metrics that define specific sustainability objectives. The Indirect Procurement group segments suppliers into four tiers: • Tier 1 – Strategic: Long-term, high-volume agreements • Tier 2 – Preferred: Long-term, but lower-volume agreements • Tier 3 – Value Add: Shorter-term, lower-volume agreements with infrequently used suppliers • Tier 4 – Tactical: Typically a one-time procurement with no ongoing relationships or expenditures 5-4 5 OUR PARTNERS Tier 1 and 2 agreements reflect those supplier relationships with significant spend, transaction volume, and business impact. Accordingly, these are our most important indirect supply chain relationships and are the focus of our management approach. Since 2010, we have been adding sustainability clauses to our major agreements to finally reach 100 percent of Tier 1 and 2 supplier agreements having sustainability language included in 2015. The sustainability clause requires suppliers to participate in the defined level of sustainability program. We use four sets of sustainability metrics of increasing rigor with our Tier 1 and 2 suppliers. In 2015, our indirect spend with Tier 1 and 2 suppliers, with sustainability metrics in their agreements, was US$189.1 million. This is an increase of US$17.3 million over the previous year. 5.4 Business Partnerships: Local and Diverse Spending The CH2M family of companies has a long-standing commitment to fostering relationships with small and diverse businesses. We promote participation by partnering with local, small, and diverse business firms and providing business opportunities, training, mentoring, and other resources to help them develop and grow. We define “local” as the site where a project is designed or constructed. As a global project delivery firm, we conduct shortand long-term projects in many locations. We make inquiries with local chambers of commerce and minority; women; veteran; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT); and small business professional organizations to increase the number of small and diverse businesses in our supplier database and foster partnerships where we have active projects. Numbers and percentages fluctuate from year to year because of our acquisition of 5-5 5 OUR PARTNERS other companies, the nature and amount of work that can be subcontracted, and the fact that some businesses expand and no longer qualify as small businesses according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. Overall, CH2M pursues subcontracting opportunities with small, disadvantaged, LGBT, minority, veteranowned, and woman-owned enterprises for our commercial, industrial, U.S. federal, and municipal contracts. Our Supplier Diversity and Small Business Program is a success because of our employees’ commitment to providing subcontracting opportunities to small and diverse businesses to the maximum extent practical. CH2M takes pride in recognizing these individuals, projects, and subcontractors for their dedication in supporting the firm’s deliverable requirements and our clients’ socioeconomic initiatives. For 2015, the Supplier Diversity and Small Business Program recognizes the hard work and dedication of the following employees and projects or programs: • Two employee recognition awards (for program and project managers and contract and subcontract administrators) recognize employees that provide small business opportunities for subcontracting, nurturing relationships, and enhancing small and diverse businesses’ skills to compete for larger scopes of work: − Advocate of the Year Award – Program/Project Manager: Sielen Namdar − Advocate of the Year Award – Prime Contract/Subcontract Administrator: Michelle Bell • Three levels of project or program recognition reward project teams for meeting or exceeding their contractual small and diverse business subcontracting goal requirements: – Diamond Award—Meets or exceeds all small and diverse business subcontracting goals (presented to 14 projects or programs for clients such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army Fort Campbell, U.S. Navy, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Association, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Science Foundation, the EPA, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Air National Guard, and Pacific Gas & Electric Company) 5-6 5 OUR PARTNERS – Platinum Award—Meets or exceeds all but one small and diverse business subset subcontracting goal (presented to four projects or programs for the U.S. Marine Corps, the EPA, the U.S. Army, and the CH2M HILL Plateau Remediation Company) – Administrator’s Award—Various circumstances prevent meeting the overall small and diverse business criteria, but small and diverse business use performance is still exemplary (presented to one project: the Philadelphia International Airport Capitalization Enhancement Program) CH2M also participates in the U.S. Small Business Administration’s awards program to recognize our great subcontractors. The U.S. Small Business Administration’s Small Business Subcontractor of the Year awards program allows large business contractors, such as CH2M, to nominate its best and brightest small business subcontractors for national recognition. Since 1996, CH2M has nominated 42 small business subcontractors for this award. We also maintain strong mentor-protégé relationships with minority and woman businesses under the U.S. Department of Energy, EPA, and U.S. Small Business Administration programs. We participate in more than 15 small business networking events each year. 5-7 This page intentionally left blank. Engaging Our Communities 6.1 Supporting Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure in Rwanda For the 900 million people worldwide who lack basic transportation infrastructure, commuting realities can be challenging and even hazardous. Completing tasks of daily life—walking to school, going to the market to buy groceries or sell goods, commuting to jobs—becomes dangerous or impossible, especially during the rainy season. According to the Rural Access Index, 48 percent of the population in densely populated Rwanda lacks safe, adequate access to transport. Rwanda is one of the countries where CH2M employees are investing their engineering ingenuity, time, and talent to build sustainable communities in the developing world. In June 2015, we sent 11 What if this were your commute? Local villagers in employee volunteers from 7 different countries Gasabo-Gasura, Rwanda, undertake a dangerous river to Gasabo-Gasura, Rwanda, to build a 45-metercrossing over a makeshift log bridge long suspension bridge in 12 days, working with our partner Bridges to Prosperity and the local community. “About 300 sites across the country should be bridged, so one of the main goals is We are so grateful for the to bring up the capacity of the local staff, so they can finish the job,” incredible support of said Ben Cook from Boston. “So we spent a lot of time trying to share CH2M, and proud of what all the knowledge we could, but then at the same time, I also learned a we've been able to lot from them.” accomplish together in service of safe access to Since formalizing our partnership with Bridges to Prosperity through a education, healthcare, and US$100,000 grant from the CH2M Foundation in 2014, more than economic opportunities 30 employee volunteers have built footbridges in Panama, Nicaragua, for so many people. and Rwanda, providing more than 2,000 community members with —Avery Bang, CEO of safe crossings to access schools, health clinics, and commercial Bridges to Prosperity markets. Bridges to Prosperity’s research shows that building a footbridge in a rural community leads to an 18 percent increase in women who are employed, a 24 percent increase in healthcare treatment, and a boost in school enrollment by 12 percent. “What’s unique about our partnership with Bridges to Prosperity is that it gives our employees an opportunity to use their engineering skills in a real, tangible way while making a difference in two communities where footbridges will literally change their way of life,” says CH2M Foundation Executive Director Ellen Sandberg. The new bridge enables 1,000 residents to cross the Karuruma River, a volatile waterway that prevents farmers from getting crops to market in the rainy season and proves dangerous for children and families traveling to nearby healthcare clinics and schools. Watch the bridge being built and erected in this video, and read inspiring stories by employee volunteers in the CH2M Foundation blog. 6-1 6 ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES Some of our most memorable clients pay us in smiles, teamwork, and gratitude rather than money. “I don’t think I’ve ever worked this hard in my life,” said Jamie Mapp from Chicago. “Working alongside the people who will be using this bridge is an amazing feeling.” The Gasura Suspension Bridge is a perfect example of how nonprofits, businesses, and communities can come together to create real change in the developing world,” said Avery Bang, CEO of Bridges to Prosperity. “From the resources that helped to make our work in Rwanda possible, to the countless hours that employee volunteers dedicated to working alongside our staff and local community members to complete Gasura Villagers celebrate the new footbridge that CH2M project, we are so grateful for the incredible support of helped build, enabling residents to cross the often dangerous Karuruma River CH2M, and proud of what we've been able to accomplish together in service of safe access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for so many people. After the Rwanda bridge build, another In addition to Bridges to Prosperity, two of our other team of CH2M volunteers headed to strategic partners are making tremendous contributions Rancheria, a rural community in Muy, to building sustainable communities in Rwanda. We have Matagalpa, to live and work for 2 weeks. been working with Engineers Without Borders USA and The volunteer team constructed a Water For People since their inception. Back in 2012, 50-meter-long suspension bridge that water engineer Diana Frost from Calgary, Alberta, was allows residents to cross the one of our first employees to travel to Rwanda as a Campasagüa River. This bridge gives a volunteer, on a Water For People trip. By partnering with community of 350 people access to the Rwandan government, Water For People has helped schools, medical services, create improved access to water supply for almost 60,000 transportation, city services, and people. The organization is implementing sustainable markets to sell their produce or water system management, sanitation services, and purchase goods and food for their maintenance and technical support to ensure that families. systems built today last well into the future. 6.2 CH2M Foundation and Giving Ever since the CH2M Foundation was relaunched in 2013 as a strategic global funder in STEM education, sustainable communities, and employee engagement, the impact of our philanthropy is being felt across the world. Now more than ever, the foundation is committed to deeper, longer partnerships, enabled by a cadre of talented employee volunteers who promote human progress by turning challenge into opportunity. We manage charitable giving through strategic partnerships with organizations in our operating countries that develop sustainable communities; promote STEM education; and foster employee engagement. Construction of a 45-meter-long pedestrian On September 25, 2015, 193 world leaders committed to the footbridge to serve the residents of La Conga, Panama; this bridge was built by 11 CH2M Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – the Global Goals to employee volunteers, in collaboration with end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and Bridges to Prosperity and the residents of La Conga. 6-2 6 ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES address climate change. In the same year, IMPACT 2030 was established as a global private sector-led collaboration to mobilize employee volunteers to advance the achievement of the SDGs. CH2M is a proud “Collaborating Partner” and joins many of our key clients in this 15-year effort to harness the power of our passionate workforce to make positive changes through donating our time and talent on behalf of the SDGs. In 2015, the foundation embarked on a new challenge to increase the number of employees engaged directly in STEM education programs. It did so through the firm’s already existing employee network groups, which represent the depth and breadth of CH2M’s commitment to diversity, equality, and inclusion. Three of the groups representing African-Americans (Harambee), Hispanics (Enlace), and Junior and Mid-Level Professionals (JuMP) from the Environment and Nuclear Business Group each selected a strategic nonprofit STEM education partner. The partner then received a financial grant from the foundation. The employees worked all year to carry out programs that inspired the next generation of socially and environmentally responsible leaders. This initiative led to deeper relationships between our employees and STEM education providers, and also created hundreds of new champions of the foundation’s goals within the company. As always, our passion for building lasting, life-changing infrastructure continues to be demonstrated through our support of our three strategic partners that provide access to clean water and develop sustainable communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America: Water For People; Engineers Without Borders USA; and Bridges to Prosperity. Together, these groups improve the lives of millions of people each year by providing access to clean water; building bridges that link communities to education, health care facilities, and markets; and providing energy to power schools and health clinics. We appreciate the passion that our employees bring to work every day and the spirit of service they demonstrate as community volunteers. Through the foundation’s Travel Grants Program, dozens of employees went to Africa, Asia, and Latin America to lend their technical expertise on critical infrastructure projects sponsored by Bridges to Prosperity, Water For People, and Engineers Without Borders USA. The foundation’s Board of Directors, which includes employees from around the world, is honored to be entrusted with funding from CH2M and is mindful about putting it to use in the most beneficial and strategic ways. In the coming years, the foundation’s impact will grow as CH2M continues to meet the challenges of our increasingly complex world. 6-3 6 ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES 6.2.1 STEM Education The two most critical ingredients for an effective STEM initiative are students and teachers. The magic happens when both are empowered with the tools to succeed. CH2M supports innovative programs to inspire students and enable teachers around the world. 6.2.1.1 Inspiring Students Founded by a professor and three of his students, CH2M has a long-standing passion for supporting innovative education programs. Students of all ages receive support from CH2M to study STEM because these topics are widely recognized as critical skillsets in solving the challenges facing our planet in the 21st century. We focus Summer Engineering Experience for Kids (SEEK) on encouraging students through the STEM pipeline by program in Denver, Colorado preparing young people for future workforce requirements at each level of schooling: • Elementary/primary school: We team with programs that introduce students to the fun and diverse world of STEM. One such program is the Summer Engineering Experience for Kids (SEEK) program in Denver, a program with which we have partnered for a third consecutive year. Over a 3week period, 300 kids in grades 3 through 5 spend Monday through Friday designing, building, testing, and troubleshooting various project toys. In the process, they develop their math and science skills. Developed by the NSBE, SEEK Denver is offered at no cost and introduces many students to a field to which they may not have had previous exposure. According to the National Science Foundation, a significant disparity persists in STEM participation among African-Americans. The program relies on up to 50 college mentors who guide the students and serve as role models. A CH2M Foundation grant helped provide stipends for the mentors who are majoring in STEM fields, reinforcing the connection between their studies to the workforce opportunities that can come their way. Another program is the Girls Inc. STEM Group in Portland, Girls Inc. STEM Group (Girl’s Group) in Oregon. CH2M scientists and engineers volunteered their Portland, Oregon, and associate mentors, time to be associate mentors to thirdthrough fifth-grade created this poster to share food waste girls as they identify and plan community service projects facts, with the overarching message of, that use the technical expertise of the mentors. In “No Thanks to Food Waste!” addition to sharing knowledge and time, the mentors facilitate positive group work experiences, collaborate on group agreements, and become female STEM role models for the girls. In 2015, the Girls Group and associate mentors explored the issue of food waste. They put their research to work through a public awareness campaign, starting with their own school cafeteria. Together, the Girls Group and the associate mentors created a poster— the girls designed characters to deliver their message, “No Thanks to Food Waste!” while the 6-4 6 ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES mentors worked to review food waste facts. Increasing awareness of reducing food waste is the first step in leading the school and the community to more sustainable ways that result in stronger and healthier environments, while reducing the community’s environmental footprint. The final poster hangs in the school cafeteria and in CH2M lunch rooms. It was shared with Portland Metro and EPA Region 9, two of CH2M’s clients, who also had a food waste reduction priority for 2015. • Middle school: When students are exposed early to what a STEM career looks like, they can make more informed decisions about their futures. Girls Inc. of Metro Denver’s Eureka! STEM program provides 8th grade girls with the opportunity to discover the doors that can open to them with a STEM education. Through a 5-year program that systematically guides 30 girls every year toward high school graduation, each individual receives summer enrichment on a college campus, exposure to role models in STEM jobs, confidence-building outdoor activities, a meaningful internship, and even an experience abroad. By the time the first cohort of girls reaches their senior year, studies show that they will be equipped to choose any number of STEM majors with confidence and experience. CH2M provided funding to pilot the program over the summer and, in 2016, will serve as cosponsor of the program, along with the Women’s Foundation of Colorado. Chairman and CEO Jacque Hinman with Girls Inc. of metro Denver’s “Eureka!” STEM program • High school: The London-based Social Mobility Foundation helps high-achieving young people from low-income backgrounds enter top professions, including engineering, business, law, and politics. A 2015 CH2M Foundation grant builds on the success of the first engineering residential program offered in August 2014. The initial grant supported one-on-one mentoring between students and engineering professionals; a free structured, 1-week, onsite work placement in our London office during summer 2014 for twenty 16and 17-year-olds; and support for skills workshops on networking, resume writing, presentations, and interviews. One of the 2014 student participants noted of her experience, “It's inspired me to want to become an engineer and made me realize that you can do anything regardless of what background you're from if you are willing to work hard enough. This whole experience has helped me a lot with understanding what I need to do to be successful.” • Young adults: Science careers offer an ever-changing landscape of opportunities for those who enjoy the excitement of inquiry and thrill of discovery. The Emirates Foundation, based in Abu Dhabi, celebrates the bright futures that science brings to young Emirati men and women through its “Think Science Competition,” held every spring in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the Abu Dhabi Education Council, and private sector partners like CH2M. The idea behind the 6-5 6 ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES competition is to encourage young people to design, develop, and build science based innovations, and apply science skills in solving practical problems. For the first time in 2015, the CH2M Foundation provided a grant for the annual science fair and dozens of CH2M employees volunteered their time throughout the 3-day event to talk with students intrigued by CH2M’s engineering feats. 6.2.1.2 Enabling Teachers When teachers are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to foster a new generation of STEM-enabled students, everyone wins. The CH2M Foundation established two new partnerships in 2014 to achieve this goal. • Teach First: Dynamic, passionate individuals are recruited from across the United Kingdom to raise the achievement, aspirations, and access to opportunity for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Its trainees join the Leadership Development Program, which involves teaching for a minimum of 2 years in a school in challenging circumstances, achieving a postgraduate certificate in education, and wider leadership skills training. Since 2002, over 5,000 teachers have been recruited, trained, and supported by Teach First—half of these to teach STEM subjects. Teach First works with universities, businesses, government, and nongovernment organizations to narrow achievement gaps and increase university graduation rates of young people from low-income areas in England and Wales. The CH2M Foundation’s grant supports high-quality STEM teachers in disadvantaged secondary schools across England and Wales by recruiting and placing up to 12 STEM teachers in classrooms to prepare 2,000 students for university placements and STEM careers. In 2015, the staff from CH2M’s Birmingham office joined with Teach First to host guest teacher sessions and a Careers Insight Day for one of Birmingham’s inner city schools, Heartlands Academy. The aim of this was to highlight opportunities available to school leaders in the coming years. The academy, located near the terminus of HS2, the proposed high-speed rail link to London, had CH2M provide guest lessons to year 12 students. These lessons provided insight into the day-to-day life of an engineer working on a major project like HS2. Organizer, CH2M’s Joanna Mole, said: “CH2M was delighted to have been involved in this important event. Coming into schools like this is fantastic, and it is so encouraging to see students and teachers get behind some of the initiatives Birmingham Council and the National High Speed Rail College are providing to help create a strong pipeline of high skilled jobs for young people in Birmingham and the West Midlands.” • Smithsonian Science Education Academy for Teachers: How did you spend your summer vacation? It’s a typical question for teachers to ask students, but what if it were reversed? That’s where the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C., enters the picture. In collaboration with other museums and units of the Smithsonian, the Smithsonian Science Education Center creates and delivers weeklong professional development academies for teachers of science. The academies bridge the gap between formal and informal science education by combining training in science content and pedagogy with behind-the-scenes experiences at a wide variety of Smithsonian units and world-class science research facilities throughout the Washington, D.C., area. Introduced to this program by the Dow Foundation, the CH2M Foundation provided funding in 2015 and 2016 to partner with Dow to send 30 teachers to the 2016 academies from California, Louisiana, and Texas. Funding from both foundations will sponsor a 2-day science symposium in 2016 in St. Charles, Louisiana, for teachers in that community who are unable to attend an event that would require a week out of town. 6.2.2 Building Sustainable Communities As the global population grows toward 9 billion by 2050, it has become increasingly important to address solutions for water, energy, infrastructure, and environmental challenges in a holistic, sustainable manner. In our strategic markets, the CH2M Foundation supports nonprofit, community6-6 6 ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES based organizations that provide access to clean water, develop sustainable communities, or protect or enhance our planet through environmental stewardship. 6.2.2.1 Bridges to Prosperity Recognizing the power of infrastructure to transform communities, the CH2M Foundation provides financial grants, skills-based volunteers, and leadership via technical advisory committees to Bridges to Prosperity. Over the past 2 years, more than 30 employee volunteers from around the world have partnered with Bridges to Prosperity to construct pedestrian suspension bridges in Panama, Rwanda, and Nicaragua, collectively providing more than 2,000 community members with safe crossing to access schools, health clinics, and commercial markets. Learn more about this robust partnership in “Supporting Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure in Rwanda.” Children crossing a CH2M-constructed pedestrian 6.2.2.2 Engineers Without Borders-USA suspension bridge in Rwanda Engineers Without Borders is building a better world through engineering projects that empower communities to meet their basic human needs and equip leaders to solve the world’s most pressing challenges. As the first corporate partner of Engineers Without Borders, beginning in 2004, the CH2M Foundation provides an annual US$100,000 grant to support Engineers Without Borders’ operating programs, helping to bring basic infrastructure solutions to developing communities in 39 countries. This work has affected more than 2.5 million lives by providing access to clean water; building bridges that link communities to education, health care facilities, and markets; and providing energy to power schools and health clinics. In 2014, we partnered to help the organization further develop its Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning program to measure the long-term sustainability of projects, an initiative that we continue to support. Since the CH2M Foundation launched the Engineers Without Borders travel grant program in 2006, the foundation has awarded 150 grants, totaling nearly US$600,000 supporting employee travel to assist on projects in 25 countries. More than 120 U.S. employees are members of local chapters implementing projects or mentoring university students. Employees have also served on Engineers Without Borders’ board and corporate leadership council. Several of our employees have volunteered their time and talents on Engineers Without Borders projects, including: • A mechanical engineer from Houston, Texas, received a travel grant from the CH2M Foundation to travel to Nicaragua as a mentor for the Rice University Engineers Without Borders chapter. The goals of the trip were to install a pump in a newly drilled well, build a concrete foundation on a large hill for a holding tank, construct piping from the well to the tank, install level switches in the tank to control the pump, and construct distribution piping from the tank to 7 Workers on a CH2M Foundation project in Nicaragua, building a locations in the community of 250 concrete foundation for a holding tank on a large hill 6-7 6 ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES residents. Side by side with community members of all ages, the students carried water buckets and sacks of dry material up a steep slope, wearing flip-flops and still carrying more. Most commonly the challenges were overcome with abundant labor, but sometimes the solution involved ingenuity. Either way, the sheer will of the community members to ensure a successful outcome ultimately made the project possible. • Stephen Clark, a project manager from Hartford, Connecticut, has been working with Engineers Without Borders’ Washington, D.C., professional chapter for the past 4 years to help a small rural community in northwest Cameroon to improve its infrastructure. During the dry season, small streams used as water sources often run dry, so Stephen and his volunteer colleagues developed a four-phase plan to construct a collection system from a spring source and convey it to the local water system through a pipeline, a storage tank, and, ultimately, to taps in the center of town and at a government school. In January 2015, his team of 4 Engineers Without Borders members left on the 3-day trip to reach the community of Mangi. Over the next 2 weeks, with help from community residents who carried sand for a mile on their heads, Stephen was able to complete construction of the collection system and spring box. The initial flow readings coming from the spring were greater than expected, even though it was during the height of the dry season. The project is far from complete, but the first trip showed the community’s Stephen Clark, CH2M project manager, constructing a commitment to the project. Not only did spring source collection system they commit to labor, but they were also able to raise 5 percent of the construction cost. • Jessie Spruill was an environmental engineering student at Georgia Tech who interned with CH2M in summer 2014. After graduating, Jessie became a full-time engineer in the Atlanta office. As an engineering student, Jessie learned about mass balances, fluid mechanics, integrals, and thermodynamic properties, but rarely did she have the opportunity to practice realworld engineering. When she first heard about Engineers Without Borders, she knew it was a unique opportunity to gain real-life experience managing an engineering project. Since May 2013, she has managed the Engineers Without Borders – Georgia Tech Uganda program, implementing a solarpowered, gravity-fed water distribution system that will provide 1,200 people with potable water. As project manager, her duties included creating budgets, managing the project team, and defining the scope of CH2M engineer Jessie Spruill with her Engineers Without work. All of these experiences provided her Borders – Georgia Tech Uganda program group with a competitive advantage among her 6-8 6 ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES peers when searching for careers. Says Jessie, “I know that the skills I acquired as Engineers Without Borders project manager made me a desirable candidate as a new hire with CH2M, and I look forward to progressing my new career.” 6.2.2.3 Water For People Born of the vision of water technology leaders at CH2M and Black & Veatch and the AWWA, Water For People helps people around the world gain and keep access to clean water. Water For People’s goal is simple: provide complete water coverage for every family, every school, and every clinic in the nine countries where they work, bringing everyone together to make a difference. We continue to be a significant sponsor of Water For People. In August, former CH2M engineer, Eleanor Allen, joined Water For People as its CEO. The next month, Water For People presented Senior Vice President and Corporate Director Elisa Speranza, who visited Rwanda on behalf of Water for People in 2013, with the Robert W. Hite Outstanding Leadership Award, for her passion and enthusiasm in advancing Water For People’s mission. In addition, in our 2015 annual workplace giving campaign, CH2M employees raised more than US$220,000, bringing us a total of US$2 million raised to enable Water For People’s mission. 6.2.3 Employee Engagement Recognizing employees for donating their time and talent and providing volunteer programs that foster pride, loyalty, and camaraderie creates strong building blocks for employee engagement at CH2M. The following examples demonstrate some of the positive impacts we can have around the world. • Employee Network Partnerships: In 2015, the foundation partnered with several of the firm’s employee network groups that selected a strategic nonprofit STEM education partner. This initiative led to deeper relationships between our employees and STEM education providers, and also created hundreds of new champions of the foundation’s goals within the company. • Gift Matching: Disaster fundraising topped the global effort as most remarkable in 2015. On April 25, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked Nepal, killing thousands and leaving infrastructure in rubble. Because of the compassionate and globally minded character of CH2M’s employees, an outcry to help those in need echoed across the company. The foundation’s employee gift-matching program is designed for just such emergencies. By setting up a dollar-for-dollar match, up to US$10,000, on all gifts to employees’ local Red Cross or Red Crescent organizations, CH2M employees in 13 countries on 6 continents donated over US$60,000 (US$50,000 from employees, with US$10,000 from the foundation). 6-9 6 ENGAGING OUR COMMUNITIES • Employee Travel: Beyond financial support, CH2M has refocused its efforts on employee-led, pro bono skilled volunteerism. In Africa, Asia, and Central America, employees from six continents have come together to build pedestrian footbridges across waterways that are impassable during rainy seasons. These efforts have saved countless lives and contribute to the economic wellbeing of villagers, now able to access marketplaces, schools, and health care facilities. Two teams of employees from CH2M’s transportation group traveled to Gasura, Rwanda, and La Rancheria, Nicaragua, to build bridges in communities that lacked safe, reliable crossings, enhancing the livelihood of thousands of residents. Seasoned volunteers for Bridges to Prosperity, Todd Wang and Mike Paddock, spent 3 weeks in the Philippines consulting With Engineers Without Borders, the CH2M team with the U.S. Navy Seabees in their celebrates completion of a bridge in Nicaragua construction of two critical footbridges and proudly partnering with an important CH2M client. In addition to the Philippines bridges, Todd Wang spent another 6 weeks in Timor Leste assisting the U.S. Navy Seabees in building two more bridges in that island nation. With Engineers Without Borders, our team celebrated completion of a bridge in Guatemala, built with students from Marquette University, who were mentored by CH2M’s Dan Salazar. Helping to ensure a safe and secure source of drinking water, CH2M’s Edgar Ortusiastigue and Olver Obagi traveled to Jinotega, Nicaragua, to provide pro bono consulting to Water For People, which needed an inventory of water resources in the vicinity. “We are helping deliver clean water to people around the world through a partnership between CH2M volunteers and local resources from WFP; we strive in building a collaborative effort through shared expertise,” says Olver. • Office Engagement: On Earth Day 2015 in San Diego, California, a small but hardworking group of employees participated in the 13th Annual Creek to Bay Clean Up as part of the I Love a Clean San Diego project.

She inherited their knacks for creative problem-solving and interests in building sustainable communities. Her father traveled the world extensively, and Jacque became fascinated with the many countries he visited. When her mother served on the local county council, Jacque recalls listening to her discuss siting and design for a new landfill. Not surprisingly, Jacque earned her bachelor's degree in civil/environmental engineering from Pennsylvania State University. During the past 31 years, Jacque has worked for the EPA and other consulting firms, but most of her career has been at CH2M. She thrives on high-profile, extremely complex projects and programs, such as the EPA Superfund Program, London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Panama Canal Expansion, and the MASDAR sustainable city in Abu Dhabi, major programs that have raised CH2M’s sustainability profile. She has held a wide variety of executive leadership positions and led CH2M’s acquisition of Halcrow Group, a UK-headquartered engineering firm with US$1 billion in annual revenue. Jacque feels that the best part of her career has been working all around the world in different cultures, while being able to count on the consistent quality and values of CH2M coworkers to deliver the best projects anywhere. She loves meeting clients who come up with creative solutions to protect our planet, and she is inspired by people who promote sustainable communities, economic growth, gender and cultural diversity, and social tolerance. In 2014, CH2M’s Board of Directors named her chair and she led us through difficult financial challenges, while following through on her commitment to communicate transparently and frequently with the firm’s employee owners. Her distinctions include being honored by WorldDenver at its International Women's Day event; being featured in STEMconnector®, a book showcasing 100 Diverse Corporate Leaders in STEM; delivering the commencement address at her alma mater, the Penn State College of Engineering; and receiving the Women Leaders in Transportation Design & Construction Council’s 2014 Glass Hammer Award on behalf of CH2M from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. Jacque is known as a leader who walks the talk. She feels a personal passion for triple bottom line sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. Her goals for the firm are market leadership, balanced growth, and client stewardship. To achieve these goals, she has prioritized sustainability, safety, quality, technology, diversity, positive employee engagement, and the highest standards of ethical behavior as drivers for CH2M’s success. Elisa Speranza, Corporate Sponsor for Sustainability Elisa Speranza is CH2M’s executive sponsor for sustainability. Elisa oversees the firm’s sustainability, innovation and technology, government relations, and community investment functions. She also serves as an elected employee-director on the company’s Board of Directors and on the Governance & Corporate Citizenship Committee. She manages several key client portfolios, is president of the CH2M Foundation, and sponsors the firm's partnerships with TNC and Encourage Capital. “At CH2M, our focus on sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and corporate citizenship reflects our clients’ priorities,” Elisa says. “It's been really gratifying to see our clients step up and make a difference, investing in innovation and working with nature to build more resilient infrastructure. We are at our 7-10 7 OUR APPROACH AND REPORT best when we're contributing to our clients' success, building thriving communities and healthy, sustainable economies and ecosystems.

Hite Outstanding Leadership Award (named in honor of longtime volunteer Robert W. Hite) for her passion and enthusiasm in advancing Water For People’s mission. The award, given annually at WEFTEC to an individual who inspires a shared vision, is forward thinking, and truly envisions a world where all people have access to safe water and sanitation facilities, celebrated Elisa’s dedication and years of leadership and service to Water For People. She also recently joined the board of directors of the U.S. Water Alliance, a national organization advancing a sustainable water future for all. She is a passionate advocate for protection of our coastal resources, particularly on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Elisa tweets about sustainability, leadership development, corporate citizenship, and being a baseball fan @ElisaSperanza. Brandy Wilson, Global Sustainability Director, LEED AP O+M Brandy Wilson truly embraces environmental stewardship and knows that there is an art to sustainability. Brandy serves as our Global Director of Sustainability, responsible for helping the firm and our clients improve sustainability performance. She also serves as program manager for our work with TNC, an innovative collaboration to transform engineering practice and incorporate nature as a partner in engineered solutions. Brandy’s career includes public outreach and technical documentation for environmental remediation projects, environmental analysis and decision processes, and sustainability framework planning for businesses. She helped start one of the firm’s first green teams in 1998, raising awareness of sustainability issues and encouraging environmental stewardship in our offices. Brandy oversees CH2M’s strategic approach to sustainability, which includes working with stakeholders to set and meet company-wide goals for sustainability, collaborating with our business units to advance sustainability objectives for clients and partners, and overseeing production of the annual Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship Report. Aligned with her work with TNC, Brandy helps integrate the value of nature in business and project planning. She also provides sustainability framework consulting and environmental communication services for clients, and publishes sustainability articles on behalf of the firm. Last year, Brandy attended the WBCSD meeting in Paris, held alongside the UN’s 21st Conference on Parties (COP21) to combat climate change. Corporations, including CH2M, stepped up in a significant way to make a difference in the negotiations, as Brandy described in “We’re Ready to Get to Work: Corporate Support Helps Close the Paris Climate Deal.” In 2014, Brandy was selected by the Corporate Eco Forum to attend the Leadership Development Challenge in Chiapas, Mexico. This experience strengthened Brandy’s commitment to green infrastructure and natural capital. “I discovered a forest acting like a sponge to preserve and protect water sources, and saw governments, nonprofits, and forprofit corporations bonding together to protect it,” said Brandy. Brandy wrote about her experience in “Chasing Water in Chiapas.” Brandy tweets about sustainability at @Brandy_M_Wilson. 7-11 7 OUR APPROACH AND REPORT Melissa Mora, Sustainability Report Manager Melissa Mora, P.E., Sustainability Report Manager, represents the new generation of sustainability experts who bring knowledge, passion, and leadership to help CH2M improve its sustainability performance.

Because Melissa believes that great ideas can come from anywhere and from anyone, in 2015 she co-led the launch of a crowdsourcing platform to engage staff worldwide in generating innovative and sustainable ideas to solve some of our clients’ most challenging problems. This kind of innovation and employee engagement continues to fuel Melissa’s entrepreneurial and inventive spirit. In 2013, Melissa completed a Water For People monitoring assignment in Cochabamba, Bolivia, where she performed household, public institutions, and water system surveys in Spanish as part of a potable water and sanitation coverage evaluation. Her work was featured in CH2M’s 2014 Sustainability and Corporate Sustainability Report. Melissa tweets about sustainability @MeliMPrada. Ellen Sandberg, Executive Director, CH2M Foundation Ellen believes that strategic giving and impact investing are the hallmarks of effective corporate philanthropy. Since 2001, Ellen has worked for three Fortune 500 companies to develop and build corporate social responsibility platforms. Her current role as executive director of the CH2M Foundation is to strengthen and promote employee community engagement and bolster the firm’s commitment to STEM-focused education programs that develop the world’s 21st century workforce and promote sustainable communities through lasting, life-changing infrastructure. Ellen played a leading role in transitioning the CH2M Foundation from a relatively small foundation in 2013, focused solely on funding grants at the university level, to a robust organization with an expanded global scope and a focus on three strategic areas. These key areas are promoting STEM education, building sustainable communities, and fostering employee engagement. “At CH2M, corporate citizenship is demonstrated in how we combine our entire portfolio of strengths, including our employees, our expertise, and our economic impact, to lay a sustainable foundation for human progress,” notes Ellen. In 2015, the CH2M Foundation championed skilled employee volunteerism and awarded nearly US$1 million to nonprofit organizations across the globe that promote STEM education and sustainable community development. Now more than ever, the foundation is committed to deeper, longer partnerships for greater impact and volunteerism opportunities for employees. Among the foundation’s strategic charitable endeavors, the strongest social impact is our support for Bridges to Prosperity, through which CH2M employees from around the world have volunteered in Panama, Nicaragua, and Rwanda to build suspension bridges for pedestrian use where no safe transportation had existed before. “This transfer of skills from CH2M engineers to the local residents means that hundreds of people have safe crossing to schools, hospitals, and jobs, and can maintain their own bridge for generations to come,” said Ellen. “The foundation is committed to promoting lasting and life-sustaining infrastructure by supporting global not-for-profit organizations that work side by side with local communities to build, maintain, and scale their critical water and transportation projects.” 7-12 7 OUR APPROACH AND REPORT William H. (Bill) Brierly, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer Bill Brierly joined CH2M in October 2012 to ensure that our ethics and compliance program has the tools and focus necessary to meet the challenges of our global growth strategy. As Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, Bill oversees our award-winning ethics and compliance programs in more than 100 countries. Bill applies his passion for lifelong learning and teaching to find creative ways to integrate his understanding of economics and the law. He brings realworld, collaborative solutions to ethical issues facing international businesses. Before joining CH2M, he served in a variety of executive roles, including as the Head of Legal Affairs at TeleTech, a publicly traded, global business process outsourcing company. “Operating at all levels of our business with ethics and integrity is central to our success at CH2M and forms the basis for our approach, not only to large-scale engineering and construction projects but also in solving day-to-day issues in the workplace,” Bill notes. From our founding in 1946 through today, CH2M has a tradition and a reputation of doing business ethically and with integrity. This tradition is captured in our Little Yellow Book, which includes several tenets on how to run an ethical and productive business. These tenets, such as “Integrity is the all-important prerequisite to employment; the person must be honest with himself and others or we have no foundation on which to build,” are woven into the fabric of our culture and guide the actions of our employees. According to Bill, “We cannot rest on our tradition of ethical business conduct; instead, we must view this tradition as foundation upon which we will continually improve our ethics program and enhance our reputation for integrity in our work and in our business practices.” Katherine Johnson, Vice President, Global HR Enterprise Services Katherine’s natural passion for people and supporting others’ successes led her to a career in talent management. She believes our 22,000 global employees are the foundation of not only our company success, but also living our commitment to social responsibility. She applies her passions toward developing the programs that strengthen the foundation of our company’s success and foster the “CH2M Way.” Katherine began her 23-year career with CH2M as a college intern and has lent her expertise to delivering strategic human resources leadership to an array of business markets, both domestically and internationally. She has also played a key role on projects, including one of the firm’s marquee programs: the Rocky Flats Closure Program, one of the firm’s strongest examples of environmental, economic, and social sustainability. As vice president of Global HR Enterprise Services, Katherine leads, plans, and delivers strategic, global HR leadership and services. She is responsible for talent acquisition and deployment, talent management and development, compensation and benefits, workforce planning and analytics, diversity, equality and inclusion, global service centers, global mobility, and HR project management offices. In 2015, her team was proud to support the SEEK program, where university mentors introduced elementary students to engineering concepts. An outreach program of the NSBE, the summer camp sponsorship reinforced CH2M’s commitment to its values of diversity, university relations, and mentoring. According to Katherine, “Our diverse and engaging employees are critical to our business success. We take pride in the investment we make in our people by establishing learning and talent as strategic differentiators for the firm.” 7-13 7 OUR APPROACH AND REPORT Valencia (Faye) Tate, Director of Global Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion In the 15 years Faye Tate has been CH2M’s Director of Global Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion, she has transformed the way the company focuses on these issues. In the past several years, Faye has helped to establish employee network groups for employees who are black, LGBT and allies, Hispanic/Latino, differently abled, women, veterans, and junior and mid-level professionals. In 2014, 150 employees representing 8 of these employee networks gathered in Denver to collaborate on diversity, equality, and inclusion. Faye has played a vital role in making CH2M a global industry leader in supporting LGBT employees. Her leadership has helped create a culture of inclusion, a strong nondiscrimination policy, and domestic partnership benefits. In fact, the firm has found its domestic partnership benefits so beneficial that representatives testified at the Colorado State Capitol on their positive impacts to company culture and the bottom line. In 2012, One Colorado honored Faye and three other individuals with “Ally Awards” for all they do to change the hearts and minds of Coloradoans. Giving back to the community is an important part of Faye’s life. She serves on the national board of directors for the Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that focuses on LGBT equality, and on several local boards of directors. In 2012, the Colorado Women’s Chamber of Commerce named Faye as one of the 25 most powerful women in Colorado, and in 2013 she received the Whitney M. Young Jr. Award from the Denver Urban League. She has received much recognition for her work in the community: as a Woman of Distinction from the Girl Scouts of America; Leadership Denver and Distinguished Community Leader and Trailblazer by the National Council of Negro Women; finalist for Frances Weimar Jacobs Award, recognizing women who are leaders in philanthropy; and the Outstanding Women in Business Award from the Colorado Black Women for Political Action. In recent years, Faye has been working with CH2M project teams and employee network groups to establish a culture of respect and tolerance on their teams. She traveled to the United Kingdom to assist with diversity, equality, and inclusion issues related to the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. In addition, she has assisted with various business development endeavors for the firm. 7.3.2 Management Systems CH2M’s safety and EMS programs (ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001) are illustrated on the following map. As mentioned in Health and Safety, our formal HSE management system is based on ANSI Z10-2012 and OHSAS 18001. We are working toward a transition to the updated ISO 14001 and 9001 standards, released in 2015, within the 3-year transition period. 7-14 7 OUR APPROACH AND REPORT 7.4 Report Profile This 2016 Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship Report focuses on activities and performance from January 1 to December 31, 2015. In addition, historical data for the past 4 years are included, as appropriate and available, to demonstrate trends. We report annually, with the most recent report issued in July 2015. As reflected in previous sustainability reports, tracking for some of our sustainability metrics extends back as far as 2003. Forward-looking statements for 2016 and beyond are provided to indicate our goals in helping create a sustainable future. No significant restatements of information from previous reports are included in this report. Neither our base years or periods have changed, nor did the nature of our business change. The scope and boundaries are noted for each aspect in the Report Index; these did not significantly change from previous reports. To determine our reporting priorities for the aspects of our organization that we directly control, we involve the employees responsible for each of those functions, such as Facilities, HR, HSE, IT, Learning & Development, Procurement, Corporate Legal, and Travel. Representatives from each of these functions meet annually to review the GRI performance indicators and industry-relevant metrics, determine if business changes have necessitated a change in reporting, and consider recent macro-scale developments and trends that might affect CH2M. We apply a ranking system and, as a group, rate each of the indicators based on relevance to employees, clients, legal issues, and impacts on the natural world and the communities where we work. We calculate each of these factors to determine an overall ranking, and this informs our goal setting and reporting strategies. Unless otherwise noted, all monetary references are in United States dollars (US$). Throughout the report, “tonne” refers to metric tons. 7-15 7 OUR APPROACH AND REPORT Our current report provides data trends for the past 4 years, where available, and is updated annually.

In some cases, we have adjusted our reporting approach to reflect more accurately CH2M’s business model and the ways we work. We have added reporting areas specific to our sector and what is material to our business and stakeholders. In all cases, we respond to the spirit of the GRI indicators and provide a transparent view of both our achievements and our shortcomings. The indicators were selected because they apply to our business in a meaningful and challenging way and represent areas where we have effects on the world.

Boundaries correspond to CH2M’s value chain, as described in Key Sustainability Impacts and Effects. The four boundaries are: • CH2M firmwide, which includes impacts from CH2M global activities • CH2M regions, which includes specific metrics reported by region, because regions provide metrics for different indicators • CH2M and suppliers, which includes impacts resulting from contracted supplier and subcontractor activities • CH2M and clients, which includes impacts resulting from project work 7.5.2.1 Economic Material Aspects External Indicators Location in Report Omissions Boundary Assurance Our Pledge: Economic DMA, Economic performance None CH2M Firmwide None Performance For competitive reasons, Our Pledge: Economic CH2M chooses not to Performance disclose wages or EC1, Economic value generated Accounting benefits publicly.
