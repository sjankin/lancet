Every year it invests a considerable fund in renovation of the streets and squares in Cherkasy as well as in social and educational institutions. In 2011 PJSC “AZOT” became a part of OSTCHEM Group DF. 2 Introduction There was the first ammonia production shop startup and the first products were manufactured 50 years ago. The enterprise half –century production history is full of striking examples of token labour achievements, purposeful collective hard work and remarkable success. The chemists working in the period of construction, startup and establishment of the plant passed on the gained traditions, competence and experience to next generations. The key to success was in their common goal, high professional level and good faith. Today PJSC “AZOT” (Cherkasy) is a part of OSTCHEM Group DF holding company and one of the most powerful producers of mineral fertilizers in Ukraine as well as a supplier of high-quality products to the inner market. Concerted actions of experts allow to keep these standards. It is the today’s generation of chemists who is responsible for maintenance and strengthening of the enterprise positive image, implementation of energyefficient technologies and target markets development. Our enterprise success is a guaranty of social and economic welfare of Cherkasy region and the whole country. In the framework of corporate social responsibility we are able to realize our projects that cover different life spheres in the district region ranging from regional development and education to ecology and cultural diplomacy.

Having been built at high tempo (less than three years) the enterprise began developing actively. In 1968 the urea production site was put into operation at the enterprise. At the beginning of 1970 the shops producing liquid ammonia, non concentrated nitric acid and ammonium nitrate started operating. During the following two years manufacturing capacities on non concentrated nitric acid and ammonium nitrate were doubled. In May 1973 the first millionth tonne of urea and the next month the first millionth tonne of liquid ammonia were produced at the plant. Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant Construction (the 1930s) 8 History By the mid-1970s the formation process of main The 1990s period was the most difficult in the production capacities had almost been completed Association’s history. Settled economic contacts and in 1975 Cherkasy chemical plant became Cherkasy were ruined and the approach to business was being Production Association “Azot”. changed. Owing to a joint stock company formation in 1995 JSC “Azot” (Cherkasy) managed to keep its Being “production association” the plant changed qualified personnel and did not allow production volume its development vector from quantity to quality. In 1967 to decrease. industrial and research site of ion-exchanging production started operating at the plant. It was the most advanced Joining OSTCHEM Group DF in 2011 gave Cherkasy site in the USSR that gathered the leading scientific and chemical industry specialists new perspectives in both technical experts in the industry. This contributes to the equipment modernizations and production capacities new products launching as well as modern manufacturing rising. technologies and equipment implementation.
