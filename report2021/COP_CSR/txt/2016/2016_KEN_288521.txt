IFRIC 21 IFRIC 21 addresses the issue as to when to recognise a liability to pay a levy imposed by a government. Levies The Interpretation defines a levy, and specifies that the obligating event that gives rise to the liability is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by legislation. The Interpretation provides guidance on how different levy arrangements should be accounted for, in particular, it clarifies that neither economic compulsion nor the going concern basis of financial statements preparation implies that an entity has a present obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period. The application of this Interpretation has had no material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the Company’s financial statements. 68 THE KENYA POWER AND LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014/2015 THE KENYA POWER AND LIGHTING COMPANY LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014/2015 69 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (Continued) 2) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (Continued) iii) Relevant new and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective for the year ended 30 June 2015 (Continued) Amendments The amendments to IAS 36 remove the requirement to disclose the recoverable amount of a cash-generating to IAS 36 unit (CGU) to which goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives had been allocated when Recoverable there has been no impairment or reversal of impairment of the related CGU.
