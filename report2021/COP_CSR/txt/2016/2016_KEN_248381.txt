METSEC supports and respects the protection of internationally recognized human rights within its sphere of influence and ensures that it is not complicit in human rights abuses. METSEC Social Charter and METSEC Code of Ethics Metsec Cables Ltd Social Charter applies directly to all Metsec Operations. Ensuring employee and human rights as well as assuming social responsibility have always been integral elements of our corporate policy. In the METSEC Social Charter, the organization commits to respecting internationally recognised human rights and to support their observance. We also encourage our business partners to respect this declaration in their own corporate policies. We regard this as a beneficial basis for reciprocal business relationships. In 2014, METSEC also introduced its own Code of Ethics. This Code of Ethics is binding for all METSEC employees of the Organization and has been made accessible to every employee. The Code of Ethics describes in unequivocal terms the values and conditions of responsible and integral behaviour that have always guided METSEC. It is essential that METSEC employees act in compliance with the internal regulations and the statutory regulations of the legal system that applies to them. Courses on METSEC Code of Ethics compliance The training courses on the METSEC Code of Ethics have been held in both English and Kiswahili. With these courses, METSEC can ensure that the employees trained on them are aware of the particular importance of protecting international human rights and can act accordingly. Additional clauses in all T&Cs further obligate all of METSEC’s suppliers to observe the protection of human rights. Human rights UN Global Compact 7 Health and safety at work Acting sustainably ensures our company’s future.

Acting in a safety-conscious manner is part of every employee’s job. Compliance with all legal obligations on safety at work and other requirements is the basis for our activities and the applicable national standards are minimum requirements in this respect. METSEC undertakes to observe all pertinent laws and directives on safety at work as well as internal rules of conduct. Conflict minerals As a manufacturer, METSEC does not knowingly purchase materials containing conflict minerals. We are committed to further developing and managing the processes that we use to inform our suppliers that we expect them to supply us with “conflict-free” materials.

METSEC is committed to providing a working environment for its employees that is free of discrimination in both employment and occupation, and in which there is freedom of association. The right to collective bargaining is effectively recognised. METSEC strictly rejects child and all forms of forced labour. These principles are codified in the METSEC Social Charter. Measures Part of the annual Control Self Assessment of managers pertaining to METSEC’s Social Charter involves confirming at all of the branches that all employees are of at least the minimum age under local law and are at least 15 years old. The Control Self Assessment also proves that there is no discrimination when employing new staff or in the employment conditions. Furthermore, breaches of these principles require Human Resource Reporting and can also be reported directly to our Chief Compliance Officer via our internal compliance process. In addition, the Internal Audit department checks this on a random basis as a separate control factor of our Internal Control System (ICS). We received no reports of any breaches of this kind in 2015. Supply chain management In order to apply the principles of the UN Global Compact in everyday work, it is of great importance to METSEC that social responsibility is also taken into account in the context of supply relationships. This applies not only within METSEC, but also to suppliers’ operations and for the Company in general. Since 2014, our Wiring Systems Division has therefore been using a supplier self-audit to check potential suppliers in the selection process in accordance with the principles of the UN Global Compact. The supplier will receive approval to supply only if either the METSEC Social Charter and the Code of Ethics or the principles of the UN Global Compact are accepted. In addition to our Social Charter, which suppliers were already required to accept in the past as part of our General Terms and Conditions, the principles of the UN Global Compact have also been adopted in our T&Cs. Here we draw express attention to the fact that, in the event of any serious or repeated breach of the principles as detailed in the T&Cs, METSEC is entitled to terminate the supply relationship without notice.

METSEC supports protection of the environment with a precautionary approach and has several ongoing initiatives to promote greater awareness of responsibility for the environment. We therefore encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. METSEC regards environmental protection as a primary corporate objective. Our environmental management is geared to keeping the impact of all our processes on nature as minor as possible. The principles of our environmental policy also play a role in the selection of our suppliers. Initiatives GREEN TECHNOLOGY At METSEC, this concept covers all products, system solutions and services that make the use of energy more efficient and easier on resources, thereby reducing emissions and pollution of the environment. Market segment Examples of applications for METSEC products Environmentally friendly power • Solar energy (e.g. photovoltaic installations and solar thermal energy plants) generation and storage • Geothermal (e.g. Geothermal plants at Olkaria) • Windpower (e.g. wind power farms) Energy efficiency • Measurement and control technology to reduce energy consumption • Energy-efficient automation and drive technology Raw materials and materials efficiency • Measurement and control technology to prevent waste • Lightweight materials and components Recycling management • Waste separation and disposal plants • Recycling (plastics recycling plants) Sustainable water management • Water treatment, distribution, supply and cleaning plants • Household appliances with high water consumption efficiency (eg Instant showers) Sustainable mobility • Charging cables and infrastructure • Rolling stock engineering Core markets Environmental protection UN Global Compact 11 Fields of application for Green Technology In 2015, METSEC further extended its product portfolio for Green Technology.  Solar Energy Products  LED Lighting Sales Report 2013 2014 2015 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 LED Solar Instant Showers Conserving natural resources METSEC endeavours everywhere to reduce energy consumption and thereby CO2 emissions. Both Divisions run environmental management systems and multifaceted environmental protection activities, which are adapted to the respective requirements of their activities. Given the intensive use of electricity in our Wire & Cable Solutions Division, in 2014 we committed to implementing at least one project to increase energy efficiency. As a result, we saw considerable savings being made in terms of energy and cost in their production processes in 2015. A new guide to considering energy efficiency when acquiring production equipment and technical infrastructure is applicable across the Division and will also help reduce our energy consumption in the future. Furthermore an energy management system complying with ISO 50001 is currently being considered for adoption. 12 Energy consumption Energy consumption within the Group could be reduced by 20 percent by 2017. This is because we have installed PV Solar Panels on our rooftop, and hence generate our own power. We are also in the process of retrofitting our conventional lights with LED lights. Energy Consumption 2015 2014 2013 1,250,000.00 1,300,000.00 1,350,000.00 1,400,000.00 1,450,000.00 1,500,000.00 1,550,000.00 Recycling METSEC participates in the recycling initiatives .Due to our use of PVC, which is 80 percent recyclable material, as one of the main element in our products, METSEC has an ideal starting position in terms of recycling.

Zero tolerance for corruption – new guidelines METSEC’s management takes a clear stance against corruption zero tolerance). The METSEC Code of Ethics clearly reflects our anti-corruption mindset. From 2015, we will continue to develop the Code of Ethics and focus on preventing corruption by introducing a specific Group guideline “Anti-corruption”. We are also planning to write a detailed audit process for the particularly high-risk group “Business Partners”, which includes commercial agents, intermediary companies and agencies. In addition, a guideline for gifts & hospitality will provide clear regulations for the granting and accepting of gifts, invitations to business meals and invitations to events. The guidelines have been reviewed by an external law firm. Employee training – controls METSEC has been providing e-learning training on prevention of corruption to all its managers in all management tiers and further employee groups (e.g. Purchasing, Sales) for several years. 100% of METSEC employees have been trained so far. We have now planned a series of classroom training sessions and videos to present and explain the regulations in the new guidelines. All METSEC managers must submit a Declaration of Undertakings every year. This means they are regularly reminded of their managerial responsibility to combat corruption. (Compliance) audits assess whether compliance guidelines are being adhered to.
