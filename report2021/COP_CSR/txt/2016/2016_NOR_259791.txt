Statkraft’s 120th anniversary was kicked off in June 2015 with more than 800 guests from around the world gathering at the Norwegian Opera and Ballet in Oslo. The anniversary was then duly celebrated throughout Statkraft's organisation, as seen here from Oslo, London in the UK, Sauda, Cheves in Peru and Istanbul in Turkey. Letter from the CEO The development of supply and demand in the world’s energy markets has strongly affected prices through 2015. The oil price has plummeted from a level of around 100 USD per barrel in 2014 to below 40 USD per barrel at year-end 2015. This has impacted prices downwards on other fuels such as coal and gas, which contributed to pull down power prices in the continental power market. The development has also influenced the Nordic power market, already significantly affected by strong hydrology and a growing power surplus. Nordic power prices were as a result on their lowest level in 15 years. The market development has led to declining revenues and The Norwegian Parliament decided in December 2015 to impairments for many European energy companies, including increase its dividend expectations from Statkraft in the coming Statkraft. Statkraft is nevertheless uniquely placed with a low years. Together with the decline in market prices, this led to a cost position, world class assets and strong competence within revised strategy and a reduced investment plan. As a result, energy management, operation and maintenance. In addition, Statkraft is now entering a phase with consolidation and we have a solid portfolio of long term contracts in the Nordics targeted growth. Statkraft will in the short term prioritize and an increasing share of contracted revenues in growth investments to refurbishments and maintenance of Nordic markets outside Europe that contributes to stabilize our cash hydropower plants, 1000 MW onshore wind power in Centralflow. Norway, some international hydropower projects, expansions of existing district heating systems and development of new New disruptive technologies drive the development within a low capital business models. wide range of industries, including the energy sector. oing forward we see deployment of more renewable capacity. Statkraft is a robust company with a strong strategic position There is also increased momentum in distributed energy. and a competent workforce. We will strengthen the focus on In order to benefit from this development, Statkraft will cost efficiency in all operations and continue to adapt the continue to explore and develop low capital business models organization and activities to the market opportunities and our in a transforming market. financial capacity. We will continue to deliver what the world needs: Pure energy. In Paris, the world’s political leaders agreed to keep global temperature increase well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. This ambition needs to be followed up with concrete actions all over the world. Norway has a better starting position than most countries, through political stability, a highly educated workforce, an advanced economy and an almost entirely renewable power system. Increased electrification and increased use of biofuels in the transport Christian Rynning-Tønnesen sector are central to further decarbonizing the Norwegian President and CEO energy consumption. This will give opportunities for Statkraft. STATKRAFT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 6 Statkraft in facts and figures Statkraft in facts and figures shows that the Group delivered robust results from operations despite a challenging market situation. Acquisitions in Chile and Brazil, new production capacity and significant contribution from market activities helped to partially offset the negative effects from lower power prices and decreased production in the Nordics. Statkraft invested more than NOK 13 billion in 2015. More than a half of this was in new generating capacity. With a total production of 56.3 TWh, Statkraft is the second largest producer of electric power in the Nordics and Europe’s largest supplier of renewable energy. Power generation Statkraft’s production is determined by production capacity, demand, access to resources (hydrological balance and wind), 56.3 spark spread (margin between power and gas price) and energy management. In 2015 the Group’s power production TWh totalled 56.3 TWh and 1.1 TWh of district heating. This represents an increase of 0.3 TWh and 0.1 TWh respectively compared to year 2014. Serious environmental incidents Injuries 0 5.9 per million hours worked There were no serious environmental incidents in the Group in There were no fatal accidents in Statkraft in 2015, but 39 of 2015. However, 228 minor environmental incidents were the registered accidents and near-misses were categorised as registered. Most of these were related to short-term breaches serious incidents. The indicator for total recordable injuries of river management regulations and minor oil spills. Reported (TRI) per million hours worked was 5.9 in 2015.

Total production was 144.7 TWh in Norway and 393.8 TWh in the Nordic region, an increase of 2% in Statkraft’s production is determined by production capacity, both markets compared with 2014. Norway had a net export of demand, access to resources (hydrological balance and wind), power corresponding to about 10% of production, while the Nordic spark spread (margin between power and gas price) and energy region overall had a net export of about 4%. management. At the end of 2015, the consolidated installed capacity (the capacity that Statkraft fully consolidates in the Other power markets accounts) was 16 918 MW, with hydropower contributing The power prices in Turkey are mainly determined by the gas 13 630 MW, gas power 2600 MW, wind power 647 MW and bio price, as gas-fired generation accounts for almost half of the power 40 MW. Consolidated installed capacity for district heating country’s power production, as well as the hydrological conditions was 840 MW. Statkraft also has ownership interests in associated in the country. The average spot price (base) was 46 EUR/MWh, companies and joint operations with production capacity, and, a decline of 19% from the preceding year. The decline was 16% in overall, the Group has ownership interests in power plants with a local currency. total installed capacity of 18 471 MW power production and 794 MW district heating (Statkraft’s share of direct and indirect Power prices in India are still relatively low, about 50 USD/MWh, ownership). mainly due to substantial growth in new thermal capacity and generally lower consumption growth in recent years. In Peru, The demand for power varies throughout the day and year, and prices are low in the spot market, but Statkraft has entered into the power markets are dependent on the capacity that can be several contracts with different maturities at prices above the spot adjusted according to the demand. Statkraft has a large prices. In Chile, the hydrology situation has improved after several percentage of flexible production capacity, and combined with dry years in a row. Increasing penetration of solar and wind extensive analysis and production expertise, this contributes to power, grid congestions and lower fuel price levels have pushed consistent, sound management of the Group’s water resources. average spot price levels for the Central Interconnected System The Group has an advanced energy management process and down to about 80 USD/MWh. In Brazil, improved inflow and lower aims to have production capacity available in periods with high demand growth (impact from the economic recession) have demand. Statkraft’s large reservoir capacity with a combination of resulted in lower spot price levels compared with 2014. The seasonal and multiple-year reservoirs enables the Group to manage the water resources in a perspective spanning more than one year. Accordingly, production can be kept high in peak price periods, but can be kept lower in low-price periods. In 2015, Statkraft held back production due to the low prices. The Nordic hydrological resource situation was relatively robust throughout the year and at year-end (week 52) the overall reservoir water levels in the Nordic region were 118% of the normal level. This corresponded to 98 TWh, which is 81% of the maximum reservoir capacity of 121 TWh. Statkraft’s reservoir levels were somewhat higher than this due to relatively low Norwegian hydropower production in 2015. In 2015, the Group’s power production totalled 56.3 TWh (56.0 TWh), plus 1.1 TWh of district heating (1.0 TWh). Hydropower production totalled 53.1 TWh, which was on a par with 2014. Wind power production increased by 43% from the preceding year as a result of new production capacity. The market situation in Europe resulted in only marginal power production at Statkraft’s gas power plants. volume produced by the Brazilian assets is mainly sold on longer term PPAs through the regulated and the free market. In Nepal, Spot sales are trading of electric energy with production and power is sold through a power sales agreement with a fixed CPIphysical delivery taking place simultaneously at market price. The regulated price. price is typically stipulated for a short time interval, for example for every hour of the day. In 2015, the Group sold 31.6 TWh (33.3 Statkraft’s production TWh) in the spot market, which corresponds to 56% of the total Statkraft is the largest power producer in Norway. The Group is production (60%). the Nordic region’s second largest supplier of electric power, Europe’s largest supplier of renewable energy and one of the ten Statkraft is a major supplier to the power-intensive industry.

Most of the contract volume for Nordic industry runs until 2020. In Norway, Statkraft is required to cede a share of the power production to counties and municipalities where the power is produced, so-called concessionary power. Explained briefly, the price for this power corresponds to the average production cost, which is significantly lower than the market price for power. The concessionary power volume amounted to 6.5% of the Group’s Nordic hydropower production in 2015. 17 STATKRAFT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Statkraft’s activities Key figures consolidated operations Statkraft Nordic Continental International Wind District Industrial Other Group Group hydropower energy and hydropower power heating ownership activities items trading Power production Installed capacity (MW) 5) 16 918 11 175 2 951 878 563 1 342 8 1), 2), 3) 2) 1), 2), 3) 2), 4) Production (TWh) 5) 56.3 43.5 1.1 3.6 2.2 5.5 0.4 District heating Installed capacity (MW) 840 702 138 4) Production (GWh) 1 055 967 88 End-user sales Energy delivered, through grid to end-user (TWh) 5.7 5.7 Volume delivered, to electricity customers (TWh) 13.3 13.3 Income statement (NOK mill.)

Financial performance The segment’s underlying EBITDA Statkraft purchased 100% of the shares in Södra Cell Tofte and continued to grow on the back of good operations in 2015 and established the biofuel company Silva Green Fuel in ended at NOK 212 million, a growth of 40% compared with cooperation with Södra Skogägarna Ekonomisk Förening 2014. The improvement was primarily due to better price and (Swedish forest owner association). higher volume on waste handling, high utilisation of base load, high availability and good fuel mix. Reduced costs and limited New segment structure from 2016 use of peak load contributed further to the improvement. The Group has adopted a new segment structure from 1 January 2016. The new segments are European flexible Industrial ownership generation, Market operations, International hydropower, Wind Industrial ownership includes management and development of power, District heating and Industrial ownership. Areas not Norwegian shareholdings, and includes the companies Skagerak shown as separate segments are presented under Other Energi, Fjordkraft, BKK, Istad and Agder Energi. The first two activities. The new segment structure is aligned with the companies are included in the consolidated financial statements, strategic initiatives and the new internal management reporting while the other three companies are reported as associated for the purpose of performance assessment and resource companies. Skagerak Energi’s activities are concentrated around allocation. the production of power, district heating operations, distribution grid operations, electrical entrepreneur activities and natural gas distribution. Fjordkraft’s activities are concentrated around the sale of electricity to private individuals and companies. Important events in 2015 Skagerak Energi sold 51% of Skagerak Elektro to the Telemark Group. BKK entered into a 10-year power sales agreement with Hydro, with an agreed delivery of 500 GWh per year for the period 2021-2030. BKK and co-operating companies entered into contracts for the procurement of equipment and installation services for their automatic metering and control system projects covering 700 000 customers. Skagerak Nett has entered into similar contracts for their automatic metering project. Financial performance The segment’s underlying EBITDA of NOK 1336 million was slightly lower than in 2014. The decline was primarily due to significantly lower power prices and slightly lower spot production. The decline was partly offset by higher contribution from end user business and long-term contracts. The share of profit from associates and joint ventures amounted to NOK 835 million (NOK 535 million), mainly related to BKK and Agder Energi. The increase compared with 2014 was primarily related to positive unrealised value changes from energy contracts in Agder Energi. Gain of NOK 108 million for BKK and Agder Energi from the sale of Småkraft also contributed positively. The 2014 figures included gains of NOK 116 million from the sale of two subsidiaries in Istad. 21 STATKRAFT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Financial performance7 operating profit.

For Statkraft, this is expected to apply if the STATKRAFT AS participants are not the sole off-takers of the production and not responsible for the obligation held by the entity. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Joint ventures Joint ventures are companies or entities where Statkraft has Below is a description of the most important accounting policies used in the joint control with one or several other investors. Joint ventures is a type of preparation of the consolidated accounts. These policies have been used in joint arrangements which have a legal form separating the participants from the same manner in all presented periods, unless otherwise stated. The the assets and liabilities of the company so that the obligations are limited to consolidated accounts have been prepared on the basis of the historical cost the capital contribution and the returns correspond to the participant’s share principle, with the exception of certain financial instruments and derivatives of the profit. In a joint venture company, decisions related to relevant activities measured at fair value on the balance sheet date. must be unanimous between participants which have joint control. Statkraft classifies its investments based on an analysis of the degree of control and CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Historical cost Historical cost is generally based on fair value of the the underlying facts. This includes an assessment of voting rights, ownership consideration given when acquiring assets and services. structure and the relative strength, purchase and sale rights controlled by Statkraft and other shareholders. Each individual investment is assessed. Fair value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an Upon changes in underlying facts and circumstances, a new assessment asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market must be made as to whether this is still a joint venture. The Group’s share of participants at the measurement date. The measurement of fair value is not the companies’ profit/loss after tax, adjusted for amortisation of excess value contingent upon market prices being available or whether other valuation and any deviations from accounting policies, are presented on a separate line techniques have been applied. When determining fair value, the management in the consolidated income statement. Such investments are classified as must apply assumptions that market participants would have used in a similar non-current assets in the balance sheet and are recognised at cost price valuation. Measurement and presentation of assets and liabilities measured adjusted for the accumulated share of the companies’ profit or loss, dividends at fair value when presenting the consolidated accounts are based on these received, currency adjustments, and equity transactions. Joint ventures are policies, with the exception of measuring net realisable value in accordance recognised in the consolidated accounts using the equity method. with IAS 2 Inventories and when measuring its value in use in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Associates Associates are companies or entities where Statkraft has significant influence. Significant influence is present when one or several Consolidation principles The consolidated financial statements comprise investors do not have joint control and where significant decisions are made the financial statements of the parent company Statkraft AS and subsidiaries. through various combinations of shareholder majority. The Group’s share in A subsidiary is an investee where Statkraft, as an investor, exercises control. associates are recognised in the consolidated accounts using the equity Control is achieved by an investor being exposed to, or having rights to, method and are presented on the same financial statement line item both in variable returns as a result of ownership or agreements entered into with the the balance sheet and the profit/loss as shares in joint ventures. investee. When considering whether control exists, Statkraft evaluates equity interests, voting rights, ownership structure and relative strength, options Leased power plants Power plants that are leased to third parties are controlled by Statkraft and other shareholders and shareholder and operating recognised in accordance with the proportionate consolidation method. agreements. Each individual investment is assessed. Statkraft as an investor Leasing revenues are presented in other operating revenues, while expenses must have the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. To relating with the operations in the power plants are recorded under operating the extent that Statkraft is considered to have control over an investee where expenses. Statkraft owns less than 50 per cent, agreements must be in place which nonetheless give Statkraft control over the relevant activities which Acquisitions The acquisition method is applied in business combinations. significantly affect returns from the company invested in.

If the accounting of a business combination is incomplete at the end of the reporting period, in If necessary, the subsidiaries’ financial statements are adjusted to correlate which the transaction occurred, the Group will report preliminary values for with the Group’s accounting policies. Inter-company transactions and interthe assets and liabilities.

Correspondingly, new ceases. assets and liabilities can be recognised. The transaction date is when risk and control has been transferred and normally coincides with the completion date. Non-controlling interests are recognised either at fair value or the Joint operations Joint operations are joint arrangements where the proportionate share of the identifiable net assets and liabilities. The participants who have joint control over an entity have contractual rights to the assessment is done for each transaction.

INVESTMENTS IN 2015 The addition in 2015 of property, plant and equipment worth NOK 9160 million (excluding capitalized borrowing costs of NOK 266 million) and intangible assets worth NOK 340 million, consisted of both investments in new generating capacity, maintenance investments and other investments. Maintenance investments and other investments amounted to NOK 1970 million (NOK 2368 million in 2014). The investments primarily relate to the Nordic hydropower and Industrial ownership segments. Investments in new capacity amounted to NOK 7797 million (NOK 7525 million in 2014). The largest projects were hydropower plants in Turkey, Albania and Peru and wind farms in Sweden (onshore) and the UK (offshore). ASSETS PLEDGED AS SECURITY TO COUNTERPARTIES Statkraft has pledged property, plant and equipment as security to counterparties. Please see note 34 for more information. STATKRAFT ANNUAL REPORT 2015 72 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 23 continued IMPAIRMENT IN 2015 In 2015, property, plant and equipment are impaired by a total of NOK 3081 million, compared to NOK 1050 million in 2014. In accordance with the ordinary reporting procedures the need to impair the carrying value of an asset is reviewed quarterly. Indicators that might give rise to an impairment loss are analysed and discussed by the segments and group’s specialists. If indicators are identified, calculations will be made and if carrying value is higher than revocable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the financial statement. Analogue procedures are performed regarding reversal of earlier impairment. The Audit committee are informed of any impairment issues on a quarterly basis. Special attention is given to assets where one or more of the following situations are present:  The difference between book value and recoverable amount is minimal  Market outlook is declining, regulatory environment unclear or project execution is uncertain  Impairment loss is assessed earlier GROUP Statkraft performs an annual update of the long term market analyses for strategic and investment purpose in the markets where the company is present. This is a systematic analysis of market trends and uncertainties, and their implication on power prices and other income streams for power generating assets including support schemes. The long term marked analysis is an indication on whether an impairment loss has occurred. Calculated value in use is based on a nominal discount rate after tax of 6.6% for wind parks in Sweden. Whereas the tax effects are considered in the calculated cash flows. This means that the recoverable amount calculated are equal to the theoretical before tax model. The discount rate represents Statkrafts expectation of earnings after tax on investments in this type of technology in the relevant market. Wind parks in Sweden The combination of lower energy prices and lower el cert prices have had a significant negative impact on the future cash flow of the Swedish greenfield and operating assets. The impairment calculations show an impairment of NOK 1530 million related to the operational assets. In addition, an impairment charge of NOK 220 million is recognised related to the wind development portfolios in Sweden. The total impairment charge on wind assets in Sweden amounts to NOK STATKRAFT AS 1750 million. When calculating the expected value in use, assumptions are made relating to future revenue and cost. The estimated values in use are particularly sensitive to changes in future power prices and cost of capital. A change in the future power price of 10 % will result in approximately NOK 730 million. A change in the discount rate of one percentage point (before tax) will result in approximately NOK 500 million. Changes to these assumptions going forward may result in a change to the conclusions reached as of 31 December 2015. Power plants under construction in South East Europe At year-end the security situation in South-East Turkey and challenges related to project execution was considered an impairment indicator for the Cetin project. On 15 December 2015, Statkraft decided to suspend the majority of the construction works. The management will continue its current effort to find a sustainable solution for moving the project forward. Due to the significant uncertainties related to the outcome of these processes management has determined that it is most appropriate to recognise an impairment loss of NOK 1297 million. The figures may change as the outcome of the ongoing assessments and CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY negotiations are becoming more certain.

The fair value of interest rate swaps, as well as combined interest rate and currency swaps, is determined by discounting expected future cash flows to present value through use of observed market interest rates and quoted exchange rates from ECB. The valuation of forward currency exchange contracts is based on quoted exchange rates, from which the forward exchange rate is extrapolated. Estimated present value is subjected to a test of reasonableness against calculations made by the counterparties to the contracts. The interest rate swaps, including the interest portion of combined interest rate and currency swaps, are part of risk management and are accounted for as hedging or at the lowest value principle, depending on whether the requirements for hedge accounting are achieved.

In brief, this means that we shall deliver electricity based on environment-friendly Responsibility sources of energy, use sustainable, safe and efficient production methods, and behave in a responsible and ethical manner. This part of the annual report presents Statkraft’s work, management system and performance in the area of corporate responsibility for 2015, describing challenges and activities within areas such as environment, health and safety, human rights, labour issues and anti-corruption. Corporate We shall operate sustainably and develop our business in a way that adds value to its shareholder and the countries and local communities in which we operate. Responsibility in Statkraft In order to succeed, we must work in a structured and systematic manner on all issues relating to corporate responsibility and integrate this work in all relevant processes in the company, such as purchasing, acquisitions, project development and operation of our assets. Our corporate responsibility work is founded on internationally recognised initiatives and standards such as the UN Global Compact and IFC’s Performance Standards on Environmental & Social Sustainability. Statkraft’s fundamental principles for sustainable, ethical and socially responsible behaviour are described in Statkraft’s Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct applies to all companies in the Statkraft Group and to all individuals who work for Statkraft, regardless of location. This includes employees at all levels, board members, hired personnel, consultants and others who act on behalf of or represent Statkraft. Business partners are expected to adhere to standards that are consistent with Statkraft’s ethical requirements. The construction of the Cheves Hydropower Project in Peru was completed in 2015. Involving local society in the planning Corporate responsibility is a central and integrated part of Statkraft’s management system. of the project has been important in order to create local The management system facilitates a structured and uniform handling of the Group’s corporate acceptance and involvement. responsibility, and the system is regularly evaluated to be tailored to new expectations, business environments, and challenges. Climate and the environment Statkraft’s environmental ambition is to provide renewable, sustainable and robust climate energy solutions. 99% of the Group’s power and district heating production in 2015 was based on renewable energy sources, and new investments are now exclusively made within renewable energy. However, renewable power generation might also affect the environment. Environmental impact assessments are undertaken for all relevant business activities, and our goal is always to find environmentally responsible solutions. Statkraft established a climate research programme in 2013. The climate programme includes obtaining updated climate forecasts and facilitating unified handling of climate challenges. Health and safety In Statkraft, health and safety has the highest priority, everywhere and always. The goal is zero work-related injuries. In an effort to reach this goal, the Group works systematically to establish a value-based safety culture based on transparency and continuous improvement. The Group’s management and follow-up of health and safety are based on international good practice. Incidents with a high risk for serious consequences are investigated in a structured manner, and learnings from the incident are shared across the organisation. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 130 Security Statkraft takes a comprehensive approach to security, preparedness and crisis management and follows international good practice. In Statkraft, the umbrella term security encompasses four areas; personnel security, physical security, IT system security and information security. In 2015, overall country threat assessments have been produced for all countries with Statkraft presence or interest, and updated security risk assessments have been performed for key locations. Human rights Statkraft acknowledges its corporate responsibility to respect human rights and this is something the Group takes seriously. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights are reflected in Statkraft’s management system and project management tools. Ethics and anti-corruption Statkraft has committed to a high ethical standard and business culture, with zero tolerance for corruption. With increased activity in markets exposed to corruption, Statkraft places significant emphasis on a strong ethical business culture and on developing robust anti-corruption measures. A risk assessment and mapping of need related to improvements in relation with preventative measures in each of Statkraft’s business areas was concluded in 2015. Furthermore, a new two-year cycle of training on business ethics and anti-corruption has been rolled-out. Social issues As a power provider, we have a very long-term perspective, which emphasises the need to develop sustainable solutions. We seek to establish a regular and open dialogue on sustainability issues with host communities and other stakeholders and we facilitate such dialogue and interaction in all project development and operations. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 131 Management Follow-up and management of Statkraft’s corporate responsibility is an integrated part of the company’s management system, The Statkraft Way. of Corporate Statkraft’s fundamental principles for acting in a sustainable, ethical and Responsibility socially responsible manner are described in Statkraft’s Code of Conduct. The Statkraft Way The Statkraft Way, Statkraft’s management system, is based on the Group’s vision, values, Code of Conduct and business model. It contains both briefly formulated policies and more detailed specifications and supporting documents. Corporate responsibility is a key topic in The Statkraft Way. Statkraft shall operate in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in all countries where we have activities and adhere to internationally recognised standards and guidelines. We focus Launch of The Statkraft Way our work towards creating a work culture in accordance with our principles and which promotes November 2014 good business practice. Statkraft’s fundamental principles for acting in a sustainable, ethical and socially responsible manner are described in Statkraft’s Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct applies to all Always refer to the intranet for updated documents individuals who work for Statkraft, and Statkraft’s business partners are expected to have standards that are consistent with Statkraft’s ethical requirements. Statkraft has prepared corresponding guidelines for the Group’s suppliers. Corporate responsibility is an integrated part of Statkraft’s management system, The Statkraft Way. The management system facilitates structured and coordinated handling of the company’s corporate responsibility, and the system is regularly evaluated to adapt it to new expectations and challenges. Detailed descriptions of how to safeguard Statkraft’s corporate responsibility for different areas can be found in requirements and supporting documents. ➔➔ Statkraft’s Code of Conduct ➔➔ Group policy: Corporate responsibility and HSE ➔➔ Group policy: People, leadership and communication Statkraft is a member of the UN Global Compact and is committed to following up this initiative and its ten principles. Furthermore, Statkraft bases its conduct on internationally recognised initiatives and standards, including principles from the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and IFC’s Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability. The OECD’s guidelines present recommendations from governments to multinational companies in relation to responsible business conduct, while IFC’s standards provide guidelines for sustainable behavior throughout the value chain. Corporate responsibility throughout Corporate responsibility is a line responsibility in Statkraft. This means that each individual unit has an independent responsibility to conduct activities in a responsible manner and that follow-up of topics such as health and safety, anti-corruption, human rights and environmental impact are incorporated in relevant processes, projects and tasks in each individual unit. At Group level, Statkraft has a dedicated staff to follow-up the company’s work and performance as regards corporate responsibility on an overall level. This staff has an advisory role vis-à-vis the business units and ensures that corporate responsibility is properly discharged in the Group’s management and reporting system. Corporate social responsibility in development projects Statkraft has a model for implementing major development projects, mergers and acquisitions which ensures a unified approach to for example corporate responsibility from an early phase and through stepwise decision processes. The model’s basic principle is that each main decision must be accompanied by documented information on a number of stipulated topics, including corporate responsibility, as part of the decision basis. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 132 Emergency preparedness Emergency preparedness plans have been prepared for all operative units in the Group and focus especially on protecting life and health, avoiding negative environmental impact and securing the company’s assets. Emergency drills are held regularly on different levels in the organisation so that unexpected, serious situations will be handled in a suitable manner. Performance follow-up Statkraft has KPIs at Group level for the areas of environment and health and safety, and results are reviewed regularly in both the Corporate management and the board of directors. In addition, relevant challenges and results within all topics associated with corporate responsibility are discussed in regular Business Reviews (meetings between the CEO and each business/staff unit). In its work, the Group Audit considers to what extent the requirements and guidelines for discharging corporate responsibility have been implemented and adhered to in the organisation. This takes place through focused audits and as part of more wide-ranging efforts. Statkraft has a Group-wide reporting system for registration and follow-up of non-compliances and potential improvements. The system facilitates structured handling of measures and deadlines, analysis of causal links and learning across the organisation. Supplier follow-up Statkraft sets clear requirements for all suppliers and follows up risk topics throughout the procurement process. Statkraft’s supplier code of conduct Statkraft has developed a version of Statkraft’s Code of Conduct which is especially aimed at the Group’s suppliers. This document describes the Group’s requirements for suppliers as regards protection of the environment, human rights, labour rights and labour standards, health and safety and anti-corruption. Statkraft’s suppliers are informed about the Code of Conduct and other relevant requirements during the procurement processes and contract signing. Follow-up of suppliers Statkraft has implemented a risk based tool that identifies and follows up risk topics throughout the procurement process. The procurement process is designed to ensure the follow-up of suppliers at different stages of the process. Risk areas are identified at an early stage, and high risk areas are followed up closely throughout the procurement process. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 133 Stakeholder dialogue Statkraft communicates in an open and active manner with all those affected by our activities. Important partners in this dialogue include the owner, elected officials on all levels, employees, local communities, rights holders, customers, suppliers, local and regional authorities, voluntary organisations and the media. Dialogue with local communities and host municipalities Statkraft emphasises a direct and predictable dialogue with all host municipalities. In Norway, annual meetings are held with all host municipalities, where Statkraft provides information about ongoing and coming activities, opening up for discussion about topics important for the individual municipality. It is particularly important to provide information and ensure transparency in the early stages of development projects. In line with national licensing processes and international guidelines, Statkraft holds open meetings and hearings, providing information about development plans and topics relevant for those affected by the project. Such topics may include expropriation, future job opportunities and environmental impacts resulting from the project. Dialogue with non-profit organisations Statkraft participates in several national and international forums for the purpose of discussing and influencing energy policy. These forums include Energy Norway, Eurelectric, World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the International Hydropower Association (IHA). Statkraft also cooperates with non-profit organisations and has cooperation agreements with the Red Cross, environmental organisations such as the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, Bellona and WWF, in addition to a conference partnership with Zero. Competence and training Good corporate responsibility competence among managers and employees is an important factor for Statkraft to achieve its goals. Relevant corporate responsibility topics have been incorporated in training programmes for both new employees and managers. Introductions are given, both as regards overall requirements and individual responsibilities, and more focused training in safety requirements in the workplace, anticorruption work and environmental and social impact as a result of Statkraft’s activities. The projects sets a particular focus on health and safety training, and Statkraft has developed web-based courses that are available, and in some cases mandatory, for both employees and contractors. Efforts are particularly directed towards raising expertise in and understanding of anti-corruption work throughout the organisation. Class room trainings, anti-corruption manuals and e-learning tools are available and tailored dilemma training sessions are held when needed. Statkraft’s corporate Statkraft annually reports the most important corporate responsibility challenges facing the Group, as well as measures and performance. responsibility reporting The report is based on GRI’s recommendations Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting is based on the recommendations of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). GRI’s recommendations include both indicators for several topic areas, as well as ten reporting principles which e.g. concern identifying important topics and implementing the actual reporting process. Statkraft systematically gathers information in order to present an annual status and most important results for areas such as climate and the environment, health and safety, security, anti-corruption work and follow-up of human rights. All relevant business units report on both quantitative and qualitative indicators. We believe these indicators capture the most important aspects as regards corporate responsibility in the Group, while also taking into account reporting requirements and expectations from our stakeholders. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 134 Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting describes the most important topics and results on the Group level. More information on special topics and individual projects can be found on Statkraft’s website. Materiality analysis, ambitions and goals In 2015, Statkraft performed a materiality analysis to identify the corporate responsibility issues that are most important to the company. The analysis was based on the principles described in GRI’s Technical Protocol, and it was approved by Statkraft’s auditor (Deloitte AS). The materiality analysis included identifying key stakeholders and their most important aspects related to corporate responsibility and workshops with representatives from Statkraft’s organisation to identify the most material aspects for Statkraft. All aspects of corporate responsibility are important for Statkraft, but the analysis identified the following six aspects as most significant for Statkraft: ➔➔ Safety and safeguarding of people ➔➔ Human rights ➔➔ Water management ➔➔ Biodiversity ➔➔ Climate change mitigation, adaptation and preparedness ➔➔ Business ethics and anti-corruption Materiality assessment High Water management Safety and safeguarding Provide and promote of people renewable energy sources Biodiversity Climate change mitigation, adaption and Business ethics Importance to Statkraft’s stakeholders Labour rights and anti-corruption Economic contribution preparedness to society Human rights Landscape and land use management Local community impact Human capital Security of development Responsible supply chain employement Resource use, waste and pollution Diversity and equal opportunity Asset and information security Occupational health Production efficiency Low Importance to Statkraft High The six aspects identified as material will be given a more detailed and comprehensive review that other topics.

Systematic environmental management in line with good international practice will minimise and compensate for the negative environmental impact of the Group’s activities. Ambitions and goals In 2015, Statkraft performed a materiality analysis to identify the sustainability issues that are most important to the company and its stakeholders. Three of the issues identified were: Climate change mitigation, adaption and preparedness, Biodiversity and Water management. Ambition, goals and status for 2015 is presented below.

Statkraft has adapted regional climate models to assess probable future changes in precipitation and temperature, which affect water values and production possibilities. Operational and investment decisions are based on such assessments. Statkraft has used IPCC/UNFCCC and other scientific data as basis to decide upon one global warming scenario. This scenario is used in the Nordics to assess the effects of climate change on our assets. Outside the Nordics, our understanding of climate change effects is not so detailed. Several R&D projects have therefore focused on this issue. For non-Nordic assets we conduct hydrological impact studies and also assess future water availability to understand future implications on balancing water needs for energy production, ecosystem services and environment. Statkraft has had a strategic collaboration with the Norwegian Meteorological Institute since 2009, and is also involved in a number of R&D projects supported by the Norwegian Research Council. Statkraft also assesses and develops tools to evaluate potential greenhouse gas emissions from our hydropower reservoirs. This is done in collaboration with leading research institutes, other industry actors and industry associations such as IEA and IHA. Statkraft continuously follows national, EU and global climate policy developments to assess the possible impact on our business. We have provided direct input to policy processes in Norway and the EU, and also participated in relevant public consultations. Statkraft joined the World Bank Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition in 2014 with the goal to establish carbon pricing as the core approach to decarbonization on a global level, and participates in other international partnerships to promote international carbon markets. Statkraft established a new office in California for carbon trading in 2015 and is directly involved in various markets for carbon related products in order to contribute with product development and enhance the development of carbon markets. 2015 status on goals related to Biodiversity Statkraft acknowledges that its core business – windand hydro power – has an impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. Biodiversity issues, including red-list species and protected areas, are therefore mapped and evaluated before an investment decision is made. In project operations, Statkraft works systematically with biodiversity issues where such action is warranted. Any impacts on biodiversity defined as serious, less serious or unwanted environmental incidents are reported through Statkraft’s non-conformity system. As part of our efforts to effectively manage biodiversity issues, Statkraft has previously developed a geo-reference database for for red-listed species and critical habitats. The system is intended to act as an information database to ensure that potential impacts are followed up and evaluated systematically. The system is still a pilot, focusing on Statkraft’s Norwegian operations. Biodiversity is one of the prioritized areas for Statkraft’s environmental R&D strategy. Impacts on ecosystem services, development of new holistic tools for improved management in regulated systems, and impacts on habitat fragmentation through two way fish migration are some examples of recent R&D projects related to biodiversity. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 139 2015 status on goals related to Water management Sustainable water management and impacts from project development and operations is a central part of project leader course. Furthermore, any breach on water levels, minimum flow or self-restrictions linked to hydropeaking requirements is reported through the non-conformity system and evaluated. To further increase our knowledge and potentially reduce our impacts on the environment and use of water as a natural resource Statkraft invests in specific and selected research programs and projects, both nationally and internationally. Important R&D topics related to water management includes hydropeaking and environmental impacts and mitigation measures, technical design of hydropower operation in northern regions, climate effects on the hydropower sector and water availability, and GHG emissions from reservoirs and reservoir operation. Statkraft offers renewable Statkraft is Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy, and in 2015, over 99% of the company’s power production was based on renewable energy sources. and sustainable energy Statkraft’s ambition is to support a global transition towards a low-carbon economy solutions by offering renewable and sustainable energy solutions. In addition, all activities shall be planned and implemented in line with good international practice. Environment-friendly portfolio In 2015, over 99% of Statkraft’s power production was based on renewable energy sources, and more than 93%, or 52.7 TWh, came from hydropower. As a technology, hydropower has many advantages, including high efficiency, long lifetime and high flexibility. The large, Norwegian water reservoirs enable us to produce electricity even when there is little inflow. This flexibility is particularly important in combination with inflexible technologies, for example hydropower in combination with wind power. Development and operation of hydropower plants facilitate multiple uses of watercourses and regulation plants, Examples of such use include irrigation, water supply, transport and recreation. In addition, flood control using reservoirs is an important safety measure in many areas. Such use of our installations will in all probability be even more important in the future when we face the consequences of the climate changes. Wind power is a renewable technology with few environmental effects and almost no emissions. Power generation and district heating (Statkraft's share) TWh The tendency is towards larger turbines, higher towers and fewer turbines in each wind farm. 70 This is considered to be a positive development as regards environmental effects. 60 50 40 The Group’s non-renewable energy production includes gas-fired power and a small part of the 30 district heating production. 20 10 Gas power is by many considered a transitional technology. The technology generates carbon 0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 emissions, but the emissions are substantially lower than for coal-based power plants. Hydropower Wind power Gas power Statkraft’s gas power plants in Germany operate only as peak load producers and, like District heating hydropower, therefore contribute to flexibility in the European energy markets. Knapsack I and II are two of Europe’s most modern and efficient gas-fired power plants, but due to high gas prices, low carbon prices and large growth in inflexible power production (solar and wind power), Statkraft’s gas power production has been significantly reduced in recent years. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 140 Environmental Environmental management is an integrated part of Statkraft’s management system and covers all business units and activities. The environmental management in management system shall ensure a systematic approach to the environmental Statkraft work, with key activities being identification of environmental risk, establishment of goals and action plans, implementation of measures and follow-up of results. Statkraft’s environmental management system is based on the principles of ISO 14001:2004. Statkraft’s contractors are also subject to the Group’s environmental requirements, and these are therefore incorporated in all contracts where relevant. The Group’s development projects are planned and implemented in line with good international practice and the work is based on the IFCs Performance Standards on Environmental & Social Sustainability. In accordance with these standards, Statkraft sets requirements relating to comprehensive impact analyses and environmental follow-up plans which are updated throughout the project process. These documents are published on the projects’ websites and thereby made available to external stakeholders. External assessment of environmental performance Statkraft’s environment KPI on the Group’s score card consisted of an environmental assessment prepared by an external rating agency (Oekom Research AG). The assessment includes a broad set of criteria covering environmental management, power production and energy efficiency, and provides an understanding of how the world around us rates our efforts and in which areas we should aim to improve. The use of a rating agency also makes it possible to compare with other companies, both in our own and other industries. The 2015 assessment resulted in the rating B+, which corresponds to good international practice in the Oekom Corporate Rating. Cooperation agreements Statkraft has entered into strategic partnership agreements with the three environmental organisations Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, Bellona and WWF. The overall purpose of the agreements is to benefit from each other’s expertise and develop the best energy solutions. Environmental activities Statkraft’s core business areas are hydropower and wind power. Neither of these technologies generates significant emissions or discharges, but both cause in Statkraft interventions in ecosystems and the landscape. The objective is always to make interventions as gentle as possible, and adapt them to local conditions. Hydropower and the environment Rivers and river systems are important, both as elements of the landscape and as ecosystems. Watercourses play an important role in both droughts and floods, and also have a multi-purpose value for people in the form of recreation, transport and as water supply to households, industry and agriculture. The development and operation of hydropower plants must therefore take into account many interests. Statkraft’s goal in all activities is to achieve sustainable water management, and our environmental efforts in relation to river systems and fish are comprehensive. Examples Djupa, Hardangervidda. Statkraft is adding gravel to the river of such efforts include environmentally adapted operation of the power plants, laying down bed to improve spawning conditions for the fish. Photo: Jon Aarbakk suitable spawning and smolt growth substrate, fish restocking, egg planting, construction of fish ladders and improvement of thresholds and migration barriers. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 141 The overall objective for this work is to achieve sustainable and self-recruiting fish populations. Many of these measures are imposed by licence, but Statkraft also implements voluntary measures, often in close cooperation with landowners and local organisations. Statkraft operates two out of three Norwegian gene banks for salmon, nine fish cultivation facilities and is a large producer of stocking fish and fish eggs in Norway and Sweden. Statkraft carries out out comprehensive studies of affected river systems. In Norway, the main focus is on salmon and trout, while Sweden and Germany have seen an increasing focus on conserving eel populations. Eel are very vulnerable to turbine injuries when migrating from regulated rivers, and Statkraft is involved in several projects and has implemented various Chip which is implanted into the eels. It sends a signal to migromat when eels start to migrate. Running of the solutions to meet this challenge. In Sweden, eel are now moved downstream of power plants landside turbine can be reduced and blades can be opend manually, while in Germany a system has been developed to control turbines and stop them as wide as possible in order to facilitae migration. when the eel migrate. Overview of river systems influenced by Statkraft’s activities In Norway, the licence terms for many power plants are now under revision, aiming to update the environmental terms to current standards. Reviews are ongoing in the Tokke/Vinje, Røssåga, Folla/Vindøla, Svorka, Altevatn, Aura, Langvatn og Bjerke/Plura river systems. The EU’s Water Framework Directive is a set of regulations developed to ensure comprehensive management of European water resources based on the ecosystems. In Norway, these regulations have been incorporated into the Framework for water management (the Water Regulations). In 2015 Statkraft has worked strategically with the Water Framework Directive in order to enhance coordination of the company’s actions related to water management in Norway, Sweden and Germany. This work will continue in 2016. The following case illustrates Statkraft’s approach to environmental management in connection with hydropower: ➔➔ Ume water course, Sweden Water and environment with life and ecological quality Wind power and the environment Both onshore and offshore, Statkraft’s wind power developments are facing environmental challenges. Birds are a recurring topic, both due to the risk of birds colliding with the turbines, and because wind farms can drive certain bird species away from their natural habitats or form barriers to important migration routes. Establishing wind farms with the associated infrastructure can influence living conditions for plants and animals, particularly in the construction phase. It is therefore important to find solutions that are well adapted to the individual location, and to avoid construction activity in particularly vulnerable periods. Noise and landscape aesthetics are also topics that are carefully considered when establishing new wind farms. The wind park on Smøla. Photo: Bjørn Iuell Offshore, the impact on the marine environment is a particularly challenging topic, not least as there is currently little knowledge about the consequences for sea mammals, fish and benthic fauna. There are a lot of indications that negative effects occurr mainly in the construction phase, and that offshore wind farms may also benefit the environment in the longer term. A wind farm resting on the seabed can e.g. provide shelter for fish fry and create good growth areas for fish and other organisms. Since 2005, Statkraft has been involved in R&D activities at the Smøla wind farm to look into how white-tailed eagles and the local variety of willow ptarmigan are affected by the wind farm, and specifically what can be done to avoid collisions between birds and turbines. A doctoral thesis presented in 2014 concluded that although Statkraft’s activities in Smøla have had an effect on the white-tailed eagles’ reproductive success within and in close proximity to the wind farm, the overall population of white-tailed eagles in the area is still robust and growing. Population studies of white-tailed eagles in the Smøla area indicate that most of CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 142 the couples which previously bred inside the wind farm area have now found new territories away from the wind farm. The research that Statkraft and several partner organisations are conducting in Smøla includes using contrast paint and UV-light on the turbines and rotor blades to increase visibility and thereby reducing the risk of collisions between the birds and the turbines. This is the only project in the world where scientific tests of this kind has been performed in full scale. The results of the project are expected in 2016. The research on birds and wind power in Smøla has been ongoing for nearly ten years, resulting in a significant amount of new knowledge about the interaction between eagles and wind power. The knowledge that the research has generated The white-tailed eagle population is followed closely on Smøla. Only a few eagle couples now breed inside the is useful, not only to Statkraft, but also for other operators of onand offshore windpower. wind farm. However, this has not resulted in a noticeable decline in the number of white-tailed eagles in the area. Photo: Bjørn Iuell Other technologies and the environment Statkraft is also involved in activities using other technologies, primarily production of gas power (Germany), production of biopower (Germany), production of district heating (Norway and Sweden), grid distribution (Norway) and some gas distribution (Norway through Skagerak Energi). Gas power results in carbon and NOx emissions, and discharge of cooling water. NOx can impact air quality and contribute to overfertilisation, while discharge of cooling water can impact biodiversity in nearby river systems. Statkraft’s gas power plants are some of Europe’s most modern power plants, with high efficiency, good treatment facilities and low emission and discharge risk. They are located in industrial areas where the additional impact from our plants has little environmental impact. The link below provides an overview of energy efficiency in Statkraft’s gas power plants, district heating plants and bio power plants: Overview of energy efficiency The operation of district heating plants and bio power plants generates NOx emissions, and district heating plants also emit SOx, which can contribute to acidification of river systems. The amount of SOx emitted varies with the energy source used. Emission and discharge figures are carefully followed up to ensure that the plants comply with their licences. For district heating plants that use waste as fuel, there may also be challenges in the form of odours, and the activity generates large volumes of wasted treated as hazardous waste. Environmental challenges in connection with grid activities are primarily related to radiation from power lines and landscape impact, which in turn can change visual qualities and the opportunities for recreational activities in the area. For gas distribution, the risk lies primarily in gas leakages. This distribution is subject to detailed guidelines and controls covering environmental, health and safety risks. Statkraft and the climate Statkraft offers clean and sustainable energy solutions and in this manner supports a global transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change and global warming are among the greatest challenges of our day, and the UN Climate Panel’s fifth Assessment Report issued in 2013-2014 confirm that the global climate changes are anthropogenic. The IPCC has previously pointed out that increased use of renewable energy may be the single most important measure against climate change. Statkraft’s Climate Advisory Panel Statkraft’s activities have a very long perspective and climate change will influence both operations and business opportunities significantly, e.g. through influencing energy sources (precipitation, run-off and wind) and through changes in the political framework. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 143 In order to meet the challenges caused by climate change, Statkraft has established an internal, cross-disciplinary workgroup, Statkraft’s Climate Advisory Panel (CAP). The Climate Advisory Panel’s main mission is to coordinate the Group’s efforts in relation to climate issues, and raise the Group’s understanding of climate issues. Based on information from international processes and key climate issue forums, as well as internal analyses of the climate situation, Statkraft has chosen a specific climate scenario as a starting point for the Group’s long-term strategy work. In some locations, climate change will result in more water, in other locations less. Statkraft A broad group of scientists, business executives, NGO leaders and politicians gathered at Statkraft’s conference can contribute to dampening the effects of climate change by using its own installations for e.g. center Vang Gård in Norway to find new solutions to flood control. In dry countries, reservoirs can also be used for irrigation and water supply. climate change. Corporate Management adapted a climate policy statement in 2014 which states that Statkraft’s most important contribution in relation to climate change is contributing to the transition towards a low-carbon society and the development of a climate resilient economy. Statkraft’s most important contribution is to – in a sustainable manner – produce renewable and flexible energy which can facilitate more variable energy sources (solar and wind). Statkraft’s climate assessments are to be based on research, in-depth analysis and scientific evidence. Central to this is the IPCC assessments and the UN climate convention. Statkraft’s climate programme Statkraft’s assessments and adaptations in relation to climate changes shall be based on international expertise and recognised research results. On this background, Statkraft has established a research programme which focuses on the development of business-specific climate knowledge and will contribute to adapt the global climate models to planning and operation. The climate programme works closely with Statkraft’s Climate Advisory Panel and has two main objectives: ➔➔ understanding the physical impact of climate change and recommend possible adaptations ➔➔ contributing to development of scientific methods which can be used to consider how climate change will affect Statkraft commercially The programme will run over several years and has a budget of NOK 10 million per year. Statkraft’s emissions of greenhouse gases Most of Statkraft’s portfolio is more or less emission-free hydropower and wind power Greenhouse gas emissions Tonnes CO2 equivalents production, and the Group’s emissions of greenhouse gases are therefore relatively low. The 2,000,000 majority of the Group’s total emissions of greenhouse gases come from the gas power plants in 1,500,000 Germany. For Statkraft’s consolidated power production emissions of CO2 equivalents amounted to 313 000 million tonnes in 2014 and 257 600 million tonnes in 2015. This corresponds to a 1,000,000 relative emission of CO2 equivalents of 6 kg/MWh in 2014 and 5 kg/MWh in 2015. 500,000 The Group buys ordinary carbon quotas in the international carbon quota market to compensate 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 for greenhouse gas emissions from that part of the business that is not subject to mandatory Gas power Accidental emissions of SF₆ and halon District heating plants Fuel consumption quota schemes. This applies to emissions related to fuel consumption, business travel and Business travel any accidental emissions of the greenhouse gases halon and SF6. In 2015, the emissions from these sources amounted to 55 800 tonnes of CO2 equivalents. Emission quota and green energy trading Statkraft actively sells certified electricity from renewable sources to distribution companies that want to or are required to supply their customers with green electricity. Statkraft sources and markets these certificates under Europe-wide schemes as well as national schemes in the UK, Italy, Poland and in Norway/Sweden. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 144 Statkraft is also engaged in trading emissions worldwide. We actively trade the major carbon currencies and deal with compliance companies looking to satisfy their obligations under the European Emission Trading System (EU ETS). With new carbon markets developing worldwide, we increase focus on our international activities. Consumption, emissions, Statkraft’s activities cause only a limited extent of waste production, emissions and discharges. Data for the Group’s energy consumption, emissions and discharges and waste discharges, waste volumes and environmental incidents are reported in the corporate responsibility statement. Electricity consumption In 2015, electricity consumption in Statkraft was 1031 GWh, of which 80% was used for pumped-storage hydropower. Electricity use in the Group is certified as renewable in accordance with RECS. Local pollution Statkraft faces few challenges as regards local pollution. The greatest environmental risk is associated with oil spills from vehicles, construction equipment and production equipment. Sandefjord district heating plant was opened by CEO Routines are implemented for registration of equipment containing oil, and the use of bio oils Christian Rynning-Tønnesen in February 2015, and is one and switching to equipment with water-lubricated bearings also help reduce the risk of oil spills. of Norway’s most modern and environment-friendly plants. There were no oil spills with permanent damage to the external environment in 2015. There can be local challenges associated with noise and dust in connection with transport and construction, and we have also experienced challenges with odours and ash emissions from the district heating plants. Waste handling Statkraft’s operations generated about 61 400 tonnes of hazardous waste in 2015. More than 93 % of this was residual products from the biomass plant in Germany and the district heating plant in Trondheim, which mainly uses waste as energy source. In addition, 12 000 tonnes of other waste was generated. Statkraft goal is to separate as much as possible of the generated waste at source, and 82% of the waste (hazardous waste not included) was source separated in 2015. Environmental incidents Environmental incidents are recorded and followed up systematically throughout the Group and reported regularly to the management and board of directors. No serious environmental incidents have been registered since 2008. In 2015, 228 minor environmental incidents with little or no impact on the environment were reported. Most of them concerned short-term breaches of the river management regulations for hydropower plants and minor oil spills. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 145 Health and safety Safety is our top priority in Statkraft and our objective is zero serious injuries for our own employees as well as for contractor personnel, suppliers, partners and third parties. The desired safety culture shall permeate the entire organisation and be characterised by transparency and a desire to learn both from our own mistakes and from successful improvement measures. Ambitions and goals In 2015, Statkraft performed a materiality analysis to identify the corporate responsibility aspects that are most material to the company. One of the aspects is “Safety and safeguarding of people”, and ambitions, goals and status for 2015 are presented here. Material aspect Ambition statement Goals towards 2020 Safety and Statkraft actively ➔➔ Ensure that managers at all levels provide safety safeguarding prevents harm or leadership of people injuries to people ➔➔ Strengthen the focus on high risk activities and through a systematic preventative measures approach and a value-based safety ➔➔ Utilize a balance of leading and lagging indicators culture to measure and guide performance ➔➔ Improve processes and capabilities for security management ➔➔ Ensure that learnings from incidents are applied corporate wide Status 2015 for health and safety targets Safety considerations are firmly embedded with the company’s senior management. Identified ambitions and goals show that personnel safety has a very strong focus. The key figures for health and safety were revised in 2015 and greater attention has now been given to high-risk incidents. New, leading indicators have also been developed and will be implemented in 2016. The new indicators will measure management and employee health and safety commitment by logging relevant activities such as completed health and safety inspections, risk assessments, transfer of experience or suggested improvements that will contribute to increased safety. In December 2015, the “CEO’s HSE award” was launched. The award will contribute to improve the health and safety results. The award will recognise excellent health and safety work and good, innovative solutions that can be implemented across the Group. The first “CEO’s HSE award” will be announced in the second half of 2016. In 2015, Statkraft launched a project to develop “life saving rules” in order to strengthen the company’s focus on high-risk activities and preventive measures. The purpose of the project is to identify and implement specific safety rules for selected high-risk activities. The rules will be suitable for communication at all levels of the organisation, and will be supported by efficient tools for roll-out and follow-up. Securing of personnel is an increasing challenge for Statkraft. New personnel security requirements were introduced in 2015. The requirements include a clarification of roles and responsibilities as well as the process for assessing risk. Such assessments have been completed for key locations in 2015 and will continue in 2016. Sharing of knowledge and experiences across the organisation is essential for good health and safety performance. Sharing of good practices and learning from incidents that have occurred are important for the organisation to improve its performance. Lessons learned from all serious incidents are made available to the organisation and discussed in the Group’s health and safety network. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 146 Adequate competence is a prerequisite for a good safety culture. Training courses are therefore provided within multiple areas. Examples of this include online courses in health and safety work, both at basic and operative level, and more comprehensive health and safety training as part of Statkraft’s project manager training. Accidents Overall, 104 lost-time injuries and 176 total injuries were recorded among Statkraft’s employees and contractors in 2015. This corresponds to an injury frequency rate (TRI) of 5.9 and lost time injury rate (LTI) of 3.5. Fatalities Fatalities Number 6 There were no work related fatalities in Statkraft in 2015. 5 4 Injuries 3 2 The LTI (number of lost-time injuries per million working hours) was 3.3 among Statkraft’s 1 employees, while LTI among Statkraft’s contractors was 3.6. Correspondingly, the TRI (number 0 of injuries per million working hours) among Statkraft’s employees was 5.6 and 6.0 among 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Statkraft’s contractors. In total, 176 injuries were recorded for Statkraft’s employees and Contractors, subsidiaries Employees, subsidiaries Third parties, associates Contractors, associates contractors, 104 of which were lost-time injuries. In 2015, six accidents occurred that resulted in serious injury. Another 33 accidents and near accidents had a serious injury potential. Such incidents are subject to investigation in order to identify the cause, course of events and preventive measures. Experience and knowledge from such incidents are shared across the organisation. The injury frequency rate in Statkraft is stable, but not satisfactory with regard to the goal of no Total recordable injuries for employees and contrators Number per million hours serious injuries. 12 10 8 Registering unsafe conditions and near-misses 6 All accidents, near-misses and unsafe conditions are registered in a joint follow-up and analysis 4 tool.

This allows us to elevate expertise concerning LTI contractors TRI contractors work situations with a risk potential, which makes us better equipped for good planning and preventive measures that can reduce the risk of accidents. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 147 Health and safety Follow-up of health and safety is a line responsibility in Statkraft. This means that each unit has an independent responsibility for efforts and follow-up relating to work in Statkraft the health and safety performance. Ambitions and goals for health and safety are clearly embedded with the Corporate management. Statkraft’s safety culture Statkraft’s goal is zero serious injuries. This is a logical, yet ambitious goal. In order to reach this goal, Statkraft is working systematically to establish a value-based safety culture based on transparency, clarification of requirements and a desire for continuous improvement. Focus areas for the Group’s health and safety work in 2015 In 2015, Statkraft formulated a new programme to strengthen the Group’s health and safety work. The programme contains for example new leading indicators for measuring the health Example from Statkraft’s web-based health and safety course. and safety performance, improvement of the follow-up tool for health and safety in projects, increased focus on high-risk activities, training programmes for the senior management, new training modules for various target groups in the Group and critical review of group requirements. The programme was launched in the autumn of 2015, and most activities will be implemented in 2016. Below follow some examples of ongoing follow-up and improvement activities in the various business areas: ➔➔ Wind Offshore has continued the effort to incorporate and implement health and safety in WO PROMAS (project management tool for Wind Offshore). The health and safety part of the tool is founded on best industry practice as well as our own experiences from operative wind farms and previous development activities. The tool will be used and developed further in Statkraft’s large wind power project in central Norway. ➔➔ The Optimum improvement programme will be continued for the business area Power Generation. This programme has addressed health and safety as one of several important improvement areas. Continuous learning, simplification and cooperation across technical disciplines, as well as increased focus on energy control and improved control over high-risk activities, are some of the measures identified for improving results. Increased construction activity in Norway will provide experience and contribute to developing the programme further. ➔➔ Wind Offshore is an active participant in the G9 Offshore Wind Health and Safety Association to increase expertise concerning risk activities in the offshore wind sector. Statkraft is a board member and also chairs the working group that is developing guidelines for working at heights in such projects. Statkraft is also participating actively in working groups for marine operations and lifting operations. Health and safety expertise Statkraft employees are given training in safety risk and working environment, adapted to their individual working situation. Health and safety is part of the introduction programme for new employees, as well as the Group’s management programmes. In addition, there is a basic, web-based course in Statkraft’s safety culture and work, which is available to all employees. Furthermore, there is a more extensive web-based health and safety course aimed at operative operation and project activities which for example reviews the identification of safety hazards, working at heights, handling mobile installations, traffic safety, electrical installations, planning and coordination of safety work and emergency preparedness work. Statkraft’s project manager programme has a module which covers planning and coordination of health and safety work. This is a more extensive programme which consists of both classroom instruction and web-based training. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 148 Networks and industry associations Statkraft is a member of several national and international networks and industry associations which follow up health and safety issues. These are important arenas where people can exchange experiences and acquire new health and safety knowledge in the utility industry. Examples of such networks and associations include: ➔➔ Energy Norway: Energy Norway is an industry association representing about 270 Norwegian companies engaged in generation, distribution and trading of electricity. Energy Norway works actively to improve health and safety work in the Norwegian energy industry. ➔➔ RenewableUK: RenewableUK is the leading industry association for wind power in the UK and works to develop industry guidelines for health and safety. ➔➔ International Hydropower Association (IHA): IHA is an international organisation promoting the role of hydropower in establishing sustainable energy solutions. IHA has developed the IHA Sustainability Guidelines, which is a framework to monitor the degree of sustainability for hydropower plants, including the health and safety aspect. ➔➔ G9 Offshore Wind Health and Safety Association: Statkraft is one of nine companies which established G9 in 2012 and which will promote health and safety for offshore wind power. ➔➔ National Safety Council of India: The National Safety Council has been established by the Indian government. Its task is to promote health and safety work at a national level in India. The CEO is visiting the construction site at the Devoll hydropower project in Albania. Investigation of serious incidents Photographer: Agim Dobi All accidents, near accidents and hazardous conditions are registered in a group-wide reporting tool. This tool allows for analysis and efficient follow-up. Serious incidents with, or with the potential for, serious consequences, are investigated or reviewed following a fixed procedure to reveal all aspects of the incident in order to determine the direct and underlying causes. This information is summarised in a report which is followed-up by responsible unit and by the relevant board. A brief version of the report is made available throughout the organisation to enable us to learn from mistakes and avoid recurrences. Absence due to illness Absence due to illness in Statkraft has been stable, and was 3.0 % 2015, which is within the goal of an absence due to illness rate lower than 3.5 %. All Norwegian companies in Statkraft have entered into Inclusive workplace (IA) agreements, with active follow-up of absence and adaptation of the work as needed by the employee. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 149 Security Statkraft works systematically on issues linked to security, emergency preparedness and crisis management. The handling of security issues is based on internationally recognised principles. Statkraft takes a comprehensive approach to security topics and aims to comply with good international practice. In Statkraft, the area of security encompasses personnel security, physical security, IT system security and information security. The Group’s guidelines for securing personnel and assets are based on national guidelines and internationally recognised principles. Risk assessment The security situation, as regards for example political instability, terrorism, sabotage and organised crime, is assessed continually in all areas where Statkraft has a presence. Such assessments are made both at the corporate level and by the individual unit. Statkraft’s interests in Turkey are followed up particularly, and the situation in the country and the region is continuously monitored and assessed. Immediate measures will be considered upon changes in the security situation, for example reinforced security routines and travel restrictions. Preparedness All business units, country offices and operative units in Statkraft have established emergency preparedness plans in order to handle emergencies in a structured and systematic manner. In addition, there is an overall Group emergency preparedness plan describing procedures for notification, interaction, information sharing and communication in a crisis. The emergency preparedness plans are regularly revised, and regular drills are held on small and large scales. Securing Statkraft’s assets All of Statkraft’s buildings, plants and infrastructure are secured against unauthorised access. The purpose of this is to secure the Group’s assets against external threats and vandalism, but also to protect third parties against any safety risks in connection with the Group’s installations. Statkraft is involved in development activities in countries and areas which can be politically unstable. This may result in an increased need for guards and security measures for people and assets. If the threat situation so warrants, this may involve armed guards. The provision of security will have to be in line with relevant principles of the Voluntary Principles for Security and Human Rights. Information security Statkraft’s work on information security will maintain confidentiality, integrity and access to the organisation’s information. In 2015, Statkraft implemented a number of measures to strengthen security and improve the company’s ability to detect and handle risks and incidents related to information security. Statkraft has, along with other energy companies, decided to establish a new company, KraftCERT. KraftCERT cooperates with Norcert and other security authorities and its main objective is to strengthen the electric utility industry’s ability to detect and resist cyberattacks on the industry’s IT systems. In addition, Statkraft has established CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team), with responsibility for following up notifications from for example KraftCERT, and operational handling of incidents related to IT security. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 150 Business ethics Statkraft is committed to ensuring a high level of integrity and has zero tolerance for corruption. With rising exposure in markets exposed to and anti-corruption corruption, Statkraft works actively to safeguard a sound internal business culture and develop robust anti-corruption measures. Ambitions and goals In 2015, Statkraft performed a materiality analysis to identify the sustainability issues that are most important to the company and its stakeholders. One of the issues identified was Business ethics and anti-corruption. Ambition, goals and status for 2015 is presented below. Material aspect Ambition statement Goals towards 2020 Business ethics Statkraft actively ➔➔ All employees complete training in business ethics and prevents corruption with focus on anti-corruption anti-corruption and unethical ➔➔ Continue to strengthen th culture of reporting of practices in all concerns and breaches activities ➔➔ Continue to ensure adequate corporate-wide handling of anti-corruption and business ethics risks, with particulat focus on high risk processes ➔➔ Improve the adequacy of how business ethics BUSINESS ETHICS TOOL is reflected in requirements and controls for key Quick guide Business business processes partners: Contractors and Suppliers 2015 status on goals related to Business ethics and anti-corruption All Statkraft employees complete training program in business ethics with focus on anticorruption A new two-year cycle of training on business ethics and anti-corruption was initiated in Q1 2015 for all staff employed in fully-owned entities. The training programme aims to ensure knowledge of relevant anti-corruption legislation, clarify Statkraft’s expectations, enhance preparedness to handle risks, and promote an ethical culture and increased reporting of concerns. The programme is composed of various elements, with classroom training or e-learning as One of Statkrat’s guidance tools: a Quick Guide on mandatory for all. The combination of methods implemented in each business unit depends on business ethics in Statkraft. their risk profile, defined according the geography where staff are located and the function they hold. The content of the training was tailored to the various business units, to ensure relevance for their type of operations and risk exposure. The training has been provided in 5 different languages, with 100 separate training sessions in over 30 locations. Training had been offered to all staff in fully-owned entities, either classroom or e-learning. Continue to strengthen the culture of reporting of concerns and breaches In the interest of promoting improved reporting of concerns, new procedures were adopted towards the end of 2014 which explain both how employees and others can present such reports, and how they will be handled. Training on these new procedures was incorporated in the business ethics and anti-corruption training programme rolled out in 2015. The development of new procedures and the roll-out of training efforts have contributed to improvements in reporting levels and in the understanding of how to handle such reports. Statkraft will continue its efforts in this area in order to further strengthen the culture of reporting. Continue to ensure adequate corporate-wide handling of anti-corruption and business ethics risks, with particular focus on high risk processes A corruption risk assessment and gap analysis for all fully-owned entities was concluded in 2015, with the aim to increase the understanding of risks and to identify potential gaps in prevention. A ‘bottom up’ approach was taken, with interviews of 350 staff in 25 different locations, followed by workshops involving 185 middleand senior-level managers. Feedback CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 151 suggests that this process contributed to important improvements in the understanding of risks and increased commitment to implement preventative measures in the company. In 2015 Statkraft also undertook a risk assessment, gap analysis and benchmarking focused on sanctions. Based on the analysis of risks, a set of recommendations for how to address the gaps were developed with corresponding implementation. Improve the adequacy of how business ethics is reflected in requirements and controls for key business processes A number of new initiatives were implemented and/or initiated in 2015 to ensure that business ethics related risks are adequately addressed by requirements and controls in key business processes. This included dedicated preventions plans being developed for high risk entities; development of new corporate requirements for integrity due diligence reviews of business partners; and a new project focused specifically on the handling of fraud and corruption risks in financial related processes. Our commitment Statkraft’s commitment to a high level of integrity is clearly stated in the Code of Conduct, approved by the Board of Directors. Statkraft has also adopted detailed guidelines for business ethics and anti-corruption. Statkraft endorses the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, which include a clear standard for anti-corruption. Challenging arena – clear position Statkraft is present in a wide range of markets. Some of these rank high on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, and particular care is taken to handle corruption risk in these markets. Statkraft works actively to ensure a sound internal business culture and develop robust anti-corruption measures. In addition to the mandatory training roll-out in the organization in 2015 and other preventative measures undertaken, Statkraft has prepared practical guidelines that advise employees on how to handle ethical challenges. The guidelines are a supplement to governing documents, the existing anti-corruption work manual and anti-corruption e-learning programme. In order to ensure accessibility and promote understanding documents have been translated to different languages used by Statkraft employees. Whistleblower channel Statkraft wants transparency surrounding dilemmas and ethical issues, and systems are in place to provide all employees with guidance and advice with regard to interpretation of Statkraft’s Code of Conduct and desired behaviour. Statkraft’s Code of Conduct emphasises that employees have both the right and duty to report breaches of legal or ethical obligations through the line organisation or the Group’s whistleblower channel, which is managed by the Head of Corporate Audit. The whistleblower channel was improved in 2014 and is now also open for external stakeholders. 12 whistleblower cases were registered by Statkraft Corporate Audit in 2015. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 152 Role in society Statkraft creates value, both directly and indirectly, in societies where we are present. In 2015, the Group’s economic gross value created amounted to NOK 15 439 million. Economic value creation The Group’s financial gross value creation amounted to NOK 15 439 million in 2015 (22 312).

Innovation is also important in order to build competence and ensure future framework conditions. Multi-year R&D program have been established, closely linked to the Group’s strategic focus areas, hydropower, wind power and bio-energy. Statkraft has also established a dedicated climate R&D program that will e.g. focus on developing business-specific climate knowledge and contributing toward ensuring that the global climate models are adapted to planning and operations. Examples of innovation projects in 2015: Bio-energy Liquid biofuel is a research activity addressing the business opportunities in the bio-energy market. Norway has an abundance of available biomass feedstock. While Norwegian electricity generation is almost 100% renewable, the Norwegain transport sector is dominated by fossil fuels. In February 2015, Södra and Statkraft established Silva Green Fuel AS. The first task is to qualify a cost-efficient technology for profitable production of second generation biofuels based on forestry raw materials. The aim is to implement the first industrial production plant at the industrial site at Tofte. In this way, Södra and Statkraft can become an important contributor towards achieving national and international targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. R&D Climate Water availability in the future Changes in water availability is one of the main risks to Statkraft’s international hydropower business. To increase the knowledge on this issue, Statkraft has initiated a project to address challenges regarding decreasing water resources, caused by climate change, competitive water demand and new regulations. In the first phase of the project existing information on historical trends, climate change predictions and governmental plans were mapped. The results for each of the seven countries in the study are used to identify knowledge gaps at present. These gaps are now covered by follow-up projects in the different countries to make sure we develop the knowledge and solutions we need for efficient hydropower in all our operations in new parts of the world. Wind power Reindeer and wind power Development of onshore wind power projects in areas with reindeer husbandry is especially complex and sensitive. Statkraft is involved in research projects in both Norway and Sweden to improve the knowledge about land use and the behaviour of semi-domestic reindeer. The aim is to find measures to avoid and reduce possible negative impacts on reindeer husbandry caused by wind power. Hydropower R&D solves problems related to hydropower operations The operation of Francis turbine at part load is associated with the formation of pressure pulsations that usually lead to restrictions for operation ranges. There is a number of reasons for operation at part load, such as grid frequency control or meeting minimum flow requirements. The troublesome flow conditions at part load operation can however be improved. A pressure pulsation reduction system (Diffcon) has been developed by Troms Kraft, Flow Design Bureau and Statkraft. By means of water injection directly into the draft tube, counteracting the natural spin of the water exiting the runner at part load, flow conditions have been improved and pressure pulsations reduced. The system has been successfully tested and proven at Svorka power station during 2015. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 154 The water footprint of hydropower Different methods have been used to establish a comparison of the water footprint for different technologies. A SINTEF-led project has been looking into the weaknesses of such methodologies, trying to develop new ones which incorporate multipurpose aspects of hydropower in areas with water scarcity. This is due to the fact that many reservoirs are used for multipurpose such as drinking water, irrigation and flood control. This might be equally important for electricity generation in many areas abroad. The new methods are gaining international acceptance and contributes to improve the image of hydropower sustainability. Stakeholder engagement People, local communities and organisations can be directly or indirectly affected by Statkraft’s activities. We shall show respect for the local communities, societies and cultures in which we are present in all dialogue with stakeholders. We want to build trust in our company by engaging in open dialogue with stakeholders. Active and long term involvement As a power producer with long-term perspectives, it is in the interest of both Statkraft and our stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions. Success in this regard can best be achieved in open dialogue and interaction with those affected by the company’s activities. Important partners in this dialogue include the Owner, elected officials, villages physically affected by a project’s presence, employees, customers, suppliers, local and regional authorities, voluntary organisations and the media. Disclosure of relevant project information helps affected communities understand the risks, impacts and opportunities of the project. Collaboration with NGOs Statkraft strives to build synergies through close collaboration with special interest organisations. The main purpose of the partnerships is to draw on each other’s expertise in common fields of work. Statkraft has formal partnership agreements with WWF Norway, Bellona, the Norwegian Society for the Preservation of Nature and the Norwegian Red Cross. Statkraft also has a conference partnership with Zero. Social issues and local Statkraft’s power production can have significant impacts on local communities and individuals. Considerable efforts are made to avoid, reduce or mitigate development negative impacts and at the same time to enhance direct and indirect benefits and development opportunities for stakeholders. Interventions are a result of consultations with all affected stakeholders in accordance with good international practices and standards, based on International Finance Corporation Performance Standards on Social & Environmental Sustainability and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In 2015, the largest social mitigation programs and development initiatives were carried out for Devoll and Cetin projects in the construction phase, focusing on infrastructural improvements and livelihood programs. An ongoing dialogue with local stakeholders and authorities is essential for ensuring cooperation and trust for compensation activities and development programs that offset losses of land, structures and natural resources. Improved market access, higher quality health and educational services and intensification of agricultural production are some of the programs. For the Cheves and Kargi projects, social programs have been initiated for the operational phases, including addressing any outstanding issues. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 155 Corporate As a power producer Statkraft is involved in several development projects in different parts of the world. Most of these are in emerging markets, but Responsibility in there are also substantial developments in Northern Europe for different development projects technologies. In the following sections we present examples of how we have addressed corporate responsibility in 2015. Devoll Hydropower Project The Devoll Hydropower Project (Devoll HPP) in Albania consists of a cascade of hydropower plants along the Devoll River with a planned installed capacity of – Hydropower in Albania 256 MW. Production is estimated at 729 GWh/year. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 256 MW ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction There is currently a team of 25 on-site employees and consultants involved in managing environment and social affairs for the Devoll Project. The project prepared an Environmental and Social Management Plan in 2013 comprising all environmental and social mitigation measures and providing a general framework for resettlement, livelihood restoration, social development and environmental management as well as monitoring indicators. This plan is implemented through detailed Annual Implementation Plans and a detailed monitoring framework is established. The main social impacts relate to the loss of agricultural and horticultural land and the loss of livelihood associated with this impact and roads. The project carried out a range of initiatives Family provided with goats for cheese production. in 2015 to compensate project affected households for these anticipated losses. The overall goal is to mitigate ahead of impacts, pre-empting any economic difficulties that could be faced by the local population at the time of inundation. The main initiative is the implementation of the Livelihood Support and Development Program. The program provides various agricultural and livelihood inputs and technical assistance to households directly affected by the project. The focus is on providing in-kind support and technical assistance, for example, in the form of veterinarian services, fruit pruning, etc. As of the end of 2015, 248 agreements out of 291 households entitled for livelihood support (85%) have been settled, and provision of inputs to 201 project affected households (including e.g. olive and fruit trees, livestock and fodder; bee hives, water pumps and items of agricultural machinery) was provided. All input delivery is linked to the provision of regular technical assistance by DHP agricultural experts. Construction of resettlement homes above Banja reservoir. A total of 15 relocation houses are currently under construction and handover is expected at the beginning of 2016. The houses are built of equal or better standard than impacted houses with thermal insulation, drinking water and electricity. The main environmental impacts of the Devoll HPP relate to the changes in the hydrology of the Devoll River and the creation of two reservoirs. Water quality will be the focus of the improved urban waste management and sewage treatment for Gramsh town which is located at the end of the Banjë reservoir. Monthly water quality monitoring with more than 200 samples taken from 20 defined spots along the Devoll River is undertaken with 33 parameters on heavy metals, nutrients, and bacteriology. 4700 values were measured in 2015. Each quarter, samples for the analysis of phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish and fauna have been taken at six tonine locations along the river. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 156 Cheves Hydropower Project The Cheves hydropower project is Statkraft’s largest project in Peru. The project construction was completed in 2015 and officially opened on – Hydropower in Peru September 15th, 2015. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 168 MW ➔➔ Development phase: Operation The main corporate responsibility focus for the project has been, and will continue to be, ensuring a social license to operate by maintaining good relations with local government and surrounding communities, as well as conducting comprehensive environmental monitoring programs to comply with Peruvian legislation and international standards. In 2015, an Environmental and Social Management Plan for Operation was prepared, describing the anticipated community development programs for the next three years, as well as the environmental monitoring related to water quality, biology, electromagnetic radiation (at substations and transmission lines) and other environmental parameters. The development programs focus on the areas of infrastructure development, capacity building/ Bank stabilisation measures above the Huauru dam ahead of operation. training, education, and business and technical development initiatives. In 2015 two studies, a Perception study and a Quality of life study, were carried out to assess the perception of the project in local communities. The Perception study asked for feedback on eight items, including “Cheves’ contribution to improve local conditions”, “Perception as to whether Cheves generates any local benefit” and “Degree of trust”. The highest score was related to degree of trust in the Cheves management, whilst the lowest score was related to whether local conditions have improved due to the presence of Cheves. The “Quality of Life” study for the affected communities was requested by the government as an Environmental Impact Assessment requirement. It contained 5 items, with the highest score for “Promotion of capacity building, especially production-related capacities” and the lowest “Help provided to new and existing businesses in the community”. Several targets have been adapted based on the results from the surveys, including giving priority to social investments in communities within the area of direct influence; implementing a community business development plan and providing support and training to local businesses. In addition, all outstanding issues from the construction Promotion of local products and businesses in the project period were closed, such as the revegetation of the disturbed sites and spoil areas with local area at opening of Cheves. cactus species. This was achieved by planting up to 115 % of the original planned seeds, taking into account natural mortality rates. As requested by IFC, a former lender to the project, an Environmental Flow Management Plan will be implemented during the operational phase. The plan outlines complementary monitoring parameters for water quality, geomorphology, hydrobiology and vegetation. Khimti Hydropower Project Statkraft has one asset in Nepal through the Himal Power Company in partnership with BKK and Butwal Power Company, Nepal. Social programs form a key – Hydropower in Nepal component to the successful operation and good relations with neighbouring communities, and this commitment was further manifested during the tragic events of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in April 2015. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 50.4% ➔➔ Capacity: 60 MW (378 GWh) ➔➔ Development phase: Operation since 2000 A number of successful programs have been initiated over the past 15 years and are now being handed over to communities and local officials in preparation for the relinquishing of 50% ownership to the Nepali Electricity Authority (NEA) as per the Power Purchase Agreement. This will bring to a conclusion a number of support programs and activities, but not without ensuring sustainability. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 157 ➔➔ Community Self-Development Program: contribution and supervision of implementation of small-scale infrastructure projects, such as rural roads, water supply and irrigation systems, undertaken by communities. This program will continue but with gradually reduced financial support. ➔➔ Khimti Rural Electric Cooperative: support for the construction of two micro-hydro projects (1035 kW) and a rural distribution system covering 9,500 households in the region. Institutional support for setting up a cooperative that now has an agreement with the national utility and is self-sufficient through the collection of fees and sale of electricity. ➔➔ Khimti School: Project established a school for worker’s families and local communities Khimti project area – development of micro-hydro and local distribution systems. during construction and has continued to support education through scholarships, educational materials and administrative costs. The company is still involved and providing support but in a much reduced capacity as fees now cover about 50% of costs. ➔➔ Khimti Health Centre: Established to provide healthcare for the wider population and contribute to improved health standards. Statkraft has also supported a mobile health clinic which has also provided services in the region. Dhulikhel hospital is now in the process of taking over responsibility for the health centre. Only minor damage was reported at the Khimti plant, confirming the quality of the engineering and construction work. The power plant was able to resume production shortly after inspections, thus being the main source of electricity for the capital after the earthquake. However, many of the communities in the vicinity of the project suffered greatly, with collapsed houses and damaged infrastructure and services. The owners of Himal Power Company Khimti primary school has provided a high standard of organized immediate emergency relief and shipped in essentials, such as tarpaulins, blankets education in the region. and food to those who had lost houses and were living in the open. A Post-Disaster Needs Assessment was conducted to identify areas of additional assistance to be funded by the Project which included restoration of houses and key community infrastructure, such as schools, irrigation channels and roads.

Statkraft also has its own training program for project managers, and 219 employees participated in these programs in 2015. Expertise development is followed up through appraisal interviews, and employees are, in addition to courses and further education, encouraged to seek internal rotation. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 159 Employee survey An annual employee survey is held in Statkraft where all employees are asked to evaluate the Group’s organisation and management. The survey covered topics such as leadership, cooperation, working conditions and personal development. The purpose of the survey was to compare ourselves with other companies in the industry and make Statkraft a better place to work. As in previous years, the results of the 2015 survey were very good. As regards the indicator “Job satisfaction”, Statkraft’s score was 73, well above the Norwegian industry index (70). Cooperation with trade unions Statkraft aims for a close and structured cooperation with all represented trade unions. In addition, Statkraft has established a European works council (Statkraft European Works Council, SEWC), with employee representatives from Norway, Sweden, Germany and the UK. SEWC is an important cooperation forum for coordinating and implementing principles and guidelines as regards labour issues and labour rights in Statkraft. The Group supports and respects internationally recognised labour rights wherever it operates. Relevant ILO conventions and EU directives have been included in the SEWC agreement with EPSU (European Federation of Public Service Unions), the federation for European unions within the energy industry. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 160 Human rights Companies have a corporate responsibility to respect human rights. Human rights situations in countries where Statkraft operates can be challenging. This is something the Group takes seriously. Ambitions and goals – Human Rights In 2015, Statkraft performed a materiality analysis to identify the sustainability issues that are most important to the company and its stakeholders. One of the issues identified was Human Rights. Ambition, goals and status for 2015 is presented below. Material aspect Ambition statement Goals towards 2020 Human rights Statkraft acts ➔➔ Follow developments related to increasing according to the international and national expectations related UN Guiding Principles to human rights management (human rights due on Business and diligence process) and improve our practices Human Rights accordingly, starting by major and international projects ➔➔ Ensure adequate implementation of training program on human rights ➔➔ Strengthen and make better known our grievance mechanisms, including at project level ➔➔ Strengthen stakeholder dialogue and communication, including on our salient human rights impacts Statkraft’s management on human rights has been guided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises since the adoption or revision of these instruments. Statkraft’s commitment in this area is reflected in the company’s Code of Conduct, which is adopted by the Board of Directors. The commitment to human rights is also reflected in the company’s Corporate Responsibility policy and HSE policy. Statkraft has over several years worked on integrating and operationalizing human rights into existing governing documents and processes. In 2015, Statkraft has worked actively on strengthening its management framework for assessing and managing human rights issues. Statkraft has also participated in a national pilot project lead by the OECD Norwegian National Contact Point aimed at providing a methodology to conduct human rights due diligence processes. The project included general training on human rights and the UN Guiding Principles, risk mapping for right holders, management of human rights in the supply chain and promoted tools including reporting tools that can assist in human rights management. Statkraft has also conducted a high-level assessment of its governance structure on human rights as well as a review of its potential human rights impacts and further identification of its salient human rights impacts. This has led to the identification of possible improvement measures, which are being considered and prioritized for a roll-out in 2016. Dispute related to development of wind power in Sweden In 2012, a complaint against Statkraft was lodged before the OECD’s Norwegian and Swedish National Contact Points (NCPs) in connection with the development of wind power in Sweden. Mediation took place between Jijnjevaerie Sámi Village and Statkraft in 2014 and was concluded without agreement. The Final Statement from the OECD NCPs was issued on 9 February 2016, thereby concluding on and closing the case. The NCPs have not found any grounds for concluding that Statkraft has failed to comply with the OECD Guidelines. The statement did point to some areas for improvement, including that Statkraft/SSVAB can work in a manner that even more clearly promotes indigenous people’s rights and the implementation of the Guidelines. The NCPs further recommended that the parties show renewed will to negotiate an agreement on the further development of the wind power projects. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 161 Corporate Statkraft’s Corporate Responsibility Statement presents the results for the areas environment, health and safety, labour practices, human rights, ethics responsibility and contributions to society. statement Scope of statement Statkraft reports annually on relevant topics associated with corporate responsibility. The reporting mainly follows the Group’s accounting principles for treatment of subsidiaries, partly-owned power plants and associated companies. This means that data are collected from all companies where Statkraft is the majority owner, and these data are included in the statement in their entirety. However, data relating to health and safety are collected from all companies where Statkraft owns 20% or more. The presented data should cover the entire Group, but this has not been possible for some indicators. Where this is the case, the issue is explained in the associated note. The notes also clarify some terms and explain major changes with regard to presented results.

The Report is part of the Statkraft Annual Report 2015 on the Internet (www.annualreport2015.statkraft.com). The Report includes the Corporate Responsibility Statement published also in the printed Statkraft Annual Report 2015. The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of Statkraft AS (“the Company”). Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on the international standard ISAE 3000 “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the Company and included those subject matters on which we have concluded below. Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have performed interviews with management responsible for corporate responsibility aspects at corporate and at selected reporting units represented by Power Generation – Region South (Dalen, Norway), Wind Onshore UK, and International Hydropower’s head office in Oslo. We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to provide a conclusion with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than would be the case had an audit-level engagement been performed. Conclusions Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention causing us not to believe that:  Statkraft has established management processes and systems to manage material aspects related to corporate responsibility, as described in the Report.  Statkraft has applied procedures to identify, collect, compile and validate information for 2015 to be included in the Report, as described in the Report. Information presented for 2015 is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately presented in the Report.  The management systems referred to above have been implemented and locally adopted as necessary at the reporting units that we have visited, as specified above. Information for 2015 from these units has been reported according to the procedures noted above and is consistent with source documentation presented to us.  Statkraft applies a reporting practice for its corporate responsibility reporting aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (version G4) reporting principles and the reporting fulfils in accordance level Core according to the GRI guidelines. The GRI Index presented in the Report appropriately reflects where information on each of the elements and indicators of the GRIs guidelines is to be found within the Statkraft Annual Report 2015 on the Internet.
