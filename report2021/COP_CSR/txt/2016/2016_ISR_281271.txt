Leumi is the oldest banking group in Israel , accompanying the Zionist endeavor from its inception, and the Bank considers corporate social responsibility to be a great privilege. The business world, of which the banking sector is a significant part, is currently in the midst of historic change: ‎a change that is the result of the technological revolution, which affects all walks of life in society, including the way people manage their financial affairs. The rapid development of technology, especially in fintech, is creating rapid changes in the banking world – both globally and locally. As a leader in the Israeli banking sector, Leumi takes care to manage its business with the objective of creating real value for the customer – value based on a combination of leadership, innovation, and thinking outside the box – while preserving financial soundness and organizational stability.‎‎ Corporate social responsibility activity rests on a dialogue with our major stakeholders, who come from diverse fields and sectors. This dialogue enables us to understand their needs and to focus on issues that are substantive for them. The products of this dialogue are taken into account in matters such as restructuring, launching new products and services, accessibility, as well as making accessible and adapting services to the needs of disadvantaged groups, the environmental impact of products and services, and increasing value for customers, employees, suppliers, and the community. ‎ Below are some of the significant corporate social responsibility measures that the Group has undertaken this year: Leading banking innovation and initiatives for the Group’s customers: In 2015, out of a genuine understanding of customers’ needs and with the objective of providing them optimal service, we continued to develop innovative products and services that are useful for our diverse customers, from households, through small businesses, to large corporations. In order to continue creating value for our customers and the Israeli economy, we have expanded out activity in the business sector as well, with an emphasis on small and middle market businesses, based on the perspective that they are a critical growth engine for a healthy Israeli economy.‎‎ As part of the view of customer needs from a technological evolution perspective, by the end of 2016, we will launch our Pepper activity – a full digital line of activity, which will provide a holistic, user-friendly, intuitive, and low-cost response for next-generation customers. The activity is wholly mobile-based, and the Leumi Group will be the first to bring this good news to Israel.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 5 ‎Commitment to promoting responsible conduct :this year, Leumi Group is continuing to instill its Code of Ethics in all units, providing extensive training on the subject and establishing an anonymous call center for employees seeking advice or wishing to file a complaint on these matters. In 2015, the Group continued its meticulous implementation of the declared money policy, in line with the strictest standards prevailing in global banking. Today, we are proud to state that Leumi has considerably lowered its potential exposure to money laundering and tax evasion by its Israeli and foreign customers.‎ ‎ Banking services accessibility to people with disabilities: This year, the Group has continued making its facilities accessible to people with disabilities. We have installed special audio systems for the visually impaired in ATMs, made forms accessible for the visually impaired, and created physical accessibility at branches nationwide. As of the end of 2015, 80% of the company’s branches – more than 210 branches in Israel – are accessible, and all branches will be accessible by the end of 2017. In general, our motto of digital banking now enables us – more than ever – to provide accessibility to advanced and convenient services to people with disabilities.‎ ‎Commitment to the Group’s employees :Leumi Group employs more than 12,000 people in Israel and overseas and considers them to be a key factor in its success. We attribute great importance to the welfare, satisfaction, and professional and personal development of our employees. We encourage excellence and seek to promote and preserve transparency, fairness, equal opportunity, job diversity, and prevent abusive employment practices.‎ ‎Continuing the contribution to, and investment in, the community: In 2015, Leumi Group donated a total of NIS 32 million to, and sponsored, social and community causes, and 230 organizations. More than 5,000 Group employees volunteered and contributed to the community in 2015.‎This year, strategic cooperation was further deepened with Aharai! Youth Leading Change, increasing the investment in the NGO and expanding activity in communities in the periphery. ‎ Reducing the environmental impact :The Leumi Group supports a cautious approach to environmental challenges, reducing its energy consumption and carbon footprint. The Group encourages the development and installation of environmentally-friendly technologies, providing credit to sustainable environmental projects. Our digital leadership enables the development of paper-saving products, starting with the digital check, which reduces the need to use checkbooks. In 2015, we granted more than NIS 1 billion in loans to advance environmental projects.‎ ‎Commitment to human rights and conduct in accordance with international standards : For many years, the Leumi Group has supported the UN Global Compact, and is committed to implementing the ten principles of this initiative and to protect human rights wherever the Bank operates. The Leumi Group recognizes the freedom of association of its employees and collective bargaining, the elimination of Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 6 forced labor and child labor, and the eradication of discrimination in employment and at work.‎ ‎We believe that extensive business endeavor is incomplete without contribution and in-depth involvement in the space in which we operate. We are proud to stand at the head of a financial institution that has worked for society, the community, and the environment for 114 years.‎ ‎David Brodet Rakefet Russak-Aminoach‎ ‎‎Chairman of the Board CEO ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 7 The Leumi Way:‎‎Vision, Core Values and Ethics‎ “To lead enterprising and innovative banking for the Customer” ‎ At the basis of the vision is the aspiration to devise a dynamic system, which combines the Bank’s values with product and technological innovation – a system that will be, for our customers, a place in which they can find the best and most suitable solution for their financial requirements, and, in so doing, derive a fair profit, maintain the Bank’s stability and create a balance between the needs of the employees and the expectations of the shareholders.

To produce a force multiplier, we will enhance interand intra-unit collaboration, with each of us thinking “Leumi,” and thus ensuring the achievement of our goals. In addition, we will show openness and courageously share our opinions, thoughts, and ideas.‎ Each and every one of us is a role model for someone.

Changes in the Israeli and global risk environment and in the risk perception require Leumi to update its assessments and the methodologies it uses, while constantly challenging all parties involved by in-house and external parties.‎ ‎The Chief Risk Officer, who is a member of the Bank’s management and Head of the Risk Management Division, is responsible for managing the Group’s main risks, excluding legal risks, which are under the responsibility of the Bank’s General Counsel, and reputational risks, which are the responsibility of the Digital Banking Division.‎ Managers of credit risks, market risks, operational risks, return risks, and the Head of Compliance report to the Chief Risk Officer.

The methodology involves analysis of the risk levels characterizing various types of customers in accordance with their field of business, the extent to which they have assimilated internal policies to reduce environmental risk, and customer compliance with the various legal and regulatory requirements in this area. Wherever relevant, credit-granting decisions include environmental risk considerations as part of the customers’ risk profile. ‎ ‎Identifying and managing environmental risk in credit granting activity requires implementing changes in the organizational culture; thus, training has been held for a series of key units involved in granting credit, with the aim of raising awareness to this issue. ‎Leumi Card’s Credit Policy Document stipulates that the company shall not finance activities resulting in a significant increase in exposure to environmental risks.‎ Compliance‎ ‎The Leumi Group is subject to a wide range of domestic and international laws, ordinances and regulations, including directives issued by the Supervisor of Banks.

In addition, under the aforementioned policy, a risk-oriented plan was devised for handling new and existing risks embodied in customers’ cross-border activity. ‎ ËË ‎Risk-mitigating policies: As part of the Group’s risk management and compliance policies, several areas of activity have been defined in which Leumi aims to avoid or reduce business activities. These include, among other things, gambling and pornography.‎ Preventing Bribery and Corruption ‎ The Leumi Group is subject to regulation against bribery and corruption in every country of operation.

The system for engagement with suppliers is based on quality, availability, reliability, service and terms. The Leumi Group makes every effort to avoid discrimination among suppliers, along with maintaining the best interests of the Group, ensuring confidentiality of the information provided by the suppliers and making objective and impartial decisions.‎ ‎On December 30, 2015, the Group approved a compliance risk management policy that includes, among other things, the decision that customers whose activity is risk-oriented in this respect will sign a statement on the prevention of bribery or breach of trust.‎‎This decision was intended to reduce the scope of potential situations where assistance to, or cooperation with, customers performing illicit activities could be attributed to Bank.‎ ËË ‎Measures for monitoring and preventing fraud and embezzlement: Relevant units in the Leumi Group have centers and tools which work on an ongoing basis to monitor and track incidents of fraud Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 49 and embezzlement.

Delivering a high quality customer experience is to understand the customer’s needs, his/her individuality and to provide a customized basket of solutions and services without discrimination of any kind.‎‎The Group is obligated to maintain a professional approach when verifying the customer’s needs.‎ ‎ Fair, responsible and professional management of the customers’ money, while understanding their needs and attending to their wishes, is at the core of Leumi’s operations. In ‎‎ order to achieve this objective, the Bank maintains, first and foremost, fairness and transparency. ‎‎This year, as always, the Bank took various measures to comply with the principles that guide its operations on this matter:‎ ËË ‎Creating a tailored customer experience. ‎ ËË ‎Maintaining transparency and providing all necessary information to customers about the products and services available to them. ‎ ËË ‎Maintaining banking secrecy and the protecting customer privacy.‎ ËË ‎Fair sale of financial products and services to customers.

The various defense systems collect data, monitor, locate unusual incidents, etc. with an emphasis on adapting the Bank’s activity to the risks and dynamic cyber activity in Israel and worldwide in combination with effective controls.‎ ‎ Bank Leumi complies with the Bank of Israel’s requirements, filing proper reports on unusual incidents. In 2015, there were phishing attempts to set up fake Bank Leumi sites, all of which were foiled expediently without causing any damage to the Bank or its customers. The Bank’s policy states that any customer harmed by phishing will be indemnified. ‎ ‎ Bank Leumi’s digital services provide means of identification aimed at strengthening identification and managing the risks inherent in these services. The Bank is also strengthening the fraud identification controls simultaneously with extensive activity to raise employee and customer awareness through various channels. Thus, business customers receive training, where attention is drawn to cyber incidents in Israel and other countries and their impact on these organizations, and issues such as the importance of information security at organizations, defensive measures, and the human factor in the cyber era are discussed.‎ ‎Information security and protecting customer privacy at Leumi Card ‎ ‎‎ Leumi Card considers the information in its systems and held by its customers and suppliers as a primary asset and invests heavily to implement of advanced information security control and defense mechanisms and procedures. ‎ As part of its preparations for dealing with the different cyber threats, Leumi Card undertakes inhouse and external procedures to reduce cyber risk to the Company and its customers. Cyber risks are managed by several security and control circles at a number of layers with the objective of reducing potential exposure to this threat. ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 60 Examples of these measures include system hardening, writing and updating procedures and work processes (such as the company authorization procedure), hacking tests, information and cyber security reviews, raising employee awareness to, and monitoring phishing attacks against the website and mobile apps.

Emphasis is placed on the sensitivity of their jobs, authorizations given for transactions in the capacity of their jobs, and work procedures for his/her position. Reports related to this activity are part of the quarterly reports that the Chief Risk Officer sends to management and the Board of Directors. An annual discussion on embezzlement and fraud is also held.‎ ‎‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 61 ‎Initiatives to ensure fair business practices ËË Fee-free track:‎‎As part of the Bank’s commitment to fairness, Leumi offers a variety of fee and account management tracks, allowing its customers to choose the value proposition best suited to them. A case in points is a unique service launched in 2012 – Leumi Total Digital that enables independent digital account management via the Internet and direct channels, without direct channel fees, and with other benefits as outlined in the Bank’s fee list (customers will not be eligible for any additional, personal, sector-specific, or other benefits).‎ ËË ‎In 2015, the Bank reviewed its fees schedule, canceling or reducing some of them (some at the orders of the regulator). These changes included cancellation of the returned check fee, a reduction in the fee for a letter of warning on arrears in payment, and an exemption of the debt card fee for credit card holders. Bank Leumi and Arab Israel Bank also equalized their fees; in a few cases of differences between rates, the lower rate was chosen. ËË ‎Adapting fee plans: At the orders of the Bank of Israel, in September 2015, the Bank notified customers who had not joined the fee plans service about the fees they had actually paid on transactions made by bank clerks and direct channels in January-May, and how much they would have paid if they had joined a suitable fees plan.‎‎When a customer who had joined the Expanded Plus fees plan cancels one of the plan’s services, the Bank, at its own initiative, switches him/her to a plan with a lower monthly payment. Approximately 75,000 customers joined one of the plans during 2015, and the Bank, at its own initiative, transferred about 200 customers to a cheaper plan that was more worthwhile for the customer.‎ ËË Fees clarity: Bank Leumi notifies customers who open an account about the fees the Bank charges and the current fees plans. The customer is provided with the relevant information about fees when opening the account. The Bank also grants longstanding customers and customers with disabilities additional benefits on fees beyond those awarded to regular customers. Every branch has a document that summarizes comprehensive information about the fees in the different plans, which is provided to any customer, upon request. The fees schedule is also published on the Bank’s website, which also features a calculator for calculating various scenarios and repayment schedules. ‎ ËË ‎Fair conduct when granting credit to customers: Bank Leumi formulated a Code of Ethics in 2015, which guides employees when offering loans to customers. T ‎ he Code of Ethics rests on the importance of customer confidence, instructing employees on examining customers’ needs and current and future wherewithal, emphasizing the need to provide customers with the information required to make smart decisions and ensuring that they understand the meaning of the transaction, while ‎‎ maintaining integrity, fairness and transparency.‎In addition, the Bank defined the target audiences which may be offered loans, taking into account criteria such as age, financial means and repayment capacity.‎‎Thus, for example, the elderly were defined as an audience which could not be contacted for loan offer purposes. Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 62 ËË ‎Identifying customer needs fairly: Bank Leumi seeks to identify the needs of its customers and adapt the products and services offered to them accordingly. The Bank carries out a needs identification process for customers applying for credit from the Bank. The process includes a discussion with the customer about his/her ‎age, the purpose of the credit, and his previous assets and liabilities. The objective of the process is to understand the customer’s needs and financial condition, from both the Bank and the customer’s perspectives. If the customer applying for credit has deposits, the Bank is required to inform him/her about them as an alternative to the credit requested. E ‎ mphasis is placed on defining needs, setting targets, adapting the product or solution to the customer’s needs and abilities, mentioning his/her assets and liabilities, and fair disclosure.‎ ËË Preventing customer debt increase: Bank Leumi strives to detect severely overdrawn accounts at early stages, by reviewing all accounts on a daily basis. Customers with problematic accounts receive two letters, at different dates, stating that they must settle their debt to the Bank. In addition to the letters, a representative from the Customer Call Center calls customers who have exceeded their credit lines. ‎‎In addition to informing the client about the problem, the representative’s job is to guide the customer and help him repay the debt by various means, such as ‎changing interest rates and granting a loan to help control the debt repayments. ‎A call from the call center and the letters are usually enough to help customers repay their debts. ‎Fairness in capital market activity ‎ ‎Traders in the trading rooms uphold the rules of fair competitiveness and respect for competitors banks and non-bank brokers. Furthermore, traders in the trading room are well versed in all the regulatory requirements and rules of professional ethics. These issues are given emphasis and managerial attention by all relevant entities – the Head of the Capital Markets Division, the Manager of the Securities Trading Department and managers of the trading rooms. ‎ Fairness in capital market consulting:‎‎Investment consulting at Leumi is done professionally and objectively, in accordance with customers’ needs, and subject to all relevant provisions of the law. Leumi’s consulting services always places the best interests of the customer as its top priority and operates according to high professional standards, presenting the customers with the full picture, with sensitivity to conflicts of interests.

Decisions regarding the Group’s employees and candidates for employment, their recruitment and promotion are made on the basis of objective considerations of performance and skills, without discrimination. ‎The ‎Leumi Group complies with the law in all matters pertaining to employment. The Group does not employ minors. The Diversity and Equal Opportunity Policy in the Leumi Group places emphasis on activity in three main areas: ËË ‎Recruitment of employees from diverse populations, with an emphasis on underemployed populations, such as the Arab population, Israelis of Ethiopian origin and ultra-orthodox Jews, by adjusting the criteria for hiring and granting special assistance. ËË ‎Recruitment and promotion of employees with disabilities, as an inseparable part of responsible employment by the Leumi Group. ËË ‎Equal gender opportunity, at the Leumi Group, in all its activity areas, at all levels and in all fields.‎ ‎The Administration and Operations Sub-Division in the Human Resources Division in Leumi is responsible for employment diversity and for measuring the issue annually and in an organized fashion. The team of recruiters in the Sub-Division includes a diversity supervisor, whose duty is to promote the recruitment of employees from underemployed populations with the placement agencies, screening centers and units in the Bank. Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 98 ‎Over the years, Leumi has accumulated a great deal of knowledge and experience regarding the possible barriers faced by these populations, and has developed relevant solutions and adjustments in order to assist in getting to know the candidate beyond the cultural barriers and the routine threshold criteria.‎ ‎‎ The guiding principle: Diversity in manpower that corresponds to the diversity in Israeli society, with an awareness of the needs of society and the customers with the aim of reflecting the Leumi Group’s responsibility towards the community in which it operates.‎ Initiatives for integrating employees from diverse populations Leumi‎ A. ‎Prioritizing the resumes of candidates from target populations. ‎ B. ‎ Personal assistance to candidates with disabilities:‎‎The recruitment unit provides personal assistance to candidates, showing great sensitivity, to give them the best job search experience and dispel, as far as possible, the stress and fears associated with the process.‎ C. ‎ Assistance in screening tests: Significant additional time (30%) in cognitive tests; adjustment of languages on the evaluation day ; the existence of a non-screening evaluation day (unlike other candidates); adding points to candidates of Ethiopian origin in specific tests; integration of Arab evaluators on screening days for Arab sector candidates, and more. ‎ D. ‎Easing the minimum requirements: Adjusting job requirements:‎‎For example, the Group recruits candidates from the ultra-orthodox population who do not have matriculation certificates or an academic degree, while providing the option of completing a bachelor’s degree on the job during the first four years of employment.‎ E. ‎Summoning to face-to-face interviews: Candidates who received a borderline score at the screening center get a second chance: they are summoned for an interview by the Recruitment Sub-Division, in order to examine in-depth their potential suitability to the position and to Leumi and in order to avoid situations in which a suitable candidate is overlooked. ‎ F. ‎Promoting candidates from target sectors with the recruiting business units: The Recruitment Sub-Division contacts recruiting executives in order to promote the candidacy of people from these populations.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 99 G. ‎Proactively approaching organizations, NGOs and placement agencies in order to receive resumes of candidates from target populations, continuous contact and periodic meetings with NGOs representing these sectors. ‎ H. ‎“‎Spotlight days” for candidates from the ultra-orthodox population (women and men separately).

The results of the study will serve Leumi and may also serve other organizations, in order to pave the way for more reliable and valid tests for candidates of Ethiopian extraction. ‎Following the results of the study, it was decided to raise the score in specific tests for Ethiopian candidates by two noviles.‎ J. ‎ Systematically dealing with discrimination: Leumi views incidents of discrimination with great severity, and deals with them immediately. ‎‎Any complaint by a candidate or employee regarding discrimination based on any cause whatsoever is examined in depth.‎‎In 2015 there were no reports of discrimination for any reason either by employees or candidates.‎ ‎‎ ËË 8% of all employees hired by the Leumi Group in Israel in 2015 were Arabs, ultra-orthodox, of Ethiopian origin, or people with disabilities.

The ‎‎ employment terms and conditions at Leumi allow for a successful combination between building a professional career and a family life (raising children, caring for elderly parents etc.). The ‎‎ overall terms of employment, together with the organizational culture at Leumi, provide a supportive environment for every employee (man or woman) to balance their family and work. ‎ ‎ The Group implements several practices that are intended to support this balance:‎ ËË ‎A five day and 39 hour work week – less than is customary in the Israeli economy. ‎ ËË ‎According to a permanent guideline, employees will only work overtime if necessary and on the instruction of a manager. ËË ‎The quota of vacation days for employees is higher than what is stipulated by law. ‎ ËË ‎The rule for accumulating and utilizing sick days benefit the employees beyond that which is stipulated by law, both for employee illness and for the illness of family members (children and elderly parents). ‎ ËË ‎Nursing mothers in Leumi are entitled to an hour of nursing per day, which exceeds the time stipulated by law, out of the desire to assist employees returning to work after maternity leave. ‎ ËË ‎Leumi participates in the reimbursement of employee expenses for pre-school activities and summer camps. Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 106 ËË ‎Leumi reimburses eligible employees for their children’s college tuition. ‎ ËË ‎Leumi offers fun days to its employees and their families.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 107 Employee turnover at Leumi Card About one-third of the Company’s employees are service representatives, most of whom work at the Company until they turn 30. The highest employee turnover rate is therefore among employees in this age range. ‎‎ ‎‎ Streamlining plan In June 2016, Bank Leumi announced a streamlining plan to support its business targets, with the objective of cutting the Group’s operating costs, and improving efficiency ratios and administrative flexibility. The plan, which was formulated and approved by the Bank of Israel, allows for voluntary retirement of 700 employees by the end of 2016. Under the plan, employees were offered increased compensation or an early retirement settlement. The proposed retirement programs were determined on the basis of the costs to the bank, which vary depending on age, gender, and seniority. ‎‎ Employee severance kit ‎‎ Bank Leumi places great importance on supporting employees when they leave the Bank, developing a special kit for managers, with the objective of building a uniform and orderly departure process with a humane response to the departing employee and with the aim of minimizing damage to the organization. ‎‎ Retirement planning courses ‎‎ Three retirement courses were held in 2015, attended by 188 employees and 54 spouses, for a total of 242 participants. ‎‎ The courses featured lectures on a range of subjects, including retirement as a turning point and change, the post-retirement social perspective, organizing post-retirement time, a family meeting upon retirement, improving memory, a healthy lifestyle, wills and inheritance, retirement and post-retirement targets and investment planning, sleep disorders, volunteering, and medical insurance. ‎‎ A website, which collects information about Bank Leumi alumni was established in 2015. Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 108 Personal development and excellence‎‎ ‎‎ In 2015, eLearning! Media Group (EMG) chose Bank Leumi as one of the 100 top learning organizations in the world for its innovative learning practices and organizational learning culture, resulting in its extraordinary performance. The human factor tops the Group’s quality components and forms the basis for its achievements and success. ‎‎The Leumi Group has set the objective of fostering and retaining the quality of its human resources, encouraging in its employees a sense of identification with, and pride in their workplace and to serve as a focal point for attracting quality people. The objective of Bank Leumi’s management is to support its business units in achieving their business targets through teaching and training, with a focus on improving the professional and managerial skills of its employees and managers, and to adapt them to a changing environment.‎‎ Leumi’s Training Division is a strategic partner in achieving the Group’s business objectives and development goals, and is involved in all organizational processes, including organizational changes, professional training, management training, preparation for technological changes, personal development programs, knowledge preservation and management, regulatory training and the development of learning technologies. Bank Leumi’s employees undergo professional and managerial training when they take up their positions and participate in “gyms”, business classes, and skill training using a training simulator. Bank Leumi also takes care to provide for employee enrichment – at the Branch Managers’ Club, outside seminars, and workshops for personal and interpersonal skill development. The training and refresher courses use a range of in-personal and digital methods and teaching processes at the Training Center and at the desktop, in real time on the job through knowledge procedures or mentoring processes, peer learning, virtual classes, e-learning, and other methods. ‎ The Training Sub-Division in the Human Resources Division is responsible for annually and methodically managing and measuring this area in the Group. In addition, the Sub-Division operates the Training Center in which all the training and learning programs for Leumi’s managers and employees are planned and developed. The Training Center believes in learning processes that are interwoven and integrated into the work routine so as to promote the business objectives of the Group and to benefit the personal and professional development of employees. The Training Center is also at the disposal of the Group’s Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 109 subsidiaries: every subsidiary participates in the Center’s activities according to its own needs.‎ The Sub-Division, in cooperation with additional units in the Group, is leading several key processes: ËË ‎Training courses and programs: The training programs focus on the core banking fields and are in line with the business objectives such as credit, investment consulting, customer relations management, retail banking, service, and customer experience and sales.‎In addition, management training sessions are held ‎and employees undergo comprehensive training on regulation and compliance. ËË ‎Measurement and Assessment of Effectiveness: Processes for drawing conclusions are held on a regular basis, with the aim of improving the proposed training programs for employees and ensuring that they are in line with the business objectives. ËË ‎Learning via Online Channels: Within this framework, Leumi enables its employees to efficiently learn professional content, at their own pace and according to their chosen means.‎ ËË ‎Personal Mentoring: Personal mentoring processes with the aim of advancing employees and managers with professional and managerial development potential. ‎ ËË ‎Managerial Reserve Program: As part of the promotion of excellence at Leumi, programs were written for the development of managers with high potential, in preparation for more complex duties further in their careers. These programs are managed by the Headquarters, Work Relations and Staff Administration Sub-Division. ‎ ËË ‎The One Hundred Forum: The forum, which includes approximately one hundred heads of subdivisions (senior managers), was established with the aim of nurturing managers, increasing their involvement in and influence on the Bank’s activities, and building an expanded management forum with members of Leumi’s management. (The forum is managed by the Headquarters, Work Relations and Staff Administration Sub-Division.) ‎ ËË ‎Leadership Forum:‎ ‎The forum, which includes about six hundred branch managers and headquarters executives at the sub-division level, was established with the aim of increasing the involvement and managerial influence of these managers in leading business and organizational processes.‎‎Members of the forum participated in a unique leadership program developed by the Training Department, in cooperation with the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center.‎ ËË ‎Promoting Academic Studies: As part of its policy of nurturing excellence, the Group funds higher education for its employees who meet the requirements.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 110 ‎Initiatives for developing excellence and training employees Leumi ËË Sales simulator: An innovative and unique training and learning space for employees and managers to develop interpersonal skills:‎Service and sales skills, interpersonal communication skills, management skills and negotiation skills. ‎ ËË ‎Leadership Program: A unique two-year program for the development of senior middle management, led by members of management and members of the One Hundred Forum.

The program combines academic studies with workshops and peer learning. ËË ‎Business class and “gyms”:‎Workshops and one day training seminars for improving skills and reducing knowledge gaps in business areas.‎ Leumi Card ‎ The Company holds training courses for new representatives and individual training programs for new employees in professional positions. Leumi Card also maintains a yearly program of ongoing professional training, in keeping with the changing needs of the organization’s units and the company’s business needs. In addition to all these, Leumi Card offers its employees a range of courses and workshops for professional and personal enrichment on subjects relating to finance, computer applications, interpersonal skills, and more, within the framework of Leumi Campus – the organizational campus. In addition, Leumi Card maintains a program for the training and development of managers at all levels for the development of managerial capabilities and skills, as well as personal development and growth. The program includes various activities such as management courses, peer learning, management forums, and personal consulting processes.‎‎In addition, as part of a desire to promote learning and personal development of employees in order to retain outstanding employees, the Company grants scholarships to employees and managers who meet the requirements.‎ Training ‎ ‎Total training days (8 hours per day training) for employees at Bank Leumi in ???2014 stood at about 47,000 this figure includes hours of online learning and other modes of learning.‎‎Some of the data in the information systems cannot be segmented by level and gender, as required by the GRI reporting requirements.‎‎Therefore, segmented data show lower averages than the total hours of training which actually took place.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 111 * ‎The data segmented by gender do not include the Arab-Israeli Bank or Bank Leumi US.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 112 Data do not include Bank Leumi US. Bank Leumi’s training data were reclassified in 2015. ‎Employee assessment and feedback‎ Employee assessment discussions are held once a year as part of the annual evaluation process, both as a tool for supporting decision-making, and to improve performance, development, and empowerment. The structured assessment meeting includes reference to meeting the targets for the preceding year and setting targets and emphases for the coming year. Most of the process is a dialogue between the employee and his/her direct supervisor, providing an opportunity to obtain the manager’s feedback about the employee’s performance and quality of work in the preceding year, coordinate mutual expectations looking ahead, and thinking together about possible ways to continue to learn and develop. Since ‎‎ February 2015, an employee self-assessment component has been added to the process. The assessment process includes the filling out of an opinion in the computer system, which can be viewed by the employee at any time. In addition to the annual assessment, Bank Leumi undertakes a “midway dialogue” process once a year, which allows for a less formal discussion with no scoring and which is unrelated to remuneration. Leumi Card and Leumi Trust Company also carry out a semiannual performance assessment to examine whether targets are being met and to update them if necessary. ‎‎‎‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 113 In addition to the annual assessment process, Bank Leumi carries out other manager evaluation processes by (external) assessors. In addition, assessments are also carried out as part of management courses.‎‎ ‎Leumi Card ‎ ‎ In 2015, a new performance assessment process was drawn up, derived from the Company’s new values. The assessment form was also revised to fit the updated values,‎‎and emphases were defined for the annual and semiannual assessment discussions: the annual assessment discussion focuses on performance in the preceding year and the setting of targets for the coming year; the semiannual assessment dialogue focuses on the employee’s personal development and validating the targets set in the annual assessment discussion. Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 114 *The percentage calculation of feedback recipients at Leumi Card is based on the percentage of feedback recipients out of the total number of participants in the annual assessment process, rather than a percentage of total employees, as calculated for the rest of the Group. ‎‎‎All company employees participate in the annual evaluation process, including representatives with at least one year’s seniority at the Company, excluding VPs. The remaining representatives (with a seniority of up to one year) receive feedback once a month, and are therefore not included in the calculation mentioned above. Employee satisfaction Since 2013, Bank Leumi has carried out the Leumi Pulse surveys –‎‎short and focused surveys that offer a fast and continuous up-to-date snapshot of employee perceptions about key aspects of the organizational culture, implementation of the vision and core values and cultural processes derived from them, and about leadership at the Bank and employee engagement. ‎‎ Bank Leumi carried out four Leumi Pulse surveys in 2015. The findings of the four surveys indicated a steady rise in the General Pulse Index and in each of the survey’s aspects (such as connectedness, leadership, Leumi 360, and innovation). ‎‎It is possible to point to a steady improvement in the Banking Division and Leumi Technologies Division. According to the September 2015 survey, 85% of employees feel that their managers trust them, and 80% perceive their colleagues as committed to their work. The surveys also found that the employees are proud of Bank Leumi, believe in its products, and work from the realization that they are part of a chain that handles the Bank’s customers. Bank Leumi also allows CofaceBDI to conduct an external objective survey on employee satisfaction at the Bank. ‎‎This survey is also used to rank the Bank in CofaceBDI’s Best Companies to Work For rankings. The surveys’ results are sent to the Bank’s management and are taken into account when drawing up recommendations for improvement. ‎‎ In 2015, CofaceBDI and The Marker ranked Bank Leumi fourth in the Best Companies to Work For, and as the number one organization in Israel’s financial system. ‎‎ Leumi Jobs: improving transparency in internal mobility and placement procedures ‎‎ In June 2014, a new online system went live, which allows employees (clerks and managers) to view available positions at the Bank and apply for them. The ‎‎ system marked a change in the organizational Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 115 culture, allowing employees to take an active role in managing their careers. In 2015, approximately 2,000 applications were submitted through the system, which was used to fill around 120 positions.‎‎ ‎Leumi Card ‎ ‎‎In 2015, CofaceBDI conducted an employee satisfaction survey, call center satisfaction survey, and company positions survey at Leumi Card. The objective of the company positions survey was to obtain a snapshot of three criteria: Ë The degree of employee engagement at the company Ë Perception of the organization culture (instilling the company’s values) Ë Perception of leadership at the company‎‎ 92% of the company’s responded to the survey, out of whom: 80% of employees said that they 83% of employees said that they were intended to continue working for the very proud or proud to work for Leumi company in the coming years. ‎‎ Card. CofaceBDI and The Marker ranked Leumi Card 25th in the Best Companies to Work For Ranking. ‎‎ Employee engagement and improved transparency‎‎ Leumi‎ A number of structured dialogue mechanisms have been established between management and employees in order to hold an open dialogue with employees and to allow them to express their positions, needs, and ideas to management, and to learn about the field and meet the employees. ‎‎The main points of the discussions and meetings are documented in order to gain understandings and produce initiatives for the future:‎‎ ËË Live meeting with the CEO: in 2015, two virtual meetings were held with the CEO. The conversation between the CEO and Bank Leumi employees was broadcast live. ‎‎Employees were invited to ask questions, either openly or anonymously, and the CEO responded to them on air. ‎‎ ËË Meetings between employees and the CEO and division heads: Over the year, initiated meetings were held between groups of employees and the CEO and division heads. These meetings make Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 116 it possible to hold an open and direct dialogue between management and diverse groups of employees. Members of management also visited branches and districts, where they spoke with small groups of employees. ËË Open line to the Human Resources Division management: in 2015, two open lines were maintained to the management of the Human Resources Division, which ‎‎ initiated conversations with employees on numerous subjects, including satisfaction from training and courses, information presented on the website, Leumi Jobs, merges, Leumi values, and improved transparency.

Procurement is carried out in a centralized manner for all of Bank Leumi’s units, including for some of the subsidiaries. The Bank Leumi Procurement Sub-Division is responsible for identifying suitable suppliers, screening vendors, requests for proposals, conducting negotiations, contracting suppliers and managing the ongoing relations with them. Procurement at Leumi is divided into technology procurement (hardware, software, product maintenance, and consultants), general procurement (office equipment, security and safety, deliveries, mailing, miscellaneous) and construction and maintenance procurement. The Group works with several suppliers that provide products specific to the banking industry, such as ATMs and machines for counting banknotes. More than 90% of the purchases is from local suppliers registered in Israel.‎‎The Leumi Group strives to maintain long-term, proper, and responsible relations with suitable suppliers, while maintaining an open dialogue with them in all areas of activity. ‎ Procurement data26 Ë ‎ In 2015, the Group contracted more than 1,400 suppliers.‎ Ë ‎ About 130 new suppliers joined the Leumi Group’s supplier pool this year.‎ Ë ‎ All the new suppliers were screened according to employment environment criteria (terms of employment, safety, etc.).‎ Ë As applicable, and depending on the type and extent of engagement, Leumi’s contracts with its suppliers include clauses regarding commitment to employee rights.‎ Ë ‎All of Leumi’s construction and maintenance suppliers were screened according to environmental criteria.‎ ‎ Implementing corporate social responsibility in procurement and in the supply chain requires taking into account two key aspects: responsible conduct with suppliers and enhancing the positive impact on the community through procurement.‎ 26 ‎The 2015 figures include overseas offices.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 151 Responsible conduct with suppliers ‎ ËË ‎Fair and ethical conduct when dealing with suppliers: In 2013, a charter was formulated based on the Leumi Way, outlining the Group’s conduct with its suppliers, with an emphasis on equality, transparency, sensitivity to conflicts of interest, exercising discretion, confidentiality, fairness, professionalism and protecting the environment.‎ ËË ‎Monitoring payments to suppliers: Leumi’s payment policy to its suppliers is “EOM + 30” (payment of up to 30 days after the end of the month in which the supplier issued the invoice).‎‎T‎‎he Payments Unit in the Finance Division conducts monitoring of the payment process to reduce possible arrears to suppliers. The process is examined frequently and measures are taken for its improvement as part of the dialogue with suppliers and adherence to good relations with them. ËË ‎Bringing forward payments to suppliers: At the request of the suppliers and at the Bank’s discretion, Leumi sometimes brings forward payments to suppliers.‎‎For example: ‎ 1. ‎ Making down payments where large projects are concerned:‎‎In large projects, suppliers are paid against receipt of deliverables.‎‎Sometimes, and when necessary, the Bank allows a down payment before receiving the initial deliverable in order to help the supplier finance initial costs.‎ 2. ‎Independent consultants are paid within 10 days of invoicing.‎ 3. ‎Prepayments are made in case of a supplier experiencing liquidity problems and by special request.‎ ËË ‎‎‎Dialogue with suppliers: Leumi operates a secure supplier portal, allowing the exchange of contract documents and invoices for payment in an efficient, rapid, and transparent manner between Leumi Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 152 and its suppliers‎. In addition, Leumi operates a web page for suppliers on the Leumi website, with general information on contracting with the Bank and other issues.‎ ‎Initiatives to promote responsible conduct with suppliers‎ ‎ ‎Procurement processes in the Procurement Sub-Division are performed while maintaining strict transparency with suppliers: ‎ Ë Price quotes are received through an online system, which allows for the submission of questions and giving a uniform response to all the suppliers participating in the procurement process. In addition, the phase of selecting the winning supplier is conducted while maintaining separation between aspects of quality and cost. Ë ‎Some of the procurement procedures such as real time tenders take place online, in order to increase transparency. Ë ‎The Procurement Sub-Division at Leumi insists on having the procurement process managed by two Bank representatives.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 153 Enhancing positive impact on the community through procurement ‎ ‎ Rising awareness about managing the supply chain and its impact on the environment and community is instilled in the selection process of suppliers and products. ‎‎‎Suppliers are required to state, as applicable, their compliance with issues such as air and water pollution, ground contamination, noise, odor, ionized and non-ionized radiation, waste, hazardous materials, business license, causing nuisances, harm to public health and the environment, liability for damage, and liability for employee safety and hygiene.‎‎ Currently, supplier evaluation includes three main subjects: ËË The supplier’s conduct with respect to employment: Fair and lawful employment. ËË The supplier’s conduct with respect to the environment, if relevant: air pollution, waste in production processes, use of green materials. ‎‎ ËË Proper and ethical conduct by the supplier: When collecting information about suppliers and, if relevant, warning signs are checked, including prior convictions of the supplier. ‎‎ Following a thorough evaluation of considerations related to corporate responsibility, social and environmentally-friendly procurement, the possibility of expanding the criteria for selecting suppliers and diversifying suppliers is being examined, including the supplier’s conduct with respect to human rights. ‎‎ Bank Leumi’s Procurement Sub-Division is responsible for managing relations with suppliers. The choice of suppliers is jointly made with other bank units. ‎‎Below are the relevant procurement processes and actions applied by the Group: ËË Employment conditions oversight: The Leumi Group takes care that the signing of contracts procedure include a declaration by companies providing services such as cleaning, security and catering, that they comply with the provisions of labor laws. The Leumi Group periodically uses an accountant on its behalf to sample service providers to verify that their employment conditions comply with the law. If the reviews uncover deficiencies, the companies are required to amend them. Cleaning, guarding, and catering service providers are required to issue assurances to keep the terms of the contract. These assurances are saved and used, inter alia, to ensure that the suppliers correct deficiencies that they were requested to correct, and to guarantee payments in accordance with the law and the protection of workers’ rights. Furthermore, by law, the Bank’s Public Complaints Bureau is a key factor in the handling of complaints by suppliers’ employees (if such complaints are received).‎‎ If a supplier is replaced for any reason, the replaced supplier’s employees have the legal right to switch to the new supplier and keep their seniority. The outgoing supplier must pay Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 154 the employees severance by law and the new supplier signs an agreement stipulating that it must comply with the law. ËË Weighted assessment of suppliers: Bank Leumi uses an automated method for assessing suppliers, which helps assess their performance and document the assessment score in the database. The Bank uses the data as an aid to assess suppliers in its procedures from time to time. ‎‎ ËË Giving construction suppliers an opportunity to participate in the procurement process: New suppliers are invited to present their operations before the construction suppliers search committee, which convenes from time to time, with the objective of giving numerous and diverse suppliers an opportunity to provide services to Bank Leumi. The committee examines new suppliers according to the standards set and on the basis of business information. Following the committee’s approval, the supplier is recorded in the Bank’s automated suppliers database, from which suppliers are chosen in various procurement processes. ‎‎ ËË Procurement from local suppliers at “price-list transactions”: Bank Leumi has about 100 “price-list suppliers”, which provide services or equipment (building or maintenance) according to the Bank’s price list. This method enables the bank to procure specific services from mid-sized local suppliers.‎‎ The Leumi Group also seeks to expand its positive impacts on the community by promoting local procurement by contracting suppliers which employ people with disabilities, suppliers which employ people from the ultra-orthodox community, and suppliers that operate in the periphery. Promoting social procurement‎‎ In 2015, Bank Leumi’s Central Procurement Unit procured products and services from businesses and NGOs, initiated procurement from young Israeli designers, and made NIS 3.4 million in purchases from Israeli start-ups, with the objective of supporting and developing these businesses. These data do not include independent procurement from NGOs by Bank Leumi units and divisions. ‎‎ Since 2008, Bank Leumi has procured services from high-tech companies which promote the hiring of people from underemployed sectors, primarily ultra-orthodox women. Procurement from these companies totaled approximately NIS 12 million In 2015. Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 155 Initiatives to enhance positive impact on the community through procurement‎ ‎Leumi‎ Ë Defining green procurement criteria: In 2015, the recommended environmental criteria for construction, maintenance, and electronic products procedures were updated with the objective of reducing the Bank’s environmental impact. The list mentions cleaning detergents, product packaging, biodegradation rate of the materials, use of recycled or easily recyclable materials, modularity and convenience of reuse, use of hazardous materials, energy and water resource conservation, and more. ‎‎ Ë In 2015, a process was jointly created with Maala, under which Bank Leumi asked 30 suppliers to fill out the Maala questionnaire for mid-sized businesses, to check their compliance with corporate responsibility norms, and to promote the issues among suppliers‎‎ ‎Leumi Card ‎ Employment conditions oversight at Leumi Card: ‎‎In 2015, as part of routine activity, satisfaction of contract workers with their employers’ conduct was sampled. Two complaints against employers were investigated during the year. In one case, the employer established an orderly response mechanism to employees’ questions and inquiries. In the second case, Leumi Card decided to replace the supplier. ‎‎ Procurements procedure revision ‎‎ In 2015, the company’s procurements procedure was revised; various changes and additions were made, including the addition of a reference to outsourcing, the setting of the principles for reporting Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 156 deficiencies, and the revision of work procedures for checking the economic background of suppliers.

All Group companies aim to conduct their activity in such a way as to consistently diminish adverse impacts on the environment, in compliance with legal obligations and, in the absence of legislation, with the aim of voluntarily adopting the accepted and leading standards in the sector.‎ ‎The main impact of the Leumi Group on the environment is derived from three main factors: ËË ‎‎Energy consumption:‎ ‎consumption of electricity, consumption of gasoline for transportation and consumption of diesel fuel for transport and emergency generators. ËË ‎Carbon footprint:‎ ‎derived from direct emissions (fuel consumption) and indirect emissions (consumption of electricity). ËË ‎Waste and water: responsible removal of electronic waste and paper waste, and total water consumption.‎ ‎The Group’s operations are characterized mainly by office activity, and most of the energy consumption is derived from the consumption of electricity in the main office buildings of Group companies, branches, and units. The Leumi Group makes significant efforts to identify actions that will improve efficiency and conserve energy. These efforts are reflected in steps taken to increase energy efficiency, which not only benefit the environment but also streamline operations regarding power consumption, air conditioning, lighting and fuel consumption. Leumi promotes energy savings when designing new facilities, and improves energy efficiency in existing facilities.‎ ‎The Building and Maintenance Sub-Division at Leumi is responsible for systematic annual measurement and the management of environmental issues by the Bank (at the Head Office level and branches) and for directing the subsidiaries. As part of this, a large amount of data is gathered, such as on power consumption, fuel consumption, water consumption, paper consumption, and about recycling of paper and of electronic waste.‎ ‎Furthermore, the Sub-Division leads processes to install systems and solutions leading to power savings and savings in fuel consumption, in collaboration with other units: ‎ ËË ‎Installation of control systems for power consumption ËË ‎Installation of an innovative computerized system that allows optimal use of the air conditioning system ‎ ËË ‎Installation of energy-saving lighting systems ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 159 ËË ‎Implementation of green building elements in new construction and renovation of existing branches ‎ ËË ‎Operation of an employee shuttle system between the main two headquarters buildings ‎ ËË ‎Installation of computerized systems for control of water consumption (including the overall management of water consumption, identifying leaks and abnormal consumption)‎ ‎This streamlining allows for a substantial reduction in both emissions of pollutants and the consumption of non-renewable resources.‎ ‎‎ ‎Bank Leumi and Leumi Card are certified for Environmental Management Standard ISO 14001 (in 2012 and 2009, respectively). As part of managing this issue, quarterly discussions are held regularly by the Group on its environmental impacts, accompanied by external parties (a consultancy company and the Standards Institution of Israel). Leumi is also certified for Energy Systems Management Standard ISO 50001, Safety Standard ISO 18001, and Quality Standard ISO 9001. Furthermore, in 2014 the Bank was the first financial institution in Israel to be certified for the Green Label for Service by the Standards Institution of Israel and the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The certifications for the standards were renewed In 2015.‎ ‎In addition to external standards, an internal standard for Green Conduct was introduced at Leumi. It provides for internal annual inspections on a series of environmental criteria to be carried out at the branches. ‎ ËË ‎Environmental Trustees: Environmental trustees have been appointed for all of Leumi’s branches as well as for headquarters. They are responsible for managing environmental issues (including energy conservation), and for monitoring power and water consumption data in their respective units. ËË ‎The Green Forum: The Green Forum was established in 2007 with the aim of promoting and developing environmental issues at the Leumi Group, with a focus on the direct impacts of the Group’s activities. The Forum includes representatives from all units of the Bank and the relevant subsidiaries, and meets once a quarter. The Forum is led by the Environment Supervisor at Leumi. Environmental issues are reported to the Group’s management and the board of directors once a year, as part of the discussions on corporate social responsibility.‎ ËË ‎‎Employee training:‎ ‎Leumi Group attaches great importance to instilling environmental content among employees. In addition to the activities of the environmental trustees and the Green Forum, Group employees are required to undergo training and refresher courses on environmental issues from time to time. Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 160 ‎In addition to managing direct environmental impacts as a result of the Bank’s activities, the Bank also examines the indirect impacts of its activities. These impacts, derived from the development of products of environmental value (for more information, please see the Customers chapter, under Development of environmentally-friendly products) and environmental risk management (for more information, please see the chapter Economic Impacts and Responsible Management, under Risk Management).‎ ‎Leumi is also working to reduce indirect impacts resulting from energy consumption. In this context, the Bank offers digital solutions that allow customers to receive service without having to visit the branch. This helps to reduce the distance driven by customers in order to receive service at the branches and to reduce air pollution and fuel consumption by the customers as well as paper usage . ‎ ‎ Note:‎T ‎ he data in the chapter “Creating Environmental Value” refer to the environmental performance of Bank Leumi (including Arab Israel Bank) and Leumi Card.

Accordingly, the Leumi Group implements projects and processes aimed at reducing its power consumption alongside projects to reduce its use of fuel. As of 2015, data on measuring power consumption were cleansed and was reinforced with measured and reported data on power consumption in the branches and in properties in which the electric charge is paid directly to the property management company. A comparison of the direct consumption data in 2015 to 2014 indicates a 3% decrease in the Group’s electricity consumption. ‎Total electricity consumption includes 85,000 kWh that were produced by photovoltaic cells and were sold back to Israel Electric Company.‎ ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 163 Energy intensity ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 164 ‎Leumi began to measure its energy intensity to test the effectiveness of measures taken to reduce the consumption of electricity and fuel. The intensity is measured by area (square meters)27 and by the number of employees at Bank Leumi (including the formerArab Israel Bank) and Leumi Card28. Between 2012 and 2015, there was a decrease in energy intensity, explained by the steps taken to increase energy efficiency.‎ ‎Initiatives to reduce energy consumptio‎n ‎‎Leumi‎ Transition to consumption of electricity produced from natural gas: As of 2014, Leumi consumes most of its electricity from a company generating power using natural gas. This move greatly reduced Leumi’s carbon footprint and negative environmental impact. ‎ ‎ Optimization of air conditioning systems: Improving the efficiency of existing air conditioning systems and turning off air conditioners at a designated time. ‎ ‎ Replacement of lighting fixtures with cost-effective lighting: In 2015, several steps were taken in this area in the branches and headquarters buildings. O ‎ bsolete and inefficient lighting fixtures were replaced with new, more efficient fixtures. Furthermore, several LED-type lighting fixtures were installed, which are characterized by high-energy efficiency and a very long life span.‎ ‎ Energy surveys:‎‎An energy survey was carried out by an external company in the Bank’s secondary computer site and internal energy surveys were carried out at branches (by Bank staff).‎ Remote energy monitoring: Installing remote monitoring and control systems for electricity consumption at the branches and expanding existing systems for building control in the management buildings and headquarters units.‎ Analysis of energy consumption characteristics at the branches: The Bank frequently installs energy monitoring systems and intelligent building systems at the branches and headquarters buildings, that allow for the analysis of energy consumption characteristics at the headquarters and branches.‎ Thermal coating of windows: The Bank installs a transparent coating with thermal insulation properties 27 A total of 292,686 square meters in 2015.‎‎The area of the Arab Israel Bank in 2015 is based on the Bank’s operating areas in 2014.‎ 28 The total number of employees in 2015 was 11,102.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 165 in order to reduce the penetration of radiant heat through the windows. ‎ Circulated air treatment system: A circulated air filtering system was installed in the existing air conditioning system in order to reduce the entry of warm and moist air from the outside. This system leads to energy savings. The Bank intends to install additional systems. ‎ Green building:‎‎When opening a new branch and in a massive renovation of an existing branch, environmental aspects are integrated such as thermal window coating on warm facades, remote control systems and more.‎ ‎Leumi Card ‎ ‎ Carbon offsetting: As part of setting goals to reduce energy consumption, and taking into account that it leases space in shared buildings, the Company decided to invest in carbon offsetting. Carbon offsetting can be done by funding projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions outside the organization for example, by funding energy efficiency projects, improving waste management or planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide).‎‎Leumi Card chose to support one of the entities that the Company has adopted as part of its investment in the community. The selected initiative is funding of an installation of a solar roof in Kfar Ofarim, a home for autistic adults in Ramat Hasharon.‎ ‎ Energy efficiency: It has been decided that, in every renovation or construction of a new building, light bulbs are to be replaced with T5 type energy saving light bulbs; a Virtualization Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) system was installed which virtualizes desktops across all computers in the organization; times were set to turn off air conditioning and lighting on certain hours at the end of each workday; and controllers were purchased to reduce energy consumption by lighting circuits. ‎ ‎Fuel consumption ‎ The Leumi Group’s fuel consumption is mainly for its fleet of vehicles. In 2015, 2,089,422 liters of gasoline and 16,931 liters of diesel fuel were consumed. ‎ Initiatives to reduce fuel consumption ‎Leumi‎ ‎Leumi Shuttle service for employees: In order to save fuel and optimize employees’ transit between the two management and service centers, located in Tel Aviv and Lod, Leumi contracted a transportation company to provide a regular shuttle service between the two sites. ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 166 ‎ Transportation service for employees:‎‎Leumi operates a transportation service for hundreds of headquarters employees to and from work in a coordinated, planned and effective manner.‎ ‎ Bicycle parking and showers for cyclists: As part of the promotion of sustainable transport at Leumi, bicycle parking spaces were built at headquarters in Tel Aviv and in the Leumi Service Campus in Lod (where Administration and Operations are located). Showers were also installed for employees who choose to come to work by bicycle and wish to freshen up after a morning’s ride. Some Leumi employees indeed prefer to come to work every day by bicycle and give up on travel by car.‎ ‎Leumi Card ‎ ‎ Reducing the distance driven by employees: As part of its efforts to reduce the distance driven by employees, Leumi Card has set a limit on mileage in leisure time for employees using company vehicles. Under this procedure, the Company allows its employees a maximum of 2,000 km per month for driving during leisure time. If an employee exceeds this average, he/she is charged for the extra mileage. In addition, Leumi Card encourages employees to come to work by bicycle, and has installed dedicated parking spaces for this purpose. ‎ Carbon footprint ‎ As part of its environmental policy, in addition to monitoring processes and measurement of its resource consumption, there is a regular calculation of greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the Group’s activities (energy consumption, fuel combustion, kilometers traveled, etc.). Data is reported by Bank Leumi as part of several reporting platforms: the international reporting initiative Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection’s voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emissions Registry in Israel, the annual Social Corporate Responsibility Report and the Maala rating.‎ ‎ The systematic management of the issue relates to two main areas: ËË ‎direct emissions: In accordance with the reporting standard29 of greenhouse gas emissions, the Leumi Group’s direct impact (Scope 1) of greenhouse gases stem mainly from the combustion of gasoline by the organization’s vehicle fleet, from the combustion of diesel fuel generators used for emergencies, and from emissions of refrigerant gases from the air conditioning systems in the Group’s facilities.‎ 29 http://www.ghgprotocol.org/about-ghgp Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 167 ËË ‎indirect emissions: Indirect emissions (Scope 2) stem from power consumption. Indirect emissions depend on the composition of fuels and the technologies with which the electricity is produced. ‎ ‎The carbon footprint of the Leumi Group in 2015 is 40,422 tons of CO2eq. The footprint is considerably smaller (13.7%) than that measured in 2014, due to a significant reduction in indirect (Scope 2) emissions, which represent about 84% of the carbon footprint of Group companies in Israel. The reduction of the Group’s carbon footprint is due to the widespread transition to consumption of electricity produced by natural gas and energy efficiency measures. About 76% of the electricity consumed by Leumi In 2015 was produced by independent power producers using efficient technologies and natural gas.‎ ‎In 2015, the Bank began measuring the emissions caused by its use of cooling gas.‎‎As a result, an increase can be seen in emissions associated with Scope 130.‎ 30 In 2015, Bank Leumi was the only group company to measure emissions riginating from cooling gas.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 168 2012 2013 2014 2015 B ‎ ank Leumi & 4375 4154 3718 4942 former Arab ‎Scope 1‎ Israel Bank‎ ‎Leumi Card 1,780 1,602 1,546 1,390 B ‎ ank Leumi & 71,567 61,049 37,478 32,181 former Arab ‎Scope 2‎ Israel Bank‎ ‎Leumi Card ‎ 5,106 4,360 4,070 1,909 ‎ ank Leumi & B 75,942 65,203 41,196 37,123 former Arab ‎ Total ‎ Israel Bank‎ ‎Leumi Card 6,886 ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 169 Carbon footprint reduction ‎ As mentioned above, the Leumi Group invests significant efforts in identifying measures that would result in greater efficiency and energy savings which would have direct impact on the Group’s carbon footprint and on climate change. ‎These efforts are mainly reflected in steps such as transition to electricity produced by natural gas. The results of the process are evident in the decline in carbon footprint intensity (ton of CO2eq per square meter) for the Leumi Group between 2012 and 2015.‎ ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 170 Recycling and responsible evacuation ‎The Group’s commitment to environmental protection includes responsible disposal of its waste. Most of the waste generated by the Group is electronic waste and paper waste. The waste is collected and sent for evacuation by licensed contractors ‎ In 2015, paper consumption by Bank Leumi and Leumi Card totaled 1,032 tons and 10 tons, respectively. Paper recycling exceeded paper consumption because of archive reduction and the closing of branches. ‎‎ Leumi ËË The paperless bank project: In 2015, Bank Leumi announced the “paperless bank project”, with the objective of substantially reducing the Bank’s paper consumption. Leumi defined an innovative organizational concept, which includes the use of advanced paper-saving technologies. These include signing up customers to “green mails”, where they receive digital mail instead of paper-based mail; the launch of the digital check service online payment of bills; and automation of in-house work procedures. Major paper-intensive work procedures at the branches were also identified in order to reduce paper consumption in 2016. ‎‎ ËË Use of recycled paper: The full use of printers recycled paper began at several Bank Leumi units in 2015, and its use will be expanded in the coming years. Leumi Card ‎ ‎Leumi Card has handled waste in accordance with the working procedures defined in the ISO 14001 Standard since 2009. The company’s waste is sent for recycling and eco-safe disposal. The organization has placed special containers for the collection of paper, batteries, beverage containers, toners, feminine hygiene products, electronic equipment, and medication. In addition, there are clear working procedures regarding the removal of construction waste (in licensed landfill sites and collection of used light bulbs for recycling).‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 172 Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 173 Objectives Results ‎Creating environmental value ‎ ‎Company ‎ ‎Objective as at end of 2015 ‎ ‎ Status ‎ ‎ Explanation ‎ Overall reduction of 1% There was a 2.8% decrease in in power consumption electricity consumption in comparison compared to 2014.‎ with 2014; excludes electricity ‎Done ‎ consumption in properties where the electricity is consumed indirectly – which was first measured in 2015. ‎”Green mail”:‎ ‎Sending ‎Leumi‎ automated emails to the banking division’s customers instead of ‎Done ‎ letters increasing the number of customers who have joined the service by 28,000.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 174 ‎Creating environmental value ‎ ‎Company ‎ ‎Objective as at end of 2015 ‎ ‎ Status ‎ ‎ Explanation ‎ ‎Leumi Card ‎ ‎Holding an “awareness ‎Delayed for 2016.‎ week” on reducing ‎Not environmental impacts by performed employees in the workplace and in private homes.‎ ‎Creating dedicated content ‎Delayed for 2016.‎ on environmental activities ‎Not for the organizational performed portal.‎ E mployee training on ‎ E ach year, all employees undergo ‎ environmental protection.‎ refresher training on protecting the ‎ Done environment.‎‎Also, each new employee in the organization is required to undergo such training.‎ ‎Reducing paper ‎Actions are taken to monitor the work consumption by 10% processes at the print centers.‎ ‎B y ‎ partial by switching to printing generating reports for managers, paper centers.‎ consumption fell by 9%.‎ ‎Continuation of control and ‎A decrease of 9% in fuel consumption monitoring of the 2,000 km during leisure time compared to the procedure to reduce fuel ‎ Done previous year.‎T‎ he number of vehicles consumption in leisure time.‎ deviating from quota was reduced by two. ‎ ‎ Passing the annual ‎Each year, an in-house inspection is inspection conducted by conducted by the Standards Institution ‎Done ‎ the Standards Institution on regulatory compliance.‎ of Israel.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 175 ‎Objective for 2016 ‎ ‎Main actions planned ‎ ‎Leumi‎ Overall reduction of 1% in power consumption Refitting of old air conditioning compared to 2015.‎ systems, replacement of light bulbs, use of control systems, etc.‎ ‎Ongoing rapport with all ‎Establishing a training system environmental trustees.‎ for environmental trustees through courses, tutorials, etc., in accordance with an annual work plan.‎ Increasing the use of recycled paper Encouraging the branches and consumption measured in 2015 by 10%.‎ headquarters to transition to recycled paper. ‎ ‎Leumi Card ‎ ‎Passing the annual inspection conducted by ‎Compliance with ISO 14001 the Standards Institution of Israel.‎ procedures and protecting the environment in all organizational activities.‎ ‎Holding an “awareness week” on reducing ‎Editing content and holding an environmental impacts by employees in the “awareness week”.‎ workplace and in private homes.‎ Creating dedicated content on environmental Creating dedicated content for activities for the organizational portal. the organizational portal. ‎Employee training on environmental protection‎. ‎Updating content and distributing the tutorial at the beginning of the year.‎ ‎Continued control and monitoring of the 2,000 ‎Monitor and control the use of km procedure for reducing fuel consumption leisure time fuel consumption in leisure time‎. and notify non-compliant drivers. ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 176 Corporate governance Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 177 ‎As a complex financial organization, the Leumi Group requires strong corporate governance and management mechanisms that allow for coordination, control, and optimal risk management.

However, the agenda and raising the issues for the agenda of the meetings of the Audit Committee or the Remuneration Committee is subject to the sole discretion of the chairpersons of the Audit Committee or Remuneration Committee, as applicable.‎ ‎Social and environmental issues, as well as aspects of corporate governance, are discussed by the board Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 181 of directors and its committees as necessary and/or as required by law. In general, the President and Chief Executive Officer, with the assistance of the Head of the Human Resources Division, manages all interactions regarding employees, subject to the receipt of appropriate approvals from the board of directors, if required.

By law, the Bank must publish a prior notice regarding the convening of a general meeting if its agenda includes the election of directors, and may also include in the notice other topics on the agenda, at least 21 days prior to publication of the notice regarding the convening of the general meeting. The Bank publishes timely invitations to general meetings, according to law. The notice includes the proposed agenda and the majority required for the various decisions.‎‎In accordance with the law, all General meeting resolutions are published through the Magna System by way of an immediate report.‎ ‎ Preventing conflicts of interest ‎ Leumi operates in accordance with the legal regulatory provisions regarding conflicts of interest, including the provisions of the Companies Law and Directives 301 and 312 of the Supervisor of Banks. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Law, a director of the Bank has a fiduciary duty to the Bank and must act in good faith and for the best interest of the Bank. Pursuant to these provisions, no person shall serve as a director of the Bank, if their business or current occupations creates a permanent conflict of interest between them and the corporation. The Bank’s procedures determine mechanisms for avoiding of conflicts of interest situations (even when they are not conflicts of interest of a permanent nature), such as the prohibition on releasing background material and the prohibition on participating in discussions and decision-making of the board of directors and its committees. ‎ At the time of their appointment and periodically, all directors are asked to provide information about positions held by them or their relatives and/or their holdings, or their relatives’ holdings, in corporations, which may be considered as being in conflict with the Bank’s interests. ‎ ‎ In addition, Leumi’s Chairman of the Board does not serve as a manager at the Bank, and the chairpersons of the subsidiaries’ boards of directors in Israel do not serve, as a rule, as managers in those companies. ‎ ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 182 Monitoring performance and risk management The board of directors oversees the management’s actions and monitors them by means of several mechanisms, including: ‎ ËË ‎Every six weeks, the board of directors receives a monthly report on the Bank’s financial position, submitted in writing by Leumi’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and discusses it. ‎ ËË ‎Following the Audit Committee’s recommendation, the Board discusses the Bank’s annual and quarterly financial statements and approves them.‎ ËË ‎‎‎Every quarter, the board of directors discusses Leumi’s financial position according to the quarterly financial statements, as well as a quarterly risk document which presents the Bank’s and Group’s risk profile. In addition, each new significant product requires approval by the board of directors.‎ ËË ‎Every six months, the board of directors discusses the report of Leumi’s President and Chief Executive Officer on the implementation of her decisions. The board of directors has various tools for maintaining proper supervision, including deliverables of the internal audit and control functions (such as the Internal Auditor, Risk Manager, Compliance Officer), and external functions (such as the independent auditor). ‎ ËË ‎The board of directors has defined a list of unusual events about which it wishes to receive reports. In accordance with the work plan approved by the board of directors, the Internal Audit Division, as part of the audits carried out at a predetermined frequency, also examines implementation of the Board’s resolutions on the matters being examined and the process for monitoring the board of directors’ decisions.‎ ËË ‎Any material deviation from limits approved by the board of directors is brought to the board of directors for approval. ‎ ËË ‎The board of directors maintains supervision and control mechanisms over the Leumi Group’s subsidiaries. ‎ ËË ‎The Risk Management Committee of the board of directors receives regular periodic reports on relevant issues, including from the Chief Risk Officer, and submits its recommendations on these issues to the board of directors plenum. In addition, the Chief Risk Officer reports to the Committee effective immediately, and if necessary to the board of directors as well on any issue, finding, or deficiency under her purview that could materially affect Leumi’s risk management and/or business. The Chief Risk Officer may decide on other issues that are to be brought for further discussion and examination by the Risk Management Committee.‎ ‎‎Assessing the board of directors’ performance ‎ ‎ Leumi has a process of self-assessment of the board of directors through questionnaires relating to various management aspects of its work and committees, including responsibility for the Bank’s and Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 183 the Group’s strategy, the delegating of tasks to the committees, issues relating to management, the remuneration policy, and the Code of Ethics. As part of this control and internal governance, the board of directors reviews findings arising from the self-assessment questionnaires. In addition, the board of directors periodically updates the board of directors’ working procedure, which is also based on the provisions of the law that apply to it. This procedure stipulates, inter alia, the duties of the board of directors and its powers, and the Board’s committees, the work methods of the board of directors and of its committees, including the reports presented to them, as well as matters and transactions that are to be brought for approval by the board of directors.‎ Remuneration of officeholders ‎All directors serving on Leumi’s board of directors, excluding the Chairman of the Board, receive remuneration and reimbursement of expenses in accordance with the law regarding external directors’ remuneration. The Chairman of the Board’s terms of employment were approved by the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the board of directors, and the general meeting.‎ ‎In February 2014, Bank Leumi’s general meeting approved a remuneration policy for Bank’s officeholders for the years 2013-2016 (following approval by the board of directors and in accordance with the approval and recommendations of the Remuneration Committee). The remuneration policy is based on the provisions of Amendment 20 to the Companies Law regarding terms of service and employment of officeholders at a Bank and that stipulated in the Proper Conduct of Banking Business Directive No. 301A (hereinafter, Directive 301A) concerning remuneration policy in a banking corporation. T‎he remuneration policy is designed to reward officeholders in the Bank in accordance with the Bank’s performance and profitability over time, including according to the Bank’s and Group’s long-term targets, and according to the actual contribution of the officeholders to achieving these performance targets. The remuneration policy includes, among other things, a reference to the salary component, additional benefits, retirement terms and annual bonus component. ‎ ‎The Remuneration Committee gives its recommendation to the board of directors on the Bank’s Remuneration Policy and the remuneration of officeholders and executives of the Bank. The Committee comprises EDs and external directors pursuant to the provisions of the Bank of Israel. If necessary, the Remuneration Committee is assisted, inter alia, by external independent consultants. ‎ ‎Further information on the remuneration policy of officeholders can be found in the Bank’s remuneration policy, which is published as Appendix A to the Bank’s immediate report dated April 5, 2014, regarding the convening of a special meeting which approved the remuneration policy (reference:‎2 ‎ 014-01-003985).‎ ‎On April 12, 2016 the Law of Officeholder Remuneration in Financial Corporations (Special Permit and Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 184 Non Tax-Deductible Expenses Due to Exceptional Remuneration), 2016 was published in the Official Gazette, (hereinafter:‎‎the “Law of Remuneration Limit”) which provides, inter alia, that the determination of remuneration for a bank employee (including an officeholder of the bank), the expected expenditure for which (in accordance with GAAP) is expected to be more than NIS 2.5 million per year, is subject to approval by the competent organs of the bank (in accordance with the approval mechanisms provided for this purpose in the law), and that in this case, a bank employee’s remuneration the cost of which is expected to be 35 times (or higher than) that of the lowest paid bank employee (including contract workers working at the bank) in the year preceding the date of approval of the contract, may not be approved.‎‎Under the Remuneration Limit Law, a transitory provision was included, whereby the provisions shall apply to any officeholder whose contract was approved from 12 April 2016 and the agreements approved prior to this date will be updated and will be adapted to the contracts approved prior to that date, updated and adapted to the Remuneration Limit Law until October 11.‎ ‎Accordingly, the Bank is working to adapt the remuneration policy to the requirements of the Remuneration Limit Law and revised provision A301.‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 185 External Assurance and Index Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 186 External assurance External assurance: Bank Leumi Group, Corporate Social Responsibility Report for 2015‎ Introduction ‎The Corporate Social Responsibility Institute is an independent public entity promoting corporate social responsibility among corporations. ‎The Institute is part of the College of Law and Business, a private law and business management college (accredited by the National Council for Higher Education). The Institute holds professional meetings, writes reports, studies and market surveys, and localizes applicative methodologies from around the world, etc. Corporations’ transparency and accountability regarding their social and environmental impacts is one of the issues at the heart of the Institute’s activity. I‎n June 2016, the Leumi Group asked the Center to perform a quality assurance process on its 2015 corporate social responsibility report. ‎ The quality assurance process is conducted by Mr. Liad Ortar, who is Director of the Institute. I‎n addition to this role, Mr. Ortar is a researcher who publishes papers on sustainability reporting, a lecturer at universities in Israel and around the world, and a major figure in the area of corporate social responsibility and transparency in Israel. ‎ It is hereby declared that the Institute receives payment to cover the time invested in this process. I‎n addition, it is hereby noted that neither the Institute nor Mr. Liad Ortar (who performed the work) have business relationships with the Leumi Group and that the quality assurance process was independent‎. ‎During the quality assurance process, a draft of the report was examined and several work meetings were held to clarify various issues. S‎ ome have already been addressed in this report , and some may be incorporated into future reports. ‎ Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 187 Methodology ‎ The aim of the quality assurance process for corporate responsibility reports is, first and foremost, to improve the final reporting product by providing professional feedback. F‎ or the avoidance of doubt, it is a process that is integral to the reporting process and aims at rapid and correct implementation, as far as possible, of the professional comments which are provided during the work process. ‎The assurance process for this report was carried out in accordance with the principles of quality assurance standard AA1000 of the AccountAbility organization. Liad ‎Ortar is a certified assurance provider by this organization. I‎n addition, we examine whether the report is in line with three key principles: 1. ‎Inclusiveness – full coverage of the topics from the reporting process and reporting parties and inclusion of a wide range of stakeholders in the report. 2. ‎ Materiality – coverage of the topics material to the company’s activity. 3. ‎ Responsiveness – reporting on topics raised by stakeholders. ‎ This report was found to be in line with these principles. ‎ It should be noted that the process for identifying materiality, which Leumi participated in, is particularly noteworthy in terms of its stakeholder engagement approach. It is a comprehensive, in-depth report that is on a par with the world’s leading banks’ reports. ‎ Findings ‎This is the Leumi Group’s seventh published SCR report. It is in line with the entire local banking segment’s adoption of SCR reporting, as required by the Supervisor of Banks. The company has adopted the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) new reporting guidelines, G4, complying with the Comprehensive reporting requirements. I‎ hereby declare that the Leumi Group does comply with the disclosure and reporting scope required for this level. ‎ Here are the main recommendations for the continued improvement of the Leumi Group’s reporting:  ‎The process of determining material aspects for reporting as rightly noted in the report, the Leumi Group is one of the largest and most influential financial corporations in Israel. I‎t is recommended that, in addition to the global and domestic research it carries out, the Group will examine macroand micro-economic policy papers published by official state bodies such as the Ministry of Finance, Bank of Israel and OECD. ‎It is also recommended that the policy documents of non-governmental organizations be taken into account. ‎These papers can provide a snapshot of Israeli society and Leumi Group Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2015 | 188 identify the economic challenges faced by it. ‎It is clear to all that in order to meet these challenges, the banking sector should be an integral part of the effort.  ‎(Direct) dialogue with stakeholders engaging (or dialoguing) with stakeholders is an essential part of the process of prioritizing the reporting aspects (hereinafter: materiality). I‎n recent years, the banking sector is leading the trend of non-financial reporting in Israel, mainly due to regulatory requirements, but it was a leader in that area even before these requirements were issued. The Bank is therefore expected to be directly involved in every dialogue process. ‎Any activity carried out on its behalf but without its presence, however important, cannot be included or presented as a dialogue process.  ‎Implementation of social responsibility in real corporations held by the Group the Leumi Group is a shareholder in several real corporations. These holdings are substantial and the Group has its own representatives on these corporations’ boards of directors. A ‎ s a leader in the field of corporate responsibility in Israel, the Leumi Group’s impact should be expressed in the administrative functions it uses in these corporations. M ‎ oreover, these representatives have official responsibility as officers. ‎This topic is not, but should be, covered by the report.
