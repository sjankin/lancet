Social Responsibility 2013 Maxibit Screenbolaget i Stockholm AB 1 Maxibit Worldwide AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se A responsible and profitable business is based on ethical considerations as well as financial. Christian Ahlberg CRDO, Maxibit 2 Screenbolaget i Stockholm AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se True to the original core values An interesting fact about Maxibit is that the original concept has never changed. In the 70s Erik Ahlberg started with the idea to provide a set of quality marketing tools to the leading premium brand companies. He created a lightweight, portable, and reusable solution that was more environmentally friendly than the booths built by craftsmen. By pioneering the portable marketing industry with great innovations Maxibit created a new world standard – a standard that today is taken for granted. Maxibit Core Values  Optimize the customer experience  Swedish designed portable premium brand stands  User centric innovations  Environmental sustainability 3 Screenbolaget i Stockholm AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se Table of content A summary of 2013 ...................................................................................... 5 Project 1 – Collecting product specifications ................................................... 5 Project 2 – Recycling ................................................................................... 6 Office recycling ...................................................................................................6 Limit paper waste ...............................................................................................6 Toner cartridges .................................................................................................7 Project 3 – Energy efficiency ......................................................................... 7 Education, Seminars, CSR Reference Group, Conscious Consumption .............. 8 The importance of environmental education..........................................................8 Maxibit Sustainability Policy Education ..................................................................8 Social Responsibility Day .....................................................................................8 Reference group for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) .....................................9 Maxibit 1 % Back Programme ......................................................................10 Contributions 2008 ........................................................................................... 10 Maxibit – a member of UN Global Compact ..................................................12 Maxibit and the UN Global Compact 10 Principles 2008 ........................................ 12 Improvements .............................................................................................14 The Code of Conduct includes requirements concerning ....................................... 16 Workers ........................................................................................................... 16 Environmental requirements for suppliers ........................................................... 18 4 Screenbolaget i Stockholm AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se A summary of 2013 Maxibit 2013 The company Maxibit Worldwide AB with its history dating back to 1978 went into a new partnership with Screenbolaget I Stockholm AB. Screenbolaget signed an exclusive agreement with the former Maxibit owners to license all rights to patents, brand names and designs related to Maxibit. This took the Maxibit operation a giant leap forward giving Maxibit access to Screenbolagets’ graphic production capacity. Screenbolagets’ general business ethics, triple A-rating and approvals such as ISO 14001 and “Svanen” fits well into Maxibits strive for an ethic and sustainable business and meeting the goals connected with the 10 principles of UNGC. More and more parts of our products are made, either completely or partly, by recycled material. All parts are made to be recycled. UNGC-related demands on the supply chain has naturally increased as an effect hereof. The 10 UNGC participles continues to take a more central role in R&D and stake holder communication. The CEO of “Maxibit” has promoted these issues especially threw diverse marketing communications and threw his participation in the Swedish Government's group for CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). Project 1 – Collecting product specifications In a joint effort with our suppliers, Maxibit continued the project to collect material specifications for all Maxibit products. The list of products now include all major products, components and parts. The work continues. By collecting product specifications, Maxibit will be able to look at, in details, each product and thus be able to see if there are parts that need to be changed in order to make a more environmentally sound product. One of Maxibits goals are to be able to offer customers a carbon footprint of each product. This work continues with the “Sustainable Analytics”, implemented in 2011, into the standard CAD & R&D process. Project 2 – Recycling It is very important that we, in the business community, take responsibility to reduce the amount of waste we produce. Waste has an extremely negative effect on our planet. Through recycling we can reduce pollution caused by waste, we can reduce the need for new raw materials and help preserve natural resources. Maxibit works with one of the largest recycling facilities in Sweden, to minimize waste and maximize recycling in both the office and the warehouse. This work continues and has intensified thanks to the joined venture with Screenbolaget. Maxibits staff are being continuously updated on new technological advances in the recycle industry. This cooperation is ongoing. Improved office recycling Recycling of all office material is mandatory and continuously improved. In the lunch room recycle bins are used, waste generating food is advised against, energy efficient washing is mandatory, soda machines are replaced by tap water. Sales car fleet 5 Screenbolaget i Stockholm AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se In keeping with Maxibit's environmental commitment, Maxibit has changed the policy for company cars to be as environmentally sound as possible to help reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide. But who needs a car anyway? Maxibit promotes all staff to bike or walk when possible. In fact, the CEO walks the talk and bikes 34 km to the office in sun, rain, hail and snow. Limit paper waste Already in 2008 Maxibit stopped the printing of brochures, price lists and product sheets. With printing orders of 20 000 A4 brochures, 8 000 A5 price lists biannually, and around 1 000 product sheets annually, we calculate a saving of roughly 3 500 kilos of paper every two years. This policy is still adopted. All Maxibit brochures and product sheets are available to download as PDF’s on the Maxibit website, and the price lists, also PDF’s, are sent digitally per request to customers. Instead of printing inspirational images for customer meetings, Maxibit show these images via phones connected to the Internet or on laptops brought to the meeting. Maxibit continues to encourage all suppliers to stop sending paper invoices to Maxibit and promote them to send digital invoices instead. At the same time, the policy to use digital invoices to customers continues. Toner cartridges Maxibit continues to recycle used toner cartridges. Project 3 – Energy efficiency Light fixture, computers and computer monitors are shut down as soon as the office hours are finished to save energy. In the office we use fluorescent ceiling lights that are more energy efficient than traditional light bulbs. A shift towards even more efficient light sources are continuously explored. During 2012 the shift to LED lamps on customer orders became standard and is still adopted. Education, Seminars, CSR Reference Group The importance of environmental education It is widely agreed that education is the most effective way to get people to understand how we interact with and are dependent on natural ecosystems. To save the ecosystems for the next generation we have to learn how we should work and live to protect them. Most of us want to do the right thing but do not always have the know-how. Through education, workshops and seminars Maxibit are striving to give its employees a greater understanding of how each and every one of us can make a difference. Maxibit Sustainability Policy Education In the beginning of 2009 the annual seminar ‘Maxibit Sustainability Policy’ was held for the employees of Maxibit HQ. Every aspect of the policy was discussed and explained 6 Screenbolaget i Stockholm AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se to the further understanding as to why Maxibit has chosen to work with these issues. The employees got an opportunity to add their comments and a unanimous decision was made to give World Wildlife Found and The Childrens Villages a contribution in 2009. The efforts in this spirit continues. Reference group for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) The participation in the Swedish Governments Group for CSR in ongoing and Christian Ahlberg a regular participant. Outside the CSR-forum, Mr Ahlberg blogges about the UNGC and the importance about involving SME into the UNGC community. Community sponsoring During 2012 a number of students working with environment, quality or innovation has been supported by Maxibit as well as dedicated people in local youth athletics. Maxibit was also a sponsor of the sustainable focused event “Innovations Days”. At this event Maxibit specifically promoted the UN Global Compact initiative. Maxibit – a member of UN Global Compact “The UN Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.” [Source: http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/index.html, 20090112] Maxibit got its membership, as the first company in the portable marketing industry, approved by the UN Global Compact (GC) in 2007. Believing in the value of the GC’s 10 principles, Maxibit has made an effort to promote the UN Global Compact to the business community in a variety of ways. On the Maxibit website there is information about the UN Global Compact and an abbreviated version of its 10 Principles, http://www.maxibit.com/about/csr/. Maxibit also made a decision to print the UN Global Compact web address on Maxibit product sheets and brochures that are sent to customers in the premium market segment. Maxibit has also produced a short film about the importance of ethical business and the environment and the values of the UN Global Compact program – “The Greener Choice”. This film is available at http://www.youtube.com/maxibitab. Principle 1 Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. To ensure that the employees at the manufacturing plant are provided with a safe work environment Christian Ahlberg, “Maxibit” CEO visits important plants on a regular basis. We also check that the production process follows the environmental demands of the Maxibit Code of Conduct. Principle 2 Business should make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses. All Maxibit suppliers have to sign the Maxibit Code of Conduct where they agree to fair 7 Screenbolaget i Stockholm AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se business practice. The agreement states that all employees have the right to a safe and comfortable working environment, that child labour and forced labour is not tolerated, the wages have to be fair, overtime must be paid, work hours regulated, that there are freedom of association and that there is no discrimination due to gender, religion, sexual preference, age, disability, political or union membership.

Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. All Maxibit suppliers have to sign the Maxibit Code of Conduct ensuring that they use no forced labour. Before any agreements are signed with a potential supplier the purchaser visits the manufacturing plant to assess the working conditions and the production process. Human rights and environmental guidelines must correspond to the Maxibit Code of Conduct. The Maxibit HQ leadership group have discussed the potential need to find an independent foundation to make sure that the Code of Conduct is continually being adhered to. At the main plant this is now practised on a regular basis. Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labour.

Principle 7 Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Threw the work with UNGC, the attendance at the UNGC Summit 2010 and the work in the CSR-reference group the staff, partners and stakeholders are being updated with benchmark possibilities and best practices in sustainability. Films from previous stakeholder events can be found at Maxibits Youtube channel. Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Maxibit decided to stop printing concept brochures, price lists and product sheets and instead offer our customers a digital version through the Maxibit website and via email. This saves the environment almost 3.5 tonnes of paper biannually. To minimize the exhaust of carbon dioxide Maxibit has reinforced its company car policy. 8 Screenbolaget i Stockholm AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se The Maxibit employee includes responsibilities for all staff at Maxibit. Recycle bins are available in the lunchroom to take care of aluminium cans, plastic containers, glass bottles, paper cartons and cardboard boxes. Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. To transfer graphic material, brochures or other marketing material to partners and end-users Maxibit has set up an FTP-server where they can pick up and drop of material. This saves Maxibit wasting CD’s and DVD’s and the environment energy and pollutants. For customer visits reusable USB memory sticks hold marketing materials.
