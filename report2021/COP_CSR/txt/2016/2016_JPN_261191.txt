This policy formalized guidelines for practicing the Omron Principles in our manufacturing activities. As every employee involved in manufacturing learns and practices this policy, we will create greater value for customers and better solutions to social issues. And, as we communicate our policy to customers, suppliers, and partners, we will create a foundation of mutual trust and understanding. These long-term mutually cooperative relationships we build will lead to even greater advancements in our manufacturing capabilities. Where We re Headed 1 ▶ Quality first Our top priority is delivering products to customers at the promised levels of quality. The accepted convention is that a trade-off exists between cost and quality. At Omron, we don t believe in trade-offs; we believe in keeping our promises and delivering products of the highest quality to our customers. Corporate Value Initiatives 2 ▶ 3F (Front-loading, Flowing & Flexible) By front-loading, we mean integrating customers demands for value into our earliest stages of product development. We imbue our products and services with this value, delivering what our customers need, in the volumes they need, when they need it (Flowing & Flexible). Corporate Value Foundation 3 ▶ H&E (Human-oriented & Eco-manufacturing) We conduct Human-oriented manufacturing, rather than the type of manufacturing in which people become subservient to machines. By seamlessly integrating the relationship between human and machine, we create higher levels of productivity and an advanced production floor in which everyone involved in manufacturing can contribute their talents, intuition, and experience. Materials, water, electricity, land, Financial Section buildings, and other resources are in finite supply. Omron believes in sustainable Eco-manufacturing that uses these resources with respect. Omron Eco-manufacturing technology provides the world with an example of how to conserve materials and energy, while producing high-quality products. Integrated Report 2016 41 Factory Tour Healthcare Business Matsusaka Factory The Omron Matsusaka Factory was built in Japan's Mie Prefecture in 1973. At this factory, Omron manufactures products that aid in the prevention, improvement, or management of lifestyle diseases and respiratory diseases. Products made here run the range from blood pressure monitors, nebulizers, and other in-home care items to medical devices for measuring arteriosclerosis and visceral fat. In addition, the Matsusaka Factory serves as the mother factory of the Healthcare Business.

This system features new technologies to reduce assembly time, a higher ratio of domestic component procurement, and other means to maintain a competitive cost structure. The factory ramped up production during fiscal 2014, forecasting total production of 1.7 million blood pressure monitors in fiscal 2016. This increase in production has much to do with this Corporate Value Initiatives year’ s adoption of the world’s first automated assembly line for blood pressure monitors. By automating processes that used to require several people to accomplish, the factory has more than doubled per-person productivity. In addition to adding more manufacturing technology to increase production in Japan, the Matsusaka Factory is training technical staff who can supervise production overseas. These individuals will introduce technologies proven at Matsusaka at overseas production centers, which will lead to further productivity gains for the Healthcare Business. Corporate Value Foundation Blood Pressure Monitor Production Line Manual Assembly Emphasis on production efficiency for a cost structure competitive with overseas manufacturers. Freely changing the number of workers and processes allows the factory to handle changes in product type and production numbers.

He believed that a company needed a compass to help predict the future. As our compass, Mr. Tateishi formulated the SINIC predictive theory, which projects the future based on the cycle of interrelationships between Science, Technology, and Society. Omron first announced this predictive theory to the world at the International Future Research World Congress in 1970. Since then, the SINIC Theory has been our compass for projecting into the future. Note: See http://www.omron.com/about/principles/sinic/ for more.

These discussions addressed by whom and how such evaluations would be conducted, as well as how we would link the results of evaluations to improving the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. While objectivity is important, evaluations that solely emphasize form and numerical data will not lead to substantial and autonomous improvements in effectiveness. To ensure both effectiveness and objectivity, we asked all members of the Board of Directors to complete a self-evaluation. Based on the results of these evaluations, the Corporate Governance Committee performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board. This Corporate Value Initiatives evaluation focused on areas having room for reform and improvement. The committee then submitted a report to the Board of Directors. This report included frank opinions and proposals for solving the issues. The report was framed as the result of an evaluation from outside directors and auditors familiar with Omron and intimately involved in Omron management oversight. As such, we believe our Board of Directors accepted the feedback earnestly and sincerely. After receiving the evaluation results, the Board of Directors promptly set about Corporate Value Foundation implementing operating policies. I believe that this evaluation of the effectiveness of our Board of Directors has served as an impetus for change, and that the Board of Directors will serve as an even more robust platform for decision-making, which will be proven as the Corporate Governance Committee continues to gauge our progress.
