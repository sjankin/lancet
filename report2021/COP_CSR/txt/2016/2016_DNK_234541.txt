The advantage of hydrogen production is that energy can be stored, and when the vehicles are in use, they emit no harmful CO2, only water. In fact, it is possible to drink the water, but it probably wouldn’t taste very pleasant. A hydrogen refuelling station also opened in Korsør to enable the vehicles to be refuelled quickly and easily. The vehicles can drive 600 km per tank, and it takes about three minutes to fill the vehicles up with hydrogen.

Projections for the Danish economy suggest a slight increase in growth rate through 2016, along with a moderate increase in inflation. These developments affect the outlook for revenue performance. Against this background and because of traffic trends in 2015, it is estimated that traffic will develop positively in 2016. Revenues will be adversely affected by the Parliamentary decision to reduce the fees from rail companies for the use of the railways across Storebælt and Øresund, by a total of about DKK 275 million in 2016.

Additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports are laid down in the IFRS order issued pursuant to the Danish The following amendments to existing and new standards and Financial Statements Act and NASDAQ OMX. interpretations have not yet come into force and are not applicable in connection with the preparation of the Annual Report for 2015: IAS The accounting policies are in accordance with those applied in 1, 16, 19, 27, 28, 38 and 41 as well as IFRS 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and the Annual Report 2014. 16. The new standards and interpretations will be implemented when they become effective. The companies have elected to use the so-called Fair Value Option under IAS 39. Consequently, all financial assets and liabilities (loans, The implementation of IFRS 9 changes, among other things, the deposits and derivatives) are measured at fair value and changes classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. in the fair value are recognised in the comprehensive income stateThe implementation of this standard is expected to have an impact, ment.

IAS 39. not expected to have any financial effect on the Sund & Bælt Group’s results, assets and liabilities or equity in connection with financial The rationale for using the Fair Value Option is that the companies reporting for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, when they are expected consistently apply a portfolio approach to financial management, to enter into force. which means that the intended exposure to various financial risks is managed through different financial instruments, both primary Recognition and measurement in general instruments and derivatives. Accordingly, in the management of Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when, as a result of financial market risks, the companies do not distinguish between, a previous event, it is probable that future economic benefits will for example, loans and derivatives, but solely focus on the total flow to the Group and the value of the asset can be reliably measured. exposure. The choice of financial instruments for managing the Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when an outflow of financial risks could, therefore, result in accounting asymmetries economic benefits is probable and when the liability can be reliably were the Fair Value Option not used. measured. On initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as It is the companies’ opinion that the Fair Value Option is the only described below for each individual item. principle under IFRS that reflects this approach as the other principles lead to inappropriate asymmetries between otherwise identical Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trading exposures depending on whether the exposure is established in day and recognition is discontinued at the trading day when the right the form of loans or the use of derivative financial instruments or to receive/settle payment from the financial asset or liability has requires comprehensive documentation as in the case with hedge expired, or when sold, and all risks and yields tied to the instrument accounting. As derivatives, financial assets and loans are measured have been transferred. at fair value, the measurement in the financial statements will produce the same result for loans and associated derivatives when In recognising and measuring assets and liabilities, any gains, losses the hedging is effective. Thus the company will achieve accounting and risks occurring prior to the presentation of the annual accounts symmetry. Loans without associated derivatives are also measured that evidence conditions existing at the balance sheet date are at fair value in contrast to the main rule in IAS 39 pursuant to which taken into account. loans are measured at amortised cost. This will naturally lead to volatility in the profit/loss for the year as a result of value adjustments.

Co-financing of the political agreement, “A Green Transport Policy”, of 29 January 2009 is included in the repayment period calculation where the company pays dividend to the State of DKK 9.0 billion (in 2008 prices) up to the financial year 2022 and ceases to do so after the agreement is concluded. After distribution of the proposed DKK 1,200 million in dividend for the 2015 financial year, the company will have distributed a total of DKK 3,000 million. The main uncertainties in the profitability calculations relate to the long-term traffic development and the real rate. Traffic growth is expected to average 1 and 1.5 per cent for lorries and passenger cars respectively. Operating expenses are expected to rise in line with inflation. Moreover, there is some uncertainty in relation to the size and timing of reinvestments in the rail link.
