Thus, as set in one of the organization’s goals, it is a priority to ensure colleagues are motivated and possess the appropriate knowledge and tools to successfully complete their ongoing tasks. The heart and engine of Ulshöfer IT that drives the company towards achievement of the Brand Promise is the Production team. It represents almost 80% of all colleagues and is divided into Production, IT and Technical service. Working conditions are closely monitored with respect to applicable laws and regulations as documented in the Labor Law of the Federal Republic of Germany. What have we done? A work-life balance is achieved through set working times and furthermore through set breaks for breakfast and lunch. Colleagues thus have the opportunity to rest and gain new energy throughout the day. Working hours have also been set to provide Production colleagues with an “extended” weekend, every week, since every Friday the Production section of the company operates only till 13:15. Health and safety at the work place is closely monitored internally and assessed externally. This includes, but is not limited to, all applicable regulations. Furthermore, assessments of ergonomics and medical check-ups, based on colleague’s individual age and prerequisite, take place at regular intervals. Colleague facilities include lockers to securely store personal belongings while at work and free-of-charge parking facilities; a shared canteen with tea/coffee making facilities promotes informal communication among colleagues. Continuous professional development is monitored on an annual basis, employing a training calendar, with colleagues encouraged to participate in industry-specific and/or personal development courses. Both out-of-house, in-house and online courses are available. Ulshöfer IT seeks all external courses to be certified by national or independent institutions, therefore ensuring highest level of knowhow. Attendance and completion of courses/trainings is documented and tracked. An periodic meeting takes place to present colleagues with key figures, challenges, and future goals as well as to answer any questions colleagues may have. Informal events consist of, for example, the annual Christmas lunch. Colleagues are provided with a minimum of 24 vacation days per year. Based on years of service with Ulshöfer IT, the amount of vacation days increases on a rate of 1 extra day every two years. Overtime is monitored, with colleagues having the opportunity to take extra days off based on accumulated hours. Remuneration is on par with comparable companies in the industry; salaries are paid regularly and on time following internal policy. Days off based on accumulated extra hours are fully compensated. What have we achieved? Ulshöfer IT has been, over the years, perceived as a reliable employer with an open corporate culture. This can be witnessed by the number of colleagues who have dedicated a greater portion of their professional life to the company. This year, five colleagues celebrate their 30th anniversary with another 13 colleagues with over 20 years with the company. Retaining a workforce of less than 50 colleagues enables for a family environment, while equally, information is passed quickly and aids in clear communication. 6 Fig. 1 % of all colleagues – division of tasks (Technical Service and IT are also part of the Production team) Fig. 2 % of all colleagues Fig. 3 % of development courses Fig. 4 % of colleagues attending courses 7 Our Work Environment Our approach In aspects of work environment is Ulshöfer IT’s strategy two-fold. On one hand it is to create the most effective environment for all colleagues to deliver to the Brand Promise of ‘Quality on Time’. On the other hand, Ulshöfer IT realizes just how vital cooperation with external partners is to the future of the company. What have we done? Efficiency and effectiveness is measured through Ulshöfer IT’s success on the market, customer satisfaction and profitability. Achieving these goals internally means providing the right tools to colleagues. With that in mind, key processes and policies have been documented describing the most efficient way of delivery of services, thus supporting a quick order turnaround. Use of equipment is monitored, as well as technology trends in the industry. At the beginning of 2016, Ulshöfer IT has invested considerably into equipment renewal within the Production and IT area. Furthermore, a new virtual network has been built for a faster, more effective access to various key areas of the company. Motivation and workplace safety play a significant role in achieving Ulshöfer IT’s Brand Promise. As already mentioned; colleagues enjoy set working hours with set breaks for breakfast and lunch as well as a half-day workday every Friday of the month. A common canteen with tea/coffee facilities and a kitchenette provide a place away from workstations to relax and socialize. Ulshöfer IT also organizes annual events for all colleagues and keeps an open channel through the Colleague Assembly. An open-door-policy has been implemented several years ago. Health and safety is regularly reviewed for continued effectiveness depending on individual departmental workload. Production department, for instance, must be reviewed in areas of ergonomics, use of monitors, exposure to various chemicals and/or load (weight) in case of the Transportation section of Production. Several colleagues are trained in First Aid to allow for a speedy assistance before arrival of professional medical services if the situation requires it. Potential danger zones are clearly marked with yellow tape. Notices regarding safety procedures in case of fire are posted at prominent, well accessible locations throughout the company. A refresher of security procedures takes place annually. Comparable to the internal approach in delivering to the Brand Promise, Ulshöfer IT builds on mutually-beneficial relationships with industry leaders. These partnerships allow Ulshöfer IT to offer a wider spectrum of services, while at the same time provide proven tools and services to customers. Depending on customer demand, Ulshöfer IT seeks to expand its portfolio of partnerships and thus achieve a one-stop-shop concept. Whether a customer is only interested in having large portions of documents scanned/archived or seeks a full document management solution involving scanning, indexing, import into an existing or a new database among others. Ulshöfer IT relies on internal know-how, best-fit technologies and partners to deliver the right solution. What have we achieved? Continuous certification to ISO9001:2008, since 1995, stands as proof of a sound internal management system. In 2013, Ulshöfer IT was awarded with the Seal of Quality by FMI e.V. (Professional association for Multimedia Information Processing) for its contribution to the industry and the level of quality it stands for. Around 150 customers have entrusted us with long-term processing of their documents and several have pointed out the reliability they can count on while working with Ulshöfer IT. 8 Long-term Partners Commitment to Quality Memberships 9 Our Green Path Our approach Regulation of Environmental impact of companies is documented through various federal laws as set by the German government and monitored through several government authorities. Ulshöfer IT complies and further commits itself to follow such laws, regulations and standards. What have we done? To deliver products and services with the highest quality, Ulshöfer IT uses electric power, water, paper, industrialgrade chemicals and vehicles. Over the past years, an active campaign to reduce use of electricity has seen an improvement in usage of electric equipment, as well as effective usage of lighting. Retirement and/or replacement of aging equipment have also been responsible for decrease in use of electricity. During production of various deliverables is Ulshöfer IT required to use chemicals. These are stored in specialized containers to avoid contamination of surrounding areas. On a regular basis the containers are emptied by a professional removal/recycling and destruction company certified to various applicable ISO Standards and perceived as the industry leader in Germany. Greatest impact on the environment represents the use of company vehicles. These are required to transport materials and data between Ulshöfer IT and different client locations preand post-production, provide technical support directly at clients’ premises, as well as to allow for visits by Sales Representatives. What have we achieved? Ulshöfer IT has maintained an overall company-average of B on the CO2 efficiency scale with gasoline-powered vehicles maintaining level C. A major revamp of the company’s carpark is planned for January 2017. Efficiency levels – company vehicles Overall Diesel-powered Gasoline-powered 2016 B B C 2015 B B C 10 11 Our Ethics Our approach In a highly competitive environment of today; keeping true to its basic principles and promise to clients of fairness and openness Ulshöfer IT has built customers’ trust through colleagues and services. It goes without saying; constant compliance to applicable laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, ISO9001 QMS standards and clientspecific requirements has been propelling the company since 1963. Particular customers, as part of their own internal requirements, also conduct an annual assessment of contractually binding terms and conditions. Ulshöfer IT embraces this win-win approach since given assessments serve as an external check of internal processes and standards. Furthermore, various identified and implemented improvement initiatives have directly benefited all clients and thus strengthening Ulshöfer IT’s Brand Promise. “Quality on time”, defines Ulshöfer IT’s commitment to delivering services tailor-made to each client’s needs and expectations in as short a time as possible. What have we done? Each colleague must, prior to commencement of work with Ulshöfer IT, submit a Clearance certificate from the German police to demonstrate no criminal intent in the past and/or present. Each client’s needs are individually assessed against end-product requirements with emphasis on available technologies. These are defined in a contract describing a concept of material processing. Non-disclosure agreements and a Personal data protection agreement form standard parts of all contractual documentation. Ensuring Ulshöfer IT complies with applicable legislation regarding personal data, an internal Data Protection Officer has been appointed. Material processing is clearly defined, documented and closely monitored for each area of Production. All processes and any potential shortcomings are followed up by the Quality Manager for correction and implementation. Furthermore, corrective action is documented for each shortcoming to comply with ISO 9001:2008 requirements and as a base of knowledge for future reference. This information is shared annually among all colleagues. Internally, processing equipment and safety and security of the promises is well defined and audited annually based on best practice from both within and outside our industry. What have we achieved? Having defined, established and implemented a robust monitoring and measurement concept to audit technical and organizational requirements has to-date resulted in no unwanted external breach of our system. The importance of keeping client information secure and the safeguarding of such information processed throughout Ulshöfer IT are well known by all colleagues. Bribes and gifts are not accepted. Any type of corruption, whether financial or otherwise is strictly forbidden as documented in the German Criminal Code. Any such wrongdoing is strictly forbidden. 12 Ulshöfer IT GmbH + Co KG Raiffeisenstraße 17 D-61191, Rosbach v. d.
