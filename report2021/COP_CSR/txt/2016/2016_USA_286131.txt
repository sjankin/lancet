As described in our supply chain section, our diverse portfolio of businesses, global footprint, and extensive operations, means we operate a highly complex, integrated supply chain. While it is difficult to succinctly summarize every aspect of our supply chain, in general, DuPont businesses process constituent materials through manufacturing stages to produce goods for our customers. Approximately half of our $9.4 billion procurement spend in 2015 went to the top purchased energy and raw materials, 37% went to other purchased energy and raw materials, and 12% went to packaging and logistics. Additional details, including a list of our top purchased energy and raw materials, are available in the annual DuPont Data Book, available at investors.dupont.com. Our renewable fuel use is provided in G4-EN3. A primary focus for manufacturing our products is minimizing waste. Our Bold Energy Plan program (described later in this section) actively seeks opportunities to reduce lost energy and waste heat in our facilities. Many of our products are also developed to reduce waste by consumers. For example, we are developing a diverse set of products intended to limit the amount of food that is wasted. This includes packaging that limits food spoilage and solutions to extend the fresh life of food products. In addition, one of our strategic pillars is bio-based industrials. This pillar works across on a wide range of industries and supports the adoption of bio-based and renewable materials to reduce the use of petroleum-based inputs while improving performance. For example, DuPont has developed a process using corn stover— unused stalks, leaves and cobs that remain in fields after the corn harvest — as a feedstock to produce cellulosic ethanol, a fuel that is 70% more efficient than gasoline in terms of wellto-wheel greenhouse gas emissions. DuPont is producing this DUPONT HAS DEVELOPED renewable, cellulosic ethanol at the company’s new biorefinery in Nevada, Iowa.

Stakeholders interested in additional information related to our water performance may view our CDP Water surveys available in the reporting section of our website at sustainability.dupont.com. As part of our new 2020 sustainability goals, we have committed that all DuPont sites in locations evaluated as high or extremely high water-risk will establish water risk mitigation plans and complete priority implementation objectives by 2020. In 2015, the primary progress achieved against this new goal was its announcement in November and internal education for businesses and site.

However, DuPont does not impose on the sites requirements regarding the method for attaining these goals; rather, businesses and their sites develop their own plans for attainment. Therefore, DuPont does not require sites to report on internal use of water; but must report metrics on water withdrawals (by type) and water consumption (by type).

The scope of the review includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission sources, and Scope 3 emissions from fuel and energy related activities. The GHG inventory applies to all owned and leased facilities under DuPont’s operational control. WSP provided a “Review Findings” report to DuPont which lists in detail the specific review tasks completed and areas which have been flagged for clarification or improvement. DuPont has addressed all requests for clarification and has completed all necessary corrective actions. The details of the scope of this assurance review can be found in Table 1.

Professional Conduct WSP has conducted this limited assurance review in its capacity as an independent third party in accordance with the ISO 14065 International Standard, Greenhouse gases — Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition. ISO 14065 specifies the principles and requirements employed by WSP to make this GHG assertion. WSP has not contributed to the compilation of DuPont’s 2014 GHG inventory and members of the Assurance Team are not working with DuPont’s 2014 GHG inventory beyond what is required of this assignment.
