We take reasonable steps to preserve the environment through responsible practices to minimize the environmental impact of our operations by complying with all applicable laws, guidelines and waste management industry standards. We keep our processes and services as clean as possible, in real terms this means that all our facilities are already certified under the EMAS environmental management standard. The continuous improvement of our services is translated into direct benefits for the environment. We have developed an Environmental Management System in full compliance with the requirements of the international standard 1221/2009/EC (EMAS) through which it is documented that products and services provided by Polyeco contribute to the protection of the environment. The scope of the system is the sound management of hazardous and non hazardous waste. Our certified with ISO 17025:2005 Laboratory is responsible for waste sample analysis and classification. Our Quality Control department produces treatment recommendations control forms and other legislative documentation. Additionally, the department can advise our customers on all hazardous waste regulatory issues, providing specialist industry knowledge and guidance. 20 Environment Our Environmental policy is achieved through the implementation of our Environmental Management System, which consists of: • Commitment to collaborate where possible with companies that have developed an environmental management system; • Savings on non-renewable natural resources and energy in all its business; • Continuous education of employees; • Continuous updating of clients and partners; • Continuous monitoring of legal and other regulations and requirements related to environmental issues. All matters relating to the protection of the environment are encountered by the Environmental and Quality Control Officer, who holds responsibility and independence. Environmental Targets The company has evaluated the environmental aspects in which the company’s activity has possible environmental consequences. Τhose are: • Electricity consumption • Suspended Particulate Matter • Noise • Liquid waste from rainwater in circulation and storage areas • Hazardous and non hazardous waste leakage risk • Risk of explosion or fire • Water Consumption • Paper consumption • Hazardous materials storage • Emissions of air pollutants (Volatile Organic Compounds – VOCs) 21 Environment Environmental Policy Polyeco conducts Particulate Matter and Volatile Organic Compounds Measurements at emission points, as well as Liquid Waste Measurements, which are carried out by Polyeco’s accredited laboratory. Polyeco also monitors the levels of Environmental Noise within its facilities. Additionally to the above evaluation procedure, Polyeco S.A. has developed environmental programs, setting specific goals, invests in environmental projects and implements the best available environmental techniques and practices for achieving continuous improvement. Indicatively, Polyeco monitors the Consumption of Resources within its facilities and takes appropriate measures in an effort to reduce the effects that arise from the use of electrical and electronic equipment, toners/inks, lamps, batteries, lubricants and packaging materials. Adopting efficient strategy in this field, Polyeco contributes to the conservation of natural resources, reducing operating expenses and raising employee environmental awareness. «Reduce, Reuse and Recycle» is one of Polyeco’s fundamental principles, implementing longstanding and active waste reduction and recycling programs. More precisely, our top priority is to reduce waste generation in the first place and the second priority is the reuse and recycling of materials, whenever this is possible. In the last years Polyeco has significantly reduced paper consumption in an effort to preserve natural resources, decreasing simultaneously its environmental footprint. In cases that it is not possible to avoid the paper consumption, we use recycled or FSC certified paper. Furthermore, Polyeco is implementing measures and actions in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the main cause of climate change. Except for the use of energy efficient products, Polyeco has established a solar power station at its facilities in Aspropyrgos. We are also conducting efforts in order to reduce water usage by establishing monitoring and targeting system. It should be mentioned that for the achievement of the targets set in the field of environmental protection the company strongly encourages the participation of the employees and ensures their constant education on the practices that can be applied for the conservation of resources. The training programs are conducted by external partners or by the company’s executives. The educational themes cover all the aspects of environmental management of the existing Quality and Environmental Management System. Furthermore, the employees are informed about the environmental policy applied by the company, the environmental goals and targets the applied environmental programs as well as the environmental effects of the company’s operation. Polyeco’s Environmental Indicators In full compliance with EMAS Regulation, Polyeco S.A. constantly monitors the basic environmental indicators measuring: water consumption, electricity consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and total annual emissions of air pollutants (NOx, SO2, and particulate matter) that arise from the company’s activity. 22 Environment Implementation Description of concrete actions to implement environmental policies, address environmental risks and respond to environmental incidents. We implement our Environmental Management System aimed at achieving longterm goals and protecting the environment from hazardous materials. Within its activities, Polyeco SA bounds and guarantees the implementation of the agreed actions with its customers, applying the National and International Legislation, with view the environment’s protection from any form of its burden. One of our prime duties is to control and mitigate risk at all of our operating sites. Our safety performance is a key part of the relationship with our customers, who rely on us to maintain the highest levels of operational integrity at all times. Each site is subject to routine inspections by Polyeco’s safety professionals and we work closely with our contractors to ensure that they are always meeting our own high standards. The choice of the most appropriate method of waste management is carried out in such a way as to ensure that the human health will not be endangered, directly or indirectly, and without using processes or methods that could harm the environment. For that reason measures are taken and proposed in order to: prevent or reduce production risk and waste, in accordance with the EU overarching principles. We help our clients primarily to prevent the generation of waste and to reduce its harmfulness. Where this is not possible, we aim in the reuse, recycling or recovery of the waste materials or their use as a source of energy. The main objective of our policy is to prevent accidents or the creation of environmental problems, to the extent possible, by reducing any potential risk that could lead to environment pollution, through our Environmental Management System, continuous improvements, and the active participation of all our employees. We intend to stabilize carbon emissions and environmental footprint from our operations, to the lowest possible level through renewable energy investments. Making More from Waste: Recovery/Recycling/Reuse At our main hazardous waste treatment facility we treat hazardous waste preventing their release into the environment and provide environmentally friendly methods of managing hazardous materials. 23 Environment Measurements of Outcome Description of how the company monitors and evaluates performance Polyeco monitors its environmental performance with environmental measurements, and sets environmental goals, according to Environmental Management Procedures EMP.ΑΕ-40 and EMP.ΑΕ-20 EMAS. Finally the company conducts systematically environmental internal and external inspections.

External audits take place regularly by the (a) Greek state public authorities, (b) TUV Hellas and (c) by external inspectors from private companies on behalf of our customers. No environmental incidents from our operations were reported at any Polyeco’s worksites during 2015. Renewable Green Energy Photovoltaic Station To achieve our commitment to UN GC Principles and stabilize carbon emissions and environmental footprint to the lowest possible level, Polyeco funded a significant investment to create a solar power station consisting of 1000 photovoltaic panels that have been installed, on the roof of our main industrial facilities in Aspropyrgos, Greece. This Green Energy Solar Station has a total surface of 3300m2, and a generating capacity of 250 kW. The conversion of direct current to alternating current generator is carried through 12 inverters DELTA (Germany), while for the connection of the unit to the Medium Voltage Power Network a privately owned Low Medium Voltage Substation of 250kVA was built. The commercial operation of this power station started after successful completion of the connection of the unit to the medium voltage network of the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator S.A. (HEDNO) in February 2013. Three years later, Polyeco S.A. continues the operation of its solar power station, which produces approximately 320.000kWh « green » electricity annually, amount enough to supply about 80 households midsize and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 270 tons of CO2 and a total of nearly 6 tons of SO2, CO, NOx and PM10 emissions. 24 Environment EBEA 2006 Eco Awards The award was granted to Polyeco, for its sensitivity and best practices to the protection of the Environment.

For Polyeco, CSR is not just resolved to simple compliance with legal and business obligations but extends to substantial contribution to the society and the environment with respect to the principles of sustainability and prosperity. In our 2014 Report we had the pleasure to announce the launching of Polyeco’s ambitious Contemporary Art Initiative, PCAI which primarily aims at raising environmental awareness through a unique art program inspired by the crucial issue of waste management, which is not only technical, but also environmental and social. Since then, Mr Athanasios Polychronopoulos, Polyeco S.A. Global Department Vice President and driving force behind the company’s art initiative, decided to implement a sprinting strategy towards the implementation of PCAI’s objectives. His genuine belief that art is the best tool to stimulate dialogue about waste management was complimented by his wish to share this assumption with the company’s employees, clients and the general public. The objective has been to create a framework that will allow Polyeco to implement its unique environmental awareness raising program. Within a year PCAI has made huge steps, from finalizing its structure to start implementing its vision. © P.Manolopoulos Artist Natasa Efstathiadi filming in Benin 26 Environment Current status Polyeco’s commitment to PCAI mission is reflected in two major steps. In March 2015 it employed a fulltime Director and a guest curator. The Director is responsible for planning and implementing all PCAI activities. The guest curator will be responsible of selecting a number of agreed commissions. A different guest curator will be appointed every two (2) years. The second step is that by January 2016 PCAI will become a non-profit organization based in Athens, Greece. Strusture: PCAI implements its objectives though three areas of activity, The Collection, The Projects, The Support PCAI is becoming part of an international trend in the corporate collecting sphere that goes beyond purchasing art works. The Collection is based on special commissions mainly of moving image art. PCAI provides mid-career and emerging artists with the means and resources to create an artwork inspired by urgent environmental, sociological and philosophical issues. Artists are invited to enter a dialogue while retaining their absolute freedom of expression and critical inquiry. Every effort is made to provide them with all the financial, scientific and legal support in order to realize their projects. Should they wish, commissioned artists are offered a wide choice of international sites to visit and do research. Artists may draw inspiration from the waste management sites and facilities, the countries, the workforce and the people involved in the waste management process. The can investigate waste sources and itineraries; they can research the external factors and taboos that affect our perception of waste. Our commissioned artists come from all over the world reflecting Polyeco’s international reach. In 2015, two commissions were completed by artists, Natasa Efstathiadi and Costas Vittis and four new artists were commissioned Anja Kirschner, Saskia Olde Wolbers, Vassilis Karouk and Loukia Alavanou. All works are expected to be completed before September 2016. Four further commissions will be assigned in the first quarter of 2016. The Projects are all the activities and events (exhibitions, publications, educational programs and workshops) organized by PCAI around its growing commissioned based Collection. PCAI wishes to reach as big an audience as possible. Apart from exhibiting the collection in Museums and other cultural institutions our aim is to incorporate the art to special educational programs. These will be presented at schools and other venues in remote locations exposing students and the public to contemporary art practices as well as informing them about environmental degradation, which constitutes one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. 27 Environment The Support refers to our engagement in other initiatives and individuals that share the same vision and concerns. Apart from the collection of commissioned art works PCAI has ensured a growing budget for sponsorship. This involves engagement in international art sponsorship schemes and the support of other initiatives, the establishment of a scholarship for post graduate studies in Media Arts and the growing support of exceptional events and people in the countries that Polyeco develops business activity. In 2015 we sponsored Design Overview In Tirana (aka DOIT) is an established annual event about visual communications culture in traditional and non-traditional media. The first-ever, international conference in Albania dedicated to Advertising, Design and New Media. In September 2015 we also sponsored Emilia Bouriti’s performance Eleusis | Space Time Energy, which explores the relationship between the human body and the industrial landscape of Eleusina, was held Sunday, September 6th, 2015 at the Old Olive Oil Factory under the Aeschylia Festival 2015. Participation of employees Polyeco’s employees play a crucial part in the implementation and the dissemination of the initiative, actively helping the artists in both research and the creation of their projects, using all the means in their disposal. They also act as ambassadors of PCAI in their areas of activity. Polyeco Project Managers are in a continuous dialogue with PCAI’s Director exchanging information and narratives about past, current and future projects. Τhe benefits from employee involvement have been recorded to be so substantial that through this growing new collaboration PCAI wishes to communicate to Polyeco employees that their participation in the Initiative through a number of different actions will eventually expose them to numerous different and creative ways of thinking. Sharing Apart from our own curated projects of the PCAI collection we accept loan requests from institutions and other professionals. So far we have accepted loan requests from many international institutions and festivals such us, Cairo Video Festival, Alternative Film/Video Festival, Academic Film Center, Belgrade, Serbia, Kuala Lumpur Eco Film Festival, Malaysia, Festival du nouveau cinéma, Montreal, Canada, “Kino der Kunst”, Festival and Group Show, Munich, Germany, “ECU”, European Independent Film Festival, Paris, France, Glasgow Short Film Festival, Glasgow, UK, Athens International Film Festival, Athens, Greece, Panorama of Ecological Films, Society for the Environmental and Cultural Heritage, Athens, Greece, The House of Cyprus: Cultural and Educational Office of the Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus in Greece. 28 Environment Target audience Having as an ultimate goal the creation of environmental consciousness and culture, PCAI does not address a specific audience. On the contrary, it wishes to connect audiences through art. Adopting the principle that environmental protection is a common responsibility and can only be achieved with collective effort, our initiative addresses each and every one, trying to communicate through art the challenges that threat nature and the consequences that are caused by the over exploitation of natural resources and human intervention, when there is no respect for the environment. However, special emphasis is given to the creation of environmental awareness among young people, which on the one hand will suffer more from the consequences of environmental degradation and on the other hand will be called to disseminate their culture to future generations. Work in progress PCAI is destined to mirror Polyeco’s growth. Its activities are on par with the success of the company. For the next year we wish to: • Develop an increasing activity around our growing Art Collection. In 2016 we are planning to open our first major Museum exhibition of PCAI commissions and produce a publication recording the first phase of our collection and activities. • Involve more of our employers; enhance our engagement program promoting the role of art in the workplace stimulating productivity, innovation and openmindedness. • Commission and engage local artists in countries where Polyeco operates and further address our stakeholders and the local communities we offer our services to, especially those in parts of the world who are experiencing a form of cultural isolation. PCAI wishes to engage them in a creative dialogue and in some cases promote their artistic voices. • Enhance our social impact and interaction with local communities and pose issues that concern environmental policy in local, regional and national level. • Attract support from other initiatives and institutions. Currently PCAI operates exclusively through Polyeco’s means and resources. Our aim is to be able to generate more financial support in order to expand our program and activities. • Be recognized for our effort to make a lasting contribution to all the countries that trust its services. 29 Environment Challenges PCAI was inaugurated at a time of national financial turmoil and has managed to progress and establish strong foundations that ensure that it will stand in time in order to continue to benefit, support and inspire a number of different audiences. PCAI has undertaken commitment programs that require time and effort from a great number of people. 2015 Highlights During 2015 we had the opportunity to communicate our activities and mission to very diverse and interesting audiences. In May 2015 our newly founded Contemporary Art Initiative participated at the Science Fair which took place in the margins of the 2015 Triple COPs in Geneva. PCAI was included in the thematic area of ‘Science Providing Sustainable Waste Management Solutions: Turning Waste to Resource’ next to the Federal environmental agency of Germany, the University of Geneva, UNEP and others. There we had the opportunity to present KEPLER, a video art work by artist George Drivas and discuss our program with a great number of delegates. KEPLER was commissioned by PCAI in 2014 and was produced in Tbilisi, Georgia during the implementation of GEF Funded, UNDP Georgia and Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Project ‘Disposal of POPs Pesticides and Initial Steps for Containment of Dumped POPs Pesticides executed by Polyeco S.A. In November 2015 we had the opportunity to communicate PCAI activities at the International Conference on Pesticides held in Zaragoza, Spain. Scientists from different countries had the opportunity to learn about the Polyeco Contemporary Art Initiative and in some cases express their willingness to contribute to this effort thus strengthening the Initiative’s intention to enrich its activities with specialized scientific knowledge, always with the primary goal of raising public awareness. In June 2015 PCAI participated as a sponsor in the program “Painting school buildings”, which is realized under the auspices of the Greek Ministry of Education and assigned graffiti team Urban Act to create a mural about the Sea and the Environment in the entire building of the 22nd Piraeus Primary School. The mural was created by the well-known visual artist Same84.Within the context of this action, students were offered workshops while they were asked to participate in the painting of the lower surfaces. PCAI responded to the request of the school’s director and the Municipality of Piraeus to change the image of decay that characterizes the majority of school buildings. The action has a permanent impact and will remain as a consignment to the city of Piraeus forever. This action happened on the occasion of The European Maritime Day (EMD) which has been established by the European Union and is celebrated annually on May 20th, aiming at highlighting the vital role of the sea for the life of the citizens, as well as for the sustainable growth. The sea and its opportunities are positioned in the epicentre of the dialogue. Our sponsorship to the 22nd Piraeus Primary School had a double purpose, our contribution to the improvement of the school environment for the children and our attempt to raise the students’ awareness on issues concerning the environment. 30 Environment Athanasios Polychronopoulos appointed new member of the board of the Hellenic Federation of Enterprices (SEV) council for sustainable development In 2015 Mr Athanasios Polychronopoulos, Vice President of Global Development of Polyeco S.A., with great honour undertook responsibilities as Member of the Board of Sustainable Development. Mr Polychronopoulos resumed his duties having absolute sense of the responsibility and obligations that this new position brings. He committed that that he will work tirelessly in the Council’s efforts to communicate the message that the country’s economic development is inextricably linked to sustainable development. The Hellenic Federation of Enterprises (SEV) Council for Sustainable Development is an entity which operates as a non-profit organization. The Council was created to be a powerful and dynamic factor for businesses, which are willing and able to play a leading role among the members of SEV in promoting Sustainable Development in the Greek business reality and in creating the necessary framework for discussion and weighing of critical issues of Sustainable Development among businesses, the State and society in general. In this context, the Council promotes communication, information and education of its members and society in general, actions involving cooperation and promotion of the concept of Sustainable Development. In 2014 Polyeco SA participated at the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises (SEV) conference on Sustainable Development. The subject of the Conference was «Comments on the National Plan for Sustainable Development that is under consultation. In its official statement, Polyeco SA saluted SEV’s initiatives on sustainable development and presented its proposals regarding the content and the structure of the National Plan. More precisely, Polyeco SA stated that concerning the introduction, the National Plan should be adjusted to the international standard ISO 26000:2010-Guidance on Social Responsibility, as well as aligned with the British standard SΑ 8000:2014Guidance on Social Accountability. Also, the National Plan should refer to Organizations, in order to include both public and private sector. Furthermore, in its comments on the National Plan on Sustainable Development Polyeco mentioned that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) should be combined with art in the context of a socially and environmentally responsible development. 31 Environment Concerning the definition of CSR, in order to avoid bureaucracy, this should be defined as it is stated in the respective international standard ISO 26000:2010 as well as the British standard SΑ 8000:2014. Another important point is that under the international legal framework in force, the establishment of the issuance of Corporate Responsibility Reports is crucial for the proliferation of CSR. In an effort to increase the efficiency of social responsibility, it would be beneficial for the organizations of the public sector to incorporate the principles of CSR in their actions and programs aiming at responsible operation. Additionally, it would be very useful if the public services developed artistic and cultural initiatives aiming at raising the awareness of their third parties (subcontractors, suppliers, local community). Concerning the implementation of a national strategy for CSR, it is substantial to establish an evaluation process for the quality of the reports at a national level, applying the appropriate procedures and methodology. In conclusion, Polyeco SA defends that in the context of contemporary entrepreneurship, social responsibility should constitute the basis of the actions and the strategy of both private and public companies, creating a positive environment for the society. © Anja Kirschner MODERATION, by Anja Kirschner, 2015. 32 Against corruption Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery 33 Against corruption Assessment, Policy and Goals Description of the relevance of anti-corruption for the company (i.e. anti-corruption risk-assessment).
