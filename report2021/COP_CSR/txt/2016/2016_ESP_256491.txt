Code None Version 01 Progress Report 2015 Page 10 of 29 Methodology This Progress Report is based on the methodology of reporting by Stakeholders. The concept of the Stakeholder is key to understanding CSR. The complexity and dynamism of the current business context has made it necessary to acquire a solid commitment to the different Stakeholders, affected directly or indirectly by the business mission. Identifying the Stakeholders and what their expectations are, are aspects that facilitate the comprehensive introduction of CSR in the heart of any organization. This enables organizations to anticipate possible risks or opportunities and establish policies, actions, follow up tools and indicators as described in this report. The CTL-TH Packaging Group has drawn up the Progress Report by developing the following steps: 1. Select the most relevant Stakeholders in your organization. 2. Identify the most significant challenges for the Stakeholders selected. POLICIES Formal documents in writing that define values, accident prevention and control tools and mechanisms, risks detected in the diagnosis. In this way communications and relations between the company and its Stakeholders are regulated. DIAGNOSIS / FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS The diagnosis, assessment and control indicators for the results obtained by the actions implemented enable us to Carry out an analysis of Stakeholders around the company and an analysis of the risks involved in topics related to the 10 Principles. In this way it is possible to know which policies and actions must be carried out for each Principle and which objectives must be set. Provide the tools to control the fulfilment of policies and help to detect failures in management systems that need to be improved. ACTIONS Once the necessary policies are formalized, actions will serve to carry them out. The actions will help the organization to shape the policies developed and minimize the risks detected. The actions must be scheduled and designed according to the Stakeholder to which they are aimed. Documento propiedad del Grupo CTL-TH Packaging. Document property of the Group CTL-TH Packaging.

Principle 2 Companies must ensure that their businesses are not accomplices in the violation of Human Rights POLICIES Our policy and objectives are aligned with support and respect for the protection of fundamental Human Rights that are internationally recognized. The organization has written and implemented an Ethical Code We have a comprehensive internal management system that incorporates internal policies, regulations and procedures related to the quality of the product, verification controls and manufacturing processes in accordance with international and internal standards. Our internal management system, besides including operating procedures and processes related to the organization, the people who belong to it and their interrelations, also determines standards in relation to our product and supply chain. There are comprehensive procedures in our internal integrated management system linked to internal policies, regulations and processes relating to quality, Human resources, the organization, Customer service and Suppliers: “P.00.00015 – Following up the Ethical Code and Functions of the Ethical Committee and Protocol to report to the Ethical Code” In addition, with regard to Employees, we include in the internal general management document all the processes and procedures to select personnel, hire, recruit, labour relations, conflict management, promotion, objective assessment of performance, etc. and we have also reflected the setup of our internal organization, distribution by areas and functions.

Code None Version 01 Progress Report 2015 Page 15 of 29 We have proceeded to implement the policy of formal purchases and in accordance with CSR principles and our current management systems, bearing in mind the system designed to control the degree of compliance. The main objective for the coming year is the materialization of our CSR policy in a public document, to be integrated into our global management systems and disseminated among all Stakeholders. DIAGNOSIS, FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS We can state that the CTL-TH Packaging Group complies strictly with legal regulations in this area, as companies are permanently subjected to public control by the administration, and also by internal company means (HR department and workers’ representatives) which guarantee compliance with these regulations. The risk is indirect non-compliance with Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact Principles, because some of our Stakeholders do not comply, as a consequence of our lack of verification, control and/or surveillance of some who are suppliers of raw materials that do not involve presence in our company. However, we must make it clear that the company checks the contract conditions of workers of subcontractors. In relation to suppliers of articles, suppliers are annually made welcome to join the quality system and include controls linked to Human Rights detected during the audits carried out. This is carried out through audits on suppliers, to whom the Ethical Code of the CTLTH Packaging Group is transmitted. Currently our supplier classification is based on a quarterly review of their contribution of complete material, with the quality agreed upon and on the agreed date. The CSR criteria is added to the assessment of suppliers, pending the data analysis.

Furthermore, in each labour contract we reflect the working hours agreed, remuneration according to the category of work or corresponding post and social benefits to which every employee in the company has access.

Meeting agendas and all agreements adopted by mutual agreement with the Company Committee are included in an internal database and also communicated globally to all Employees, becoming part of the internal regulations of the Company. In this way several lines of direct communication are maintained with the employee, well known by all the staff, who is incorporated into the workforce on being recruited: direct meetings with the person in charge and with the company committee, internal email address, memos, collective meetings with Management and Worker Assemblies. We do not restrict the time for meetings according to the legal minimum for collective negotiation, but invest whatever time is necessary to suitably manage each circumstance. We must incorporate the criteria defined in the previously written CSR policy into future selection processes, in which we include criteria for gender equality and respect for diversity as well as verification procedures for compliance with these policies and incident management. Hiring in the company, both national and international, is regulated by current regulations in Spain with regard to the minimum age for access to the labour market, i.e. 18 years of age. We omit the possibility of carrying out labour contracts with persons aged over 16 with the authorization of their legal representative. We promote a policy which tends to keep a stable workforce and in which currently less than 2% of staff in the organization are in a temporary situation. We have a general and formal policy with regard to family conciliation for employees, pending identification and registration. Finally we disseminate this policy in writing among all the staff in the company, through the usual internal media, as well as among other Stakeholders Our safety and health management system is certified by OHSAS 18001 in some of the group companies. DIAGNOSIS / FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS We have not verified if our Stakeholders Suppliers and Clients comply properly with these principles and in particular if they support the elimination of all kinds of forced or coercive labour. We have pending the dissemination of information to our supply chain about good working conditions and the absence of forced labour. We have a formal procedure for the management of actions and assessment of staff based on competencies, potential and/or professional projection and staff must respond to the expectations of professional growth for employees as well as coverage of future needs by the organization of the company.

We verify all contracts with the identification of the employee and carry out an initial medical check-up, which all national and international employees of the company fulfil as adults when formalizing the labour contract. We consider that discrimination for gender reasons is our greatest risk, and despite the existence of an equality plan, we must update and be vigilant in order to ensure comprehensive compliance. A concrete action has not yet been established for the promotion of effective equality of opportunities between men and women in all aspects, including access to management posts. With regard to the companies that work in our installations, the system checks compliance with this principle. Audits are carried out which check compliance of this principle by different suppliers.

Since 2008, the CTL-TH Packaging Group has been committed to improving the environment in development and management. For example, the development of “Light“ caps which have made it possible to significantly reduce the materials and energy required for manufacturing, a reduction in COV (Volatile Organic Compounds) in the manufacture of its products to practically eliminate them in the composition and development of efficient packaging (cardboard, optimization of useful space...). Reduction in the consumption of electricity and gas: o Each company develops an energy savings plan o Gradual substitution of all pre-existing light elements with low consumption LED lamps. o Adjustment outdoor temperature sensor to adjust the indoor temperature more precisely. o Adjust outdoor light sensor to optimize lighting times. Policies to reduce other types of consumption: o Reduction in consumption of Volatile Organic Compounds (COV). o Reduction in consumption of Polyethylene and Propylene waste (PE and PP) o Change taps for new ones that close properly with dosifiers to regulate the flow of water.

Code None Version 01 Progress Report 2015 Page 25 of 29 Anticorruption Principle 10 Companies must work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. POLICIES We comply with national and international regulations and legislation aimed at the control and suppression of any action related to corruption in all its forms, including extortion or bribery. Dissemination of our formal CSR policy including our practices in the fight against corruption and verification of its dissemination to all the Stakeholders through the usual means of corporate communication. As we have indicated previously, we have developed a code of conduct against extortion, bribery or any other type of corrupt conduct which we have disseminated internally. We keep a strict compliance with current legality with regard national and international regulations of countries where we operate, with regard to the control and abolition of any kind of corruption which might arise, including extortion and bribery. DIAGNOSIS / FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS We have carried out a diagnosis to get to know internal and activity areas with a greater risk of corruption, with the result that we have located in the Supplier supply chain, due to the markets in which we operate and their own idiosyncrasies. There is no procedure to assess the degree of knowledge, with regard to our codes of conduct and policies against corruption and bribery in relation to our Stakeholders, with the exception of the employees group. In order to ensure compliance with the Ethical Code, resolve incidents or doubts about interpretation and adopt suitable measures to improve compliance, a Committee to apply and follow up the Ethical Code has been created. This committee has the mission to promote the dissemination and application of ethical principles in all the activities that the company carries out. It will be composed of the General Management, the management of HR and SIG of each company in the Group Percentage over the total, broken down by each interest group, which knows the codes of conduct and policies against corruption and bribery in the organization Suppliers Clients Employees 80 % 0% 80 % Documento propiedad del Grupo CTL-TH Packaging.

Code None Version 01 Progress Report 2015 Page 27 of 29 Feedback from the Stakeholders Apart from the 10 principles, the CTL-TH Packaging Group, as a result of the management of Stakeholders (audits, visits, surveys, follow ups by interest groupO), has the extended policy, diagnosis and actions, which will be described below. DIAGNOSIS / FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  Feedback for “Employees” Over the year 2015, the employees of the companies in the CTL-TH Packaging Group sent their opinions and concerns via different means, although basically we can focus this exchange of information on annual sessions of information and communication I+C calls, as well as multiple periodical meetings which we hold with Representatives of the workers in the companies in the Group. From all this activity, the most relevant information about what worries the employees of these companies, without doubt, are subjects linked to the future and strategy of the company, innovation which we are implementing, and potential success and trade development in our markets. Therefore, the most outstanding aspect is, without doubt, everything related to the stability and future of our company. Secondly, we are also aware of interest about all topics related to training and the development of company employees, recent years in this period have seen very little activity in terms of initiatives linked with training, the promotion of individuals and personal development in the companies.  Feedback for “Clients” The main clients are increasingly more involved in CSR. For the moment most express their interest through forms or surveys on the web although, occasionally, a client has carried out an audit on two companies in the group On the other hand, a client has launched a new Brand which aims to be 100% sustainable, selecting 5 outstanding suppliers (one being CTL Packaging) to present their actions carried out in sustainability. In general, according to our clients’ comments and compared with the competition, the CTL-TH Packaging Group Has a correct focus for the development of CSR. Is well positioned with regard to other suppliers. The improvements that clients highlight generally are: Lack of “code” in purchases Absence of objectives Lack of awards or participation in recognized organizations.

Code None Version 01 Progress Report 2015 Page 28 of 29 Absence of tool to analyse the carbon footprint. All these points are integrated in the corresponding action plan.  Feedback for “Suppliers” With regard to suppliers, we should highlight that we include aspects of CSR during audits (Prevention, environment, management of human resources, suppliers Ethical CodeO). In these audits, a lack of awareness about the CSR and ethics in general is noted, so the group takes advantage to inform about the importance of CSR for the coming years so that little by little the information will be spread so that it will be taken into account.  Specific CSR Indicators Indicator Indicator Result Result Indicator (Formula) (Code ) (Unit) 2014 2015 Number of suppliers with follow up the D.00.00075 % Without 80% Ethical Code / total suppliers. Number of cases of closed reports / Total Without D.00.00074 % Without number of reports to the Ethical Code. report ACTIONS: Based on the diagnosis, the different activities of the group and feedback from the Stakeholders, complementary actions to the 10 principles were defined. The main points are shown in the following table.
