Officer’s review Indeed, efficiency improvements have helped us reduce our operational expenditure per barrel of oil equivalent from US$19 a barrel at the end of 2014 to US$16 a barrel at the end of 2015. We build responsible Furthermore, we have successfully maintained our core skills base and management into are proactively managing our financial position. We are taking all appropriate actions to weather the current market everything we do conditions and, when the oil price recovers, to continue generating shared value for our shareholders Tony Durrant and society as a whole. In addition, Chief Executive Officer we have continued to enhance our portfolio through both disposal and acquisition opportunities. In this context, we have not compromised our corporate responsibility performance and, in many aspects, have improved on it. This reflects the degree to which we have successfully integrated corporate responsibility into the core of our business. As in previous years, the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, to which we remain committed, have helped guide our efforts in this respect. How does corporate responsibility support Premier’s business? We do not see corporate responsibility as being separate from the rest of our business. The latent environmental and safety challenges involved in offshore drilling and production mean we have to build responsible management into everything we do. Indeed, our approach to responsible management is integral to supporting short-term stakeholder value by protecting not only our operational continuity, but also our business-critical relationships with host governments, investors, local communities and business partners. Our approach also supports longer-term stakeholder value by both improving our access to new commercial opportunities and ensuring we are well prepared for evolving social attitudes and public policies.

Premier Oil plc // 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report 38 Section 3: Environment Premier is committed to operating responsibly and will never knowingly compromise our environmental standards to meet our operational objectives. We will do all that is reasonably practicable to minimise our impact on the environment. Premier Oil plc // 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report 39 Materiality OVERVIEW Premier currently conducts all of its operated activities offshore, where we drill for and extract oil and gas from sub-surface reservoirs. By their very nature, offshore oil and gas operations OUR APPROACH can have a range of potential impacts on water quality, air quality and local ecosystems. Furthermore, any failure to take reasonable steps to avoid and/ or mitigate negative environmental impacts poses a material risk to Premier’s reputation, as well as our HS&S ability to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations. Our most significant environmental ENVIRONMENT issues relate to: • Greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption and flaring at our facilities • Effluents and waste, including the prevention of spills and the EMPLOYEES responsible management of hazardous materials Managing our environmental performance We manage our environmental COMMUNITY RELATIONS performance across the lifecycles of our operations and projects through our HSES Management System (p29–31). All our operated production and drilling activities are certified to the ISO 14001 environmental management standard. Our HSES Management System, as well as our external ISO 14001 audits, help ensure that we continue SOCIETY to comply with relevant environmental legislation and regulations. In 2015, we spent US$5.5 million on identifiable environmental management measures. APPENDIX Impact assessment Under our HSES Management System, we conduct baseline surveys and prepare environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) for each operated activity.

By doing so, the power the existing turbines with a new spare HS&S a ‘two-turbine’ operating strategy generated per unit of fuel utilised on turbine (currently in storage) in 2016, was fully implemented. In real terms, the platform is increased. It is estimated with the aim of further improving using two turbines instead of three that actual diesel consumption can be Balmoral’s operating efficiency. ENVIRONMENT Air pollutants Our discharges to air (in addition to our greenhouse gas emissions – see p41–42) are set out in Figure 28 below16. In broad terms, these emissions have fallen due to decreased diesel usage in vessels.

Premier Oil plc // 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report 50 Section 4: Employees continued Workforce reduction Difficult market conditions mean it has been necessary to carry out a limited number of redundancies (39 in 2015). We have tried to limit the number of employees facing redundancy by reducing the number of contractors we employ and by actively seeking redeployment opportunities. Where an employee has been at risk of losing their job they have been consulted to identify ways in which this can be prevented. If it was still found that redundancy was necessary, employees were consulted on how to mitigate the resulting impacts. We have offered affected employees outplacement support, financial counselling or additional training, as well as making an enhanced redundancy payment that exceeds statutory requirements. Local employment We employ suitably qualified nationals whenever possible.
