Changed market structures and changed success factors – the chemical industry is in transition. And we too must change if we are to remain successful in the long term. In 2015, we took a number of resolute decisions as we set a new strategic course. Our new perspective is growth: focused, moderate and sustainable.

In the past fiscal year, for example, not only did we exceed all of the financial targets we com­ mitted to at the start of the year, we also made rapid and significant progress in realigning the company. At the start of the year, we reorganized our business units and group functions, restructured our manage­ ment team and initiated sustainable cost reductions, some of which had been realized sooner than expected by the end of fiscal 2015. We also found the ideal partner for our rubber business in Saudi Aramco. Im­ proved access to strategically important raw materials combined with the strengths of our Tire & Specialty Rubbers and High Performance Elastomers business units will ensure their long-term competitiveness in a market that has changed fundamentally in recent years. We intend to use the financial proceeds from the partnership with Saudi Aramco to continue developing LANXESS in line with a clear strategy. We aim to achieve a better balance in our portfolio and to engage primarily in mid-sized markets. And we intend to invest only where sustainable growth is possible. Our objective is clear: In 2020, LANXESS should be a more stable, less cyclical and more profitable specialty chemicals company. Quality and sustainability are the stable foundation on which we are building this transformation. However, we do not restrict our concept of quality to our products and services; quality shapes our culture and our entire corporate philosophy. This philosophy also includes meeting our global responsibility toward people and the environment. In 2015, we underscored our sense of responsibility by reaffirming our commitment to the principles of the U.N. Global Compact. On behalf of my colleagues on the Board of Management, I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our employees for their extraordinary dedication and willingness to embrace change. They have done first-class work. I would also like to thank our customers, business partners and particularly you, our stockholders, for your confidence in our change process. Together we have achieved something very important in just a very short time: We are LANXESS again. And I am confident that if we can sustain this momentum and this will to succeed, we will achieve so much more in the years ahead.

More than 100 years’ experience. The world market leader with the broadest product portfolio in the industry. Globally recognized for first-class product and service quality. The characteristics of our rubber business are not ones that would normally be associated with an economic problem child. But what is the value of tradition if the future makes different demands? And what is the value of market leadership if it fails to deliver adequate returns? LANXESS Annual Report 2015 A new quality of cooperation 9 Matthias Zachert and Abdulrahman F. Al-Wuhaib, Senior Vice President Downstream of Saudi Aramco, signed the new joint venture agreement in September 2015. Nothing is as it once was There has been a sea change in the global rubber market, resulting in permanent change to the com­ petitive environment. In recent years, significant production capacities – for high-quality products as well – have been created in countries such as China that used to be traditional export markets. And the lower raw material and energy prices in many parts of the world have further exacerbated the wage-related cost disadvantages of European producers.

PERSPECTIVES Matthias Zachert LANXESS Annual Report 2015 15 In the past one-and-a-half years, LANXESS has undergone a dramatic change process. What do you think was special about it? Matthias Zachert: In a first for our company, this change process didn’t just involve a small team but Dr. Hubert Fink spanned all business units and functions. They have worked together to evaluate an enormous amount of information. This process yielded the organizational and strategic changes we have made as well as various initiatives that have produced very tangible and impressive results. Can you give us an example? Until now, LANXESS has always been associated with rubber. Matthias Zachert: Central outcomes have been What will the company’s name the streamlining of the business unit structure and stand for in the future? the strategic realignment of the company. The latter was instrumental in the decision to seek a Matthias Zachert: The realignment doesn’t partner for the rubber business. mean that we’re withdrawing from the rubber busi­ ness altogether.

When will they again be able to enjoy their investment? Michael Pontzen: Unfortunately, there’s no ­simple answer or patent recipe here. Basically it’s up to us to provide investors with strong a­ rguments for putting a higher value on LANXESS stock. In this respect, we certainly achieved quite a lot in 2015. And it’s not as if the capital market has ­entirely ­ignored our realignment until now. ­Standard & Poor’s has raised its outlook for LANXESS, while Moody’s has also positively commented on the measures we’ve taken. If these now take effect as planned, it should be reflected in our share price sooner or later. However, there’s always the m ­ arket as a whole to consider, which is something we unfortunately can’t influence and which is currently dragging the entire industry down. What you can influence, though, is your indebtedness, which the capital market has been watching closely in the recent past. When will this get back down to a healthy level? Michael Pontzen: It already has. We’re pleased to have been able to substantially reduce our indebtedness over the past two years. The transaction with Saudi Aramco and the resulting cash inflow will tangibly improve our capitalization in 2016 and place us in a relatively comfortable financial position. As a company, we have thus regained our financial strength and can start to invest again. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 17 You’re talking again about making acquisitions as well as capital expenditures. Is that not contrary to a secure investment-grade rating? Dr. Rainier van Roessel Michael Pontzen: It’s important to us that we maintain a solid investment-grade rating. Yes, we’re looking at growth opportunities, but always with this objective in mind. We attach high priority to ensuring that our capital expenditures afford good potential for growing earnings. At the same time, we also want to improve the risk profile of our portfolio. The bottom line is that we are aiming to increase profitability while reducing the volatility of our earnings. » It’s important to us that we maintain a solid investmentgrade rating.« Michael Pontzen LANXESS Annual Report 2015 18 Change creates new perspectives » We are seeking to support each individual in becoming creative and proactive, in addressing and acting on issues.« You are also aiming to improve the company’s profitability.

Budgets are generally in the range of €100 million to €150 million. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 19 LANXESS has seen sweeping changes and will have to adapt to new situations in the future as well. How do you motivate your workforce in such processes and how can you make LANXESS attractive to new employees? Dr. Rainier van Roessel: We have been work­ ing hard to improve the way we interact within the company. That means we are collaborating more closely, being more open in the feedback we give and facilitating greater participation in major decisions. It is very important to me to motivate our e ­ mployees. We are seeking to support each individual in becoming creative and proactive, in addressing and acting on issues. This helps our employees to identify with what they do and is the best fuel for LANXESS’s commer­ cial success. Ultimately, it benefits our employees as well. Matthias Zachert: We have returned to being a company that is working at shaping its future with a great deal of energy, drive and enthusiasm. I believe that makes us attractive to all target groups – to our present workforce and potential new employees, but also to business partners and investors. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Strategy Systematic implementation of realignment program Joint venture for synthetic rubber with Saudi Aramco Creation of headroom for strategic optimization QUALITY Our concept of quality extends far beyond our actual products or services. Quality has its roots in the philosophy practiced by our company and by each individual employee. It is characterized by an entrepreneurial mindset, quick decision-making and unconventional solutions. 22 Strategy Successful transition In a market environment that is undergoing fundamental change, we must change as well. Through the three-phase realignment program we are implementing systematically and successfully, we created the basis for a new strategic course in 2015. The aim is for LANXESS to be a much more stable and profitable specialty chemicals enterprise in 2020. An industry facing change Despite its comparative maturity, the chemical industry is continuing to expand. Worldwide it is achieving growth rates which are in part well above overall global economic expansion. However, for European chemical companies in particular, it will become increasingly challenging in the medium term to benefit from this generally positive environment. The reason for this is to be found in profound change ­processes which have impacted market structures and mechanisms – some of which have been in place for d ­ ecades – and which will continue to shape the industry’s operating environment over the coming years. 1. Overcapacities in the synthetic rubber market The commissioning of major new plants for the production of synthetic rubbers in recent years has created considerable overcapacities in this market, which has exacerbated the existing pressure on prices worldwide. 2. Competitive raw material prices and ongoing cost optimization are crucial In the price-sensitive synthetic rubbers business, raw materials and energy account for about 75% of production costs. Producers in emerging economies and the Middle East mostly have better access to low-cost raw materials and energy, as do those in the United States. As a result, they enjoy cost advantages which European suppliers will struggle to achieve through efficiency gains. 3. European chemical industry under pressure The ongoing expansion of local production capacities in the global growth regions, especially Asia, means the progressive decline of export opportunities for European suppliers. By contrast, the United States and the Middle East – aided by low energy prices and the ready availability of raw materials – are transitioning from importers to exporters in the commodity segment, bringing low-cost products to the world’s markets. 4. China remains the main growth market China will further strengthen its role as the growth engine of the global chemical industry through 2030. According to estimates from market research company IHS, the country is likely to account for around 40% of global chemicals demand in 2030. A significant proportion of this demand will likely be covered by domestic suppliers. Suppliers wishing to participate in this growth will have to build not just individual plants but entire value chains in the country. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Successful transition An industry facing change 23 5. The focus of innovation is shifting from molecules to applications and processes In the past, innovative expertise was mainly manifested in the successful development of novel chemical compounds with new or improved properties. In view of the enormous scientific advances being made and the high cost of registering new substances, there are now fewer opportunities for bringing commercially viable new chemical compounds to market. For the broad majority of chemical companies, innovation in the future will mean accessing new fields of application for existing products and making production processes as safe and efficient as possible. 6. Environmental standards will converge at a high level in the medium to long term With growing environmental awareness, sustainable production standards worldwide will converge at a high level. In the medium term, this development will offer a further opportunity for consolidation, because, in the growth markets in particular, not all competitors will make the necessary capital investments to upgrade their plants to meet regulatory requirements. However, in the long term, producers that have always applied high standards will lose this advantage over their competitors. We, like others, face the challenge of reacting to these change processes. Our measures can be consoli­ dated in six strategic approaches. Reduction of dependence on volatile raw materials such as ethylene and butadiene Sustained growth in China, North Process and cost optimization America and Southeast Asia as an ongoing entrepreneurial challenge Strengthen the competitiveness of our networked sites Value chains Further expansion of our integrated value chains Increased focus on profitable mid-sized markets LANXESS Annual Report 2015 24 Strategy Successful realignment creates strategic headroom Several of the aforementioned approaches were already clearly reflected in our three-phase “Let’s LANXESS again” global realignment program, which we initiated in 2014 and pursued in the reporting year – with measurable success. “Let’s LANXESS Again” – A Three-Phase Realignment Program Is Being Implemented ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������ III. Competitiveness of the business portfolio II. Operational competitiveness I.

In the reporting year, we already fully realized annual savings of around €150 million, which we originally expected to achieve from 2016. These are set against cumulated exceptional charges of around €150 million for fiscal 2014 and 2015 together. In close and constructive dialogue with employee representatives, we eliminated around 1,000 positions worldwide – about half of them in Germany – in this first phase of the program. Phase II: Operational competitiveness As a result of our initiative to optimize production operations, we intend to discontinue the manufacture of EPDM rubber at the Marl site in Germany by the end of the first quarter of 2016. We are also reducing From 2019, sustainable savings of capacities for NBR and ESBR rubber at our sites in La Wantzenau, France, and Duque de Caxias, Brazil. In conjunction with many process improvement and efficiency enhancement measures, we aim to achieve a further €150 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2019. €300 million As part of our initiative to achieve commercial and supply chain excellence, we automated and harmonized will be generated by Phase I order processing in 2015. A further project was dedicated to developing a new customer care approach, and II measures. aimed at tailoring our services even better to the needs and expectations of our different customer groups. Phase III: Competitiveness of the business portfolio In September 2015, we agreed a partnership for the synthetic rubber business with Saudi Aramco – the world’s largest integrated energy producer – in which each party will hold a 50% interest. We are contrib­  www.saudiaramco.com uting our Tire & Specialty Rubbers and High Performance Elastomers business units to the alliance, with a total of 20 production facilities in nine countries and around 3,800 employees as well as management support functions. Our partner will facilitate competitive access to strategic raw materials for this business area in the medium term (see also “In focus,” page 8). Saudi Aramco is expected to pay around €1.2 billion for its 50% interest after deduction of debt and other financial liabilities. This cash inflow will not only allow us to pay down more of our debt, but will also give us the crucial headroom for the strategic optimization of the Group in the years ahead. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 26 Strategy A clear vision for progress Through its new strategic alignment, LANXESS aims in 2020 to be a less cyclical specialty chemicals group with a strong cash flow and a balanced portfolio. To achieve this, we will be building especially on our strengths in mid-sized markets. Here we can offer our customers an attractive combination – the professionalism of a global chemicals company coupled with the customer proximity and agility of a specialized niche provider. These advantages, along with mostly above-average growth rates in these markets, create good prospects for LANXESS. In the further optimization of LANXESS, we will be focusing on the following areas of activity in particular. 1. Achieving a more balanced portfolio It is our declared aim to reduce financial dependence on individual industries or closely correlated markets We have defined in the future. In regional terms, too, we aim to achieve an even better balance in our portfolio by increasing China, North America and the share of our business accounted for by the growth markets of China, North America and Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia as the growth markets for LANXESS. With the aim of achieving this better balance, we can work in many respects from a position of strength to develop the Advanced Intermediates and Performance Chemicals segments and the High Performance Materials business unit of our Performance Polymers segment. The two business units of our Advanced Intermediates segment hold leadership positions with their highly diversified product portfolios and count a number of global players among their customers. By expanding our highly efficient networked sites in Germany, we are creating the necessary capacities for leveraging growth opportunities in Asia and the United States. Our application-driven businesses, which we have brought together in the Performance Chemicals segment, are world leaders in their niche markets. Potential lies above all in further integration of global value chains and the elimination of existing capacity bottlenecks. Moreover, in part highly fragmented competitive structures are expected to provide us with the opportunity in the medium term to actively participate in market consolidation. High Performance Materials, with its expertise in innovative hybrid and composite technologies, a backward integrated value chain and a globe-spanning network of modern production facilities, is in a promising position to serve the growing demand for high-tech plastics for automotive and many other applications. In this business, we aim to improve the balance of the value chain especially by increasing the captive use of intermediates for our innovative polyamide compounds, an area in which we seek further expansion.

On the other hand, we are also investigating options to extend our portfolio into related areas of business that are the right fit. Here, we will consider both integrated chemical value chains and suitable application-driven businesses. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Successful transition A clear vision for progress 29  Quality and sustainability – key success factors A clear objective in our sights Quality and sustainability – key success factors Quality and sustainability are the strong foundation on which we aim to build LANXESS. However, we do not restrict our concept of quality to our products and the associated services; quality is an element of the philosophy already practiced by our company and each individual employee. We foster and promote a value-based performance culture. Every employee – regardless of function or position in the hierarchy – is expected to display an entrepreneurial mindset, to quickly take solution-oriented decisions and to be open to new and unconventional approaches. Our diverse team is the key to successfully implementing our strategy. In this context, our global human resources work (see the “Corporate Responsibility” section, page 42) is an important pillar of our corporate strategy. We also consider quality to mean conducting our business sustainably in the broadest sense. We strive to combine safety, environmental protection, social responsibility and commercial efficiency in our busi­ “ Good for business, good for society.” ness operations. Sustainability is an important criterion in all our strategic considerations and decisions. This short sentence perfectly sums up our approach to business. This is summed up not least by the sentence: “Good for business, good for society” (see the “Corporate Responsibility” section, page 32). We aim to sustainably increase the company’s enterprise value and to make a value contribution that serves the interests of our stockholders, customers, employees and society. From an external perspective, quality and sustainability are to a certain extent the catalysts for creating value: for our customers, who see in LANXESS a reliable partner that not only reliably delivers top-quality products but also actively supports their innovation processes; for our investors, whose capital we use responsibly and who benefit from an appropriate share in the company’s success by way of a consistent dividend policy – even in challenging times; and for society, which we serve in many ways as a construc­ tive and fair partner. A clear objective in our sights The operational progress and important strategic decisions made in 2015 have laid the foundation for LANXESS’s future viability and development – together with our strong partner Saudi Aramco in the rubber business, and independently as a leading supplier in promising mid-sized specialty chemicals markets. In 2020, the name LANXESS should stand for stability, earning power and moderate growth – in short, for successful transition. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Corporate Responsibility Further decline in accident rate per million hours worked to people reached by way of not-for-profit projects SUSTAINABILITY “Good for business, good for society.” This short sentence perfectly sums up our approach to business and expresses our goal of combining safety, environmental protection, social responsibility and commercial efficiency in our business operations. Sustainability is an important criterion in all our strategic considerations and decisions. Substantial reduction in CO2 emissions by 32 Corporate Responsibility Corporate Responsibility As an international specialty chemicals group, we bear a major responsibility toward people and the environment. Our entrepreneurial activities reflect this sense of responsibility, which is also a key component of our strategy. Safety, environmental protection, social responsibility, quality and commercial efficiency are all key corporate goals at LANXESS. CR management We regard acting and thinking sustainably as the responsibility of each and every employee at LANXESS. However, sustainability in itself is no more than an abstract concept. Appropriate organizational structures, strategies, operational guidelines and goals are needed to enable our employees to act sustainably in their day-to-day work and to translate the abstract concept into a specific factor of entrepreneurial success. Innovation Know-how Products Corporate Corporate Sustainability governance citizenship Economic Social Environmental responsibility responsibility responsibility We have established various committees and functions to ensure compliance with and the ongoing optimization of our CR strategy and our rules and standards. nn CR Committee Representatives from selected group functions develop our CR strategy and ensure that all LANXESS’s CR activities are in line with this strategy. As an interdisciplinary competence center, the committee ­advises both the Board of Management and the business units on all matters relating to sustainability. It is also responsible for collecting and maintaining reliable data that comply with current market standards for use in our external CR communications. The Board of Management is regularly represented on the CR Committee by Dr. van Roessel. nn HSEQ Committee LANXESS’s senior executives, under the direction of Board of Management member Dr. Hubert Fink, ensure worldwide compliance with uniformly high quality management, safety, environmental, energy and climate protection standards. The committee has responsibility for initiating and monitoring the global implementation of all necessary HSEQ guidelines, strategies and programs, as well as for ­defining our HSEQ objectives and monitoring their achievement. It also defines the global strategy for our integrated quality and environmental management system and our energy management system. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 CR management 33 nn Compliance organization The compliance organization, which is made up of the Group Compliance Officer and a network of local compliance officers, handles all referrals concerning compliance violations, with the goal of countering illegal or unethical conduct by LANXESS employees at an early stage and introducing suitable measures to prevent improprieties. At the end of 2015, we additionally established an interdisciplinary project team headed by Dr. Fink, which has the task of aligning our strategic corporate objectives more closely with the requirements of sustain­ ability management and corporate responsibility at LANXESS. The interactions between ­political, social and corporate strategy developments are of central importance here. Ultimately, a committee comprising top management representatives (Board of Management, business units and group functions) will take the decisions concerning our future course in respect of significant sustainability issues such as climate strategy, ecological efficiency in our operations, product stewardship, and human resources and supply chain management. Integrated management system creates transparency At LANXESS, a central management system provides the necessary global structures to ensure responsible commercial practices. Through this tool, we have created a transparent system and set of rules that unite management and employees across national borders. Worldwide, we are guided by internal directives and operating procedures, as well as by the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 international standards for quality and environmental management and ISO 50001 for energy management. External, independent experts regularly audit the progress in integrating new sites into our management system and the system’s performance worldwide. Confirmation of our compliance with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 takes the form of a global matrix certificate. We successfully completed the recertification audit in 2015. Our energy management system was certified separately in Germany. As of December 31, 2015, our matrix certificate covered 48 companies with 80 sites in 23 countries. The sites in Epierre, France; Lipetsk, Russia; and Little Rock, United States, were included for the first O  ur global matrix certificate time, as planned. Our sites in the United States have also received confirmation of certification to RC 14001 now covers 48 companies with 80 sites in 23 countries. (RC = Responsible Care®). In 2016, we intend to integrate the production sites in Neville Island, United States; Rustenburg, South Africa; and Joo Koon, Singapore, into the matrix certificate. HSEQ (health, safety, environmental protection and quality) management is an important part of our inte­ grated management system. We have aligned our HSEQ management system toward ensuring uniform standards and reference bases for all our sites. The key performance indicators (KPIs) required for this purpose are recorded, thus enabling us to systematically determine and analyze performance in each business unit and at each site and to develop this sustainably in the future. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 34 Corporate Responsibility Guidelines for business conduct All management systems are based on guidelines that provide a clear framework for a company’s manage­ ment and employees. Our system is based on established global standards and on our company’s own basic rules, which are subject to ongoing amendment. LANXESS respects applicable law and requires its employees and business partners to do likewise. All our decisions and activities must meet this requirement of the compliance code, irrespective of the aims we are pursuing or the conditions we face. In the first instance, we define applicable law as any inter­ national or national legislation in the jurisdictions in which LANXESS operates. Moreover, human rights and ethical principles apply without restriction, even if they are not stipulated in the applicable law. As a global enterprise, we are committed in all our markets to promoting respect for human rights at all times LANXESS is committed to and to preventing child and forced labor. In this context, we have also signed the U.N. Global Compact the principles of the and recognize the principles it sets forth as inalienable rights. We renewed our commitment in this regard U.N Global Compact. for the 2015 reporting year. www.unglobalcompact.org We understand compliance to be the observance of all legal provisions that are binding on the LANXESS Group and its employees and of internal LANXESS rules. In addition, we are committed to ­internationally recognized basic principles of business activity. As well as the principles of the Responsible Care® Global Charter, these include ILO labor standards and the basic principles of the Global Compact. Our ­employees’ integrity and awareness of their responsibilities are key factors in the success of our company. The Ten Principles of the U.N.

Principle 5 Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labor. 6  Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occu­ pation. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 CR management 35 The “Code of conduct – Code for integrity and compliance at LANXESS,” which is applicable throughout the Group, specifies minimum standards and gives our employees advice and guidance on complying with these standards. Our code covers issues such as anti-competitive behavior, anti-corruption, data protection, o ­ ccupational, product and plant safety, and environmental protection. Other directives set forth detailed rules for s­ pecific areas covered by the code and concrete requirements for the conduct of LANXESS employees. All globally applicable LANXESS directives and guidelines are contained in a system that is accessible to every employee. Our code of conduct can be found on our website at www.lanxess.com under Corporate Responsibility/Corporate Governance/Compliance at LANXESS. Compliance management system We have established a compliance management system (CMS) to implement our clear commitment to compliance in our daily business activities. This system guides our employees and eliminates p ­ otential uncer­ tainties relating to our compliance principles. It also encompasses advice and training in ­compliance-related issues. Our global compliance management system is defined in our CMS directive and is externally audited at regular intervals in respect of its design, suitability and effectiveness. These audits are not restricted to defined risks but focus on the ten main compliance risks that we have identified. The last audit by ­Deloitte & Touche GmbH in 2012 was completed without observation and with an unqualified audit opinion. ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� Environment Anti-corruption 7 Businesses should support a 10  Businesses should work against precautionary approach to environ­ corruption in all its forms, including mental challenges. extortion and bribery. 8 Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater envi­ ronmental responsibility. 9 Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly techno­ logies. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 36 Corporate Responsibility The basic elements of our CMS are: nn Compliance culture This is shaped by the commitment of our Board of Management and Supervisory Board. It is essential that all management levels live and communicate our compliance culture so that it permeates the entire company. At LANXESS, responsibility for compliance and business activities goes hand in hand. nn  ompliance objective C We seek to avoid any compliance violations. nn Compliance risks The risks are regularly analyzed, discussed with the Board of Management and evaluated according to the likelihood of occurrence and damage potential. Risk exposure is analyzed both for business areas and countries, and corresponding countermeasures are defined. The main areas of potential compliance risk are antitrust and competition law, anti-corruption, foreign trade law, environmental and safety regulations, data protection, product liability, insider trading, discrimination, accounting law and fraud against the company. nn Compliance program  Our compliance program includes all of the “classic” CMS elements, such as a compliance code, specific guidelines and work instructions, established guidance systems, information and training. We aim to ensure compliance in the broader sense by clearly assigning responsibilities within our structural and process organizations, and by implementing a functioning internal control system and suitable auditing and monitoring activities. nn Compliance organization  L ANXESS has established a compliance organization, headed by the Group Compliance Officer, to assist its employees in observing the code of conduct and to provide support for the compliance management system. In those countries where LANXESS operates through subsidiaries, the Group Compliance Officer is assisted by local compliance officers. The responsibility for ensuring legally compliant behavior, however, always rests with the respective decision-maker. We therefore view compliance primarily as a key leadership task. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 CR management 37 nn Compliance communication  Information events and training courses enable our employees to fulfill their tasks correctly and in compliance with the law. The compliance section on the LANXESS intranet also offers e-learning programs. Compliance issues and problems are reported from the bottom up to the local compliance officers and by them on to the Group Compliance Officer. All significant developments, findings and measures are reported to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on a regular basis. There is an obligation to report ad hoc to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in the event of wide-reaching compliance violations. However, there has been no need to do so as yet. nn Compliance monitoring  Compliance monitoring is performed by means of general audits and special audit programs conducted by Internal Auditing and a central HSE department. Since Internal Auditing is itself part of the CMS, we have this organizational unit regularly audited by independent third parties. The status of compliance at LANXESS is also subject to regular review by the auditor of the annual financial statements. Responsible Care® Transparency and improved public dialogue are among the stated objectives of the Responsible Care® Global Charter launched by the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). The aim is to build confidence and trust in an industry that has a crucial role in improving people’s living standards and quality of life. We became one of the signatories to the ICCA charter in 2006. By signing the revised Responsible Care® Global Charter in 2014, we reaffirmed our commitment to the visions and ethical principles of the initiative. For us, applying the Responsible Care® Global Charter to our business means  e have been supporting the W consistently working to improve our processes and performance in terms of environmental and climate chemical industry’s global Responsible Care® initiative protection, health, safety and quality. Our corporate directives ensure that the principles of the charter since 2006. are integrated into our management principles and corporate strategy. www.responsible-care.com We expect our suppliers to commit to our values and rules, especially the Global Compact, to establish adequate systems for ensuring legally compliant behavior and to carry ethical behavior throughout their organizations. The LANXESS Supplier Code of Conduct is part of our communication with suppliers. Reviewing compliance with these requirements is a key aspect of our collaboration in the Together ­for  s a member of the Together A Sustainability initiative we operate jointly with 17 other international chemical companies (see page 119). for Sustainability initiative, Additionally, in the course of acquisitions, we make it a principle of our due diligence processes to ensure we promote sustainability in the that human rights are also respected by the target company. chemical industry supply chain. www.tfs-initiative.com LANXESS Annual Report 2015 38 Corporate Responsibility Active stakeholder dialogue GRI The stakeholders of relevance to LANXESS are the groups, institutions and people with whom we are G4–18 G4–24 linked directly or indirectly through our business units and who therefore have a justified interest in our G4–25 activities. Our most important stakeholder groups are customers, employees, suppliers, capital market G4–26 G4–27 participants, the media, neighbors of our sites and representatives of politics, public authorities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We conduct an intensive dialogue with all these groups with the aim of identifying topics that they consider to be significant in terms of corporate responsibility. At the same time, we seek to encourage mutual understanding and build trust through an open and constructive exchange of views. External stakeholder survey enables accurate materiality analysis In order to optimize our sustainability strategy and utilize resources in the most effective way possible, it is essential to systematically prioritize the various areas of activity. In this regard, we consider the mate­ riality analysis as defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to be an important tool. This analysis is based on four principles: sustainability context, materiality, completeness and stakeholder inclusiveness. In 2015, we commissioned a comprehensive personal survey of our main external stakeholders which was based in both content and method on our 2014 internal survey. Participation in our External Stakeholder Survey % 9.2 Customers Suppliers 13.6 Investors 36.4 Media NGOs Politics 13.6 13.6 13.6 The survey participants were unanimous that sustainability is of great strategic importance for a global chemical company. A broad majority regard LANXESS as a company that acts sustainably and rated us highly for fulfilling our corporate responsibility. Of the 31 issues evaluated in six areas, our external stake­ holders consider anti-corruption, safety at work and compliance to be the most relevant. They saw room for improving sustainability communications through face-to-face discussions – customers in particular would welcome a more active information policy from LANXESS. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 CR management 39 The consolidated findings from the two surveys are shown in our materiality matrix, which has been given GRI G4–18 a clear new format.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015 40 Corporate Responsibility GRI Thus, as well as the detailed information on our compliance management system contained in this G4–18 G4–26 ­section, a large amount of other information about anti-corruption and compliance is once again provided G4–27 in the GRI Content Index starting on page 247 of this report. Measures aimed at achieving continuous improvements in occupational safety are brought together in the Board of Management’s “Xact” initiative, which we discuss in detail on page 55. The Together for Sustainability initiative mentioned previously seeks to provide a transparent portrayal of sustainability in our supply chain. The progress achieved in the reporting year is described in the combined management report on page 119. Customer satisfaction as a success factor Customer satisfaction and customer loyalty are among the most important success factors to us. Our central inquiry management system provides customers with information about our products, their applications and potential risks and with product certificates. Critical feedback from customers gives us valuable pointers for improving our products and processes. In early 2015, we established a decentral customer complaint management system in the operating units. Anchored directly in the business units, this process is aimed at addressing customer issues both quickly and competently so as to establish a sustained bond between the customer and us. By conducting regular customer surveys using recognized opinion research methods, we obtain vital Our 2015 customer information about the loyalty of our customers, their expectations and how they perceive our products survey was completed by and services compared with those of our competitors. In the course of the “Let’s LANXESS again” pro­ 421 gram, responsibility for customer surveys was transferred to the individual business units and thus also decentralized. In 2015, five of our ten business units carried out surveys with a total of 421 participants. Positive ratings were received for our technical expertise, customer focus and delivery reliability in par­ respondents. ticular. On the other hand, the customers surveyed still saw room for improvement in terms of pricing and delivery flexibility. In 2016, the other five business units will follow with their own surveys. Our daily commitment to high product quality and customer satisfaction is regularly recognized and honored with awards and prizes. For example, in 2015 LANXESS was named Top Influential Brand at the China International Rubber Industry Exposition, a key industry event. U.S. company Dayco, the world leader in manufacturing toothed belts for engine drives and a major customer for our high-performance elastomer Therban, once again rated us its best supplier in China. Acting together – maintaining effective networks We are very aware that no single organization alone – company, government, research institute or NGO – will be able to master the major societal challenges of our time. Alongside our own CR activities, we therefore participate in powerful global networks where we combine our competence in sustainable development with the expertise of other partners. As well as state institutions, NGOs in particular – with their extensive expert knowledge of specific issues – have a crucial role here. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 CR management 41 Since 2013, for example, we have been supporting “Chemie³,” the joint sustainability initiative of the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI), the German Mining, Chemical and Energy Industrial Union (IG BCE) and the German Chemical Industry Employers’ Association (BAVC). The initiative focuses on the Guidelines for Sustainability in the Chemical Industry in Germany, which encompass a total of 12 areas of activity and were formulated with input from internal and external stakeholders. They are a mission statement for the industry, supporting companies and their employees in expanding their contributions We have been supporting the Chemie3 initiative to sustainability. The initiative has also set itself the goal of developing new economic, environmental and in Germany since 2013. social progress indicators in the area of sustainability by 2017. www.chemiehochdrei.de In addition to trade shows, high-level congresses provide us with important forums for discussion with potential and existing business partners, competitors, scientists and opinion leaders on current develop­ ments and future challenges in the area of sustainability. In November 2015, more than 150 international GRI G4–26 participants accepted our invitation to attend the second LANXESS Pigments Symposium in Shanghai, G4–27 China. The two TfS Supplier Days that we organized in São Paulo, Brazil, and Shanghai, China, in the reporting year attracted around 750 visitors in total. We often contribute to studies concerning socially relevant issues, such as an environmentally friendly approach to mobility. In the reporting year, a European Climate Foundation study we supported entitled “Fuelling Britain’s Future” received a great deal of attention and was even presented in the British House of Commons. The central finding of this study was that, like alternative vehicle powertrains, high-tech plastics can make a significant contribution to climate protection. In addition, in a long-term test conducted jointly with energy provider RheinEnergie and confirmed by TÜV Rheinland, we demonstrated that the use of green tires can reduce fuel consumption in urban traffic by up to 7%. We also conduct an open dialogue with government representatives and with authorities on local, Euro­ pean and international level. The focus is on an active exchange of ideas on strategic corporate issues such as environmentally friendly product and process innovations, developments on raw material and energy markets, and issues relating to the labor market and education policy. Our own offices in Berlin and Brussels place us close to the center of political decision-making. LANXESS representatives are also active in a number of industry associations. Another important element of our stakeholder communication is structured dialogue with residents in the immediate vicinity of our sites. For example, our affiliate Currenta operates Chempunkt neighborship offices in Leverkusen, Dormagen and Krefeld-Uerdingen to serve as a point of contact for local residents interested in discussing issues concerning the Chempark sites. Awards for sustained commitment Our commitment was again recognized with various awards in 2015. For the first time, the China Enterprise Evaluation Association (CEEA) and the Social Science Faculty of Tsinghua University published a list of 500 companies in China which best fulfill their responsibility to society. In 130th place, LANXESS ranked in the top third of the listing. At the Salute to the China Dream financial summit, LANXESS received the Best CSR Award for the second time in succession in recognition of our leading position in the area of corporate social responsibility and environmentally compatible corporate development. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 42 Corporate Responsibility Employees Our long-term entrepreneurial success is fundamentally based on our employees’ sense of ­responsibility, professionalism and focus on solutions. We as a company will only be able to continue successfully exploiting the opportunities presented by evolving markets if we constantly invest in employee training and development – in particular in their ability to act on the basis of values, to take a fresh approach and swiftly implement ideas, and to work as part of a team in developing solutions. In 2015, our HR strategy continued to support the successful realignment of the Group. In order to shape and steer the cultural shift we are seeking, the Board of Management and senior executives used an interactive approach to develop a new value model, which they discussed with employees in numerous workshops held at almost all our sites around the world. Other focal points of HR strategy were implementing and supporting global restructuring activities and designing the organization of our new partnership with Saudi Aramco. The ongoing realignment of the LANXESS Group was reflected in our global headcount in 2015. A total of 825 new employees joined the company worldwide in fiscal 2015. 155 new employees were hired in Germany, where our focus was on the recruitment of specialists from various disciplines.

To cushion the impact in a socially respon­ sible way, we have taken measures such as appointing an advisory and placement agency in Germany. Against the backdrop of our headcount adjustment program, we recorded increasing turnover during the reporting period. In Germany, the turnover resulting from voluntary resignations was 1.1% in the reporting period (2014: 0.69%). Globally, it was around 2.9% (2014: 3.29%).

In order to achieve our corporate goals, it is essential that we remain flexible and open to change in the areas of recruiting and talent management as well. When faced with challenging markets and operating conditions, we expect our employees to display a high degree of professionalism, flexibility and willingness to change. In return, we offer a wide range of development opportunities, including foreign assignments, collaboration in interdisciplinary projects and transfer between business units and central functions.

We are especially committed to fostering young talents during their undergraduate or PhD study programs and facilitating their successful career start. To enable the smartest minds to realize their full potential, we specifically sponsor outstanding master’s and PhD students in scientific and engineering subjects through the LANXESS support program.

The goal is to give preference to candidates who have completed this program when filling positions within the company. A successful recruiting tool which also benefits society is our partnership with Teach First in Germany www.teachforall.org and Teach For India (TFI). We have been one of the main sponsors of these not-for-profit organizations www.teachfirst.de since 2010. Both organizations are national network partners of the global Teach For All initiative, which www.teachforindia.org aims to help school students who have had a difficult start in life, fostering their individual talents and developing their career prospects. Particularly highly qualified university graduates from all disciplines, who also have the requisite soft skills, act as fellows for a period of two years, helping schools in socially disadvantaged areas with education and schooling tasks. Acquiring and retaining specialists and managers In recent years, our international trainee programs have proved very successful. Particularly highly 9 quali­fied university graduates are prepared for challenging specialist and management roles within the company, already gaining international experience during the program. In 2015, nine international ­trainee programs were launched in Germany with a total of 16 participants (12 women and 4 men). The focus international trainee programs was on marketing, controlling, engineering, human resources and finance. offer university graduates attractive entry opportunities We also offer local trainee and university student programs in various regions. In the United States, at LANXESS. we collaborate with a number of universities to provide trainee and intern programs in the fields of finance and engineering. LANXESS in India has established three “XTrainee” programs structured individually for students, gradu­ ates and prospective managers. Participants in these programs are given a specific project to work on and are supported by a mentor. In 2015, 29 students, graduates and prospective managers received training and guidance in one of these programs. LANXESS in India runs a further one-year training program in collaboration with the Industrial Training Institute (ITI) which allows 14 young people to continue their training after completing an apprenticeship as a production specialist or technician. On account of their location away from the main business centers, our South African sites have ­traditionally faced a particular challenge in attracting suitably qualified university graduates. For that reason, we offer attractive trainee programs in a number of engineering and business fields. In 2015, we employed a total of 11 trainees. Vocational training valuable in recruiting We have always given priority to training young people as a means of safeguarding the company’s future 500 and as an element of our social responsibility. Vocational training is an integral part of our strategy to develop our own skilled workers for our German sites. In 2015, 139 (2014: 147) young people (126 men and 13 women) started a vocational training or combined vocational training and study program young people were in at LANXESS in Germany. As of December 31, 2015, LANXESS had a total of 500 young people (82 vocational training at LANXESS women and 418 men) in 19 different career paths, including six combined vocational training and study on the reporting date. programs. In 2015, despite our restructuring program, we hired 80% of those who completed their vo­ cational training with us in Germany. We aim to maintain both the number of training places we offer and the proportion of young people subsequently hired at this high level in the years ahead. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Employees 47 In addition, our one-year orientation program “XOnce” provides young people with guidance on their way to vocational training if they are not ready to take this route at the current time. We also aim to help the steadily rising number of people who have sought refuge in Germany from war and poverty. To this end, we are currently developing a concept for offering refugees guidance in their career choice. We are also examining whether we could offer additional, specifically tailored internships, apprenticeships and jobs in the medium term. An exemplary model  Our company in South Africa provides proof that Germany’s vocational training model – with its balanced mix of theory and practice – can be transferred to other countries. As of the end of 2015, 18 young people were participating in a twoto three-year training program in various manual trades. Of course, we aim to hire as many of them as possible in permanent positions at LANXESS once they have completed their examinations. However, even those who do not work for us afterwards will have good career prospects with the qualification they have acquired – in the mining industry, for example. In this way, we are also fulfilling an important social role at our South African sites. Redefining leadership and performance – optimizing development worldwide Successful change is primarily the result of successful leadership, which in turn is underpinned by clear, globally binding values and standards. For that reason, we have translated our new value model into five management principles that are applicable worldwide. By the end of 2016, we will integrate these principles into all relevant HR processes and tools. Our management principles were also taken into account when developing our Executive Database, a global talent management tool that facilitates the matching of job profiles against the candidate profiles The Executive Database will enable produced in annual HR development conferences. At these conferences, we review the performance, us to optimize selection when filling management positions in the future. potential, individual development needs and future career planning of all our managerial employees around the world. During 2016, we intend to implement the Executive Database worldwide for senior management levels. In connection with the changes we are making, the question of how well a person represents LANXESS’s target performance culture in all its facets is also becoming more important for employees taking on their first managerial role. In India, an analysis of this aspect has been a fixed element of promotion procedures since 2015. We are also pursuing a similar approach in Brazil. It goes without saying that employee training and development remained important elements of our HR development activities in 2015. Alongside formal training sessions and seminars, which amounted to 10,973 hours in France, for example, employees were able once again to take advantage of many informal measures, such as mentoring and peer-to-peer coaching, which foster continuous knowledge sharing across the company. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 48 Corporate Responsibility In Germany, the Summer Academy format has been translated into a new program that is offered through­ out the year. This program, which is available to all specialist and managerial employees at our German sites, provided a total of 19 training sessions enabling staff to improve their hard and soft skills and to participate in an intensive interdisciplinary exchange of ideas. 194 employees from various business units (62% men and 38% women) took advantage of the offering. At the Singapore site, we introduced a Skills Matrix Program aimed specifically at production technicians. The program enabled participants to engage in a learning process which they themselves shaped in order to extend their knowledge of production processes beyond their own area of responsibility. LANXESS Employee Structure by Employment Type, Gender and Region (Also Including Employees on Fixed-Term Contracts) ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� EMEA Germany North America Latin America Asia-Pacific (excluding Germany) Employment type Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Permanent contract, full-time 406 2,477 891 6,118 299 995 259 1,150 550 2,275 Permanent contract, part-time 84 176 366 149 17 1 2 1 7 3 Temporary contract, full-time 37 62 127 552 0 0 22 42 23 53 Temporary contract, part-time 4 1 6 7 2 11 17 3 Total 531 2,716 1,389 6,826 316 998 294 1,210 583 2,331 Experience for international markets Our global alignment is a key strategic advantage. LANXESS currently employs people from 69 (2014: 77) countries across the world. We do not view training, the transfer of know-how and international experi­ ence as a matter of origin or hierarchy. Both new talents and top managers from all regions are given the opportunity to acquire and deploy experience worldwide. International assignments are a key component of our systematic HR development process. We advertise expatriate positions globally on an internal platform. We also feel it is important to give the best-possible consideration to an employee’s family circumstances in the event of international assignment. That is why we support the accompanying partner’s professional development, for example. Short-term assignments, which are necessary for project work, are becoming increasingly important at LANXESS. At the same time, they offer employees with only short-term international mobility the opportunity to gain experience working in other countries. We have therefore enhanced the framework conditions for these short-term assignments. For example, an attractive mix of fringe benefits and special training is now offered for short-term assignments, too. Since 2014, in the course of our realignment, we have tangibly reduced the number of employees on long-term international assignments. At year end 2015, a total of 87 employees (2014: 136 employees) – around 2.7% (2014: 4%) of our specialists and managers – were working as expatriates outside their home countries. The focus was in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Employees 49 In addition to achieving a focused global transfer of knowledge by sending experts and managers abroad, our goal is still to develop local management with the necessary expertise and international competencies in each country and to transfer challenging tasks to suitable employees. At sites outside Germany, 81.1% (2014: 80.9%) of our management functions are currently filled by local employees. Our Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) project is aimed at enhancing diversity at LANXESS and using its positive effects to benefit our company and our employees. The D&I project is focused on the dimensions Our Diversity & Inclusion project of age, gender and nationality. It is helping us to become more innovative and effective and to attract and is focused on the dimensions of age, gender and nationality. retain promising talents – which is essential given that our business is becoming increasingly ­international and demographic change has presented us with major challenges in many of our core countries. The D&I Dashboard facilitates the detailed analysis of data pertaining to the three dimensions in our focus. Each business unit and group function can view its D&I indicators on national, regional and global level, enabling the development of appropriate strategic measures. Since the project was launched, we have implemented a large number of measures and created the ­appropriate structures. In the reporting year, the project – which was established in 2011 as a Group-wide Board of Management initiative under the patronage of Board of Management member and Labor Rela­ tions Director Dr. Rainier van Roessel – was incorporated into the regular HR organization and operations. For example, we successfully extended our global mentoring program in 2015. In China, more than ten managerial employees agreed to be mentors and share their experience and insights with promising young talents. Our HR organization in India created an initiative named EmpowHER to represent the interests of women. In the future, it will develop specific measures for the development of women and serve as a first point of contact for all female employees. Moreover, an experiential learning program is aimed specifically at women, encouraging them to pursue on their own career paths. Two network events across all sites rounded off the varied offering for our female employees in India. Through these measures, our D&I initiative is making an important contribution to reaching the goal we set ourselves in 2012, in connection with the voluntary undertaking by the DAX 30 companies, of raising  By 2020, the proportion the proportion of women in middle and upper management to 20% worldwide by 2020. The figure of women in middle and currently stands at 15.6%. upper management is to be In accordance with the law on the equal representation of women and men in management positions in the private and public sectors, which came into force on May 1, 2015, certain companies in Germany are required to define targets for the proportion of women on the first two management levels below the Board of Management and to specify when these targets are to be met. In the case of first-time targets, the 20  % deadline for implementation may not be later than June 30, 2017. Against the backdrop of LANXESS’s ongoing restructuring program, the Board of Management of LANXESS AG resolved to retain the existing proportion of women as the target for the first and second management levels through June 30, 2017. At the time this resolution was taken, the proportion of women on the first and second management levels below the Board of Management was 9.8% and 20.5%, respectively. The proportion of women at both management levels together should be 18.6% at the closing date. We have already taken and are continu­ ing to pursue measures to increase the number of women in management positions across the company. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 50 Corporate Responsibility Meeting demographic challenges To address the challenges posed by demographic change, LANXESS worked closely with the e ­ mployee representatives in 2009 to develop “XCare,” a comprehensive demographic program based on the collective agreement on lifelong working time and demography in the chemical industry. This program, which applies to our German companies, aims to find answers to the challenges posed by a steady rise in the average age of our workforce, coupled with a shortage of skilled young people. The measures brought together within the “XCare” program encompass five areas of activity: nn People and health nn Work and training nn Time and organization nn Career and family life nn Savings and retirement provision Balancing work and family life remains a main focus of the “XCare” program and is important to an ­increasing number of employees. A total of 7.0% (2014: 6.7%) of our employees in Germany aged ­between 20 and 40 made use of the option to take parental leave. Of this figure, almost 43% (2014: 42%) were fathers. 97% (2014: 82%) of the employees who ended a parental leave period in 2015 returned to a job at LANXESS. Our “Xkids” company daycare center in Leverkusen is now in its third year of operation and all places are full. The facility offers around 50 places for children aged between six months and six years in two preschool groups and one crèche group. In addition, we offer a needs-based number of places at daycare centers in Cologne, emergency places for those instances when regular care arrangements are unavail­ able, and a Germany-wide agency service for childcare providers. Statutory maternity leave is a matter of course in Germany and similar models are in place in other Euro­ pean Union countries. However, it is by no means standard practice around the world. For that reason, we investigate whether country-specific models can be introduced or extended at our sites outside Europe. In Brazil, for example, we have reached agreement with the trade unions to benefit our employees by extending maternity leave from the statutory four months to over six months. Also in Brazil, we pay pre­ school fees for children up to the age of two whose parents return to work for us after their parental leave.

Alongside advice from an external service provider and the arrangement of care placements throughout Germany, we offer our employees paid short-term release from duties. Caregiver leave remains at the heart of the LANXESS caregiving program. This allows employees to reduce their working time to a greater extent than their salary during the care phase and to make up the shortfall when they return to work. To date, 40 employees in Germany have taken advantage of caregiver leave and other job release options. More flexible worktime models are becoming increasingly important at our sites outside Germany as well. For example, we introduced three new worktime models in 2015 for our administrative employees in W  e are promoting flexible China, encompassing flextime, part-time and home office working. In Brazil, meanwhile, we offer our worktime models as part of our demography initiative. administrative employees a model with flexibilized starting times. Health and preventive action Protecting the health and safety of our employees remained a focus of activity in 2015. These issues are a regular aspect of the dialogue between employee and employer representatives in all countries where collective agreements apply. Our occupational health management is based on raising all employees’ awareness of their own health and motivating them to adopt healthy behaviors in their professional and private lives. In many plants and departments, employees have taken part in running groups. We also offer influenza vaccinations to all employees at the different sites. In addition, the members of our top management can undergo an extensive medical check-up. If health problems have already arisen, such as musculoskeletal disorders, we offer services such as access to orthopedic specialists, who treat our employees much more quickly than would be the case in the regular health system. We have successfully deployed reintegration management at all German sites for a number of years. Employees who are suffering illness or have had long periods of absence from work in the past twelve months are provided with extensive advice by our workplace reintegration officers – appointed by the employer – and the reintegration teams made up of employee representatives. Among other things, the teams arrange external contacts and provide individual support for technical or organizational issues at the workplace. In 2015, as in the previous year, more than 40% of the employees invited to participate accepted the offer of an individual consultation with the respective site workplace reintegration team. In Germany, our occupational health management and workplace reintegration programs are based on agreements with employee representatives. The operational teams are managed by steering committees made up equally of employer and employee representatives. We also offer employee health promotion initiatives at our sites outside Germany. For example, all our employees in the United States have access to health check-ups paid for by their health insurance. In ­Canada, our employees receive financial support to pay for membership at a gym or other health-­promoting establishment. Our Employee Assistance Program in South Africa offers support in a range of areas over and above health. Employees with personal, family, financial or health issues can turn in confidence to qualified external advisory services. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 52 Corporate Responsibility In the area of savings and retirement provision, we continued the long-term account for non-managerial 97 employees as regulated by the agreement with the employee representatives and the collective agreement. In 2015, the very good participation rate was further increased to around 97%. The reporting year was % the first in which employees were able to take the time accumulated in their accounts as leave before of our non-managerial employees they retired. have a long-term account that enables them to retire earlier. All benefits with respect to work and family, health and retirement provision apply to the core workforce. Individual benefits may vary regionally and be adjusted locally to our employees’ needs. Our core work­ force comprises all employees with a permanent full-time or part-time position. As of December 31, 2015, they made up 93.3% of our total workforce worldwide. In fiscal 2015, we employed a total of 140 temporary staff (134 men and 6 women) at our German companies – LANXESS GmbH, Saltigo GmbH and IAB Ionenaustauscher GmbH. 88.3% (2014: 88%) of our employees worldwide receive variable compensation. A total of 64.7% (2014: 65%) of our employees worldwide benefit from unfunded company pension plans. Rewarding performance transparently and fairly LANXESS offers its employees worldwide transparent, market-rate compensation, which also includes a bonus system linked to the company’s long-term success. An employee’s individual income is based on his or her responsibilities and performance. As well as collective agreements that are the basis for the compensation of non-managerial staff in Germany and many other countries, legal requirements such as minimum wage levels are also important in ensuring fair compensation. In Germany, for example, we obtain temporary employees only from agencies that are covered by the collective agreement for temporary employment. In addition, the chemical industry pays industry-specific supplements. The fixed salaries of managerial staff – and of some non-managerial staff – are supplemented by a per­ formance-based variable compensation component known as the Annual Performance Payment (APP), which is paid to employees in countries that participate in this program. The Annual Performance Payment is linked to the attainment of the Group’s defined EBITDA target. Additional individual targets are set for top management. In 2015, our employees around the world shared in the company’s success in 2014 with a payout totaling €63 million. During the course of the year, supervisors are also able to reward outstanding employee performance In 2015, we rewarded quickly and unbureaucratically with an Individual Performance Payment (IPP). In fiscal 2015, payments outstanding individual performance of €11.2 million worldwide were made solely for outstanding individual performance. Around 82% of our with payments totaling. employees around the world are currently eligible for IPP, which also provides them with a prompt as­ €11.2 sessment of their performance and career prospects. For some time now, we have also offered a long-term incentive program for managers in Germany and million similar programs in the United States, Canada, India and the Netherlands. The Long-Term Stock Perfor­ mance Plan (LTSP) 2014 – 2017 consists of four tranches, one commencing each year, and compares the performance of LANXESS stock against the MSCI World Chemicals Index over a four-year period. Since participants make a personal investment and there is the chance that the stock will increase in value, this program is an attractive long-term incentive and a means of enhancing employee loyalty. The participation rate for all eligible employees in the current program is 99.8%. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Employees 53 Recognizing, rewarding and using good ideas In 2015, we further optimized the processes and structures of our idea management system. A new works agreement, which became effective on September 1, 2015, is intended to simplify and accelerate the processing and evaluation of ideas. In addition, Saltigo GmbH was integrated into the LANXESS idea management system. In 2015, employees at our German companies submitted a total of 2,027 (2014: 2,807) suggestions, a rate of 274 (2014: 373) per thousand employees. In the same period, 1,077 ideas (2014: 1,312) were implemented, yielding total savings of €2.56 million (2014: €2.52 million). In addition, 789 sugges­ tions (2014: 887) led to improvements in occupational safety and environmental protection. A total of €0.95 million (2014: €1 million) was paid out to employees whose ideas were put into practice. Shaping change processes in partnership A key pillar of our HR policy that we practice worldwide is close cooperation between employee repre­ sentatives and management, including trade unions and employers’ associations, in line with the principle of active codetermination. This means that we also comply with International Labour Organization (ILO) standards and the U.N. Global Compact in respecting our employees’ freedom of association and valid collective agreements. Worldwide, 66.9% (2014: 67%) of our employees are covered by collective agreements; in Germany the figure is just under 90% (2014: 90%). We maintain a dialogue with employee representative bodies in Germany, Europe and around the world to discuss our corporate goals on a regular basis and involve these bodies in organizational changes We attach great priority to fair at an early stage. In the context of the realignment and associated global restructuring program, dealings with employee representatives and trade unions. manage­ment and the employee representatives in various countries collaborated during the reporting period to develop and implement socially acceptable solutions. In August 2015, the annual meeting of the European Forum – the company’s codetermination platform in Europe – was also dominated by the Group’s realignment. In accordance with the German Works Constitution Act, LANXESS is obliged to inform the Works Council fully and in good time of any planned operational changes which could result in material disadvantage to all or substantial parts of the workforce. The Economics Committee is also informed on a regular basis about the company’s economic affairs. We fully comply with our legal obligations with respect to the responsible bodies. Notification periods are defined in the collective agreements in Germany and other countries. In Germany, for instance, it is four weeks. Similar periods in other countries are also always complied with. Outside Europe, too, we give high priority to fair dealings with employee representatives and trade unions. In South Africa, for instance, we comply with International Labour Organization (ILO) standards with respect to our employees’ freedom of association. This includes regular dialogue between local management and trade union representatives as well as binding collective agreements on compensation and working conditions. In the reporting year, local management and trade union representatives at our Sarnia site in Canada worked together to draw up an action plan aimed at improving communication and collaboration between the two parties. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 54 Corporate Responsibility Health, safety, environment and climate protection in the value creation chain LANXESS is responsible for its actions across the entire supply and value creation chain – from the global procurement of raw materials and product development, through production, storage and transport, to use and disposal. The health and safety of our stakeholders – employees, contractors, immediate neigh­ bors of our production sites, customers and end users – is of central importance at each of these stages. Through our safety standards, we aim to ensure the responsible application of chemistry in health and environmental protection, in the handling of chemicals, in plant safety and in workplace safety precautions. Company-wide standards are in place to define the associated requirements and responsibilities. Through the ongoing training of our employees and regular auditing of our health, safety and environmental manage­ ment, we ensure that the requirements are systematically and sustainably implemented in our processes. Uniform standards in production Across the globe, LANXESS operates at 52 production sites in which it holds an interest of more than 50% (as of December 31, 2015). The diversity of the company’s product portfolio necessitates the use of many different chemical and technical processes. Uniform standards for planning, engineering and operating facilities are applied to ensure a high level of process, plant and occupational safety. Handling chemical substances and working with technical equipment fundamentally involve health and safety risks. Wherever in the world we operate, we systematically identify these risks and the hazard potential – both for existing and new facilities – and minimize them by implementing defined preventive and protective measures. To help us achieve this, we have established LANXESS-specific guidelines within the context of our global management system. These govern our procedures for all safety-critical processes in our production facilities and cover aspects such as the formulation and implementation of technical and organizational protective measures and the environmentally friendly handling of raw materials, products and waste. To ensure compliance with LANXESS directives and local regulations for the safe operation of facilities, In 2015, we audited experts on site conduct audits based on targeted spot checks that are carried out with a frequency 45 ­appropriate to the relevant risk profile and results. At each facility across the globe, compliance with the safety standards must be certified regularly, at least at the intervals required by local legislation. A total of 45 production facilities (2014: 38), 19 of them in Germany (2014: 19), were audited in the context of production facilities HSE (health, safety, environment) compliance checks in 2015. in the context of HSE (health, safety, environment) compliance checks. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Health, safety, environment and climate protection in the value creation chain 55 “Xact”: Board of Management’s global safety initiative LANXESS attaches the highest priority to the safety of all its work processes. Our “Xact” global safety GRI G4–26 program, launched in 2011, is aimed at encouraging all employees to work together to improve safety G4–27 throughout the company and at raising their awareness of this issue. Making a company safer is a complex task in which each and every employee has the most crucial role. That is why we developed six “Xact” safety regulations as the central principles of safe working at LANXESS. These address the main areas in which every employee – whether they are employed in production or administration and irrespective of their function or position in the hierarchy – can actively contribute to their own safety and that of their colleagues. Striving for Safety nnI always take time for safety. nn I openly address unsafe situations. nn I always pay attention to my own nn I take action when safety rules safety and that of my coworkers. are breached. nnI decline to do work I cannot nnI do not give instructions for unsafe do safely. actions to be carried out. After familiarizing our employees around the world with the cultural elements of our occupational safety program in 2014, we launched five more HSE standards in 2015. These incorporate new, stricter regu­ lations for technical activities with a higher risk potential, such as entering containers or tight spaces and using forklift trucks. After receiving extensive training from the “Xact” regional managers, our managerial staff communicated these standards throughout the entire organization during the reporting year. At the same time, we also continued to drive forward implementation of the program’s cultural elements. One important format in this regard is the safety dialogue, when positive and critical behaviors are ­discussed and possible improvement measures devised. These discussion sessions regularly take place between supervisors and their staff as well as among groups of colleagues. We are also seeking to achieve an improved mutual understanding of occupational safety with suppliers who provide us with technical services, for example, and are increasingly integrating them into our s­ afety W  e actively integrate suppliers culture. Here, we apply the principle of “select, train, support and evaluate.” For example, our partners into our safety culture, applying the principle of “select, must provide verification of their own safety management system and that their employees who work for train, support and evaluate.” us have received certain safety training. Independent of this, we give employees of our partner companies individual safety briefings as a matter of course. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 56 Corporate Responsibility GRI Another “Xact” tool that is becoming increasingly well established is the Pulse Check survey, which was G4–26 G4–27 again conducted among all LANXESS employees in 2015. This gave them a fresh opportunity to describe their personal experience of key safety aspects at LANXESS. Among other things, the anonymous survey seeks to establish the importance that individuals attach to safe working practices, whether they feel in­ volved in safety activities and whether they receive positive feedback for working safely. More than 10,000 employees – a response rate of 61% – provided feedback on their experiences. The level of participation was therefore almost double that for the first survey in 2014 and the responses to all specific questions were generally more positive than last time. For example, 87% of respondents are now familiar with the six “Xact” safety regulations. Our employees believe there is room for improvement regarding the degree to which supervisors acknowledge their safe working practices. Furthermore, the view that all accidents are avoidable is not shared by as many of our employees as we would like. Recording accidents and incidents Thanks to our electronic Incident Reporting System (IRS), we are able to record accidents and incidents worldwide using standardized procedures. The incidents that are documented include accidents involv­ ing people, transport accidents, near accidents, safety-relevant incidents, environmental incidents and downtime caused by, for example, bad weather or strike action. We communicate significant incidents worldwide via our intranet or by newsletter. Each incident is carefully analyzed to identify measures that can be taken to avoid similar accidents, disruptions or near accidents in the future. LANXESS uses the recordable incident rate (RIR, the number of injuries per 200,000 working hours that are reportable as per OSHA rules) and the lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR, known as MAQ in Germany and describing the number of injuries for every million hours worked) as indicators for evaluating occupational safety. The LTIFR was 2.2 in 2015, slightly lower than the previous year’s level. It was 3.2 in 2013 and 3.4 in 2012. This substantial medium-term reduction shows that the measures implemented over the past three years to improve occupational safety at LANXESS are taking effect. For example, we have seen a significant decrease in the number of work-related injuries at our chrome oxide mine in South Africa. The RIR, which was recently introduced to enhance international comparability, was 0.8 in 2015 and 2014, down from 1.1 in 2013. Carrying forward the positive trend of recent years will require further concerted efforts supported by “Xact.” We should benefit from our employees being much more safety-conscious than they were in the past owing to the raised profile of occupational safety.

This aims to provide basic information and risk assessments for substances so that the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment can be minimized and products can be manufactured and distributed in such a way as to prevent injury to people and damage to the environment. In line with the aforementioned commitment, our product stewardship covers the safe handling of chemical substances and products throughout their life cycle – from procurement and research and development, through production, storage, transportation and downstream processing to marketing and disposal. The Product Safety Management at LANXESS Directive steers the Group-wide observance of prod­ uct stewardship and secures the participation of everyone involved. This applies in particular to those substances in our product portfolio that are classified as hazardous. Our Central Product Surveillance Directive systematically governs worldwide tracking of our products and their use in respect of potential health and environmental impacts. The information acquired is used by our product developers and product safety experts in their evaluations. Management of chemical control regulations The safe handling, marketability and safe transportation of our chemicals and products are conditional on compliance with global chemical control regulations. LANXESS has a global organization supported by an electronic safety data system to ensure compliance with both mandatory and voluntary control requirements. Material safety data sheets in more than 30 Material safety data sheets in more than 30 languages inform our customers worldwide about substance data and the safety measures that are necessary when using the relevant chemicals. We aim to raise marketability and the provision of hazard­ ous goods data to a globally uniform safety and technical standard by successively integrating this safety data system into our SAP system worldwide. In 2015, we integrated our country organization in Spain and the Rhein Chemie organization in the United States into the system. languages We regularly adapt our electronic safety data system to reflect changes to the GHS (Globally Harmonized inform our customers worldwide System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals) in various countries. The GHS is a system under about substance data and the the umbrella of the United Nations that aims to harmonize existing classification and labeling systems safety measures that are necessary when using our products. used in various sectors such as transportation and consumer, employee and environmental protection. We observe regional variations in the implementation of the GHS such as the European Union’s CLP (Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures) regulation. Before manufacturing, importing or selling our products in a given country, we examine their marketability in accordance with the chemicals legislation in force there. We register our substances and products in line with local requirements and participate in the substance analysis programs of the responsible author­ ities by supplying all available information and collecting new data if necessary. Efforts to meet the new requirements in chemicals legislation in Taiwan and South Korea – in terms of registration requirements for both new and previously listed substances – continued in 2015. Our experience in implementing REACH in the European Union helped with this. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 58 Corporate Responsibility We expressly support the protection goals of the E.U. REACH regulation, which aims to ensure a high www.echa.europa.eu level of safety for human health and the environment in the manufacture and use of chemicals. We have so far pre-registered all the substances that are relevant for LANXESS with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki, Finland, by the stipulated deadlines. By the third deadline, on May 31, 2018, all substances we produce in volumes exceeding one ton will have been registered in Europe. Registration involves the systematic evaluation of information concerning our substances and their uses. In doing this, we consider the entire product life cycle. Within the context of a voluntary commitment made by the German Chemical Industry Association (VCI) in 1997 to record and assess substances, we go beyond the legal requirements to determine a basic data set for our intermediates as well, in line with Appendix VII of the REACH regulation. In the case of consumer applications in particular, such as those in the areas of food and drinking water contact, toys, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and medical products, we ensure that our products meet national and international laws and standards, religious dietary laws and quality hallmarks. In this way, we actively support our customers in the certification of their materials for drinking water contact appli­ cations, for example. The exchange of information with our customers is an important aspect of our product stewardship activities. We therefore provide them with extensive information about our products via the IMDS (Inter­ national Material Data System), an automotive industry database for archiving, exchanging and managing information, or via LANXESS’s product-specific database, which has a public area and a restricted area for registered business partners. No Pellets Emission – making sure everything stays where it belongs A good example of how we use the information gained from product monitoring to develop our own measures is the No Pellet Emission project. This focuses on plastic pellets, which may be released into the marine environment due to inattentiveness at various stages of the value chain – during production, distribution, storage and transportation. Plastic pel­ lets themselves do not react chemically but may have an undesired impact on account of their small size and volume. We therefore joined forces with PlasticsEurope Deutschland to launch the No Pellet Loss project as part of the Responsible Care® initiative, with the goal of motivating all stakeholders to handle plastic pellets in a responsible way. As part of the internal LANXESS No Pellet Emission project, our facilities in Germany that handle pellets have systematically analyzed all potential emission sources and put in place measures designed to effectively prevent water pollution caused by pellets. Based on our experience and findings to date, we want to give the No Pellet Emission project global scope in 2016. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Health, safety, environment and climate protection in the value creation chain 59 Procurement in the supply chain Responsible action begins in procurement. At LANXESS, raw and other materials, plant and services must satisfy globally uniform safety and environmental protection requirements. Raw materials in particular are subject to stringent monitoring to ensure safe processing in our production facilities. For example, the procurement of any raw material is dependent on the submission by the supplier of a current material safety data sheet. Our procurement department clarifies which of the REACH requirements must be satisfied in the case of raw materials from non-European suppliers. In order to minimize our procurement risks and enhance supply chain transparency, we and five other international chemicals companies founded the Together for Sustainability initiative in 2012 (see page 119). Global dangerous goods and transport safety management Through our global dangerous goods and transport safety management system, we ensure the avoidance of hazardous situations in the relevant processes. We centrally coordinate, supervise and review the im­ plementation of international, regional and local dangerous goods and transport safety regulations and internal company guidelines. The central classification of our products ensures uniform interpretation of international, regional and local dangerous goods regulations, while at the same time respecting regional and local specifics. Classification determines, among other things, the form of encapsulation (packaging and tanks), marking and labeling, permitted modes of transport and transport routes and the measures that emergency ser­ vices must take in the event of a transport incident. The corresponding classification data are archived in LANXESS’s safety data system for chemicals. In 2015, we expanded the central dangerous goods classification for Mexico and Uruguay and made preparations to incorporate Australia into the system. In the years ahead, we aim to consistently pursue this approach and integrate the remaining countries – Argentina, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea. Storage management We operate our own warehouses, but also commission external warehousing service providers, selecting them on the basis of a specified process that considers relevant aspects such as logistics, safety and security, environmental protection and cost-effectiveness. In line with a chemical industry concept, we apply a globally standardized warehouse concept that takes into account the substances stored and meets fire protection and occupational health and safety requirements. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 60 Corporate Responsibility Ecological responsibility As LANXESS sees it, conserving natural resources – for example, through the most efficient possible use of raw materials and energies – and identifying further potential for reducing emissions and waste are an ongoing mission and an inherent part of our ecological responsibility to which we must apply our expertise. We equip all new production sites in line with state-of-the-art environmental standards, taking into account local requirements. This often sets us apart from local competitors.

In this connection, we have established a global procedure for an energy management system in line with ISO 50001. The centrally managed global implementation project was completed in 2014. Our certification in Germany was reconfirmed in 2015. On account of our realignment activities, we have revised our strategy of global certification of the energy management system in favor of a regional certification strategy. In the future, decisions will be taken locally on the basis of regulatory requirements. For example, LANXESS Liyang in China successfully obtained certification in April 2015. In 2015, we concluded the LANXESS Energy Efficiency Program (LEEP), in which we had combined our measures to increase energy efficiency since 2012, and handed over ongoing projects to the rel­ evant business units for further implementation. A number of cross-business unit projects had already been concluded by this time. The results achieved by LEEP are now being fed into the business units’ potential analyses and optimization projects. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Health, safety, environment and climate protection in the value creation chain 61 Energy consumption As the volumes produced and our product mix play a significant role alongside efficiency, the savings cannot be directly represented in our absolute energy and emissions data. For this reason, global energy consumption appears largely unchanged compared with the previous year.

The CDP is an organization representing international institutional investors which have joined forces in order to improve transparency for the financial market on questions linked to climate change and the requisite corporate guidelines. We achieved a disclosure score of 98 out of a possible 100 points in 2015, having created a very high level of transparency for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by LANXESS and our strategies and activities designed to reduce our environmental impact. In Europe, 17 LANXESS facilities and/or sites are subject to the European Emissions Trading System. Trading in CO2 emission rights – or allowances – is a cost-effective way of reducing harmful CO2 emis­ sions. Since all our facilities that are eligible for emissions trading are at the cutting edge of technology and compete on the international market, we expect to receive an adequate number of free allowances up to the end of the third trading period in 2020 to cover our anticipated CO2 emissions.

We also take into account the CO2 emissions resulting from our transports. Today, we already use ships as the means of transport with the lowest emissions for around 90% of all ton-kilometers (tonnage transported multiplied by the distance transported in kilometers). In Germany, we continue to use the TÜV SÜD-approved Eco Plus solution offered by logistics provider DB Schenker Rail for transporting our products by rail. The electricity required for transport is obtained from renewable energy sources. This enables us to reduce the CO2 emissions from our German rail transport operations by almost 75% compared with the standard solution. In 2015, we further extended our tried-and-tested railshuttle concept for our Uerdingen site. Every day, up to 20 export containers now leave the site by rail, bound for seaports. We also use this concept to bring in raw materials that are landed at the same ports. Packaging is an often critical aspect in sustainable logistics processes. However, it is of lower significance to a chemical company like LANXESS because at least 60% of our products are transported in reusable containers. Other atmospheric emissions In the year under review, our emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) decreased further – both in absolute terms and in relation to the volumes sold. This was due to, among other things, various measures we had taken to achieve our environmental protection target of cutting VOC emissions by 30% through the end of 2015 (base year: 2010). VOC Emissions tons VOC, kilograms per ton of product 14,000 1.4 1.22 1.15 12,000 1.2 1.04 10,000 0.90 1.0 0.83 7,800 7,600 8,000 0.8 6,600 5,700 5,400 6,000 0.6 4,000 0.4 2,000 0.2 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Absolute In relation to volumes sold Responsible use of water resources All wastewater and surface water discharges at our sites are subject to legal and permitting requirements. We use both technical (wastewater treatment) and organizational (monitoring) measures to comply with these requirements. Before the authorities issue an operating permit, an assessment is carried out on the possible economic, social and environmental impacts of water extraction on the surrounding area. At all LANXESS sites, this takes place under approved conditions. The issue of water extraction is also addressed by our envi­ ronmental protection compliance program. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 64 Corporate Responsibility In the year under review, we again achieved a slight reduction in our total water consumption in relation to volumes sold.

Some forms of waste can be used as secondary raw materials and are thus a valuable resource. Sustainable waste management therefore involves systematically avoiding waste and, if this is not possible, using waste as a raw material or energy source. In order to minimize the amount of waste requiring disposal, we seek to continuously improve our production processes. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Health, safety, environment and climate protection in the value creation chain 65 The total amount of waste generated in relation to volumes sold dropped slightly compared with the previous year. The amount of waste classified as hazardous also declined at the same time. All forms of waste are disposed of or reused in compliance with statutory requirements.

This system enables us to define a broad range of HSE performance data for each business unit and site worldwide. These provide a valid database for internal and external reporting and map the progress we are making toward achieving our globally applicable HSEQ targets (see table on page 72). Data for all indicators except the LTIFR are gathered only at those production sites in which the company has a holding of more than 50%. We are working systematically to improve our data recording processes and data quality. PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft assessed our HSE indicators for 2013 to 2015 (see below) and the necessary data recording processes in the course of a business audit with a view to achieving a “limited assurance” rating.

All Scope 1 greenhouse gases are calculated as CO 2e. In accordance with the GHG Protocol, the CO 2 emissions from the combustion of biomass are shown separately and are not included in the Scope 1 emissions.

We also formulated the target of reducing our VOC emissions by 30% through the end of 2015. Due to various influencing factors, we achieved both our CO2e and VOC targets (unadjusted) by the end of 2015, but did not achieve our energy target. First, we did not achieve our planned business growth targets, which had been used as the basis for setting both the aforementioned targets and the budget for the corresponding investment in efficiency measures. Second, portfolio adjustments in the form of acquisitions and new facilities also had a substantial effect and, in some cases, hindered progress in achieving the targets. As the volumes produced and the respective product mixes are significant factors alongside efficiency, the savings effects cannot be directly depicted in absolute energy and emissions data. Specific energy consumption Comparing the specific energy consumption in the individual segments in 2015 with the figures from the base year 2010 shows that only the Advanced Intermediates segment has improved, while the other two segments have not. On the one hand, this outcome can be attributed to LANXESS’s business de­ velopment, which resulted in production and sales volumes that were below original assumptions. On the other hand, measures associated with the “Let’s LANXESS again” program and changes to the way energy is recorded are also involved. For example, one consequence of the realignment program was that the energy efficiency measures identified by LEEP could only be implemented to a limited extent, if at all. Furthermore, due to the continuous expansion of our energy recording systems, far more energy sources are now included in our reporting than was the case in the base year 2010. Specific CO2 emissions In terms of specific CO2 emissions, all segments achieved their reduction targets. With a reduction of around 30%, the Performance Chemicals segment substantially exceeded its target. The situation was also very encouraging in the two other segments – Performance Polymers and Advanced Intermediates – where we succeeded in cutting specific CO2 emissions by approximately 13%. One key reason for this achievement is the partial switchover to climate-neutral biomass for in-house power generation. We were able to reduce our specific CO2 emissions across all segments by more than 15%. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 70 Corporate Responsibility Absolute VOC emissions The situation regarding VOC emissions is also encouraging. Focused measures enabled us to exceed our reduction target of 30% (in absolute terms). For example, at our sites in Belgium, Brazil and Canada alone, which are responsible for a significant share of our total volatile organic compound emissions, we reduced emissions by some 3,000 tons. Analysis of adjusted values In terms of specific energy consumption, the picture is slightly different if we factor in the effects of portfolio adjustments and larger volumes of energy data being collected. Here, too, the Advanced Intermediates segment achieved its energy efficiency target and the Performance Polymers segment succeeded in slightly reducing its specific energy consumption. The Performance Chemicals segment cannot point to any improvement in energy efficiency for the period from 2010 through 2015. However, the LANXESS Group as a whole achieved a 5% reduction in specific energy consumption. In terms of CO2 emissions per ton of product sold, the Advanced Intermediates and Performance Chem­ icals segments achieved their targets with reductions of 13.9% and 33.4%, respectively. Although the reduction of 2.9% in the Performance Polymers segment is below the target value, it still contributed toward the overall result. We succeeded in lowering our specific CO2 emissions across all segments by 12.3%. In terms of volatile organic compounds, we not only achieved but substantially exceeded our adjusted target. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the measures implemented in the facilities that already belonged to LANXESS in the base year 2010.

That is why, at the start of 2016, we set new long-term targets for CO2 and VOC emissions and for reducing energy consumption. By 2025, we aim to cut our specific CO2 and VOC emissions by 25% (base date: December 31, 2015). We also aim to reduce specific energy consumption by 25% through 2025. In the future, assessment will no longer be based on the performance of the reporting segments, but rather on that of LANXESS as a whole. This approach takes account of the company’s changing structures.

We believe it is only right that, in line with the concept of corporate citizenship, we assume responsibility and thus contribute to the evolution of society. We focus on four areas of activity: education, climate protection, water and culture. In 2015, we again initiated or supported a number of projects worldwide in these areas of activity. The regional focus of our activities in the reporting year was Europe, where more than half of all projects were implemented. Overall, more than 335,000 (2014: more than 218,000) mainly young people benefited from our projects, which we funded with some €2 million in 2015 (2014: some €0.9 million).

Within the context of the LANXESS education initiative, we have established projects at many of our sites to pursue these objectives in varying ways. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Society 75 We underscore our clear commitment to Germany as a business location and a base for the chemical industry not just through financial assistance for schools close to our sites but also through collaboration in the provision of scientific teaching materials. For instance, we have worked with an experienced partner specializing in education media to develop teaching materials on the subjects of mobility, globalization, urbanization and water for use in elementary schools. We distributed the materials to a total of 269 ele­ mentary schools throughout Germany. The “TuWaS!” (Do Something!) project initiated by the Cologne Chamber of Commerce and Industry and supported by LANXESS also targets elementary school students with the aim of getting children interested in scientific and technical questions through play. We have pro­ vided a total of €90,000 in funding for middle and high schools close to our sites at Krefeld, Leverkusen, Dormagen, Brunsbüttel and Cologne. This has enabled these schools to implement projects in MINT subjects (mathematics, information technology, natural sciences and technology), for example on acids, photometry, computer-assisted measurement recording and the generation and storage of electricity. In Brazil, we promote scientific knowledge and environmental awareness at our various sites through the “Green Cycle” competition, which gives participants the opportunity to develop their own environmental protection projects. LANXESS provides full funding for implementing the winning projects. Participants receive assistance from an agency that specializes in environmental projects. Since the competition ­began in 2010, we have successfully initiated 38 projects that have benefited more than 8,000 people. In addition, our employees in Brazil participate in Community Day once a year and spend the day providing practical assistance to facilities such as kindergartens, hospitals, schools and social centers. The “Educar para Crecer” (Educate to Grow) initiative in Argentina aims to promote development in the Zárate region by supporting schools and not-for-profit organizations engaged in educational, social and environmental protection activities there. As part of this initiative, we provide funding for sustainable education projects and help those wishing to launch such projects by delivering the fundamental k­ now-how they need. Since the initiative began in 2007, more than 40 projects have been implemented, directly or indirectly benefiting about 10,000 people. The “La Basura Sirve” (Waste is Useful) initiative launched in Zárate in 2012 also promotes responsible environmental practices. The program, which we conduct in collaboration with a group of schools, encourages the collection and sorting of inorganic household waste. The income from the sale of reusable materials to recycling companies is used by the participating schools to finance purchases. In China, we collaborate with the Goethe Institute to offer the LANXESS-PASCH Dream Career Program. Each year, two students from the Goethe Institute’s partner schools complete a four-week internship with LANXESS. In Liyang, we provide support to particularly gifted or very committed school students. Each year, students from the three renowned universities we partner in Qingdao, Shaanxi and Changzhou can apply to LANXESS for a scholarship and internship. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 76 Corporate Responsibility In Japan, we have been working for a number of years with the aid organization Save the Children Japan. In August 2015, under the motto “Exciting Experiments,” our Japanese company arranged workshops at three schools in Miyagi Prefecture. In one of these workshops, participants made batteries from vegetables. Each year, we support “Fun Chemistry World” in South Korea, an initiative organized by the South Korean Responsible Care Council in four different cities. Through a variety of experiments, LANXESS employees provide insights into the exciting world of chemistry for the more than 1,000 school students who regularly participate. Since 2011, we have been the main sponsor of the “Rally to Read” initiative in South Africa, which aims to reduce the significant difference in reading and writing skills between students in rural areas and their counterparts in urban centers. Each year, we provide schools in remote areas with items such as teacher training guides, container libraries, writing materials, sports equipment, educational toys and school shoes. In 2015, twelve schools in the vicinity of our Rustenburg site benefited from these measures. Our partnership with the Junior Achievement organization in the United States also fully reflects our commitment to corporate volunteering. LANXESS employees regularly visit schools in the Pittsburgh area to teach firstto fifth-grade classes basic aspects of economics, entrepreneurship and corporate responsibility. Another project which LANXESS has been supporting for some time is the Neighborhood Academy, which supports and mentors disadvantaged young people from Pittsburgh in preparing for their high school diploma examinations. Since its launch, the LANXESS education initiative has reached tens of thousands of children, adolescents The LANXESS education initiative and young adults worldwide. Feedback from teachers, principals and school authorities shows that the has already reached tens of initiative has significantly enhanced the importance of the MINT subjects in school timetables. thousands of children, adolescents and young adults worldwide. Committed to protecting the climate and water resources A further focus of our corporate responsibility is enhancing awareness worldwide of the causes and consequences of climate change and water scarcity – for both drinking and industrial uses. In Brazil, we collaborated in 2015 with Valdemir Cunha, one of the country’s best-known landscape and nature photographers, to organize photography workshops for school students at five sites. Previously, Cunha had documented Brazilians’ day-to-day relationship with water in a book entitled Água (Water) that was sponsored by LANXESS. In China, to mark the publication of the Chinese government’s Water Action Plan, we initiated a new research competition in the reporting year. Students from five universities were asked to develop approaches for protecting water as a vital resource. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Society 77 Promoting art and culture We are convinced that successful scientific work and, ultimately, social progress can only flourish in a culture of thought, research and critical evaluation. As part of our cultural commitment, we therefore sponsor both literary and musical talents. We have been the main partner to lit.COLOGNE, Europe’s biggest literature festival in Cologne, since 2010. Since 2013, we have also been partnering its sister event phil.COLOGNE, a top-class international philosophy festival. The second mainstay of our cultural commitment is support for musical training, especially for young people. The Young Euro Classic initiative brings together talents from Germany and LANXESS’s main markets around the world. LANXESS SNYO Classic sponsors an exchange and mentoring program for the Singapore National Youth Orchestra. In Japan, we support the Ozawa International Chamber Music Academy (OICMA), which enables talented young musicians from across Asia to receive a top-quality musical education. Furthermore, we are a partner to the “Kölner Philharmonie,” one of Europe’s premier cultural institutions. In addition to the “Acht Brücken” (Eight Bridges) contemporary music festival, we support initiatives such as a discounted concert subscription for university students. Alleviating distress, creating opportunities In 2015, more than one million refugees came to Germany to escape war and poverty in their countries of origin. We, like others, wish to make a helpful contribution to alleviating the immediate distress of these people and to providing them with opportunities for the future. We have therefore provided €400,000 to support selected refugee aid projects in Cologne, Leverkusen, Dormagen, Krefeld and Brunsbüttel. These funds will be used mainly to finance language teaching for children at schools as part of their preparatory classes and for adults at further education centers. We consider language skills to be the key to successful integration. In addition, we are expressly fostering our employees’ individual involvement. They can take paid leave for up to eight days to help established aid organizations in their work. And we are granting two days’ leave for local or self-initiated aid projects. We also aim to provide career opportunities for people seeking refuge and – in light of demographic change – acquire well-trained employees for LANXESS at the same time. Therefore, as a first step, we have created twelve additional places on the one-year preparatory course prior to vocational training. In addition, we are organizing trial weeks to help with career choices. In the medium to long term, we intend to offer additional internships, vocational training places and jobs, some of which will be specifically tailored to refugees’ particular needs. We are working closely with the responsible public agencies and, when the time comes, will offer assistance in assessing refugees’ skills. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 LANXESS on the Capital Market BBB – Standard & Poor’s Baa3 Moody’s 32.2% equity ratio STABILITY We pursue a conservative financing policy that is guided by clear criteria and focused on maintaining our investment-grade rating and achieving a strong free cash flow. Our good access to the capital markets ensures a balanced financing structure and a very solid liquidity position, regardless of cyclical fluctuations. 80 LANXESS on the Capital Market LANXESS on the Capital Market In a year in which the stock market was again characterized by a high level of volatility, LANXESS stock outperformed the DAX and its two industry benchmark indices. Year on year, the share price rose by around 11%. After switching index at the end of September, our stock is again listed in the MDAX. In 2015, the German stock market performed positively overall, but was subject to sharp price fluctuations over the course of the year. The German lead index, the DAX, made a very strong start to the trading year. This was stimulated by the European Central Bank (ECB) asset purchase program announced in January as well as by improved economic data from the eurozone and the continuation of expansionary monetary policy in key economies such as the United States and China. A rally lasting more than three months pushed the index to record levels. On April 10, for example, the DAX closed at a new all-time high of 12,375 points. However, shortly thereafter negative factors gained the upper hand for several months. In particular, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Greece, weaker macroeconomic data from China, a sharp correction on Chinese equity markets and growing discussion of an interest rate rise in the United States sent the DAX back below the 9,500 point mark by the end of September. There was no clear turnaround in this trend until October, when the ECB announced that it might further ease its expansionary monetary policy at the end of the year. However, market participants’ hopes of increased bond purchases were dashed in December. Moreover, the impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s long-anticipated interest rate increase was felt. On December 30, the DAX closed at 10,743 points – 9.6% higher than the 2014 closing price. Viewed over the full year, the MDAX was much more stable, rising by 22.7% to 20,775 points. By contrast, the LANXESS benchmark indices – the Dow Jones STOXX 600 Chemicals SM and the MSCI World Chemicals Index – were much weaker in 2015. The Dow Jones STOXX 600 Chemicals SM rose by only 5.6% to close the year on 829 points. The more comprehensive and international MSCI World Chemicals Index declined 2.8% year on year, closing 2015 at 250 points. After being heavily impacted in 2014 by company-specific news, LANXESS stock moved largely parallel Of all the benchmarks, with the market as a whole during the reporting year. Positive news, such as the successful implementa­ only the MDAX posted tion of our realignment program and a significantly improved operating performance, contrasted with the a stronger performance switch from DAX to MDAX as a result of insufficient market capitalization. LANXESS has again been in the reporting year. listed in the MDAX since September 21, 2015. Our stock reached its high for the year of €55.59 on June 26 but remained below the €50 mark in the second half of the year. The closing price on Decem­ ber 30 was €42.68. Thus, in 2015, LANXESS stock gained 11.0% in value, significantly outperforming its two industry benchmark indices and also faring better than the DAX. Of all the benchmarks, only the MDAX posted a stronger performance in the reporting year.

LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Sustainability 83 Stockholder structure Stockholder structure The majority of LANXESS’s stockholders are institutional investors whose strategy is oriented toward growth or value. At January 31, 2016, these investors held around 89% of the stock. The remaining share of around 11% of LANXESS stock is owned by private investors, including our employees, who hold around 1%. Since LANXESS was first listed on the stock exchange, most of our private investors have been located in Germany. In 2015, as in the past, many of our institutional investors were based in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. The proportion of our stockholders in the United States increased further and at January 31, 2016, was around 35% (2014: 31%). At the same date, some 17% (2014: 18%) of LANXESS stock was held in the United Kingdom. Institutional investors from Germany represented about 15% (2014: 14%) of our stock. Taking private and institutional investors together, ownership of our shares in Germany increased slightly to around 26% (2014: 25%). In other regions, LANXESS is represented in France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, in particular. The proportion of institutional investors from the rest of Europe declined year on year to 12% (2014: 18%). For other regions, on the other hand, the figure increased to around 10% (2014: 8%), due especially to growing ownership of our stock by Asian investors.

Key themes were implementation of the realignment and – following announcement of our strategic alliance with Saudi Aramco in the rubber business – the future direction of LANXESS. Alongside our dialogue with the sell side, we maintained our close interaction with fixed-income analysts during the reporting year. As of January 31, 2016, 36% of analysts (2014: 37%) recommended buying LANXESS stock. A further 48% (2014: 42%) said to hold our stock, while 16% (2014: 21%) gave a sell recommendation.

Ratings LANXESS’s creditworthiness is regularly evaluated by the rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service. It is our strategic corporate goal to retain an investment-grade rating in the BBB range. In September 2015, Standard & Poor’s confirmed LANXESS’s investment-grade rating at BBB– and raised its outlook from stable to positive. The reason given by the rating agency for this improvement was the company’s financial profile, which it considered to have been tangibly improved by the pending cash inflow from the Saudi Aramco transaction. Our consistently conservative financing policy and ­improved operating performance in the course of the fiscal year additionally supported this assessment. In July 2015, Moody’s confirmed LANXESS’s investment-grade rating of Baa3 with stable outlook. It also took a positive view of our strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco in September 2015. Rating agency Fitch, which latterly gave LANXESS a BBB– rating with stable outlook, discontinued its un­ solicited rating in March 2015. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 86 LANXESS on the Capital Market Investor relations activities Maintaining an active, broad and uninterrupted dialogue with investors and analysts is a top priority for LANXESS. Our objective is to provide a continuous and sustained flow of information about our company. Our activities remain focused on addressing equity-side investors. However, we also maintain a close dialogue with fixed income investors and with institutional investors focused on sustainability. We consider roadshows and conferences to be highly relevant because they give LANXESS man­ The Chief Financial Officer and agement and Investor Relations the opportunity to engage in a broad and personal dialogue with institu­ the Investor Relations team tional investors. Key roadshow locations are international capital market centers such as Boston, New represented LANXESS at roadshows York, London, Paris, Frankfurt and Zurich. Elsewhere in Europe, the Benelux and Scandinavian countries, and capital market conferences on Italy and Spain have also become destinations for regular roadshows. Other regions where there is­ 76 interest in our shares are Asia (Singapore and Japan) and North America. As far as conferences are concerned, we focus on international cross-industry events organized by well-known banks. We also participate at conferences specifically for mid caps or the chemical industry. In addition, we attend forums days. for private investors in order to present our company’s business performance. In fiscal 2015, the Chairman of the Board of Management, the Chief Financial Officer and the Investor Relations team represented LANXESS at roadshows and capital market conferences on a total of 76 days (2014: 72). However, we also use our own events to explain and discuss central issues for our company. For example, our LANXESS Capital Markets Day on November 6, 2015, centered on our new strategic focus following successful implementation of our realignment. All presentations from the Capital Markets Day can be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. Conference calls are a further important means of providing capital market participants with timely and extensive information updates. In these calls, the Board of Management comments on our published results and reports on current measures being taken by LANXESS. Conference calls are streamed live in the Investor Relations section of the LANXESS website, and recorded versions are available for download for one year. Of course, here you will also find all key presentations, our financial publications and information about our stock and bonds. The high quality of our investor relations work again received external acknowledgment in 2015. For ­example, the sell-side analysts surveyed each year by U.S. magazine Institutional Investor ranked LANXESS first among European chemical companies in the Best Investor Relations and Best IR Profes­ sional ­categories. LANXESS was also included in the Most Honored Companies list from among almost 1,300 companies named by survey participants.

They place high value on the standards of good corporate governance with a view to strengthening the trust of investors, customers, employees and the public in LANXESS. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board herein report on corporate governance at LANXESS pursuant to Section 3.10 of the German Corporate Governance Code. The Board of Management also issues its corporate governance statement pursuant to Section 289a of the German Commercial Code. Implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code As LANXESS is a stock corporation listed on the German stock exchange, corporate governance at the company is aligned with Germany’s securities and capital market legislation, regulations pertaining to codetermination and the German Corporate Governance Code. The latter makes recommendations and suggestions concerning corporate governance. There is no obligation to comply with this code. However, pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of LANXESS are required to issue an annual declaration of compliance in line with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, providing information about and stating the reasons for any deviations from these recommendations. Shareholders can view the declaration of compliance on the company’s website at any time. There they will also find the now invalid declarations made in the previous five years. On December 9, 2015, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board issued the following joint declaration pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act: “I. Recommendations Since the issuance of the last declaration of compliance on 10 December 2014, LANXESS AG has com­ plied with the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code (“Government Commission”) as amended on 24 June 2014, which was published on 30 September 2014 by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official portion of the Federal Gazette with the exceptions described in the declaration of 10 December 2014 in Sections 4.2.3, Paragraph 2, Sentence 6, 4.2.3, Paragraph 2, Sentence 8, 5.1.2 Paragraph 2 Sentence 3, 5.4.1 Paragraph 2 Sentence 1 as well as the meanwhile inapplicable exception in Section 4.2.3 Paragraph 4, Sentence 1. LANXESS AG has and will henceforth comply with the recommendations of the Government Commission as amended on 5 May 2015, which was published on 12 June 2015, with the following exceptions: LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code 91 Section 4.2.3, Paragraph 2, Sentence 6 The amount of compensation shall be capped, both overall and for variable compensation components. The current employment contracts for Board of Management members are besides the fixed compen­ sation capped regarding the variable compensation components and the fringe benefits. They do not provide in addition a separate overall cap of the compensation also including a possible discretionary bonus. However, the Supervisory Board will rightfully exercise its discretion regarding a discretionary bonus as shown in the past. Section 4.2.3, Paragraph 2, Sentence 8 Changing such performance targets or the comparison parameters retroactively shall be excluded. When the Supervisory Board resolved in December 2014 the conditions of the variable salary component Annual Performance Payment (APP) for the members of the Board of Management for fiscal year 2015 it reserved the right to retroactively adapt the comparison parameters of the APP. In order to synchronize the conditions with those applicable to the other management, the Supervisory Board exercised its right of modification and agreed to adapt the relation of target achievement and potential payout of the APP for the Board of Management in fiscal year 2015. Section 5.1.2, Paragraph 2, Sentence 3 An age limit for the members of the Board of Management shall be specified. The Supervisory Board does not consider an age limit to the members of the Board of Management as appropriate. The ability to successfully manage a company does not necessarily cease when a specific age is reached. It rather may be in the interest of the company to appoint a member of the Board of Management beyond a defined age limit. Section 5.4.1, Paragraph 2, Sentence 1 The Supervisory Board shall specify concrete objectives regarding its composition which, whilst considering the specifics of the company, take into account the international activities of the company, potential conflicts of interest, the number of independent Supervisory Board members within the meaning of section 5.4.2, an age limit to be specified for the members of the Supervisory Board and a regular limit of length of membership to be specified for the members of the Supervisory Board as well as diversity. The Supervisory Board does not adhere to the rigid age limit for the Supervisory Board members. The age of Supervisory Board members is not a criterion for their qualification and competence. The company does not want to waive longtime experiences. Moreover, the company would restrict itself regarding the appointment of adequate members to the Supervisory Board. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 92 Corporate Governance Report II. Suggestions In addition to its recommendations, the Corporate Governance Code also contains a number of sugges­ tions for efficient, responsible corporate governance compliance which is not required to be disclosed under the statutory provisions. LANXESS currently complies with these suggestions as well, with only a few exceptions. In accordance with Section 3.10 Sentence 2 of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board therefore voluntarily issue the following declaration: Since the issuance of the last declaration of compliance on 10 December 2014, LANXESS AG has com­ plied with the suggestions of the Government Commission as amended on 24 June 2014, which was published on 30 September 2014 by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the official portion of the Federal Gazette, with the following exceptions and will continue to comply the suggestions of the Government Commission as amended on 5 May 2015, which was published on 12 June 2015, with the following exceptions: Section 2.3.2, Sentence 2, 2nd Half-Sentence The Management Board shall arrange for the appointment of a representative to exercise shareholders’ voting rights in accordance with instructions; this representative should also be reachable during the General Meeting. The representatives appointed by LANXESS AG to exercise stockholders’ voting rights in accordance with instructions can be reached at the Stockholders’ Meeting until the voting is held. Stockholders not attending the meeting can reach the representatives up to the previous evening. Section 2.3.3 The company should make it possible for stockholders to follow the General Meeting using modern communication media (e. g. Internet). The speech by the Chairman of the Board of Management to the Stockholders’ Meeting is broadcast on the Internet. Continued broadcasting of the proceedings thereafter, particularly of contributions made by stockholders, could be seen as a violation of the stockholders’ rights to privacy. For this reason, LANXESS does not plan to broadcast the further proceedings.” LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code 93 Other key principles of the management practices applied by LANXESS Other key principles of the management practices applied by LANXESS Prominent among the other relevant management practices applied throughout the company are the principles of business conduct. LANXESS views compliance with laws and ethical principles as the basis of sustainable corporate governance. Our employees’ integrity and awareness of their responsibilities are key factors in the success of our company. Compliance with laws, social responsibility, sustainable environmental protection, and occupational, plant and product safety are an essential part of our corpo­ rate culture. The “Code for integrity and compliance at LANXESS,” which is applicable throughout the Group, specifies minimum standards and gives our employees advice and guidance on complying with these standards. This code can be viewed on our website at http://www.lanxess.com under Corporate Responsibility/Corporate Governance/Compliance. An effective compliance management system, which is regularly examined, has been established to imple­ ment the compliance code. This system was globally audited in 2012 by Deloitte & Touche GmbH, which applied the AuS 980 standard promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW – Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). The system was rated favorably, and there were no objections. Components of this system include a compliance organization that is integrated into the overall LANXESS Group organization, risk identification and assessment, a compliance program (comprising directives, hotlines, training, know­ ledge sharing, compliance reporting and guidance on responding to observed breaches of compliance), and measures for monitoring the overall compliance situation within the LANXESS Group. The objective is to prevent breaches of compliance and to create and foster a culture of compliance. LANXESS does not tolerate breaches of compliance and enforces observance of the provisions of its compliance code. As an international specialty chemicals enterprise, LANXESS bears a large degree of responsibility toward people and the environment. Our entrepreneurial activities reflect this sense of responsibility. Safety, en­ vironmental protection, social responsibility, quality and economic efficiency are all key corporate goals at LANXESS. The company’s objective is sustainable, forward-looking development which meets the demands of economics, ecology and society in equal measure. The greatest benefits of our corporate responsibility activities are achieved if they are balanced with entrepreneurial and, especially, economic objectives. They must therefore be linked to our core business or to our available expertise. An overview of the implementation of corporate responsibility at LANXESS can be downloaded from the Corporate Responsibility section of our website at http://www.lanxess.com/. Additionally, LANXESS joined the United Nations Global Compact initiative in July 2011 and has supported the Responsible Care® Global Charter adopted by the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) since 2006, a commitment the company reconfirmed by signature in August 2014. LANXESS has supplemented German legislation prohibiting insider trading with a Group-wide insider directive. This defines rules of conduct for trading in the company’s securities so that insider trading vio­ lations can be avoided. The names of persons with authorized access to insider information required for the performance of their professional duties are included in an insider register that is regularly updated. The directive also stipulates the reporting and disclosure obligations for transactions with LANXESS shares (directors’ dealings). Corporate policies on other important issues, such as occupational safety and diversity, are implemented throughout the Group on the basis of Board of Management initiatives. With its Diversity & Inclusion initiative, LANXESS aims to promote equal opportunity for employees and facilitate work/life balance. Additional information is available on our website at http://www.lanxess.com/ under About LANXESS/ Who we are/Diversity & Inclusion. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 94 Corporate Governance Report Composition and work of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board and its committees LANXESS AG is a company established under the laws of Germany. One of the fundamental principles of German stock corporation law is the two-tier management system with the governing bodies of manage­ment board and supervisory board. This system is characterized by a clear separation between the management board as the body that manages a company and the supervisory board as the body that advises and oversees management. Concurrent membership on both boards is strictly prohibited. The management board and the supervisory board work closely together in a relationship of mutual trust for the benefit of the company. Board of Management The Board of Management of LANXESS AG currently comprises four members: Matthias Zachert ­(Chairman), Dr. Hubert Fink, Michael Pontzen and Dr. Rainier van Roessel. Information about the ­members of the Board of Management is available on our website at http://www.lanxess.com/ under Investor Relations/Corporate Governance/Board of Management. The Board of Management is appointed to manage and represent the company. It is responsible for ­conducting business in the company’s interests with the goal of creating sustainable value. The ­principal tasks of the Board of Management include defining the company’s goals and strategic alignment, managing and overseeing the operating units, setting human resources policy, arranging the company’s financing, and establishing an effective risk management system. It is also responsible for preparing the quarterly and half-year financial statements, the financial statements of LANXESS AG, the consolidated financial state­ ments of the LANXESS Group and the management report for LANXESS AG and the LANXESS Group. The Chairman coordinates the work of the Board of Management. As a rule, Board of Management decisions are adopted with a simple majority. In the event of a tie, the Chairman has the casting vote. Resolutions of the Board of Management are generally passed at regularly held meetings. The rules of procedure for the Board of Management that are enacted by the Supervisory Board contain further regulations concerning the form of cooperation within the Board of Management, the allocation of duties and the matters requiring resolution by the full Board of Management. In deciding the composition of the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board gives consideration to professional suitability, leadership qualities and diversity. By way of implementing the law on the equal representation of women and men in management positions in the private and public sectors, which came into force on May 1, 2015, the Supervisory Board resolved to maintain the status quo with a target for the proportion of women on the Board of Management of LANXESS AG of 0% through June 30, 2017, in light of the fact that the appointments and service ­contracts of the members of the Board of Management serving at the time the resolution was taken are valid beyond June 30, 2017. In the future, however, the Supervisory Board will seek to appoint women with the appropriate professional qualifications and personal skills as members of the Board of Management. Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board of LANXESS AG is composed of twelve members, with equal numbers of stock­ holder representatives and employee representatives, in accordance with the provisions of the German Codetermination Act of 1976. The stockholder representatives are elected by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, whereas the employee representatives are elected in accordance with the provisions of the Codetermination Act and its electoral regulations. Supervisory Board members normally serve for a five-year term. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Composition and work of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board and its committees 95 Gisela Seidel, Manuela Strauch, Werner Czaplik, Dr. Hans-Dieter Gerriets, Thomas Meiers and Ralf Sikorski serve as the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board. Claudia Nemat, Dr. Friedrich Janssen, Lawrence A. Rosen, Dr. Rolf Stomberg, Theo H. Walthie and Dr. Matthias L. Wolfgruber serve as the stockholder representatives. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is Dr. Rolf Stomberg. The Vice Chairwoman is Gisela Seidel. Information about the members of the Supervisory Board is available on our website at http://www.lanxess.com/ under Investor Relations/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board’s role is to advise the Board of Management in its management of the company and to monitor its conduct of the business. The Supervisory Board discusses business performance, planning and strategy at regular intervals. Its responsibilities also include appointing the members of the Board of Management as well as reviewing the financial statements of LANXESS AG and the consoli­ dated financial statements of the LANXESS Group. The Supervisory Board reaches its decisions with a majority of the votes cast unless a different majority is stipulated by law. In the event of a tie, the Chair­ man of the Supervisory Board has two votes in a second ballot on the resolution, even if this also results in a tie. The German Codetermination Act contains special requirements concerning resolutions. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work in the Supervisory Board, chairs its meetings and represents the concerns of the body externally. Supervisory Board resolutions are usually adopted at regularly held meetings. The Supervisory Board has issued its own rules of procedure, which, in addition to defining the tasks and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board and the personal qualifications of its members, establishes the processes for convening, preparing and chairing meetings as well as the procedures for voting. The Board of Management reports to the Supervisory Board on a timely and comprehensive basis about the progress of business and the situation of the Group, including potential risks and relevant issues relating to corporate planning. The Supervisory Board has laid down the Board of Management’s notification and reporting requirements in detail in its rules of procedure. The Chairman of the Board of Management regularly exchanges information with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board in order to discuss matters of strategy, planning, business performance, risks, risk management and compliance. Certain transactions and measures of major or long-term importance require the Supervisory Board’s approval. Measures requiring approval include, but are not limited to: adoption of the corporate planning; the acquisition, sale or encumbrance of real property, shareholdings or other assets; borrowings and certain other types of financial transactions. Thresholds have been set for some of these transactions. Goals for the composition of the Supervisory Board Section 5.4.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code states that the concrete objectives of the Supervisory Board regarding its composition and the status of the implementation of these objectives are to be published in the Corporate Governance Report. The members of the Supervisory Board of LANXESS AG are expected to possess the necessary exper­ tise, skills and professional experience to perform their duties. The members of the Supervisory Board autonomously undertake the necessary training required for their tasks and are supported in their efforts by the company. In making nominations, the Supervisory Board applies only legally permissible and fair selection criteria, acts in the company’s best interests, and gives consideration to the nominated candi­ dates’ integrity, commitment and independence. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 96 Corporate Governance Report The Supervisory Board of LANXESS AG should ensure the provision of impartial advice and supervision ­­ to the Board of Management. All current stockholder representatives on the Supervisory Board are independent. The Supervisory Board also assumes the independence of the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board and that their ability to act independently is not affected by their status as employees of the company or members of labor unions. No member of the Supervisory Board has a personal or business relationship with the company, its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder or any enterprise affiliated with a controlling shareholder that may cause a material and not merely temporary conflict of interest. No former member of the Board of Management of LANXESS AG is a member of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also aims for all future members of the Supervisory Board to be independent within the meaning of Section 5.4.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code and free of conflicts of interest. The Supervisory Board does not consider it appropriate to apply a rigid age limit for its members as it does not view age alone as a measure of their qualification and competence. The company should not have to forgo extensive experience. This takes into account the maximum length of membership of the Supervisory Board of generally not more than three full terms of office (15 years) that has been specified by the Supervisory Board. In general, the Supervisory Board should be guided by the principles of diversity in its composition. On the basis of their various personal and professional backgrounds, the members of the Supervisory Board contribute a broad spectrum of experience and skills. The global reach of LANXESS AG has been reflected in the composition of the Supervisory Board thus far and will remain a factor in selecting candidates to be proposed to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting for election to the Supervisory Board. In many cases, the experience and skills of the members of the Supervisory Board have been acquired while working abroad for a long period or in an international field. Two members of the Supervisory Board are not German citizens. The members of the Supervisory Board have professional knowledge of the chemical industry and other sectors that are important for the company’s business. Diversity applies equally to gender. In accordance with the law on the equal representation of women and men in management positions in the private and public sectors, codetermined stock corporations like LANXESS AG are required to appoint at least 30% women and 30% men when refilling Supervisory Board positions that become vacant from January 1, 2016. Existing appointments – including those of substitute members – can run until they end regularly. Three of the twelve members currently serving on the LANXESS AG Supervisory Board are women, which is a proportion of 25%. Future new appointments must be made in accordance with the legal stipulations. Composition and work of the Supervisory Board committees The Supervisory Board has a Presidial Committee, an Audit Committee, a Committee pursuant to ­Section 27, Paragraph 3 of the German Codetermination Act and a Nominations Committee formed from among its members. The Presidial Committee discusses key issues and prepares the meetings and resolutions of the ­Supervisory Board. It makes decisions on transactions requiring approval that are already included in the company’s annual planning. The Presidial Committee may also resolve on the exercise of participation rights pursuant to Section 32 of the German Codetermination Act and on transactions requiring approval that cannot be deferred. It consults regularly about long-term succession planning for the Board of Manage­ ment. Furthermore, the Committee also prepares the personnel decisions to be made by the Supervisory Board and resolutions of the full Supervisory Board regarding the compensation of the members of the Board of Management. In place of the full Supervisory Board, the Presidial Committee resolves on the LANXESS Annual Report 2015 Composition and work of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board and its committees 97 Stockholders and stockholders’ meetings conclusion and amendment of employment contracts with the members of the Board of Management and all other contractual matters not pertaining to compensation. The members of the Presidial ­Committee are Dr. Stomberg (Chairman), Ms. Seidel, Ms. Strauch, Mr. Sikorski, Mr. Walthie and Dr. Wolfgruber. The Audit Committee supports the Supervisory Board in overseeing the conduct of the business and deals with matters relating to the supervision of accounting, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal auditing system, as well as auditing, including the independence of the auditor and the work additionally performed by the auditor, and compliance. It ­prepares the Supervisory Board’s resolutions concerning the annual financial statements of LANXESS AG and the consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group and recommends an auditor whom the Supervisory Board then proposes to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting for appointment. The members of the Audit Committee are Dr. Janssen (Chairman), Ms. Nemat, Mr. Czaplik, Dr. Gerriets, Mr. Meiers and Mr. Rosen. Dr. Janssen, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, is an independent financial expert and has specialist knowledge and experience in the field of accounting acquired through his professional activities. The Committee pursuant to Section 27, Paragraph 3 of the German Codetermination Act ­performs the tasks described in Section 31, Paragraph 3 of the German Codetermination Act. The members of this committee are Dr. Stomberg (Chairman), Ms. Seidel, Mr. Meiers and Dr. Wolfgruber. The Nominations Committee solely comprises stockholder representatives and proposes candi­ dates for the Supervisory Board to nominate for election as new members of the Supervisory Board by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting. The members of this committee are Dr. Stomberg (Chairman),­ Mr. Rosen and Dr. Wolfgruber. Other Supervisory Board committees established for a particular purpose perform the duties assigned to them by Supervisory Board resolution. The respective committee chairmen report regularly to the Supervisory Board on the work of the committees. Stockholders and stockholders’ meetings The stockholders of LANXESS AG exercise their rights at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, where they can vote on the resolutions submitted. The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting resolves on all matters reserved for its decision by law, with binding effect on the stockholders and the company. Each share confers one vote. The items resolved on by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting include appropriation of the balance sheet profit, ratification of the actions taken by the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, appointment of the auditors and election of the stockholder representatives to the Supervisory Board. The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting also resolves on amendments to the articles of association, measures affecting the company’s capital and the approval of intercompany agreements. Each year there is an Annual Stockholders’ Meeting at which the Board of Management and Supervisory Board give an account of the last fiscal year. The German Stock Corporation Act requires the convening of an Extraordinary Stockholders’ Meeting in certain situations. All stockholders who register in time and prove their eligibility to attend the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting and exercise their voting rights shall be allowed to participate in the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting. Stock­ holders may exercise their voting rights at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting in person, through a proxy of their own choosing or through a company-nominated proxy who acts according to their instructions. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 98 Corporate Governance Report Compensation report The compensation report, which describes the compensation system and the amount of compensation paid to the members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board for their service in fiscal 2015, is part of the combined management report for LANXESS AG and the LANXESS Group. Risk management Corporate governance also includes the responsible handling of business risks. Therefore, a systematic and effective risk management system is the basis for professional corporate governance. Our risk ­management system aims to identify risks and opportunities at an early stage and to steer and minimize the risks that materialize. It is subject to ongoing optimization and adaptation to changing conditions. The Board of Management informs the Supervisory Board about the existence and development of potential risks on a regular basis. The Audit Committee regularly reviews the effectiveness of the risk management, internal control and auditing systems. Liability insurance The company maintains a directors’ and officers’ (D&O) liability insurance policy for members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board.

The company took on and successfully mastered the challenges it faced. With an EBITDA pre exceptionals of €885 million, we were able to substantially improve the company’s earning power – despite the persistently difficult competitive environment for the rubber business. All three segments contributed to this result. The Board of Management of LANXESS, with the support of the Supervisory Board, systematically implemented the extensive realignment program initiated in the previous fiscal year. We have improved our administrative structures, initiated optimization measures in production operations and found a strategic partner for our rubber business: Saudi Aramco. We are on schedule with the implementation of the joint venture named ARLANXEO and, working together with our strong partner, will soon be able to drive our rubber business forward. Fiscal 2016 will continue to be shaped by the challenges in the synthetic rubber business. However, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management has set the course for new growth in our Advanced Intermediates and Performance Chemicals segments and in the High Performance Mate­ rials business unit. Alongside the integration of the joint venture and ongoing stabilization of our financial position, growth should again become the focus for LANXESS. During 2015, the Supervisory Board duly and fully performed the tasks and duties incumbent upon it under the law, the articles of association and the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board. It advised the Board of Management regularly on the management of the company and monitored its work. In par­ ticular, it dealt with matters relating to the company’s realignment, its strategic development, the various options for the rubber business and measures to increase competitiveness. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 104 Report of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board was directly involved in all decisions of fundamental importance for the company. The Board of Management informed us regularly in written and oral reports about business performance, the situation of the Group, including the risk situation, strategic development and current issues. On the basis of these reports, we discussed significant business transactions in detail. We thoroughly examined the reports and the resolutions proposed by the Board of Management and discussed them at length in meetings of the full Supervisory Board and its committees. If the law, articles of association or other provisions required the Supervisory Board to approve the actions of the Board of Management, we dis­ cussed these actions and adopted resolutions on them. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management were in regular contact outside of the Supervisory Board’s meetings. We regularly discussed the present state of the company, matters of strategy, planning, business performance, risks, risk management, management development, com­ pliance and material events. Principal topics discussed by the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board met a total of eight times in 2015. We regularly discussed the sales and earnings performance of the company and its segments, as well as the financial position. Additionally, the Board of Management kept us updated about the overall state of the economy, the situation in the chemical industry, the performance of LANXESS stock, and investment and acquisition plans. Other important issues addressed by the Supervisory Board are presented below. The focus of the Supervisory Board meeting held on March 17, 2015, was the review of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2014 and the proposal for use of the distributable profit. The Supervisory Board also discussed and passed motions for resolution by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting and reviewed corporate governance matters. An important topic at this meeting was the discussion of personnel matters pertaining to the Board of Management. The Super­ visory Board approved the mutually agreed termination of the appointment of Dr. Bernhard Düttmann as a member of the Board of Management effective March 31, 2015, and the severance agreement in respect of his service contract. Effective April 1, 2015, Michael Pontzen was appointed as a member of the Board of Management. At the same time, responsibilities were reassigned within the Board of Management. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board defined the variable compensation components for the members of the Board of Management on the basis of target attainment in fiscal 2014. At the meeting held on May 6, 2015, we discussed with the Board of Management the impact on e­ nergy costs at LANXESS that will result from Germany’s Renewable Energy Act and the emissions trading system. The Board of Management made a full report on environmental protection and occupational and plant safety, which was subsequently discussed by the full Supervisory Board. The meeting that took place immediately prior to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 13, 2015, served to prepare that meeting. Following the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, a constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board took place with the stockholder representatives newly elected by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting and the employee representatives who had already been elected by the LANXESS workforce in April. Dr. Rolf Stomberg was re-elected Chairman of the Supervisory Board. Ms. Gisela Seidel was appointed Vice Chairwoman. In addition, new committee members were elected. At the meeting on August 5, 2015, the Board of Management reported in detail on the status of various options for the rubber business and on the planned legal separation of the organizational units affected. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 105 We also discussed with the Board of Management the factors relevant to calculating the provisions for pensions in Germany. Moreover, we resolved the awarding of the audit contract for the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015. The Board of Management explained the implementation of the new law on equal representation of women and men in management positions in the private and public sectors. In light of the fact that the appointments and service contracts of the members of the Board of Management serving at the time the resolution was taken are valid beyond June 30, 2017, the Super­ visory Board resolved to maintain the status quo with a target for the proportion of women on the Board of Management of LANXESS AG of 0% through June 30, 2017. At an extraordinary meeting on September 22, 2015, the Supervisory Board reviewed the advanced status of negotiations with potential partners for the rubber business. The offers were subsequently assessed in terms of the opportunities and risks they presented. In conclusion, we decided to approve the proposal of the Board of Management for a joint venture with Saudi Aramco in which each partner would hold 50% and to which LANXESS would contribute its entire rubber business. With a view to the company’s realignment, the Supervisory Board also decided to fill the vacant position for a second oper­ ational member of the Board of Management. Effective October 1, 2015, Dr. Hubert Fink was appointed as a member of the Board of Management. At the same time, a change to the assignment of Board of Management responsibilities was also decided. At the meeting on November 4, 2015, the Board of Management reported on decisions taken in respect of capital expenditures in the Saltigo business unit, which we discussed at length. We were also informed about the status of the closure of the Marl site and other measures aimed at strengthening the competitiveness of the rubber business. Additionally, the Board of Management described the ­company’s financial position and financial policy. We approved the creation of a new financing framework for ­concluding further finance agreements with a total value of €1 billion. Lastly, the Board of Management explained the company’s internal control, risk management and auditing systems. At its meeting on December 9, 2015, the Supervisory Board reviewed in full and approved the ­corporate planning for 2016 proposed by the Board of Management. It also discussed the company’s ­strategic alignment and capital expenditure policy. As in previous years, current developments in corporate ­governance were a topic on the agenda of the December meeting. After reviewing compliance with the ­recommendations and suggestions of the Corporate Governance Code, we resolved to issue a declaration of compliance. We also specified a regular limit of three full terms of office (15 years) for the length of membership of the members of the Supervisory Board and agreed changes to the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board. In order to synchronize the conditions with those applicable to the other manage­ment levels, the Supervisory Board agreed to adapt the relation between target achievement and p ­ otential payout of the Annual Performance Payment (APP) – a variable compensation component – for the ­members of the Board of Management for fiscal 2015. Lastly, the Supervisory Board defined the conditions for the Board of Management’s variable compensation components for fiscal 2016. All members of the Supervisory Board and its committees performed their duties diligently and conscien­ tiously. The German Corporate Governance Code recommends that this report should contain a remark if any member of the Supervisory Board attends only half or fewer of the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and of the committees of which he or she is a member. Until he left the Supervisory Board on conclusion of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on May 13, 2015, Robert J. Koehler had attended fewer than half of the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and of the Presidial Committee on account of ill health. The stockholder representatives and employee representatives to the Supervisory Board worked together in a spirit of trust. They regularly held separate meetings at which they prepared the meetings of the full Supervisory Board. The members of the Board of Management attended the Supervisory Board meetings unless the Chairman of the Supervisory Board determined otherwise. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 106 Report of the Supervisory Board Work of the committees The Supervisory Board has four committees: the Audit Committee, the Presidial Committee, the Nomi­ nations Committee and the Committee formed pursuant to Section 27, Paragraph 3 of the German Co­ determination Act. The committees are tasked with preparing the topics and resolutions to be discussed at meetings of the full Supervisory Board. They also, at times, exercise decision-making powers conferred on them by the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee met four times during the year. It dealt in particular with the annual financial state­ ments of LANXESS AG for fiscal 2014, the consolidated financial statements and combined management report for fiscal 2013, the interim reports issued during fiscal 2015, and the condensed consolidated financial statements and interim management report included in the 2015 half-year financial report. It also reviewed the company’s risk management and internal control systems. Other topics discussed were the significant findings by the internal audit department, corporate planning, compliance, the development of pension provisions and the determination of the principal areas of focus for the audit of the 2015 financial statements. The external auditor attended two of the Audit Committee’s four meetings and reported on the auditing activities. The Presidial Committee convened six times during 2015 to prepare the meetings of the ­Supervisory Board and the decisions to be reached by the full Supervisory Board concerning human resources ­measures in the company’s Board of Management. The Nominations Committee and the Committee formed pursuant to Section 27, paragraph 3 of the German Codetermination Act did not convene in 2015. The chairmen of the committees each reported on the meetings and the work of the committees at the meetings of the full Supervisory Board. Corporate governance and declaration of compliance In the year under review, the Supervisory Board discussed the German Corporate Governance Code (the Code). The joint declaration of compliance made on December 9, 2015, by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act can be viewed by stockholders at any time on the company’s website. As expressed in the declaration, LANXESS AG complies with the Code’s recommendations and suggestions except in a few justified cases. No conflicts of interest on the part of Supervisory Board members became known last year. Further information about corporate governance can be found in the Corporate Governance Report and in the Board of Manage­ ment’s declaration pursuant to Section 289a of the German Commercial Code. Financial statements of LANXESS AG and consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group The Board of Management of LANXESS AG prepared the financial statements for the 2015 fiscal year in accordance with the rules of the German Commercial Code, the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the combined management report for 2015. These were all audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, the auditor appointed by the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting and engaged by the Supervisory Board. The auditor issued an unqualified opinion in each case. LANXESS Annual Report 2015 107 The Supervisory Board convinced itself of the independence of the auditor and the persons acting on the auditor’s behalf. The audit reports and the documents relating to the financial statements were discussed at length with the Board of Management and the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting held on March 14, 2016. They were also discussed in detail on the basis of the required documents and notes at the Supervisory Board’s financial statements meeting held on March 15, 2016. The responsible auditor was present for the discussions concerning the financial statements of LANXESS AG and the consolidated financial state­ ments of the LANXESS Group. He reported on the material results of the audits. He was also available to the Audit Committee and full Supervisory Board to provide additional information. Based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee as well as on its own review and in-depth discussions about the financial statements of LANXESS AG, the consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group, the combined management report and the proposal for appropriation of the profit, the Supervisory Board endorsed the auditor’s conclusions and had no objections to raise. The Supervisory Board has approved the annual financial statements of LANXESS AG and the consolidated financial statements of the LANXESS Group, which were prepared by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board endorsed the Board of Management’s proposal for use of the distributable profit after close examination and extensive deliberations that carefully weighed the best interests of the company and the stockholders. Composition of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board was newly constituted in fiscal 2015. With the conclusion of the 2015 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, the terms of office of all employee representatives and of five of the six stockholder representatives routinely ended. The following employee representatives were elected in April 2015 by delegates elected by the work­ force: Gisela Seidel, Werner Czaplik, Dr. Hans-Dieter Gerriets, Thomas Meiers, Hans-Jürgen Schicker and Ralf Sikorski. Axel Berndt and Ulrich Freese are no longer members of the Supervisory Board. On June 30, 2015, Mr. Schicker resigned as a representative of the LANXESS workforce. He was succeeded as a member of the Supervisory Board by Manuela Strauch, who was his elected substitute member. At the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting of LANXESS AG on May 13, 2015, Dr. Friedrich Janssen, ­Lawrence A. Rosen, Dr. Rolf Stomberg, Theo H. Walthie and Dr. Matthias L. Wolfgruber were elected as the stockholder representatives on the company’s Supervisory Board. Robert J. Koehler and Rainer Laufs resigned from the Supervisory Board. Mr. Koehler passed away in May 2015 after a serious illness. The Supervisory Board greatly valued Mr. Koehler’s commitment and input and will continue to hold his memory in high esteem. The Supervisory Board thanks the Board of Management, all of the Group’s employees and the employee representatives for their enormous dedication and work.

Grants and subsidies from third parties for the acquisition and construction of property, plant and equipment are accounted for as deferred income using the gross method. In this respect, no adjustments other than for gross depreciation and amortization are made when calculating EBITDA pre exceptionals. Every operational decision or achievement is judged in the short and long term by its sustainable impact on EBITDA pre exceptionals. As part of the annual budget and planning process, targets are set for this benchmark of our company’s success, which are then taken into account in determining employees’ variable income components.

In addition, we use a simplified variant of ROCE, called “business ROCE,” to evaluate the contribution of our business units. Our annual budget and planning process delivers key values for the Group’s earning power and our ability to finance operations from our own funds as the starting point for steering the company.

In addition, LANXESS has a contractually agreed title to goods until the contractual partner has paid the full purchase price. The vast majority of receivables relate to customers with very high credit standing. The creditworthiness of the counterparty is a key criterion in the financial policy and credit risk management of the LANXESS Group, especially in the selection of banks and financial partners for ­capital investments and transactions involving financial ­instruments. LANXESS therefore endeavors to undertake transactions with banks and other financial counterparties that have at least an ­investment-grade rating. The derivatives and financial assets outstanding as of the closing date were almost all concluded with banks with an investment-grade rating. Credit risk management also includes global management of the counterparty risk relating to all existing relationships with banks and financial partners. The LANXESS Group pays particular attention to risk diversification to prevent any cluster risks that could jeopardize its existence. Through master agreements, the market values of open trading positions can be netted if a partner becomes insolvent, thereby further reducing risks.

On October 6, 2015, sulfur dioxide was released as the result of an unplanned build-up of pressure in a spent acid incinerator at the site in Leverkusen, Germany. The impact was restricted by the immediate shutdown of the facility. Also in Leverkusen, failure of the thermal waste air purification facility on November 11, 2015, resulted in the release of very odorous substances, which were clearly discernible outside the site. On November 21, 2015, some 130 m² of a reaction mixture spilled from a container at the Kallo site in Belgium.
