Paradoxically, while one region in which we operate generates excessive food waste, another—Africa—suffers from famine. We will commit to: • Measuring tonnes of food waste generated, and targeting a 20% reduction of food waste diverted from landfill for our supermarkets, restaurants and serviced facilities in 2015— ultimately aiming for zero waste to landfill. This includes quantifying and publishing food waste in terms of the number of people that could have been fed. • Creating an internal food think-tank to identify ways to eliminate food waste such as donating to charities or other alternative uses. • Profiling and targeting the most wasted food items in our supermarkets by category and volume. • Guaranteeing purchase amounts from our food suppliers in advance so they can forecast demand and avoid waste surplus. • Supporting initiatives, social enterprises, and startups addressing food waste, such as apps linking surplus food from stores to local food charities, or food preservation technologies • Launching a campaign to educate our customers on food waste and incentivise more sustainable consumption habits. • We will proactively engage 100% of farmers in our supply chains to increase crop quality and yield, and to promote organic and sustainable agriculture in partnership with thirdparties like the UN Environment Programme. • We will monitor and increase the percentage of organic locally grown produce at Alosra by 10% in 2015, providing fresher products with fewer food miles, emissions, and waste.
