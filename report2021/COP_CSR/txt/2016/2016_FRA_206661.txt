This is our third Communication on Progress (COP). Within the scope of our security and safety services, we have increasingly incorporated the socioeconomic dimension of the environments in which we operate. This Communication examines those steps and describes the measures and indicators that show the results achieved. The continued growth in terms of annual turnover and number of clients registered by ERYS Group in the last four years keeps encouraging us to better define our policy in terms of sustainability and social responsibility. Working in fragile environments with weak governance and potential human rights violations, ERYS is fully aware of the importance of the strict affirmation and implementation of the UN Global Compact principles. Still driven by this firm commitment, ERYS Group is pleased to address once again this Communication on Progress, reaffirming it as a key issue in its dealings with partners and commissioning parties. I am looking forward to reporting on our progress next year. THE GLOBAL COMPACT | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 3 HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES PRINCIPLE 1: BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS; AND PRINCIPLE 2: MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS The activities implemented by ERYS Group are based on the human rights commitments entered into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, the Montreux Document and the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers. ERYS Group implements projects and operations in countries that are affected by conflicts, fragility and violence. For this reason, ERYS strives for the elaboration of common standards for its subcontractor. In particular, ERYS Group’s commitment to the UN Global Compact’s principles on human rights is expressed in our Ethic Charter, stating that ‘ERYS Group supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and our employees are never to be complicit in human right abuses’. The Ethic Charter is available on our website (www.erysgroup.com) and has to be signed by all subcontractors wishing to work with ERYS in each theatre of operation. IMPLEMENTATION ERYS Group has implemented several actions in 2014 in order to include the respect of Human Rights into its daily work. Training and Introductory Briefings Working in hostile and volatile environments, one of the main concerns of ERYS is to guarantee a solid and trusted establishment of partners’ network in the countries where operations are conducted. As stated before, all subcontractors of ERYS shall sign and comply with the principles stated in the ERYS Ethic Charter. Furthermore, the management personnel working in higher-risk environments get a compulsory introductory training, composed of a specific course and a briefing document, to make sure that they fully understand their responsibilities in terms of respect of human rights. Finally, since our trials in 2014 in New Caledonia, we have continuously expanded the use of Human Rights courses to local staff. Since October 2015, for instance, all our locally-hired employees on our Libyan project have followed those courses. Internal Reporting Process The employees of ERYS are encouraged to report any alleged violation of human rights or any unacceptable or inappropriate conduct in relation to other ethical issues. The issue shall be raised through a specific complaint box that has been installed in every ERYS office worldwide. The CEO is directly involved in dealing with such reports. THE GLOBAL COMPACT | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 4 Participation to International Instruments ERYS was one of the first signatories of the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers (ICoCA), which establishes human right-based principles for the responsible provision of private security services. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES In 2015, no violation of ERYS Group’s Ethic Charter neither of the Human Rights principles has been noticed nor reported. A number of smaller, side projects have been completed thanks to our action. In Mali, hence: A school has been reopened, with gender parity in employment (September 2015, Amachach, Northern Mali). A vegetable garden has been purchased and gifted to a group of women who weren’t allowed access to property previously (Amachach, Northern Mali) A crafts shop has been built and gifted to disaffected tribal youth (Tessalit, Northern Mali). THE GLOBAL COMPACT | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 5 LABOUR PRINCIPLE 3: BUSINESSES SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING; PRINCIPLE 4: THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCES AND COMPULSORY LABOUR; PRINCIPLE 5: THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR; AND PRINCIPLE 6: THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS The main strength of ERYS Group is the quality of its people. For this reason the Group places great importance on the selection and recruitment of its employees. Moreover, ERYS strives to provide opportunities for our people to develop, achieve their professional goals and enjoy a successful career within the company. Within this context, ERYS’ Ethic Charter makes a clear reference to the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) ‘Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights’. Protection against discrimination, especially on the ground of ethnic origin, gender, religion, disability, age, sexual identity and orientation, is also enshrined in our Ethic Charter. We also fully comply with the requirements of French national gender equality law. IMPLEMENTATION Both in headquarters in Paris and in offices worldwide, staff meetings are held regularly, and there are also other opportunities for dialogue within specific videoconferences with the presence of the CEO. ERYS Group often works in countries and regions where the conditions are particularly difficult and complex. For this reason ERYS continually reviews the contracts, insurances, policies and procedures to ensure the compliance with local legislation. ERYS Group carefully controls its subcontractors and prospective employees before engaging them and expects them to comply with its policies when working on the company’s behalf. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES We have firmly committed ourselves to promulgating female representation in our sector which has traditionally been male-driven. The departure of female employees at our headquarters has been systematically compensated by the hiring of female employees. In our security staff, since 2014, we have managed to steadily increase the proportion of female staff: further, in 2015, female security employees have been staying far longer than in previous years, showing that our efforts to increase their well-being have given results. THE GLOBAL COMPACT | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 6 ENVIRONMENT PRINCIPLE 7: BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES; PRINCIPLE 8: UNDERTAKE INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY; AND PRINCIPLE 9: ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS Due to its specific area of expertise, ERYS Group has a relatively low impact on the environment. However, ERYS identified three key areas of environmental focus and is fully committed to evaluating and monitoring the performances in these areas:  Reducing office waste and consumption  Promoting a sustainable travel policy  Raise the awareness of the employees and subcontractor IMPLEMENTATION As far as the reduction of office waste is concerned, specific measures have been taken in order to run a recycling awareness campaign among the employees. The nature of our activities means that travel cannot be avoided. However, the use of video conferencing and online messaging has been incentivised to discourage the travel. When absolutely necessary, train has always been preferred over flights in order to reduce the carbon footprint. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES In 2015, an increase in the percentage of recycled waste (paper, glass and plastic) has been registered compared to 2014. We have signed a contract with the recycling company Le Petit Plus (www.lepetitplus.net): all our paper is being recycled and the recycling of other waste categories has been further increased. THE GLOBAL COMPACT | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 7 ANTI-CORRUPTION PRINCIPLE 10: BUSINESS SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND BRIBERY. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS ERYS’ commitment to the Tenth Principle is expressed in its Ethic Charter (available on our website www.erysgroup.com). Beyond the obligations derived from compliance with French and international law, integrity and anticorruption are considered as two core elements of our compliance management. Operating in fragile environments, a particular attention is given to the monitoring of any activity that can be assimilated to corruption (active and passive bribery, giving and taking of gifts and other benefits, the employment and contracting of related or associated persons and other conflicts of interest). IMPLEMENTATION Two major axes have been identified: Training and awareness As reported in our last COP, ERYS’ CEO intervenes in classes and conferences in order to sensitize company staff to the particular risk of corruption. Furthermore, the recruitment process conducted by ERYS is conceived with the aim to minimise the risk of illegal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour. This is made through face-to-face training sessions combining a briefing with discussion scenarios focusing on common situations such as demands for facilitation payments during specific procedures. Control of subcontractors The principles adopted by ERYS in terms of anti-corruption apply to subcontractors as well. In fact the process of selection and management of our subcontractors is aimed at minimising the risk of illegal, unethical or unprofessional behaviours and at reinforcing the existing awareness in terms of relations with third parties and ethical behaviour. This approach is adopted both with new and existing subcontractors. Creation and management of CEFSI ERYS GROUP has created and pilots the Club des Entreprises Françaises de Sûreté à l’International (CEFSI) since December 2014. CEFSI is a think tank aiming at fostering discussions between private and institutional security actors on ethical matters. THE GLOBAL COMPACT | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 8 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES In 2015, the Ethic Committee, at the management level of the Group or at any subsidiary level has noticed no corruption act or attempt.
