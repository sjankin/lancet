(thereafter KOLB), since 2015, is a participant of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) initiative that has developed the Ten Principles of Responsible Business Conduct in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment, and anticorruption. The UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles are derived from: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. The UNGC is a strategic policy initiative for corporations and non-business organisations that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles of responsible business conduct. The initiative is set up as a multi-stakeholder platform whose aim is to team up actors from the business environment, civil and labour society, and United Nations agencies. The UNGC seeks to build cooperation and promote partnership between business and actors in order to support corporations to respect and support a set of core values. The UNGC is organised in Local Networks as intermediaries between its members and the UN Global Compact Office in New York. The Global Compact Network Switzerland (GCNS) serves as official platform for the Global Compact in Switzerland bringing together Swiss signatories of the UN Global Compact Initiative. KOLB participates in the board of GCNS to show its support of the UNGC as a medium-sized enterprise. One way to communicate its commitment to the UNGC organization and society is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) Report. In 2016, one year after becoming a UNGC participant, KOLB submits its first COP Report to demonstrate KOLB’s ongoing accountability for the Ten Principles of the UNGC.

To remain successful in the future, we want to build an inclusive, sustainable business model that aims for the most sustainable product solutions to deliver lasting benefits to our markets and society. As KOLB, we want our product solutions to be part of a sustainable, global economy that benefits all people and the environment. We recognize that the UN Global Compact initiative provides the framework and support for achieving this goal. KOLB has a long-standing tradition in aligning its strategies and operations with health and safety, and environmental standards. We are pleased about our accomplishments to date, but know that we must stay focused and constantly reinvent our business and ourselves for our success. By joining the UN Global Compact and the local Swiss UNGC Network in particular, KOLB is part of a strong network that dedicates resources to jointly advance societal goals in the areas of human and labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption. Goals that in the long-term create benefits for society, nature and our markets. As KOLB Group, we fully support the UNGC’s Ten Principles and are committed to align our operations, accordingly.

Principle 2: Businesses should make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Our contribution to the implementation of the UNGC Principles on human rights As KOLB, we support the UNGC’s principles on human rights through legal compliance and our own internal guidelines and policies, which lay down our established values and high ethical standards as a responsible company. KOLB operates two production sites, one in Switzerland (Headquarters: Hedingen) and one in The Netherlands (Moerdijk). At both sites, we strive to strictly comply with all applicable national and supranational laws and regulations, which implement international regulations on the protection of human rights. According to our “Sustainability Policy Statement for KOLB Group”, if national law and international human rights standards differ, KOLB, in principle, will follow the higher standard. Where they are in conflict, KOLB will adhere to national law, and simultaneously pursue ways to respect the international human rights to the greatest extent possible. To substantiate our support and respect towards human rights in our global business activities, and relationships along our supply chain, KOLB in 2015 implemented an updated version of its “Sustainability Policy Statement for KOLB Group” and issued a package of specific policy documents (awaiting implementation in due course) designed to deepen and complement the “Sustainability Policy Statement”. These documents include our “Human Rights Policy Statement for KOLB Group” and our “Code of Business Conduct for KOLB Suppliers” which all will be available in the main languages (German, Dutch, French, English) spoken at our two production sites in Switzerland and the Netherlands, to make their content accessible and easily understandable to our entire workforce. In addition, a training concept is being developed, so that our employees at different categories can be effectively educated to adopt the included rules in their daily work. The development of our “Human Rights Policy Statement for KOLB Group” (currently in the process of implementation) is a first step to better understand, and prioritize KOLB’s human rights risks – on this basis we develop our approach to human rights further. As we take our responsibility serious also beyond our own operations, we refrain from cooperating with any business partners who violate our high ethical business standards. Our “Code of Business Conduct for KOLB Suppliers” (currently in the process of implementation) covers environmental protection as well as compliance with human and labour rights in particular (incl. land tenure rights and rights of indigenous and local communities), and antidiscrimination and anticorruption policies. KOLB seeks to establish relationships with suppliers that share the same principles and values. In particular, we are aware of our responsibility to human rights aspects along the palm oil supply chain and therefore engage in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an international multi-stakeholder organisation and certification scheme for sustainable palm oil. KOLB’s production sites in Hedingen (CH) and Moerdijk (NL) are RSPO certified, which means we are able to verify sustainable palm oil, according to RSPO, at every step of the supply Kolb Distribution Ltd. · Maienbrunnenstrasse 1 · P.O.

Land tenure rights and the rights of indigenous and local communities shall be respected, and smallholder farmers shall be integrated into the supply chain and provided access to education. Grievance and remedy mechanisms shall also be provided for. Labour Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Our contribution to the implementation of the UNGC Principles on labour KOLB strictly complies with all applicable laws and regulations on labour standards at our two production sites in Switzerland and The Netherlands. Swiss and EU laws and regulations guarantee the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, and prohibit forced and compulsory labour, child labour and discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Our internal system to deal with all compliance issues is currently being made concrete. As a small organisation with a lived speak-up culture and short ways and flat organizational structure, we are dedicated to provide a safe and respectful working environment for all our employees. We offer equal employment opportunities and foster the diversity of our workforce. To stipulate our habitual values with regard to labour standards, we have laid down employment regulations, which specifically address issues such as prohibition of discrimination on grounds of gender, religion, nationality or other criteria, as well as harassment or abuse of power. Our documented employment regulations also define the framework of working hours and shift work, wages, absences, and continued payment in case of illness. Our “Sustainability Policy Statement for KOLB Group”, updated and implemented in 2015, determines our company values in terms of employment and is complemented by several topicspecific policies, such as the “Code of Business Conduct for KOLB Employees” and the “Code of Business Conduct for KOLB Suppliers” both dealing with aspects of labour standards. (The two documents were developed in 2015 and await implementation). These codes specify that KOLB prohibits harassment and discrimination in the workplace, does not tolerate forced, compulsory, and child labour, and is committed to providing safe and healthy working conditions. KOLB respects the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and effective information and consultation procedures.

In 2015, no lost time accidents occurred. Our staff are regularly trained in regard to occupational health and safety issues and instructed in appropriate measures and behaviour to prevent accidents (e.g., our “12 Life Saving Rules”). To emphasise our commitment, we interchange with other responsible organisations and actively shape the development of sustainable business, KOLB is a member of the board of the Global Compact Network Switzerland and the Swiss regional network (oebu) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). In reward of our longstanding efforts to improve the sustainability performance in business relations along our supply chain, KOLB received the Silver Medal from Ecovadis, a rating organisation for global supply chains. Environment Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Our contribution to the implementation of the UNGC Principles on the environment As a chemical company with a wide range of products at the output side and numerous production substances at the input side, we as KOLB recognize our considerable responsibility for the environment both during our operations, along our supply chain and in the context of our products. With this in mind, we are dedicated to continuously improving the environmental performance of our production sites, the ecological value proposition of our products and actively engage in maintaining high ecological standards for the procurement of our resources. This includes compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with regard to the environment at our two production sites in Switzerland and The Netherlands and with our own guidelines addressing the environment, a safe handling of chemicals in particular. In our updated “Sustainability Policy Statement” we declare to continuously improve the environmental, health and safety knowledge about and performance of applied technologies, and our own processes and solutions during their life cycles to mitigate any significant adverse negative environmental, and safety and health risks and impacts to people and the environment. This includes the safe handling, storage, recycling, reuse and disposal of Kolb Distribution Ltd. · Maienbrunnenstrasse 1 · P.O.

In this context, we ensure that all palm oil used by us is produced in a manner that is environmentally sustainable, in line with the RSPO guidelines and beyond. We promote the RSPO “Principles & Criteria for Sustainable Palm Oil Production” throughout our supply chain and expect from our suppliers to abide to the “Code of Business Conduct for KOLB Suppliers”. In particular, suppliers shall protect and conserve High Carbon Stock (HCS) and High Conservation Value Areas (CVA) and peat areas. A broad portfolio of our products is RSPO certified. In principle, we seek to consolidate and foster certification of our product portfolio through different appropriate eco-labels (Ecocert, Ecolabel & Nordic Swan, HOCNF), which independently affirm product sustainability and environmental friendliness. We register and classify all chemical substances used and produced by us according to international regulations, such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals; Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006) and CLP (Classification, Labelling and Packaging; Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008) of the European Union. Until 2015, nine substances were registered under REACH. Inspections according to the Ordinance on Protection against Major Accidents (the Swiss complementary to the Seveso-III Directive of the EU) on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances were conducted in 2015 at our production site in Hedingen (Switzerland). KOLB is one of only a few companies in Europe who have considerable experience in regularly handling ethylene oxide, a hazardous substance. As member of a network of ethylene oxide users, we support disaster management services in case of (transport) accidents with ethylene oxide. To emphasise the management approach applied to our environmental protection measures and to underline our commitment to the precautionary principle in all our operations, we run a management system which is certified according to ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 and adheres to the standards of OHSAS 18001 and the Responsible Care Program. It constitutes the documented structural framework that KOLB employs when setting group wide and local objectives, and manages its activities and programs. KOLB continually improves and efficiently manages its natural resource consumption, reduces waste and emissions to air, land and water preferably at the source, and treats any waste appropriately before discharge or disposal. In this context we annually formulate and review our Health & Safety and Environmental targets. Together with the Energy Agency of the Swiss Private Sector (EnAW) we monitor our CO2 emissions annually and define the most appropriate measures to reduce them. The measures are categorized by pay-back time, such that we can implement the most cost-effective measures to reduce our risks associated with high CO2 emissions (fee to be paid if CO2 limit cannot be attained). According to the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) reporting scheme our disclosure of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is above average, compared with similar corporations. Between 2013 and 2015, we managed to reduce our direct emissions (scope 1, according to the GHG protocol) by 22%. Energy consumption in 2015 was 24% lower than in 2014. In 2015, we optimized our waste water management system by improving the monitoring of the internal sewage facility, implementing new analytical methods, and training of our employees. Thus, we increased the performance of aerobic decomposition within the internal sewage facility and reduced the environmental footprint. Kolb Distribution Ltd. · Maienbrunnenstrasse 1 · P.O.
