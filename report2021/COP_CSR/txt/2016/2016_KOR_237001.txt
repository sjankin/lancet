This leaves us with one simple question: How will we continue to grow? Or, economic value of Profits more precisely, what drives us to achieve growth in the first place? To find the answer, we need to look back on the past 10 years. Increased sales of automobiles resulted in revenue growth. This propped up the share of our business partners, who account for 80 percent of our sales revenue, while the remaining 20 percent—distribution to employees, investors, governments, local communities and R&D investments—grew as well. Over the past decade, both sales revenue and sales volume have grown more than twofold. Over this time, we have built plants overseas and extended our domestic production lines. More investments were dedicated to product innovation, while we spent more on marketing and services. Consequently, our workforce size and supply chain have also grown, while our influence has increased in local communities in which we have a presence and where we are proactively addressing social issues.

Diesel oxidation or one with fewer cylinders, results in higher fuel efficiency catalysts and diesel particulate filters (DPF) eliminate carbon Whether from an economic or an environmental perspective, fuel efficiency is an indispensable factor because there is less frictional resistance or loss of air during monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and particulate matter (PM) when choosing a car.
