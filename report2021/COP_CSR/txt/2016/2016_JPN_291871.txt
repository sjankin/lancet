To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 14 BUSINESS OVERVIEW DOMESTIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS Obayashi will realize stable earnings by providing higher-value-added services in the construction business, utilizing its advanced engineering technologies and other advantages, while strengthening its competitiveness in growing markets such as in the Tokyo metropolitan area and renewal fields. Business The economic outlook is currently affected by concerns such as uncertainties in overseas economies and yen appreciation. On the other hand, in the manufacturing industry, companies continue to Environment invest in upgrading and streamlining their equipment to enhance competitiveness. Investment in new fields in conjunction with energy diversification and technological innovation has also been strong. In the non-manufacturing industry, many of the buildings that were constructed during Japan’s high growth period are due for renewal, and ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, investment has continued to pour into redevelopment projects in the Tokyo metropolitan area and other major cities, railway and other infrastructure upgrading, and constructing and remodeling hotels. Meanwhile, the volume of orders received expanded 16% year on year to ¥1.2 trillion in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, reflecting robust construction demand in Japan. Obayashi and sub­ contractors are likely to be reaching the limit of production capacity. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we will work hard to secure and expand production capacity. Business In growth fields and fields peripheral to construction that require advanced engineering technologies, we are focusing on renewable energy, industrial robots and medical equipment fields, as well as Strategies Smart Cities*1 and other new fields that are associated with technological innovation. On the other hand, while many buildings in Japan are coming due for renewal, a large number of old buildings were devastated by the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016. We believe it is our ­mission to pass on high-quality, environmentally friendly buildings that are secure against natural disasters to the next generation. From the standpoint of business continuity planning (BCP), we are concentrating on renewal projects that will provide safety, security and comfort. In response to the issue of securing production capacity, we are focusing efforts on training skilled construction workers and improving labor conditions. We are developing construction methods that save labor and shorten construction periods, while deploying Information Communications Technology (ICT) such as Building Information Modeling (BIM). *1 Smart City: An environmentally friendly city focused on resource conservation that aims to achieve effective citywide energy consumption by deploying cutting-edge technologies such as IT and environmental technology. 15 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 To Contents p3–6 p7–12 p13–36 p37–62 p63–66 p67–109 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR Corporate Governance Corporate Data Priority Measures ■ Bolster competitiveness in growing markets such as Tokyo metropolitan area and renewal fields ■ Receive orders for engineering projects for production facilities and renewable energy-related facilities ■ Develop and implement labor-saving and short period construction methods, as well as training multi-skilled workers ■ Help suppliers to secure and train skilled workers ■ Optimize BIM, IoT (Internet of Things) and other ICT TOPICS We utilize BIM in all of our designed and contracted projects as well as roughly 80% of the projects designed Integrated by other companies.

This project started by replacing the overpass bridge on National Route 20 (Koushu Road), which was originally constructed over 90 years ago. Obayashi completed JR SHINJUKU MIRAINA TOWER, a new landmark in Shinjuku comprising a large-scale office and the commercial complex “NEWoMan,” and featuring a multi-purpose hall and an outdoor space. Moreover, the Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal was opened as the largest bus terminal in Japan with 1,600 expressway buses arriving and departing each day during peak periods. The expressway bus stops that used to be scattered around the West Exit of Shinjuku Station are now concentrated and joined directly to the station, allowing passengers to easily transfer between buses and trains, improving convenience. The taxi stop on the overpass has also been relocated to a spot inside the bus terminal, alleviating the chronic traffic jams on National Route 20. The completion of JR SHINJUKU MIRAINA TOWER and the Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal has dramatically changed the appearance of the South Exit of Shinjuku Station, making the station more convenient and attractive. 17 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 To Contents p3–6 p7–12 p13–36 p37–62 p63–66 p67–109 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR Corporate Governance Corporate Data The building was constructed in separate east and west sections Photograph courtesy of East Japan Railway Company East side West side Attaching the curtain wall using the outer wall lifting system Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal is constructed directly above the railway lines Our Solution Coordinated Construction in Three Sections For this project, Obayashi advanced construction in three sections in parallel: building construction, underground construction (civil engineering), and construction above the railway lines. Since progress on each section influenced the construction schedule for the entire project, it was vital that each section coordinated with the others. For example, the underground construction needed to use the western side of the building construction area in order to have materials delivered underground. Therefore, building construction started on the eastern side first, with construction on the western side starting six months later. This not only moved the entire project forward, but also shortened the construction period for the building construction section. Introduction of Outer Wall Lifting System Obayashi introduced an “outer wall lifting system” for installing external panels in the building construction section. The construction period was considerably reduced by using a mobile crane on rails attached to the outer rim of the building frame to hoist and move the curtain wall to its predetermined position, thereby conveying it separately from steel beams and other construction materials. Thorough Safety Measures Shinjuku Station is used by more than 3 million people each day. One of our projects was to ­construct a bus terminal above the railway lines by the station. To prevent any risk of interrupting railway services due to falling objects or other reasons, construction on exterior portions of the steel frame was performed late at night, and objects were secured with double suspension wires as an extra precaution. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 18 BUSINESS OVERVIEW DOMESTIC CIVIL ENGINEERING BUSINESS Obayashi will contribute to the development of safe and secure infrastructure through its business activities, while focusing on projects that require advanced technologies. We aim to reduce labor by using more precast units for construction structures and improve productivity by utilizing ICT to increase the efficiency of production systems. Business We estimate domestic construction investment at ¥49.6 trillion in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, and expect it to remain around ¥45–50 trillion annually for the time being. We anticipate high Environment levels of investment in our target markets, such as projects related to the Chuo Shinkansen Project using the Superconducting Maglev System as well as newly constructing infrastructure, renewing infrastructure, and renovating existing infrastructure related to the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. In order to ensure infrastructure quality and train and secure skilled workers in the construction industry over the medium and long term, the Japanese government has revised three labor-related laws*1 in conjunction, including the Quality Assurance Act*2, which is fundamental to public works projects. As a consequence, private-sector companies have introduced and utilized a diverse array of bidding contract systems allowing diverse types of order placements. *1 The Act on Promoting Quality Assurance in Public Works, the Act for Promoting Proper Tendering and Contracting for Public Works, and the Construction Business Act *2 The Act on Promoting Quality Assurance in Public Works Business Among abundant projects, Obayashi aims to receive orders from projects in our areas of strength, such as advanced technologies, new infrastructure construction, infrastructure renovation, disaster Strategies prevention and mitigation measures, and energy-related fields. We are pressing the limits of project execution capacity due to shortages of human resources, both in-house engineers and skilled workers at our subcontractors. We therefore aim to secure production capacity by improving productivity and increasing the number of skilled workers, while proposing and implementing measures to ensure a sufficient labor supply in the construction ­industry in the future. Moreover, we will respond to the needs of our customers by strengthening proposal-based ­marketing, mainly focused on our proprietary technologies, and aiming to develop competitive new technologies. 19 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 To Contents p3–6 p7–12 p13–36 p37–62 p63–66 p67–109 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR Corporate Governance Corporate Data Priority Measures ■ Shorten construction periods and reduce labor to improve productivity at construction sites • Use photos taken from drones to manage soil volume, use ICT in heavy machinery • Implement the use of precast structures • Regularly deploy Construction Information Modeling (CIM) • Promote wearable robots and further expand use of tablets TOPICS This award recognizes outstanding individuals and orgaWave-breaking blocks made with High Durable Concrete with Seawater nizations chosen from a broad range of people that High Durable support manufacturing, production, and traditional Concrete with culture, in order to pass along and advance methods of Seawater Wins production that have contributed to the formation of the 6th abundant lifestyles for citizens. “Monodzukuri High Durable Concrete with Seawater is a concrete that uses seawater instead of fresh water.

Then, full-face excavation resumes until the end of the tunnel is reached. Our Solution Tunnels Passing Diagonally through Steep Inclines The outbound lane of Inagi Tunnel (717 m) in Shinshiro City, Aichi ­Prefecture, passes diagonally through a steep incline. To overcome this geological condition, we used the “side wall pilot heading excavation method.” A small cross-section pilot tunnel was dug first to minimize the earth pressure. Next, earth was mounded up until the pressure effect on both sides of the exit became even, and then the full-face excavation was completed to the end of the tunnel. This method contributed to a safe completion of the tunnel. (See the pictures above). Safely Carrying Debris from a Tunnel with an Outside Conveyor Belt We initially planned to carry out approximately 110,000 m3 of debris in 30,000 dump-truck loads carried along narrow roads with steep inclines from the Inagi Tunnel. However, since tunnel excavation ­coincided with the construction of a nearby bridge, the possibility of contact accidents occurring from the large number of vehicles and workers passing along the road remained. As a solution, we built a 300-square-meter surface belt conveyor passing over a valley to carry out most of the debris without using dump trucks, thereby preventing accidents on the road. The “zero accident and zero injury” record of the Inagi Tunnel project was recognized with the Labour Minister’s Awards to excellent workplaces, organizations and persons who contributed to occupational safety and health, in FY2016.

We contribute to the development of countries and regions through the upgrading of infrastructure and the global reach of our environmental technologies. Business In tandem with economic development, especially in emerging countries, environmental problems, urbanization, and energy shortages have become more serious issues, prompting increased demand Environment for infrastructure that will provide safety, security and comfort for society. Investment in infrastructure and other construction is projected to expand in the regions where the Obayashi Group conducts business, including Southeast Asia, North America, and Oceania. Business From the standpoint of selection and concentration of management resources and risk management, our policy is to focus on areas such as Southeast Asia, North America, and Oceania, where legal Strategies systems, business practices and socio-economic infrastructure have been established to a certain extent, and political and security risks are relatively small. Business development with strong roots in each country and region is key to growth in the ­overseas construction business. We have had a constant presence in Southeast Asia for more than 40 years, and we are forming local networks in each country. Looking ahead, we will localize operations further at our overseas affiliates by assigning locally hired staff to administrative and management positions and training personnel as candidates for core positions. We will also conduct technical training at Obayashi and transferring technology to local affiliates through personnel exchanges, and expanding sales to non-Japanese global corporations and leading local companies. In North America in 1979, we became the first Japanese construction company to win an order for a public works project in the U.S. Since then, Obayashi has been in charge of many tunnel and bridge construction projects that require a high level of technological capability. Group companies are also developing business in North America. In 1989, E.W. Howell Co., LLC joined the Obayashi Group, followed by Webcor, LP in 2007, Kenaidan Group Ltd. in 2011, and Kraemer North America, LLC, an expert in bridge construction with an extensive track record, in 2014.

Obayashi will contribute to the creation of attractive communities by proactively ­participating in redevelopment projects and joint development projects. Business Urban infrastructure renovation and development projects are underway, especially in the Tokyo metropolitan area, as many buildings constructed during Japan’s strong economic growth period are Environment due for renewal and Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games are approaching in 2020. Creating internationally competitive cities and developing international business centers have become urgent priorities following a recent upturn in business related to inbound tourism, as well as in the private sector, and there is a need for urban revitalization and redevelopment projects deploying National Strategic Special Zones and other mechanisms by the government. In these circumstances, conditions in the leasing market have steadily improved over the past few years. Amid robust demand for office space, vacancy rates have remained at low levels for A-grade office buildings in central Tokyo locations. However, market growth looks likely to taper off in light of a large supply of office space poised to come onto the market from 2018 through 2019. Business We aim to further reinforce the stable earnings foundation of the office leasing business, an earnings pillar in the real estate development business, by investing more in the key area of central Tokyo. In Strategies areas of the leasing market, in which we are competitive, we plan to develop and acquire new revenue-­ generating properties and proactively participate as a business partner in large-scale redevelopment and joint development projects. For office buildings that we already own, we will systematically ­shuffle our properties and execute projects to increase value, such as renovation and BCP projects, while working hard to improve the level of ­satisfaction of tenants and other users of our properties. Through these measures, we will hone the competitiveness and earnings potential of our properties. In the housing business, we continue to sell detached housing and condominiums located in the Tokyo metropolitan area and major cities in the Kansai region, mainly through Obayashi-­Shinseiwa Real Estate Corporation, a major group company. We also continue to develop new rental housing as part of our efforts to diversify our portfolio in leasing operations. The Obayashi Group will evolve its business structure to adapt flexibly to changes in the business environment. 27 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 To Contents p3–6 p7–12 p13–36 p37–62 p63–66 p67–109 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR Corporate Governance Corporate Data Priority Measures ■ Form a high-quality leasing portfolio focused on key areas (central Tokyo) Develop and acquire new revenue-generating properties, participate in redevelopment and joint development projects, systematically add value to properties ■ Stabilize earnings and diversify the leasing portfolio Develop facilities for the leasing business other than office buildings, such as rental housing and logistics facilities ■ Get involved in urban infrastructure renovation projects, promote the creation of secure and safe communities and the revitalization of regions Participate in large-scale development projects and urban redevelopment projects ■ Apply the latest construction technologies in the development stage Increase customer satisfaction by providing ideal solutions, including for energy conservation and BCPs Ongoing Projects Exterior image B3 floor cutaway space image NIPPON LIFE Location: Minato City, Tokyo Uses: Offices, stores, conferences, parking HAMAMATSU­ Scale/structure: Site area: 7,646.56 m2 CHO CREA Floor area:99,277.09 m2 TOWER Steel frame, steel-reinforced concrete construction Hybrid vibration control structure (combined use of brake damper and oil damper) 29 floors above ground, 3 floors below ground, 1 penthouse floor Project owner: Nippon Life Insurance Company, OBAYASHI CORPORATION Construction to be completed: August 2018 (scheduled) Exterior image Image of the rooftop garden Kanda Station Location: Uses: Chiyoda City, Tokyo Offices, stores, parking Front Project Scale/structure: Site area: 1,054.80 m2 Floor area:8,168.04 m2 Steel frame construction (vibration control construction) 9 floors above ground, 1 floor below ground, 2 penthouse floors Project owner: Obayashi-Shinseiwa Real Estate Corporation Construction to be completed: August 2017 (scheduled) To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 28 BUSINESS OVERVIEW REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PROJECT REPORT Office Leasing Completion of oak meguro Business In March 2016, Obayashi completed construction on oak meguro, a new landmark building near Meguro Station. oak meguro is an office building with excellent safety features that support the BCP (business continuity planning) initiatives of tenants.

To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements OBAYASHI CORPORATION For the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the accounts maintained by OBAYASHI CORPORATION (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Companies”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial ­statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan. Certain amounts in the prior year’s financial statements were reclassified to conform to the changes made for the latest fiscal year. 2. U.S. Dollar Amounts The accounts of the consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen by rounding down to the nearest million. The U.S. dollar amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto were translated from the original Japanese yen into U.S. dollars on the basis of ¥112.68 to US$1, the rate of exchange prevailing at March 31, 2016, and were then rounded down to the nearest thousand. These U.S. dollar amounts are not intended to imply that the Japanese yen amounts have been or could be converted, realized or settled in U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (1) Scope of consolidation and application of the equity method The Company had 88 subsidiaries at March 31, 2016. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 included the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in all affiliates (27 companies for 2016) are accounted for by the equity method. (2) Business year for consolidated subsidiaries Certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (36 companies) and a domestic consolidated subsidiary (1 company) have a fiscal year that ends on December 31. The consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the financial statements as of the same date. Necessary adjustments for consolidation were made on significant transactions that took place during the period between the fiscal year-end of the subsidiaries and that of the Company. Kenaidan and its subsidiaries (4 companies) are consolidated for 10 months from March 1 to December 31 in the latest fiscal year, due to the change of their accounting periods. Consolidated subsidiaries other than those referred to above have the same business year as the Company, which ends on March 31. (3) Goodwill Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 5 years. However, goodwill that is not material is charged to income in the year of acquisition. Differences between the cost and underlying net equity of investments in affiliates accounted for by the equity method are charged or credited to income as they occur. (4) Foreign currency translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The balance sheet accounts of the foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments and non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. 77 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 To Contents p3–6 p7–12 p13–36 p37–62 p63–66 p67–109 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR Corporate Governance Corporate Data (5) Cash equivalents All highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are so near maturity that they represent only an insignificant risk of any change in value attributable to changes in interest rates, are considered cash equivalents. (6) Short-term investment securities and investment securities Securities are classified into two categories: held-to-maturity and other securities. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving ­average method. (7) Inventories Real estate held for sale, costs on uncompleted construction contracts, costs on real estate business, inventories for PFI and other projects and costs on other business are all stated at cost determined by the specific identification method. Raw materials and supplies are stated at cost determined by the first-in first-out method. The net book value of inventories in the balance sheet is written down if the net realizable value declines. (8) Property, plant and equipment The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries mainly calculate depreciation by the declining-balance method, while straight-line method is applied to the buildings, excluding building fixtures, acquired on or after April 1, 1998. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries mainly apply the straight-line method. The useful lives and residual values of depreciable assets are estimated mainly in accordance with the Corporate Tax Law. (9) Intangible assets Intangible fixed assets are amortized by the straight-line method. Computer software for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years. (10) Leased assets Depreciation of leased assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased assets to the lessee is calculated by the straight-line method over the lease period with a residual value of zero. (11) Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on the historical experience with respect to write-offs for the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and based on an estimate of the amount for specific uncollectible accounts for the Companies. (12) Provision for warranties for completed construction The provision for warranties for completed construction is provided to cover expenses for defects claimed concerning completed work, based on the estimated amount of compensation to be paid in the future for the work completed during the fiscal year. (13) Provision for loss on construction contracts The provision for loss on construction contracts is provided at the estimated amount for the future losses on contract backlog at the balance sheet date which will probably be incurred and which can be reasonably estimated. (14) Provision for stock payments for directors The provision for stock payments for directors is provided for stock award debt based on predetermined regulations for awarding stock, which is prepared for future awards of the Company shares to its directors and executive officers. (15) Provision for loss on real estate business and other The provision for loss on real estate business and other is provided for the estimated losses to be incurred in liquidating real estate and restructuring the real estate related business. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 78 (16) Provision for environmental measures The provision for environmental measures is provided based on an estimate of costs for disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) waste, which the Company and its domestic subsidiaries are obliged to dispose of by the Act on ­Special Measures Concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Waste. (17) Retirement benefits In calculating retirement benefits obligations, the benefit formula method is used to allocate expected retirement benefit payments in the period until the end of the current fiscal year. Actuarial differences are amortized commencing in the following year after the differences is recognized primarily by the straight-line method over periods (5 years to 10 years) which are shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees. Prior service cost (PSC) is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years which is shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees, while PSC of certain subsidiaries is expensed as incurred. (18) Derivatives and hedge accounting (a) Method of hedge accounting Hedging instruments are valued at fair value and accounted for using the deferral method of accounting. The monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, for which foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge the foreign currency fluctuations, are translated at the contracted rate if the foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for hedge accounting. The interest rate swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria, are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is charged to income (short-cut method). (b) Hedging instruments and hedged items To hedge foreign exchange risks related to the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and projected future foreign currency transactions, foreign exchange forward contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts are employed as hedging instruments. To hedge the interest-rate risks related to loans payable, interest rate swaps are employed as hedging instruments. (c) Hedging policy The Companies utilize derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of hedging future risks of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates in accordance with internal rules. (d) Assessment of hedge effectiveness Hedge effectiveness is not assessed when substantial terms and conditions of the hedging instruments and the hedged transactions are the same. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under the shortcut method. (19) Recognizing revenues and costs of construction contracts Revenues and costs of construction contracts of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is calculated at the cost incurred as a percentage of the estimated total cost. The completed-contract method continues to be applied for contracts for which the percentage of completion cannot be reliably estimated. Revenues from construction contracts and the related costs of the overseas subsidiaries are mainly recorded on the percentage-of-completion method. (20) Revenues and expenses associated with finance lease transactions Sales and cost of sales are recognized upon receipt of lease payment. (21) Consumption taxes Consumption tax and local consumption tax are accounted for under the tax-exclusive method. 79 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 To Contents p3–6 p7–12 p13–36 p37–62 p63–66 p67–109 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR Corporate Governance Corporate Data (22) Income taxes The Companies apply deferred tax accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of income taxes by the asset / liability method. Under the asset / liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. (23) Consolidated taxation system The Companies adopted the consolidated taxation system. 4. Change in Accounting Policies The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries adopted “Revised Accounting Standard for Business ­Combinations” (ASBJ Statement No. 21; hereinafter the “Business Combinations Accounting Standard”), “Revised Accounting Standard for Consolidated Financial Statements” (ASBJ Statement No. 22; hereinafter the “Consolidation Accounting Standard”), “Revised Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures” (ASBJ Statement No. 7; hereinafter the “Business Divestitures Accounting Standard”), “Revised Accounting Standard for Earnings Per Share” (ASBJ Statement No. 2), “Revised Guidance on Accounting Standard for Business Combinations and Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures” (ASBJ Guidance No. 10), “Revised Guidance on Accounting Standard for Earnings Per Share” (ASBJ Guidance No. 4) effective from April 1, 2015. As a result, the accounting method has been changed such that the difference associated with changes in equity in subsidiaries remaining under the control of the ­Company is recorded as capital surplus, and acquisition-related costs are recorded as expenses for the fiscal year in which the costs are incurred. For business combinations implemented on or after April 1, 2015, the accounting method has been changed to reflect the adjustments to the allocated amount of acquisition costs on the finalization of provisional accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements for the year containing the date of the business combinations. In addition, the presentation method of profit (loss) attributable to owners of parent was amended, the reference to “minority interest” was changed to “non-controlling interests,” and accounting treatment for adjustments to provisional amounts during measurement period was also changed. The Business Combinations Accounting Standard and other were applied on or after April 1, 2015, in accordance with the transitional treatment as prescribed in article 58-2 (4) of the Business Combinations Accounting Standard, article 44-5 (4) of the Consolidation Accounting Standard and article 57-4 (4) of the Business Divestitures ­Accounting Standard. The revised accounting policies above have minor effect on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2016. 5. Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective “Revised Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets” (ASBJ Guidance No. 26 of March 28, 2016) (1) Overview Regarding the treatment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, a review was conducted following the framework of Japanese Institution of Certified Public Accountants Audit Committee Report No. 66 “Audit Treatment on Determining the Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets,” whereby companies are categorized into five categories and deferred tax assets are calculated based on each of these categories. (a) Treatment of companies that do not satisfy any of the category requirements for (Category 1) through (Category 5) (b) Category requirements for (Category 2) and (Category 3) (c) Treatment related to future deductible temporary differences which cannot be scheduled in companies that qualify as (Category 2) (d) Treatment related to the reasonable estimable period of future pre-adjusted taxable income in companies that qualify as (Category 3) (e) Treatment in cases that companies that satisfy the category requirements for (Category 4) but qualify as (Category 2) or (Category 3) To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 80 (2) Scheduled date of adoption The Company expects to adopt the revised implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.

Additional Information Performance-linked stock compensation plan for directors and executive officers (1) Transaction summary The Company introduced a performance-linked stock compensation plan as an incentive plan for its directors and executive officers (the “Directors”) from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. The plan is highly transparent and objective and closely linked with the Company’s performance for the Directors, with the goal of increasing awareness of the importance of contributing to further enhancing the corporate value and performance over the medium-to-long-term.

Financial Instruments (1) Overview (a) Policy for financial instruments The Companies raise funds by borrowing from banks and issuing commercial paper or corporate bonds. Also, the Companies restrict temporary excess fund management to highly secure assets, time deposits and other short-term investments. The Companies use derivatives in order to avoid the risks, fluctuations of particular assets and liabilities, and fluctuations of interest rates. The Companies do not use derivative transactions to gain short-term profits or for speculative purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments related risks and risk management “Notes receivable, accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other,” “Electronically recorded monetary claims” and “Accounts receivable-other,” which are operating receivables, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. In order to mitigate the risk when orders are received, the Companies conduct a strict screening and determine project plans so that potential risks are minimized. Short-term investment securities and investment securities mainly consist of stocks. While short-term investment securities and investment securities are exposed to market risk, the Companies monitor market prices of these securities. “Notes payable, accounts payable for construction contracts and other,” “Electronically recorded obligations” and “Deposits received,” which are operating liabilities, are due within one year. 87 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2016 To Contents p3–6 p7–12 p13–36 p37–62 p63–66 p67–109 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR Corporate Governance Corporate Data “Short-term loans payable,” “Long-term loans payable,” “Commercial paper” and “Bonds payable” are used for operations or capital investment. “Nonrecourse loans” are used for enterprise funds related to particular PFI projects and other. The floating rate loans are exposed to fluctuation in interest rates. In order to hedge against the interest rate risks and fix the payment of interest, the Companies utilize derivative transactions (interest rate swaps) for each contract of certain long-term loans payable. Regarding the evaluation of hedge effectiveness, it is omitted by the judgement of the short-cut method because the interest rate swaps meet the certain criteria under the short-cut method. The transactions of derivative financial instruments are carried out in accordance with the Companies’ internal rules, and the status of the transactions is reported regularly to the Board of Directors. The Companies trade derivative transactions with major financial institutions and therefore consider there is no credit risk underlying those transactions. While operating debt and borrowings are exposed to liquidity risk, the Companies manage the risk mainly by preparing quarterly and monthly cash management plans. (c) Supplementary explanation of fair values of financial instruments Notional amounts of derivative transactions, disclosed in “(2) Fair value of financial instruments,” do not indicate market risk in derivative transactions. (2) Fair value of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying values and fair values of financial instruments as of March 31, and any ­differences.

Note 1. Method to determine the fair values of financial instruments, and other information related to marketable securities and derivatives Assets Cash and deposits Since deposits are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Notes and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other and Electronically recorded ­monetary claims The carrying value of the items that will be settled within a year approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. The items that will be settled later than a year are determined based on the present value of carrying value, grouped by term of settlement, discounted at an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of those and credit risk. Short-term investment securities and investment securities The fair value of stocks is determined based on quoted market price and the fair value of debt securities is ­determined based on either quoted market price or prices provided by financial institutions making markets in these securities. Information on securities classified by holding purpose is disclosed in Note 12 “Securities.” Accounts receivable—other Since “Accounts receivable—other” is settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable for construction contracts and other, Electronically recorded obligations, Shortterm loans payable, Current portion of nonrecourse loans, Commercial papers, Current portion of bonds and Deposits received Since these accounts are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value.

Long-term loans payable and Nonrecourse loans For fixed rate loans, the fair value is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into. For floating rate loans, since the market interest rate is reflected in the interest rate set within a short period of time, the carrying value is the same as the fair value. The fair value of loans qualifying for special hedge accounting treatment of interest rate swaps is based on the present value of the total principal and interest hedged by interest rate swaps, which is discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into.

The Companies therefore have five reportable segments: “domestic building construction,” “overseas building ­construction,” “domestic civil engineering,” “overseas civil engineering” and “real estate.” The overview of each reportable segment is as follows: Domestic building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses within Japan Overseas building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses outside Japan Domestic civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related businesses within Japan Overseas civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related businesses ­outside Japan Real estate: Purchase, sale and rent of real estate properties, development of land parcels and related businesses (b) Accounting treatment for net sales, income (loss), assets, liabilities and others by each segment The accounting methods of the segment are substantially the same as those described in “3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Segment performance is evaluated based on operating income or loss. Intersegment sales are recorded at the same prices used in transactions with third parties.
