Ban Ki-moon Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA 29th January 2016 Statement of continued support by the Chief Executive Officer Dear Mr. Secretary-General, Auxel FTG has been a member Global Compact since 2009; we support the ten principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. With this communication, we express our intent to continue to advance those principles within our sphere of influence. Being a dynamic forward moving company and as a principal supplier to many manufacturers with strong links to green energy, it is vital to us that we not only respect the legal requirements that we are bound to, but that we also set an example ourselves by showing we are preoccupied by our impact on the environment, our employees welfare, our suppliers and our commitment to be fair in all our business transactions. We are committed to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our group, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. Auxel FTG will make a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders, employees and the general public. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress within one year of joining the Global Compact, and annually thereafter according to the Global Compact COP policy.
