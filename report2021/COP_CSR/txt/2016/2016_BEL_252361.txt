OUR COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT July 11, 2016 © 2016 – ipc.be ABOUT INTERNATIONAL POST CORPORATION International Post Corporation (IPC) is the partner company of the global postal industry. We are a cooperative association of 24 member postal operators in Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. Now more than 25 years IPC has provided industry leadership by driving service quality and interoperability, supporting its members to ensure the high performance of international mail, packet and parcel services and developing the IT infrastructure required to achieve this. IPC engages in industry research, creates business-critical intelligence, provides a range of platforms for member post CEOs and senior management to exchange best practices and discuss strategy, and gives its members an authoritative, independent and collective voice. IPC also manages the system for incentive-based payments between postal operators. Members account for 2 million jobs and deliver some 80% of global postal mail. IPC is based in Brussels, Belgium and has an international staff of 70, representing more than 20 different nationalities. IPC is governed by a board comprised of CEOs from eleven member posts and the IPC Chief Executive Officer. IPC MEMBERS © 2016 – ipc.be 2 STATEMENT OF SUPPORT IPC became a signatory company of the UN Global Compact in 2009. We have fully embraced the ten universal principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption and regularly report on our performance. IPC is committed to incorporating the ten principles in both our efforts with members and in our own operations. In particular, we facilitate the management and reduction of members’ carbon emissions, and provide a platform for best practice sharing on broader sustainability objectives, through our Environmental Measurement and Monitoring System (EMMS). As part of this programme we encourage and support members to also become signatories of the Global Compact. In 2014, the total number of EMMS participants reporting their endorsement stood at 15 – a significant increase from the 6 reported in 2008. Further details of recent EMMS actions can be found in the rest of this document and also in our annual Sustainability Report, available on our website. As a growing employer and expanding business, we are also firmly committed to practicing these principles with respect to our employees, environment, operations and local communities. This is demonstrated by our internal policies and reports on our operational impact, such as our annual carbon emissions and offsetting efforts. CEO STATEMENT Sustainability is a strategic choice for posts; therefore IPC remains a strong supporter of the Global Compact’s ten principles. Through the IPC Environmental Measurement and Monitoring System programme, postal operators from Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Africa, have demonstrated how postal services can contribute to a more sustainable future and how sustainability can drive new business models. Building on their main strength – the proximity to the households – they are uniquely placed to play an essential role towards society.

We endeavour to continually improve our performance, prevent pollution wherever possible and comply with all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards. Our commitment applies to our own operations, our field of influence and our work with our members. In particular we:  Manage our processes so as to avoid or minimise waste  Work to minimise our use of energy  Minimise unnecessary travelling to reduce the impact of aircraft and road vehicle emissions  Encourage the use of relatively low-carbon emissions engines  Include environmental considerations in investment decisions, and  Ensure all employees have an awareness of this policy so that it is implemented effectively. A brief description of our processes and systems We translate our commitment into action by undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility and by assisting our members to manage their own responsibilities in this respect. We do so using the following processes and systems: In our own operations  Environment Policy (as part of our overarching Corporate Responsibility Policy)  Employee Handbook, which includes the policy (Details of our engagement with members are considered under Principle 8). Recent actions  After continuous annual decreases since 2008, between 2014 and 2015, IPC’s carbon emissions increased from 635 tonnes to 704 tonnes. Over half (57%) of these emissions were caused by business air travel and just under 36% by road travel (business and commuting). The remaining 7% were caused by heating, paper usage etc.  For the eighth consecutive year, IPC partnered with the Climate Neutral Group to compensate our carbon emissions. The last six years of emissions have been fully offset with Gold Standard credits from Cookstove projects in Africa. In 2015, credits were used from the Cookstove Project in Uganda. This project has a positive impact on both climate and local communities. By replacing © 2016 – ipc.be 11 traditional cooking with fuel efficient stoves, carbon emissions are reduced and carbon credits generated. In addition, this project allows households in Uganda to cut fuel bills by over a third, and therefore makes a significant contribution to poverty alleviation in the region. For further details on the project see: https://www.climateneutralgroup.com/en/climate-projects/efficient-cookstoves-inuganda/  IPC also offset its GHG emissions for the year 2014 in association with the UNFCCC’s Climate Neutral Now initiative using UN Certified Emissions Reductions.  Printing paper is 100% Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and EU Ecolabel certified. Reductions in our paper use are driven through continued implementation of a minimal printing policy and – unless there are good and pressing reasons – IPC encourages the printing of documents in black and white and on double-sided paper only.  Continued provision of recycling facilities in our communal areas so that employees can recycle glass, cardboard and plastic.  Continued use of environmentally friendly printing, IT and lighting technology on a replacement basis.  Continued emphasis on the use of teleconferencing and remote presentation technologies (e.g. WebEx and webinar techniques) to help reduce business travel.  Continued selection (in collaboration with our IT supplier) of additional desktop PC’s (and other relevant equipment) on the basis of their performance / energy efficiency in order to accommodate growing employee numbers. © 2016 – ipc.be 12 PRINCIPLE 8 INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Our commitment or policy In 2008, IPC developed the Environmental Measurement and Monitoring System (EMMS) in direct response to requests from CEOs working throughout the postal industry. EMMS participants collectively employ around 1.8 million staff across the globe at over 100,000 facilities, with well over half a million delivery and transport vehicles. Through fuel combustion, the energy used to heat and cool buildings, and several other energy sources, these companies release significant volumes of CO2 into the atmosphere. The EMMS systematically addresses global climate change across the sector by improving carbon management proficiency and performance. This is achieved through the provision of a common reporting structure for posts to disclose their strategies, achievements and emissions, and by facilitating forums for sharing best practice. Following a pilot in 2008, the full programme was rolled out in 2009 with the first data collected and progress measured for the 2008 calendar and financial reporting year. Participants set themselves two targets to reach by 2020 from this benchmark year:  To achieve a score of at least 90% in carbon management proficiency  To reduce combined Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions by 20%. Participants successfully achieved the 20% emissions reduction target in 2014, six years ahead of schedule. Recognising participants’ continuous improvement in carbon efficiency, this year IPC introduced a new target for the group:  To achieve a 20% reduction in carbon emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3 – outsourced transport) per letter mail and per parcel by 2025, from a 2013 baseline. The EMMS programme represents one of the few, if not the only, global sector-wide initiatives that commits to reducing carbon emissions to a specified amount by a given date and reports publically on its progress towards achieving these goals. All of our Sustainability Reports are available on the IPC website. Furthermore, IPC’s new delivery efficiency target has been approved as a sectoral benchmark by the Science Based Targets (SBT) Technical Review and Steering Committee, placing us within a group of only 17 organisations globally to have successfully developed a science based target. Our 20% efficiency improvement target therefore ensures that our targeted emission reductions are in line with the reductions that are required to meet the IPCC’s recommended goal of limiting global warming to 2°C. A brief description of our processes and systems In line with the programme’s separate carbon management proficiency and emissions reduction targets, the annual EMMS process requires individual participants to:  Complete a comprehensive questionnaire on their carbon management proficiency (CMP). This considers ten areas, such as principles and standards, and value chain management. © 2016 – ipc.be 13  Report quantitative data to enable the calculation of a suite of Carbon Performance Indicators (CPI) across five categories: Overall Sector Indicators, Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 and Activity Indicators. Multiple measures are in place to ensure data consistency and accuracy. Participants are encouraged to use our calculator tool for CPI reporting and are provided with detailed guidance documents for reference for both the CMP and CPI sections. These are aligned with the requirements of international best practice standards including ISO 14001, ISO 14064, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Dow Jones Sustainability Index, FTSE4Good, and current best practice as used by members of the Carbon Disclosure Project and the US Climate Registry. The final results are subject to review by IPC and Verisk Maplecroft, an independent global risks analytics and advisory firm. Our external accountant, PricewaterhouseCoopers, reviews the key sector indicators each year. Limited assurance for Scope 3 emissions has also been provided since 2011. Figure 1 © 2016 – ipc.be 14 Figure 2 © 2016 – ipc.be 15 Figure 3 © 2016 – ipc.be 16 Recent actions  Under IPC’s EMMS, postal companies successfully achieved the 20% emissions reduction target in 2014, six years ahead of schedule. The EMMS group collectively reduced CO2 emissions by over 1.8 million tonnes, equivalent to a decrease of 20.6%, between 2008 and 2014.  Having achieved our 2020 reduction target for total volumes of carbon emissions, IPC introduced a new target for the EMMS programme to reduce total carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3 – outsourced transport) per letter mail and per parcel by 20% by 2025, from a 2013 baseline. IPC’s new target places greater emphasis on efficiency, and has been approved as a sectoral benchmark by the Science Based Targets (SBT) Technical Review and Steering Committee.  Collaboration and best-practice sharing continues to be one of the corner stones of the EMMS programme, which has become a platform bridging the gap between developed and developing countries and which has engaged posts from across the globe. IPC hosted a two-day sustainability workshop in June 2015 attended by 14 posts from Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America. Workshops are also held with participants on an individual basis; in February 2015 IPC held workshops with both Australia Post in Melbourne, and also New Zealand Post in Wellington.  As part of this process of continuous improvement, IPC is now encouraging EMMS participants to address their Scope 3 emissions. Although we do see sub-contractors as having primary responsibility for their carbon emissions, we accept that participants have an influence on this section of the value chain and should not be achieving Scope 1 reductions at the expense of increasing the impact of Scope 3 through outsourcing and sub-contraction. To this end, since 2013 we have reported on Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions combined, and have this year introduced a new delivery efficiency target focussing on emissions reductions from all three scopes.  Following the first IPC Drivers’ Challenge in 2012, seven posts competed in the second competition hosted by An Post in Dublin, Ireland in 2013. In March this year (2015) the third challenge was successfully held – under arctic conditions – in Lapland, Finland. This international competition aims to raise awareness of the impact of eco-driving on CO2 emissions. Participating teams were challenged to demonstrate their eco-driving, customer service and safe driving skills. © 2016 – ipc.be 17 PRINCIPLE 9 ENCOURAGE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGY Our commitment or policy As part of our EMMS programme, we actively encourage our members to make increasing use of alternative-fuel capable vehicles in their delivery fleets. This includes electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles, vehicles that run exclusively on biofuels or that that run on LPG and CNG. It excludes vehicles that run on bio/mineral fuel mixes that are below the nationally agreed minimum content of bio/mineral fuel. IPC participants are also required to provide their energy usage data for renewable electricity purchased (‘green’ electricity). A brief description of our processes and systems IPC has developed the EMMS system to drive improvements in our members’ environmental performance. A summary of this system can be found under Principle 8 above. Recent actions  The EMMS system measures the percentage of alternative-fuel vehicles within each of our members’ delivery fleets. We publish performance figures and case studies in our sustainability report to encourage increased uptake. In 2014, alternative-fuel vehicles made up 13% of total reported vehicles, representing an impressive increase from the 10% recorded in 2008. We see no change in the number of E85 (ethanol fuel blend) models between 2013 and 2014, however the number of electric vehicles reported has increased by almost 3,000, and now accounts for almost 30% of all alternative-fuel vehicles / alternative-fuel-capable vehicles (2013: 26%).  In 2014 four EMMS participants solely used renewable electricity, while 20 participants (95%) reported purchasing or generating some form of green electricity in their CMP Questionnaire.  The percentage of green electricity as a proportion of total electricity consumption within the group was 16% in 2014 (2013: 16%).  As part of its company car policy, IPC incentivises its employees to opt for a greener car in order to limit IPC’s carbon footprint. IPC also provides its employees with eco-driving advice in order to limit fuel consumption. Also the purchase of bicycles (especially the folding bike) by employees via the company has been very successful. © 2016 – ipc.be 18 PRINCIPLE 10 WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL OF ITS FORMS Our commitment or policy IPC is committed to working transparently and is against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. No employee or associate will take or receive bribes of any form, or involve themselves in situations that may give rise to any potential conflicts of interest. Our commitment means that we will not only abide by all applicable laws in this respect, but will act in the spirit in which they were made. Our commitment applies to our own operations, our field of influence and our work with our members. A brief description of our processes and systems We put our commitment into practice by taking a transparent approach towards doing business, by opposing corruption in all its forms and by helping our members manage their own responsibilities in this respect. We do so using the following processes and systems: In our own operations  Statements regarding ethical standards, conflicts of interest and the giving/receipt of gifts, within the Employee Handbook.  During the course, and during the suspension of his/her employment, the employee will not, without prior written agreement of the company, accept or engage in any other professional activity, remunerated or not, for his/her own account or for third parties (as an employee or as selfemployed).  Whenever facts or circumstances which might indicate a potential conflict of interest are known to any director, officer or employee, such facts or circumstances shall be reported through normal channels to the Director, Finance and Human Resources.  Officers and employees shall not solicit, accept or agree to accept, at any time of the year, for themselves or on behalf of IPC, any gift without notification to their functional Director.  There is an absolute prohibition on IPC making a political contribution to any state, federal or local election campaign. No such contribution, whether by cash or otherwise, may be made by or in the name of IPC or be reimbursed by IPC. Anti-bribery policy:  Ensuring compliance with anti-bribery laws, rules and regulations, not just within Belgium, but also in any other country within which the IPC may carry out its business or in relation to which its business may be connected  Enabling employees and persons associated with the IPC to understand risks associated with unlawful conduct and to enable and encourage them to be vigilant and to effectively recognise prevent, avoid and report any wrongdoing, whether by themselves or others. © 2016 – ipc.be 19  Providing suitable and secure reporting and communication channels and ensuring that any information that is reported is properly and effectively dealt with  Creating and maintaining a rigorous and effective framework for dealing with any suspected instances of bribery or other unethical conduct © 2016 – ipc.be 20
