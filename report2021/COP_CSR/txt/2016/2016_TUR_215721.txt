At Yüksel İnşaat, Vice President Bülent Güngör is responsible for Environmental and Social Impacts. Sustainability, which is a fundamental aspect of our management approach, is a requirement not just for the construction sector but for all sectors. This is why Yüksel is involved in the UNGC Turkey Local Network Board and working actively to spread the concept of corporate responsibility. Energy Efficiency The amount of renewable and nonrenewable fuel that Yüksel consumed in 2014 in the Headquarters, Ankara Machine Supply Directorate (Kazan) and its construction sites subject to inspection is as follows; CP CEI IIB SE GO BE EI ENI SI GRI 43 Diesel For the Generator 6.720 lt (A Block: 1.420 lt, B Block: 1.300 lt, F Block: 1.420 lt, (Headquarters Blocks A, B, F and Kazan) Kazan: 2.580 lt) Kazan 2.580 lt (for machines) Natural Gas F Block Kitchen 7.564 m³ For Central Heating (A, B, F 295.705 m³ Blocks and Kazan) Electricity Headquarters (A, B, F Blocks, 1.871.583 kWs Parking lot) and Kazan The calculation method for the above figures was the monthly receipts, invoices and slips. It was seen following the measurements taken in 2014 that the greatest energy consumption was due to shipments, energy use and flights. Work is underway for a savings plan for 2015. Periodic machinery repairs and maintenance also aim to conserve fuel. Moreover, the use of energy saving light bulbs has increased. Compared to the energy consumption in the previous year, some increase is seen due to climate change. CP CEI IIB SE GO BE EI ENI SI GRI 44 Carbon Footprint Management Yüksel views measurement as the most important step towards identifying the measures to be taken to prevent existing and potential adverse effects. Therefore, it collaborates with professional consultants to measure its carbon footprint, compares results with the previous year and carries out work to take decreasing measures. The comparative figures for the corporate carbon footprint for 2013 and 2014 are given below; 2013 2014 Comparative figures for corporate carbon footprint by activity (%) Emission Source Scope 2013 2014 ∆ Activity 1/2/3 t CO2e t CO2e % Energy 1-2-3 1.703,60 1.823,87 7,06 Transportation 1-3 144,25 134,37 -6,85 Business related travel 3 2.164,82 2.591,57 19,71 Hotel Accommodation 3 73,91 15,83 -78,58 Office Supplies and Wastes 3 34,94 15,71 -55,02 Other (Air Conditioner Gas, 1-3 917,86 724,73 -21,04 Cafeteria, Water) Shipping 3 5.391,65 2.902,84 -46,16 Mail 3 6,27 3,46 -44,82 Total 1-2-3 10.437,29 8.212,39 -21,32 CP CEI IIB SE GO BE EI ENI SI GRI 45 2014 Carbon Footprint Percentage Distribution Energy 0,04% Transportation 22,21% Business related travel 35,35% Hotel Accommodation 1,64% Office Supplies and Wastes 31,56% Other (Air Conditioner Gas, Cafeteria, Water) Shipping 8,82% Mail 0,19 0,19% 2014 Carbon Footprint Percentage Distribution Based on Yüksel İnşaat’s carbon footprint from 2013 and 2014, the greatest increase is seen in business related travel with 19.71% A decrease of 46.16% is seen from 2013 to 2014 in the carbon footprint resulting from shipping activities, which was Yüksel’s main carbon footprint source and currently remains as such. A decrease of 78.58% is seen in 2014 in the carbon footprint resulting from hotel accommodation compared to that in 2013. There is a 55.02% decrease in emissions resulting from office supplies and waste disposal. The emissions resulting from Yüksel’s third largest source of carbon emissions, energy consumption, an increase of 7% is seen from 2013 to 2014.

The report features Yüksel’s economic, social and environmental performance. Carbon Footprint Awareness (2010) In 2010, Yüksel began measuring its carbon footprint to decrease the environmental pollution resulting from its operations and enable the sustainable use of natural resources.
