TruTeq Wireless United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress March 2016 Statement by the Chief Executive Officer TruTeq Wireless has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2009. We joined the Compact because we believe that organizations have a responsibility to conduct business in an ethical way. The ten principles of the Global Compact offered a way of articulating this belief. It also offered a way to measure our progress and publish our commitment. We are pleased to report on progress made in following the ten principles. TruTeq remains fully committed to the United Nations Global Compact and look forward to the journey of continuous improvement. Tjaart van der Walt Human Rights Principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.
