HANSEN SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015/16 6 OPERATIONAL GOALS CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY NEW ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS Performance against the long-term target is well on track, as As part of the new sustainability strategy, Chr. Hansen Chr. Hansen has improved its CO2 performance by 16% since launched four new environmental targets for 2020. From the the base year. base year 2013/14, Chr. Hansen is aiming for: During 2015/16, Chr. Hansen extended its reporting to cover ⋅ 20% energy and water efficiency improvement greenhouse gas emissions from downstream transportation ⋅ 25% CO2 efficiency improvement under Scope 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. A project was ⋅ 40% of solid waste recycled launched to increase focus on the environmental footprint of our transportation. To support the new targets, the environmental organization was strengthened and a fully global approach to environmental Water efficiency is stable since last year with a 5% management adopted. Among other initiatives, this includes improvement compared to the base year 2013/14. new minimum global standards and systematic implementation of best practices. The percentage of solid waste recycled stayed just above 20, similar to last year’s performance. ENERGY, CO2, WATER AND WASTE Chr. Hansen strives to reduce the environmental footprint of OUTLOOK its operations and activities, and works systematically In 2016/17, Chr. Hansen will focus on developing a global throughout its value chain to promote responsible practices environmental standard and governance structure, and revise with respect to climate and the environment. the reporting requirements for environmental, health and safety data.

These precautionary initiatives allow the organization to capture and respond faster to any potential issues. 7. WASTE AND BY-PRODUCTS ACCOUNTING POLICIES Waste and by-products comprise wastewater, recycled Wastewater is measured after any on-site wastewater biomass and solid waste.

Of the remaining solid waste, 44% went to landfill, 32% was incinerated and 1% was disposed of as hazardous waste. * Total direct CO2e emissions and efficiency improvements in past years are not comparable to figures reported in previous sustainability reports due to adjusted scope, emission factors and calculation methodology. The adjustments are mainly based on the need to better align with the GHG Protocol and best practice for GHG emissions accounting. **The percentage of solid waste recycled has been adjusted due to a reporting error in 2014/15.
