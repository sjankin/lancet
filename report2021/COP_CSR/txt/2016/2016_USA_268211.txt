12 September 2016 Dear Stakeholders, UN Global Compact Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture became a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact in September 2012. In doing so, we made a commitment to supporting and implementing the ten principles of the United Nations in the four areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. We will continue to support these principles over the coming years and report annually on our progress. This document represents our 2016 Communication on Progress (COP) and is the means by which we inform our stakeholders about our efforts to implement the principles of the UN Global Compact. We are committed to sharing this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Yours sincerely Robert Forest FAIA, OAA, RIBA, LEED AP Partner Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture
