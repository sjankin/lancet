Martín Migoya Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO 1 About the report In this new Sustainability Report, we seek to raise greater awareness of what we do at Globant. The new business approach puts the emphasis on the person and how to simplify their interactions with brands through “seamless” digital journeys, i.e. intuitive, intelligent and comprehensive ones. In turn, the Sustainability Council in 2015 worked on the development of a strategic three-year plan that proposed a long-term vision for each of the issues related to Globant’s sustainability framework. This strategic plan is fully in line with the new direction taken by the company and is in the process of discussion with the Top Management. It should be noted that the sustainability framework was updated on the basis of dialogue with our stakeholders. In 2015, a study was conducted to understand the applicability of each of the issues for the industry globally, which led to rethink the priorities and relevant aspects of each one.

In addition, from Globant Labs -our internal laboratory of innovation and researchwere carried out more than 20 experimental projects, in which more than 180 Globers participated. Some of these projects were: Huellas is a mobile application for searching and finding lost pets Nova Astronomy Legacy Project is a Big Data project in which the instantly.

Is a site that aims to bring Globers together in different parts of the world who are interested in offering and receiving accommodation, or sharing an outing. The initiative arises from the need Globers have to be close to one another when traveling to other cities for work. 11 IFACTOR CONTEST – LOOKING FOR THE INTRAPRENEUR GENE By Leonardo Giovanetti | Globant Montevideo The ifactor. iFactor. That common factor that those who call themselves “entrepreneur” have. However, if they are not part of a large company, it is called e-factor. Being part of a large company and having an entrepreneur spirit is to have the best of both worlds: support for your ideas while they are born and developed, and a testing environment for your project. Of course, one could argue that not having the “fear” that characterizes a venture could be lethal. That “fear” is, in itself, the engine that moves an entrepreneur forward. However, in order to clarify this, being an intra-entrepreneur will not override that fear, it will transform it. Having ideas that can be applied in the company for which you work will help pave the way towards a better future. The company can implement your idea on its clients, and you can be the master of that success. In my case, I participated in the first edition of the “iFactor” competition presenting an idea with a colleague. We were finalists and were about to win a scholarship to study at Singularity University in California. Although the scholarship was awarded to other colleagues, who also presented an excellent idea, we learned and enjoyed the whole process.The intensive training week in Buenos Aires, coordinated by Endeavor Foundation was an amazing experience. Having shared this time with Globers from all over the world, becoming acquainted to their cultures and their entrepreneurial spirit was unique. That in itself was a huge prize, an opportunity were we clearly all won. 12 ?

Wearables & IoT ND ND 13 Integrity The main guardians of the values of the company and those who lead by example are the board and senior management; they put forward the organization’s style of functioning. They are continuously getting feedback from the various stakeholders (employees, suppliers, customers, investors, community) on their expectations and referring to social and ethical standards of the markets in which the company operates. They seek to promote understanding and compliance, taking specific measures to encourage good practices. This led to the generation and implementation of standards of conduct, policies and practices that guide the expected behaviors. These resulted in a Code of Ethics and a procedure to inform of actions against the Code of Ethics. CODE OF ETHICS: In 2015, we relaunched the Code of Ethics approved To establish an equal opportunity policy regarding employees. by the Board, in line with best corporate governance practices and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act1.

Ethics, a system to channel Globers’ potential complaints for actions that go against the code’s provisions has been established. Although, the company applies a philosophy of open and transparent organizational structure, it also provides a channel for complaints, or speak up system, managed by an external supplier, according to the requirements of regulatory compliance and in line with the best practices of business transparency and integrity. This channel allows users to report or make anonymous queries in In the last five years, we have not received any significant different languages and through different channels (email, phone or fine for breach regarding either our services or legislation. via webpage). The speak up channel is enabled 24/7, 365 days a year. We have neither received confirmed reports of corruption cases nor lawsuits. 15 Government / Management Structure ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY: Like all public companies, Globant adheres to the provisions of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Anti-Bribery Act, and complies Sustainability Council Committees with all the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which the company operates, through the issuing and approval of an Board anti-corruption policy by its Board.

Consequently, we went from being 3,775 Globers in early 2015 to 5,041 by the end of year. 17 TOWARDS A GLOBAL CULTURAL INTEGRATION Guillermo Willi | Chief People Officer In Globant, we have a very strong identity. A culture that represents us, makes us different, and adds value. From People Integration we intend to promote and encourage this culture taking care of each office’s local identity. We welcome the additions of new work teams, the opening of new offices and acquisitions of companies, always seeking to make transitions as smooth and harmonious as possible. We know that being part of a dynamic company such as Globant can be challenging at times, and so we always focus on the person, getting to know them quickly and identifying their talents to generate a sense of belonging. In addition, together with the rest of the team of Champions and Communications we generate cultural exchanges leveraging our geo-dispersion. We take advantage of being in many countries and cities to learn about different cultures, diversity of work and preferences. 18 Career development: Promoting talent In Globant, we are deeply committed to the professional growth of our As for external training, Globant promotes the completion of university people and we consider it a key factor for the company’s sustainable courses of studies. In this regard, for 2016, a reward policty was defined development. In 2015, more than 1000 Globers recategorized and with special benefits for those Globers who achieve their degree in a about 4000 Globers were trained worldwide. timely manner. As for continuous training, in 2015, Globant Academy was launched, a Another essential part of career development considered was feedback space where all training efforts are consolidated and formalized. It is management. Despite of having implemented performance evaluadivided into four schools (Technology, Leadership, Institutional and tions for all the Globers several years ago, we worked on improving the Languages). quality of feedback from people, increasing its frequency, promoting multidirectionality and creating new formats of recognition that serve as validators and motivational sources to Glober’s work. Globant Academy In that sense, we created MyFeedback, a tool to write comments of any Glober with whom one has worked. These feedbacks are taken into account when assessing re-categorizations.

Institutional School: Training on processes and internal areas to learn more about Globant. Language School: To support learning and practices of the most popular languages in the industry. 19 Work and Life integration Beyond the set of benefits that grow every year in the different offices, which are detailed below, one of the central concerns of the Rewards area in 2015 was to see the way in which we could simplify professional development to female Globers who had children. Moving forward, a series of proposals aimed at facilitating the integration between family life and professional life was analyzed. Finally, in November a Childcare program partially funded, for female Globers that had to return to work after their maternity leave was launched. This initiative thus added on the benefits of extended paternity and maternity leave and the flexibility and autonomy policy that already existed. The other priority of the area was to ensure Glober’s health. In this regard, in 2015, private health plans started to be offered in several countries where companies have no obligation of providing them, such as Chile and Mexico, and the replication of this benefit in Spain, Colombia and Uruguay is under discussion. Moreover, benefits such as having an in company physician and nutritionist remain in effect, as well as the vaccination campaign, the organization of Healthy Journeys and the provision of massage and fruit in the office.

For this reason, besides working with Globers, we focus on local communities, interact with the dynamic forces of society and commit ourselves to the needs from the place in which we stand as a technology company. 2015, was a year of continuity and growth in terms of our relationship with the community and private social investment made by the company. Both our management approach organized on the pillars of Education for Inclusion, Technology for the Community and Entrepreneurial Development as well as specific projects undertaken were deepened during the year. SIX YEARS OF IT EMPLOYABILITY. The training program on manual testing of applications, which aims at employability for young people in vulnerable situations, completed its sixth consecutive year reaching more than 300 people and developing its first edition in a shantytown in Bajo Flores neighborhood, Buenos Aires. In partnership with the social company Arbusta, we conducted courses at a shantytown called Villa 1.11.14 and on the outskirts of the city of Rosario, with the lowest dropout rate since the creation of the program. 24 TEACHER’S CLUB PROGRAM This is the “umbrella” corporate volunteering program, which brings together all the initiatives, in which we offer Globers a space to share their knowledge with the community. The program objectives are twofold: on the one hand, to make the IT world known, its possibilities and Globers’ experiences / testimonies to community’s youngsters without prior knowledge. On the other hand, providing a space to Globers where they can share with the community their knowledge, experience and testimonials. The formats developed during 2015 were four: The Hour of Code (event which seeks to teach programming in an hour to people between 4 and 104 years old); Inspirational Workshops (workshops in which Globers that do not want to teach programming can share their knowledge and experience in an inspiring manner); Globers for a Day (visits by young people to the company, where being a Glober for a day is experienced) and mentoring (by which Globers accompany students, entrepreneurs and teachers advising and supporting them for one year). 25 The ISTIC had set itself the goal to substantially increase its impact across the south of the city of Buenos Aries and Greater Buenos Aires, reaching more than 300 schools with vulnerable contexts in the area, in order to encourage young people going through the last years to continue their tertiary studies in Systems. DANE PROJECT In 2015, we continued to support DANE project, from which we develop applications for children and youth with special needs. For this, the Institute decided to undertake the conversion of the whole educational plan, in order to align its syllabus with what the technology While continuing to maintain and refine the applications carried out in industry needs. Therefore, they contacted Globant and suggested the previous years, in 2015, we actively collaborated in partnership with possibility of carrying out this challenge together. Furthermore, several Asociacion Argentina de Padres de Autistas (APAdeA) in two initiatives work meetings among the school authorities, teachers and some that facilitate the personal development of children with Autism SpecGlobant specialists in the area of Technology were held, which led to trum Disorders. define the methodology and work framework for 2016. From this interesting experience and as of 2016, we are planning to replicate this idea with several institutions in the different cities where we operate around the world. NEW MODELS OF COLLABORATION ISTIC CASE. Several organizations were interested in forging alliances with Globant to carry out joint projects during 2015. Many of them linked to the educational field, seeking the way to bring closer the academic world and graduates to the IT work world. One of the most interesting cases of collaboration was the one developed with Instituto Tecnologico Inmaculada Concepcion (ISTIC) a state tertiary education establishment located in the neighborhood of Constitution, in the City of Buenos Aires. 26 Promoting industry In Globant, we seek to contribute to the overall growth of the entire IT industry through the organic growth the company enjoys, especially in the cities where we operate. For this reason, we face the promotion of the industry from three variables: Participation in business chambers and IT hubs, offering training and open talks, and encouraging entrepreneurship. In 2015, our participation in the sector’s chambers and hubs was very active. We held the vice presidency of Camara de Empresas de Software y Servicios Informaticos (CESSI), the presidency of Endeavor Foundation, and occupied a position of importance in Argencon, the International Association of Microsoft Channel Partners (IAMCP), Asociacion de Tecnologia de la Informacion y Comunicacion de Mar del Plata (ATICMA), Camara de Empresas del Polo Informatico de Tandil (CEPIT), Asociacion de Desarrolladores de Videojuegos de Argentina (ADVA), IT pole of Buenos Aires, Camara Uruguaya de Tecnologias de la Informacion (CUTI), Camara Argentina de Comercio Electronico (CACE) and Technological Pole of Bahia Blanca, among other local organizations. With regard to training, as noted above, Globant’s policy is to build local installed capacity: Young professionals in the community that can benefit the entire IT ecosystem. It is woth mentioning the series of 36 bootcamps implemented throughout the year in different cities of Latin American, in which we trained more than 300 young people in various technologies, and the design centers, where 45 youths received intensive training in web design, user experience, layout and more. 27 VOLUNTEERING GLOBERS TESTEAR IN NUMBERS 2013 2014 2015 TOTAL ( % of total payroll) STUDENTS TOTAL 70 52 55 318 2015 531 10.5% 2014 489 13.0% % OF COMPLETION 79% 81% 89% 82% 2013 318 9.8% TECNOLOGY FOR THE COMUNITY 2013 2014 2015 VOLUNTEERING ACTIONS IT PROJECTS 6 7 9 2015 33 2014 29 HOURS OF PRO BONO DEVELOPMENT 1366 5000 5670 2013 19 SOCIAL INVESTMENT PER COUNTRY 2014 2015 INCIDENCE IMPACT INCIDENCE IMPACT UNIVERSITIES ARGENTINA 100 VERY HIGH 100 VERY HIGH VISITS 2013 2014 2015 URUGUAY 30 LOW 40 AVERAGE 24 29 25 COLOMBIA 20 LOW 75 VERY HIGH No. OF VISITS 360 646 602 BRAZIL 20 LOW 40 AVERAGE PARTICIPANTS INDIA 20 LOW TOP MANAGEMENT PRO BONO HOURS 200 274 349 MEXICO 20 LOW PERU 10 LOW 10 LOW UNITED STATES 20 LOW 20 LOW Environmental awareness Searching the company’s growth without generating negative impacts A new efficient plant was built in the Head Office in Buenos on the communities in which we are is one of the guidelines to achieve Aires, which has energy-efficient led lights, shutdown timer and our purpose of being the best company in the world. automatic movement sensors, in addition to datacenters with low consumption and server virtualization.
