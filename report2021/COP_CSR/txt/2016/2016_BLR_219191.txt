Industry risks To mitigate and account for probable risk effects Metallurgic industry is distinguished by its in business-plans, the Company carries out multisusceptibility to cyclic variations of prices for raw variant calculations to identify projects’ financial materials and steel. Demand for steel is determined performance and efficiency indicators against various by country-specific levels of economic development variable factors (capital input amounts, product and consumption by major steel-consuming selling price, manufacturing costs, debt-to-equity industries.
