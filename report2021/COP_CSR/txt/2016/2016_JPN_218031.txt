In 2015 we celebrated the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Railroad Vehicle Equipment Business. In 2014, we became the first Japanese company to be certified by Bombardier Transportation as a global supplier of entrance systems for railroad vehicles. This global supplier certification qualifies us to automatically receive official requests for quotation from the company’s railroad business sector, which operates in 21 bases in 16 countries around the world. As a result of acquiring this certification, Nabtesco Oclap S.r.l, a Nabtesco Group company in Italy, received an order for cab doors for trains on the Cross Rail, the British urban railway line that will be opened at the end of 2018. Moreover, the company also received an order from Siemens AG for passenger doors for the fully automated unmanned trains that will be operated on the B Line of the Rennes Metro in France. Since becoming a Nabtesco Group company in 2013, Nabtesco Oclap S.r.l has contributed to the Group’s expansion of new business opportunities in Europe, and the Group will continue to expand its door system business around the globe. For over 40 years, Nabtesco has had a business partnership with Boeing, and recently was awarded a contract to supply flight control actuation systems for the aircraft manufacturer’s next-generation large jet, the 777X. The 777X is the latest model of the 777 series, with more than 1,000 airplanes belonging to the 777 family delivered by Boeing to its customers. The 777X will be Awarded a Contract to released on the market in 2020. Nabtesco has already been supplying actuation systems for four flight control surfaces on the current Boeing 777 series, and with the new agreeSupply Aircraft Equipment ment concluded for approximately 300 airplanes, our scope of work will expand to actuafor Boeing 777X tion systems for all eight flight control surfaces, including spoilers. We will contribute to the success of Boeing’s two major development programs, for the 777X and 737MAX for which we won a contract in 2013, thereby supporting the aircraft industry to achieve dynamic growth. We expect that participation in these programs will help us stably expand our business, including in after-market services, on a long-term basis. The Nabtesco Group is delivering products necessary for the establishment of social infrastructure that supports people’s daily lives, while conducting CSR* activities in the spirit of its corporate philosophy of, “The Nabtesco Group, with our unique motion control technology, will provide safety, comfort and a sense of security in daily lives as well as any form of transportation.” Promotion of CSR-Oriented In April 2014, we formulated the Nabtesco Group CSR-Oriented Procurement Policy to foster the fulfillment of CSR by the entire Group across its supply chain. Subsequently, Procurement and Participation in April 2014, we announced our support for and signed the United Nations Global in the UN Global Compact Compact. The Global Compact was proposed at the meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos in 1999, with more than 13,000 companies and organizations participating in this initiative and conducting activities in line with the ten Principles set in the four areas of “Human Rights,” “Labour Standards,” “Environment” and “Anti-Corruption.” As a participant in the Global Compact, we will make further efforts to foster CSRoriented management suitable for a global enterprise. *CSR: Corporate Social Responsibility Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 10 Top Message OUR VALUE Enhancing Product Development and Technological Strength for Value Creation, and Forging Trusting Relationships with Stakeholders President & CEO Kazuaki Kotani Looking Back on the Year Ended March 31, 2015 Results are For the year ended March 31, 2015 (fiscal 2014), the Nabtesco Group posted net sales of 219,657 generally favorable, million yen (up 8.6% year on year), operating income of 23,615 million yen (up 17.5%), ordinary with both sales and income of 27,193 million yen (up 12.2%), and net income of 17,746 million yen (up 18.5%). Both sales and profits exceeded numerical targets set at the beginning of the term, with the profits exceeding the results generally favorable. During the year, however, we felt rapid changes in the business numerical targets environment, although we achieved greater-than-expected growth in some business segments, set at the beginning growth was slower than planned in other segments. of the term In the Precision Equipment Segment, the market expanded, driven by the growth in demand for precision reduction gears for industrial robots. We made appropriate responses to meet this demand, as a result, both the amount of orders received and sales were increased. We also boosted profits by more than 30%, covering an increase in the cost of overseas procurement as a result of the weaker yen, by expanding sales and implementing production reforms. In the Transport Equipment Segment, the proactive expansion of the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) business greatly helped increase the amount of orders received and sales at a pace exceeding the market growth rate. Further, we achieved dramatic growth in the Marine Vessel Equipment Business due to the abundant volume of shipbuilders’ backlog and expansion of the MRO business. As a whole, operating profit for this segment was boosted by approximately 80%. 11 Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 Consolidated Sales by Operating Income and Business Segment (FY2014) Operating Income Margin (JPY million) (%) Precision Aircraft & 25,000 22,859 23,615 25 Equipment Hydraulic Equipment 20,212 ¥51.5 billion (23.5%) ¥47.8 billion (21.8%) 20,092 20,000 20 15,013 15,000 15 ¥ 219.6 10,000 11.9 11.5 9.9 10.8 10 billion 8.4 5,000 5 Transport Industrial Equipment Equipment 0 0 ¥61.3 billion (27.9%) ¥58.8 billion (26.8%) (FY) 2010 2011 Operating Income (left axis) 2012 2013 Operating Income Margin (right axis) 2014 In the Aircraft and Hydraulic Equipment Segment, however, the Hydraulic Equipment Business continued to be sluggish. In China, demand for construction machinery has not recovered, which led to declining operation rate of our local manufacturing facilities. The supply of key components from Japan to China also declined. As a result, we recorded decreases in both sales and profits in the business. We expanded the scale of business in the Industrial Equipment Segment through recent proactive M&A in the Automatic Doors Business—the core business of the segment. However, we posted a decrease in profit in this segment due to one-time M&A related cost and up-front IT investments in Europe and North America. For sales by region, actual sales exceeded to previous year for all the regions. In Asia, we faced difficulties in the Hydraulic Equipment Business in China as mentioned above, but thanks to the growth of the Railroad Vehicle Equipment, Marine Vessel Equipment and Precision Reduction Gears Businesses, we also posted a surplus in the country. In North America and Europe, success of the Precision Reduction Gears and Automatic Doors Businesses contributed to an increase in sales; particularly in the North American market, sales increased by more than 20% including the effect of the weaker yen in Aircraft Equipment Business. In short, I believe that our Group’s business portfolio management has led to overall favorable results. Progress in the Mid-Term Management Plan, “Think Global! Act Local! For the Second Decade” (Fiscal 2014 to 2016) Composition ratio of In the three-year Mid-Term Management Plan, “Think Global! Act Local! For the Second the business segments Decade,” we uphold “consolidated net sales of 280 billion yen ±5%” and “operating income of 34 would differ from billion yen” as our targets for the final year of the Plan. The sales results for the initial year indicate an increased possibility of achieving these targets; however, composition of ratio of the those initially planned, business segments making up the net sales and operating income will differ from those initially reflecting changes in planned, reflecting changes in the business environment. As for the net sales of 66 billion yen the business planned for the Precision Equipment Segment, the expanded sales of precision reduction gears environment for industrial robots will cover of the sales decrease of solar tracking equipments caused by drop-off of potential businesses resulting from the delay in launching the solar thermal generation plant. Also, decrease in the Aircraft and Hydraulic Equipment Segment will be covered by expansion of the Transport Equipment Segment. As a result, the configuration of the operating income would also substantially differ from the initial plan.

In particular, to take advantage of the Precision Reduction growth of the Chinese market where the needs for unmanned, automated operations are draGears Business and matically increasing, we will enhance the capacity of our manufacturing facilities in Japan reorganizing the during 2015 and launch a new production base in China in 2016, thereby building up a stable supply system to meet the expected increased mediumto long-term demand. In the fields Hydraulic Equipment other than industrial robots, we will promote the sales of new products in Europe and China with Business in China an eye to find new markets. The Hydraulic Equipment Business has been sluggish due to the stagnant Chinese construction machinery market, however, we will reorganize the business and seek to achieve a V-shaped recovery in and after 2016 by reducing related assets according to the extent of demand. Specifically, we will consolidate Jiangsu Nabtesco Hydraulic Co., Ltd., which we established jointly with Shanghai Electric Group for the production of hydraulic equipment, into Shanghai Nabtesco Hydraulic Co., Ltd., another hydraulic equipment production base in China, thereby downsizing the production facility. The land and facilities of Jiangsu Nabtesco Hydraulic will be taken over and effectively operated by Nabtesco (China) Precision Equipment Co., Ltd., a new company to be established as a new production base for precision reduction gears. In the Hydraulic Equipment Business, we also acquired Hyest Corporation on April 1, 2015 to broaden our product lineup in the business. In the future, we will release a new value-added hydraulic system into the market developed by fusing the technologies of the two companies. Expectations for Midto Long-Term Growth Demand will double in the In the civil aircraft field, the number of airplanes in operation is predicted to double over the first half of the 2020s in next 20 years. Nabtesco has cultivated a business partnership with Boeing for over 40 years, the Aircraft Equipment and in 2015 was chosen by the aircraft manufacturer to be a supplier of flight control actuation Business, and the systems for its next-generation large passenger aircraft 777X, which is slated for release in the Railroad Vehicle market in 2020. In addition, we have already won contracts to supply actuation systems for Boeing’s 737MAX in 2013 and the MRJ*1 of Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, both of which will be Equipment Business will released on the market in 2017. steadily expand into the Also, in the Railroad Vehicle Equipment Business, we made important progress for future European market growth. In December 2014, we were certified as a Japan’s first global supplier of doors for train 13 Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 cabs and cars by Bombardier, one of the three leading manufacturers of railroad vehicles in the world. Moreover, in April 2015, we forged an agreement with Siemens AG to supply passenger doors for subway cars to be operated in France. We will steadily expand our business in the European market through Nabtesco Oclap S.r.l., which operates in Italy. *1 MRJ: Mitsubishi Regional Jet Enhancing Product Development and Technological Strength for Value Creation Accelerating R&D in In this year, we spent a total of 15 billion yen for capital investment, M&A and R&D to achieve the field of advanced further growth, and for the next term (fiscal 2015, 12-month basis), we plan to double this technologies and amount to make growth investments totaling 30 billion yen. fostering innovation In R&D, we have been proactively conducting joint research with the overseas universities, in the production such as the University of Washington, the Technical University of Denmark, ETH Zurich*2. We have been fostering collaboration with these external research institutes to adopt a range of development process technologies and improve the product development process. We will accelerate R&D in the field of advanced technologies and foster innovation in the product development process with a view to enhancing our technological strength for value creation. For example, a resin 3D printer using stereolithography, which was developed by CMET Inc., a Nabtesco’s subsidiary, has been utilized in a product development process. Further, in July 2015, we started a project to develop next-generation products with the use of a metal 3D printer at the Nabtesco Digital Engineering Center, which was transferred from the Kobe Plant to our facility within the Kyoto Research Park. Thus a most-advanced basic structure has just been prepared and it will contribute to shorten the development period drastically. Nabtesco will take advantage of its product technologies, business diversity, and the relations of trust it has built up with customers over many years as its greatest strengths, and will further enhance its technological capabilities to provide customers with products that will lead to greater value creation. *2 ETH Zurich: Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich In Pursuing the Achievement of the Long-Term Vision Forging a trusting We are required to secure and develop excellent human resources as a means to build the relationships with both foundation of our businesses. We also need to make a concerted effort across the Group to internal and external achieve the Long-Term Vision, which was formulated in May 2012, sharing Nabtesco’s values stakeholders and features, and taking actions in line with the same decision-making criteria. To this end, we formulated The Nabtesco Way in 2012 and have been raising all members’ awareness of its principles. We aim to develop human resources who will respect the corporate DNA that has been passed down through the generations, make prompt responses to changes occurring in the world, and continue making all-out efforts. Further, in order to foster trusting relationships with a range of our stakeholders, including shareholders, investors, customers, business partners, and local communities where we conduct businesses, and also to fulfill our social responsibility more firmly as a global enterprise, we signed the United Nations Global Compact in April 2014 as an advocator of its principles. In fiscal 2014, we proactively participated in the symposiums and study meetings held by Global Compact Network Japan as opportunities to make exchanges with other companies and foster our CSR activities. The Nabtesco Group will strive to achieve the Long-Term Vision while working to implement “Challenge & Creation” across the Group to build even more trusting relationships with stakeholders and foster value creation.

This marked the beginning of our Railroad Vehicle Equipment Business. In the 1960s, Shinkansen bullet trains began to be operated in time for the Olympic Games to be held in Tokyo, and the urban railway networks were increasingly being improved for transportation at higher speeds and in greater quantity. In response, we developed highly reliable automatic train control systems to ensure safety even during high-speed operations, as well as electric command air brake systems. We continued to expand the business as subway systems were successively constructed to mitigate traffic congestion in urban areas. We also changed our business model from the development of hardware products to making proposals to individual customers in order to expand our business. In and after the 2000s, we entered into the market of Chinese and Taiwanese high speed train and subway businesses.

NABCO began to conduct such business back in the 1930s, offering a range of products, not only for construction machines and special vehicles, but also for general industrial equipment. The company also developed small, multiple-spool control valves for use in road sweepers produced in Japan, and these valves have been developed into our present control valve products. Teijin Seiki began conducting business by establishing the Tarui Plant in 1961. Its hydraulic motors were not highly competitive despite being core products, and the company worked to develop a new product independently. The traveling units “GM Series” that was thus developed provided the four functions necessary for the driving unit of hydraulic excavators (i.e. hydraulic motor, reduction gear, valve and parking brake functions), and was also compact enough relative to the width of an excavator crawler shoe. The company then successfully commenced mass production of this innovative product. Further, the reduction gear technology developed for hydraulic motors led to the development of Precision Reduction Gear RV to control the joints of industrial robots. Subsequently, we established a production base in China in 1996 and one more in Thailand in 2008, thereby fostering overseas business expansion and increasing our global market share in the business of traveling units for hydraulic excavators to 30%. In 2015, we acquired Hyest Corporation, the hydraulic equipment division of TOSHIBA MACHINE, with a view to further expanding our product lineup and developing new hydraulic systems. 1937 Manufactured hydraulic pumps for airplanes in the national defense field (as the former NABCO). 1949 Commenced manufacture and sales of hydraulic equipment (as the former NABCO). 1961 Opened the Tarui Plant for the manufacture of hydraulic equipment and start the Hydraulic Equipment Business (as the former Teijin Seiki). 1970 Opened the Nishi Kobe Plant (presently Seishin Plant) for the manufacture of hydraulic and pneumatic equipment (as the former NABCO). 1977 Commenced mass production of the “GM-series” traveling units.

Based on the relations of trust we have built with customers who themselves are leading companies, we are shifting the focus of our business from the sales of component products to the provision of solutions. To this end, we are identifying the sophisticated needs of customers and enhancing our existing technologies while expanding the scope of our business by applying these technologies to the creation of new products and businesses, including those energy-related ones. To attain the aforementioned goal, Nabtesco is implementing a range of initiatives, including promoting joint research with overseas universities and research institutes, and fostering M&A. Moreover, we relocated the Nabtesco Digital Engineering Center (NDEC) to the Kyoto Research Park located in the city of Kyoto, around where the universities and the research institutes collect. At the NDEC, we foster collaboration with external organizations such as companies and universities based on the concept of open innovation. Through these measures, we will further adopt diversified technologies, speed up our development process, and develop global human capital for R&D, thereby promoting the creation of new products and businesses. 02 R&D System Roles to Be Played by the Technology and R&D Division (1) Support for In-house Companies The Technology and R&D Division makes recommendations and supports in-house companies to help them meet their challenges and develop necessary human capital with the aim of eventually improving manufacturing quality to the industry’s top level in each business field. The Division also formulates and implements intellectual property strategies to increase the company’s competitiveness and protect its intellectual rights and associated benefits in all business segments. It supports the development activities of the in-house companies by using IT-based technologies, including computer-aided engineering (CAE), digital engineering (DE), 3D printing technologies and its unique material technology. Through simulations made at the initial product development stage, the Division helps the in-house companies make prior verifications in a precise manner. In addition to this “front-loading type” of develDisc brake thermal analysis (example) opment support, it also supports in-house companies in human capital development and other development activities by providing them with electronics and sensor technologies. (2) Creating New Businesses The Division searches for the seeds of business, including market needs and technological seeds. It now deals with 100 or more development projects launched by the in-house companies as well as by the Division itself. The Division conducts joint research with both domestic and overseas universities, research institutes, and companies on multiple development themes to develop high-level technologies in a timely manner. The NDEC works on the creation of new businesses Fluid-structure coupled analysis through a wide range of industry-academia collaborations, taking an open innovation approach. for high-speed electromagnetic valve (example) (3) Enhance Base Technologies (Surface Treatment and Heat Treatment Technologies) Recently, great progress has been made on a range of machines in terms of energy conservation and product life longevity, which is said to be attributable to the advancement of surface treatment and heat treatment technologies. The Division proactively introduces the most advanced of these base technologies and verifies their effectiveness in laboratories, discloses the results internally, and applies the technologies to individual products and components in cooperation with the in-house companies. As competitors in emerging countries are catching up with us technologically, we are enhancing the base technologies and transforming them into “black box” technologies so that it will be difficult to imitate them. We are thus making Robot motion simulation efforts to maintain and increase our product competitiveness. (example) 41 Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 03 Major R&D Fields Additive Manufacturing (Making use of 3D printers to acquire more manufacturing technologies) 3D printer technology is advancing from the stage of rapid prototyping (RP) to that of additive manufacturing (AM). Nabtesco has made the NDEC a center for its 3D printer-related technologies, and has equipped the NDEC with a metal 3D printer as well as a resin 3D printer (stereolithography equipment) to foster research into AM technologies. The NDEC has already started R&D using these printers, being the first to launch an internal 3D printing service. We also plan to input resources in the development of materials to support the base technologies. Sensor Technology (Shift from prototyping to mass production of color and water sensors) Nabtesco developed a lubricant oil status monitoring sensor by using fine processing technology for semiconductors, and its unique color measurement technology developed for lubricant oil by using white LEDs. The sensor enables the real-time quantitative measurement of lubricant oil contamination, degradation and water content. We will foster the use of this sensor in a wider range of fields. Joint Research with Overseas Universities and Research Institutes We conducted wind power generation-related analyses jointly with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and announced the results at EWEA 2014 (European Wind Energy Association). In FY2015, we will press forward with analytical research, move to the second stage of the project, and conduct experiments that use actual wind turbines. Moreover, we are working on R&D for actuators with the University of Washington (UW) in the United States and for power electronics technologies with Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zurich).

Through this base in Kyoto, a city that collects the universities and the research institutes, we will foster external collaboration with local companies and universities based on the concept of open innovation, thereby reducing the time required for development and efficiently managing R&D expenses, while also developing human capital through the exchange of human resources and technologies with the organizations. Kyoto Research Park Fostering the Use of 3D Printers (Promoting regular use and searching for new applications) We introduced a resin 3D printer manufactured by CMET, a Nabtesco Group company, to the NDEC. Using this machine, the Center has been supporting the development activities of the in-house companies and conducting examinations on the rapid prototyping of casting steels. In FY2014, we tested a new unique 3D printing method that prints objects with certain forms that in the past were unable to be produced by 3D printing. We also implemented a new initiative—making use of a 3D printer in a patent litigation—and from that, achieved results. Also, in relocating the NDEC to the Kyoto Research Park and enhancing the facilities, we newly installed a metal 3D printer at the Center for product prototyping. By concentrating our 3D printer-related technologies in NDEC, we now possess the necessary leading-edge infrastructure to shorten the time required for development, from initial prototyping of products using resin and then metal, to design for mass production. We will develop products by taking advantage of the features of our 3D printers while also focusing on the acquisition of AM technologies through the use of the 3D printers themselves. Metal 3D printer “Moving it, stopping it.” + 05 “Monitoring it, and repairing it.” Nabtesco has been honing its motion control technology under the tag line “moving it. stopping it.” to provide customers with high-precision and high-efficiency products. In the future, we will enhance our sensor technology to provide the function of monitoring products and their surrounding environment and repairing them before they fail. We will thus offer predictive solutions to help increase efficiency at manufacturing facilities, improve the safety and environmental performance of transport equipment, and expand the businesses of renewable energy, including wind power and solar thermal power generation. Through these measures, we will continue to provide advanced technologies to be used in important products and services that support social infrastructure. 43 Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 Intellectual Property Strategy Intellectual Property Activities to Achieve the 01 Long-Term Vision Nabtesco has been fostering intellectual property activities in line with the business strategy set for the achievement of the Long-Term Vision.

Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 136 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2015 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Nabtesco Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries Years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements (1) Description of business Nabtesco Corporation (the “Company”), a Japanese corporation, was established as a holding company on September 29, 2003 through a stock transfer process by TS Corporation (formerly Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd.) and NABCO Ltd. As a result of the stock transfer, both TS Corporation and NABCO Ltd. became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The Company completed its business integration through the acquisition of the two wholly owned subsidiaries on October 1, 2004. The main products of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Companies”) include precision equipment, transport equipment, aircraft and oil hydraulic equipment, and industrial equipment. (2) Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and its related accounting regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. The accounts of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are based on their accounting records maintained in conformity with generally accepted principles prevailing in the respective countries of domicile. The accounts of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with either International Financial Reporting Standard or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, with adjustment for the specific five items as applicable. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restructured and translated into English from the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. Certain supplementary information included in the statutory Japanese language consolidated financial statements, but not required for fair presentation, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The translation of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars is included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan, using the prevailing exchange rate at March 31, 2015, which is ¥120.17 to U.S. $1.00. The convenience translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate of exchange. 137 Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2015 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (1) Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its 48 subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions, account balances and unrealized profits are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in 10 affiliated companies (generally 20% to 50% owned), over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policy, are accounted for by the equity method. (2) Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposits with banks withdrawable on demand and short-term investments which are readily convertible to cash subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and which are purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. See Note 4 as to reconciliation to cash and deposits on the balance sheets. (3) Allowance for doubtful receivables The allowance for doubtful receivables is provided in amounts management considers sufficient to cover possible losses on collection. The allowance is based on past collection experience and management estimate of the collectability of individual receivables. (4) Provision for loss on order received To cover the future losses relating to order received, a provision is recorded when the future losses are anticipated and the losses are reasonably estimated. (5) Securities The Companies are required to examine the intent of holding each security and classify those securities as (a) securities held for trading purposes (hereafter, “trading securities”), (b) debt securities intended to be held to maturity, (c) equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and (d) for all other securities that are not classified in any of the above categories (hereafter, “other securities”). The Companies have no trading securities at March 31, 2015 and 2014. Held-to-maturity debt securities are expected to be held to maturity and are recognized at amortized cost computed based on the straight-line method. Other securities with available fair market values are stated at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported, net of applicable income taxes, as a separate component of Net assets. Realized gains and losses on sale of such securities are computed using the movingaverage cost method. Other securities with no available fair market value are stated at moving-average cost. If the market value of equity securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and other securities declines significantly, such securities are written down to their fair market value and the difference between fair market value and the carrying amount is recognized as loss in the period of the decline. For equity securities with no available fair market value, if the net asset amount of the investee declines significantly, such securities are written down to the net asset amount in the income statement in the period of decline. In these cases, such fair market value or net asset amount will be the carrying amount of the securities at the beginning of the next year. Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 138 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2015 (6) Inventories Inventories of the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries are stated at the lower of the cost or net realizable value, while inventories of its consolidated foreign subsidiaries are principally stated at the lower of cost or market. The evaluation methods for the cost of inventories are as follows: Inventories Evaluation method Finished goods and Work in process Mainly weighted average method (however certain finished goods and work in process are determined by the specific identification method) Raw materials and Supplies Mainly weighted average method (however certain raw materials and supplies are determined by moving average method) (7) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, including building and building fixtures, are stated at cost. The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries calculate depreciation mainly by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. In addition, the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries depreciate Machinery and equipment, of which acquisition cost is ¥100 thousand or more but less than ¥200 thousand, over a period of three years on a straight-line basis. The consolidated foreign subsidiaries calculate depreciation mainly by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Depreciation of assets acquired by the domestic companies after March 31, 2007 is calculated mainly by the straightline method under the amended tax code for building, not including building fixtures and by the declining-balance method under the amended tax code for the remaining assets. (Change in accounting policy and estimated method) The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries have changed the depreciation method of property, plant, equipment other than buildings from the declining-balance method to the straight-line method from the current fiscal year. The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries reviewed their operating situation of tangible fixed assets when the mid-term management plan was formulated in the current fiscal year. According to the result of the review, the domestic operating situation is predicted to be stable due to the increase of overseas production, etc. Therefore, the Company judged the straight-line method is appropriate in the operating situation. As result of the change, an operating income has increased by ¥1,306 million ($10,868 thousand) and income before taxes and minority interests has increased by ¥1,310 million ($10,901 thousand). (8) Lease assets Property, plant and equipment capitalized under finance lease arrangements are depreciated over the lease term of the respective assets. Finance leases which do not transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee commenced before March 31, 2008 and are accounted for as operating leases. 139 Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2015 (9) Derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions The Companies use derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of mitigating fluctuation risk of interest rates with respect to loans payable and future risk of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates with respect to foreign currency receivables and payables. The following summarizes hedging derivative financial instruments used by the Companies and items hedged: Hedging instruments Hedged items Interest rate swap contracts: Loans payable Forward foreign exchange contracts: Foreign currency trade receivables and trade payables The Companies evaluate hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative changes in cash flows from or the changes in fair value of hedged items and the corresponding changes in fair value of the hedging derivative instruments. The Companies are required to state derivative financial instruments at fair value and to recognize changes in the fair value as gains or losses unless derivative financial instruments meet the criteria for hedge accounting. If derivative financial instruments are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the Companies defer recognition of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments until the related losses or gains on the hedged items are recognized. If interest rate swap contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap contract is added to or deducted from the interest on the assets or liabilities for which the swap contract is executed. If forward foreign exchange contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, hedging instruments and hedged items are accounted for in the following manner: a When a forward foreign exchange contract is executed to hedge an existing foreign currency receivable or payable, (a) the difference, if any, between the Japanese yen amount of the hedged foreign currency receivable or payable translated using the spot rate at the inception date of the contract and the book value of the receivable or payable is recognized in the income statement in the period which includes the inception date, and (b) the discount or premium on the contract (that is, the difference between the Japanese yen amount of the contract translated using the contracted forward rate and that translated using the spot rate at the inception date of the contract) is recognized over the term of the contract. b When a forward foreign exchange contract is executed to hedge a future transaction denominated in a foreign currency, the future transaction will be recorded using the contracted forward rate, and no gains or losses on the forward foreign exchange contract or the forward foreign currency options are recognized. (10) Amortization Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over a period within twenty years. However, if the amount is insignificant, it is expensed as incurred. Software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (five years). (11) Research and development costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 140 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2015 (12) Income taxes The Companies recognize tax effects of timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for tax reporting purpose. Income taxes are comprised of corporation tax, enterprise tax and prefectural and municipal inhabitants taxes. (13) Provision for product warranties Provision for product warranties is provided to cover the estimated cost for customers’ claims relating to after sales repairs. (14) Translation of foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the year-end rates. Financial statements of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the year-end rates, except that shareholders’ equity are translated at historical rates and income statement items resulting from transactions with the Company are translated at the rates used by the Company when the transactions occurred. Foreign currency translation adjustment is reported in net assets. (15) Appropriation of retained earnings Under the Japanese Corporate law, the appropriation of retained earnings with respect to a given financial period is made by a resolution of the shareholders at the general shareholders meeting held subsequent to the close of such financial period. Therefore, the accounts for that period do not reflect such appropriations. (16) Retirement benefits The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries provide two types of retirement and severance benefit plans, unfunded lump-sum payment plans and funded non-contributory pension plans, under which all eligible employees are entitled to benefits based on the level of wages and salaries at the time of retirement or termination, length of service and certain other factors. a Allocation of estimated retirement benefit obligation Expected retirement benefits are attributed to the respective fiscal years by a Benefit formula basis. b Past service costs and actuarial gains and losses Past service costs are recognized as expense when incurred, and actuarial gains and losses are recognized as expense from the following fiscal year using the declining-balance method over a certain period (10 years) not exceeding the average of estimated remaining service period. c Simplified method in small consolidated subsidiaries Certain consolidated subsidiaries calculate retirement benefit liabilities and expenses using the simplified method that assumes their benefit obligation is equal to the benefits payable if all employees voluntarily retired at fiscal year-end. 141 Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2015 (Change in accounting policy) Effective from the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries have applied the article 35 of the “Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Statement No.26, May 17, 2012 (hereinafter, the “Statement No.26”)) and the article 67 of the “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Guidance No.25, March 26, 2015 (hereinafter, the “Guidance No.25”)) and changed the determination of retirement benefit obligations and current service costs. In addition, the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries have changed the method of attributing expected benefit to periods from a Straight-line to a Benefit formula basis and determining the discount rates. In accordance with the article 37 of the Statement No.26, the effect of changing the determination of retirement benefit obligations and current service costs has been recognized in retained earnings at the beginning of the current fiscal year. As a result of the application, the liability for retirement benefit has decreased by ¥1,150 million ($9,570 thousand) and retained earnings has increased by ¥678 million ($5,642 thousand) at the beginning of the current fiscal year. In addition, operating income and income before income taxes and minority interests have decreased by ¥11 million ($92 thousand), respectively, in the current fiscal year. The effects of this change on earnings per share are described in the related note. (17) Provision for director’s retirement benefits Certain consolidated subsidiaries accrue liabilities for retirement benefits, which is estimated at the end of the fiscal year, for their directors and corporate statutory auditors based on their internal policies. (18) Earnings per share The computation of basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock after consideration of dilution that securities or other contracts to issue common stock are exercised or converted into common stock, or resulted into issuance of common stock. Amounts per share of net assets are calculated based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the year-end. Cash dividends per share include interim dividends of the Company proposed by the Board of Directors in addition to year-end dividends approved by shareholders at the general shareholders meeting held subsequent to the end of fiscal year. (19) Recognition of significant revenues and expenses Accounting for construction of completions When the construction work is in progress at year end and the progress rate of construction work up to that time is deemed certain, the percentage-of-completion method is applied. The progress rate is estimated using cost-to-cost method. When the above condition is not met, the completed-contract method is applied.

Financial Instruments (1) Qualitative information on financial instruments a Policies for using financial instruments The Company raises required fund for its business primarily from loans payable and bond issues, and manages surplus funds using financial instruments that carry low or no risk. The Company uses derivatives to mitigate the risk that are described below, and as a matter of policy does not use derivatives for speculative transactions. b Details of financial instruments used and the exposures to risk and how they arise Trade notes and accounts receivable are exposed to customer credit risk. In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from receivables denominated in foreign currencies. The Company uses derivative transactions including forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk of exchange fluctuations associated with receivables denominated in foreign currencies. Short-term investment securities and other securities mainly consist of held-to-maturity debt securities and securities for strengthening the relationship with counterparty and exposed to market price risk. Loans payable and bonds payable are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments. The repayment dates of long term loans payable extend up to five years beyond the date of the closing of accounts. The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuation that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. c Policies and processes for managing the risk (a) Credit risk management (counterparty risk) The Company has prepared policies for managing its credit exposure and business receivables. The Company manages amounts and settlement dates by counterparties and works to identify and mitigate payment risk that may result from situations including deterioration of the financial condition of counterparties at an early stage. Consolidated subsidiaries are subject to the same risk management rules. Held-to-maturity debts securities carry low credit risk because they are managed in high liquidation. The Company conducts only with highly creditworthy financial institution under the risk management policy when using derivatives. Nabtesco Integrated Report 2015 144 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2015 (b) Market risk management The Company and some consolidated subsidiaries use derivative transactions including forward foreign exchange contract to hedge the risk of exchange fluctuations associated with receivables denominated in foreign currencies. For short-term investment securities, the Company examines fair value and the financial condition of the issuing entities. In addition, for all securities other than those classified as held-to-maturity debt securities, the Company regularly revises its portfolio based on its relationships with issuing entities, and interest rate swap transactions to hedge against interest rate risks on long-term loans payable. For derivative transactions, the basic policies for executing the derivative transactions are managed by the Board of Directors of the Company. Based on such policies, the finance departments of each company establish the internal policies which prescribe the specified limits and procedures on the derivative transactions. After execution, each finance department reports certain information on derivative transactions to the Board of Directors of the Company. (c) Liquidity risk management The Accounting Department manages liquidity risk for the Company by making and updating a capital deployment plan based on reports from each division. In addition, the Company manages liquidity risks by keeping high leveled liquidity on hand due to the unstable financial market. d Supplemental information on fair values The fair value of financial instruments is based on market prices, or a reasonable estimate of fair value for instruments for which market prices are not available. Estimates of fair value are subject to fluctuation due to the variable factors and assumption. In addition, the contractual amounts of the derivative transactions discussed in “Derivative Financial Instruments” below are not an indicator of the market risk associated with derivative transactions. (2) Fair value of financial instruments Fair value and difference compared to the book value reported in the balance sheets as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows. Please note that for those items of which obtaining an estimates fair value is deemed to be extremely difficult, such differences are not shown (Please refer to Note 2).

Net Assets Under the Japanese Corporate Law, upon issuance of common stock, the entire amount of the issue price is required to be accounted for as common stock, although companies may, by resolution of the Board of Directors, account for an amount not exceeding one-half of the issue price of the new shares as additional paid-in capital, which is included in capital surplus. Under the Japanese Corporate Law, in cases where dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in-capital and legal earnings reserve must be set aside as additional paid-in-capital or legal earnings reserve. Legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the Japanese Corporate Law, legal earnings reserve and additional paid-in capital could be used to eliminate or reduce a deficit by a resolution of the shareholders’ meeting. Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve may not be distributed as dividends. Under the Japanese Corporate Law, however, all additional paid-in-capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends. The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Japanese Corporate Law. 12.
