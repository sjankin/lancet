Futureye believes that business has a critical role to play in addressing the myriad issues facing the globe today, and as such our client work has continued to focus on assisting businesses to understand and meet ever-increasing expectations. This year I had the opportunity to take part in a number of global events, including attending the UNGC Leaders’ Summit in New York and chairing the corporate stewardship panel at the Nexus 2014: Water, Food, Climate and Energy Conference in North Carolina, where I valued the opportunity to join with leaders to consider the way businesses can maximise their positive contributions to global issues. With the upcoming Sustainable Development Goals and the broader post-2015 agenda in mind, we have also continued to work on our sustainable development initiative, which seeks to address poverty reduction through addressing food, energy, water and climate issues in nexus while focussing on community engagement to ensure the needs and wants of the community are central to the solutions. Once again, I am proud to confirm Futureye’s continued and renewed support and commitment to the UNGC and its 10 principles.

Futureye UNGC COP 2013-2014 Page 9 Case study: Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil European communication strategy to influence the influencers on palm oil The dilemma The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is the leading international body supporting the production and use of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil as an ethical and sustainable solution to the growing global demand for palm oil. RSPO faced an increasing reputational risk as its certification was being questioned at the same time as its members sought reputational “cover” through the use of its certification scheme. RSPO decided to seek advice on a new communication strategy. Futureye won a global contest with a nonconforming bid. The solution Futureye undertook comprehensive research using its social maturation curve and outrage analysis elements of the social licence to operate strategy development process. The social maturation curve on palm oil revealed the key turning points in the growth of the anti-palm oil sentiment and the outrage analysis revealed the emotional outrage factors driving the criticisms of NGOs and activists. Both these elements were brought together to recommend that RSPO move from a position of a “fixer” to one of a “facilitator” of the solution with the supply chain members. NGOs endorsed the resulting shift in the communication strategy. The result RSPO now has a credible strategy that could be used to build visibility with stakeholders, members, sustainability bloggers and the public at large. The strategy was launched in November 2014 and is receiving positive feedback. Page 10 Futureye UNGC COP 2013-2014 “We decided to work with Futureye as they offered a fresh approach and were obviously passionate about the brief to strengthen our social licence to operate and create a consumer outreach campaign for sustainable palm oil. Their detailed analysis, clear thinking and well structured recommendations have resulted in a bold new communications strategy for Europe that will help us to reposition the organisation in a fairly challenging environment. Katherine Teh-White is a great communicator and facilitator. I enjoyed working with everyone in the team, they were insightful, enthusiastic and fun.” Danielle Morley, European Director of Outreach & Engagement, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil Futureye UNGC COP 2013-2014 Page 11 Labour  Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;  Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;  Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labour; and  Principle 6 The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.
