Read on the Elisa website (in Finnish) how we increased the capacity of the network during Provinssirock, for example. In the management of disturbances, communications play a significant role. We invest in proactive and comprehensive communication. We initiate communication with customers as quickly as possible after an extensive disturbance has been detected, and we communicate the progress of fault repair until the disturbance is resolved.
