The development of predictive models based on past data is one key to effectiveness. Several Group Activities, particularly in the Building Distribution Sector, currently use these methods to anticipate customer needs. In 2016, this approach will become more widespread. More than 20 projects, covering all Activities, have the objective of systematizing this approach. d) Monitoring of digital strategy Digital transformation is a unique opportunity for the Group to better measure the effectiveness of its marketing approaches. For the Building Distribution Sector, the effectiveness of the digital approach is measured by volume of online sales (e-commerce) as well as sales generated indirectly, through processes that start online and finish inhouse (Web to store). For the Group’s manufacturing Activities, e-commerce is not the purpose of the digital strategy. Rather, it involves increasing website traffic and, beyond that, the “commitment” of visitors to the Group’s sites. When a visitor downloads a document from a site, and asks a question or tries out the brand, he becomes a potential identified customer, with whom it is possible to interact. 62 OPERATIONAL POLICIES 4.

Variable compensation owed for fiscal year 2015 to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was set by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 25, 2016, at the proposal of the Nomination, Remuneration and Governance Committee, as follows: Weighting of Assessment scale Percentage Completion by objectives for each objective completion amount (€) ROCE 25% 0 to 100% 66% 205,700 Quantitative Operating income 25% 0 to 100% 50% 155,833 objectives* (2/3), Group current net of which: income per share 25% 0 to 100% 61% 190,117 OFCF 25% 0 to 100% 75% 233,750 Total quantitative 2/3 63% 785,400 Qualitative objectives Qualitative 1/3 0 to 100% 80% 498,667 (1/3) (global) TOTAL VARIABLE SHARE 100% 69% 1,284,067 * For each quantitative objective, the corresponding portion of variable compensation becomes payable if from 90% to 94% of the budget is achieved, depending on the objective concerned, and it reaches its maximum if the objective reaches 106% to 111% of the budget, depending on the objective concerned (with base 100 corresponding to the budget). If actual performance is less than the abovementioned thresholds from 90% to 94%, the portion of variable compensation corresponding to the objective in question is equal to 0. When the budget is met, the variable compensation determined according to all quantitative criteria is 68% of the fixed part of his compensation. Within the Group, the budget is based on ambitious objectives that are not always met and the variable compensation’s objectives are therefore challenging. In all, Mr. Pierre-André de Chalendar’s total compensation (fixed and variable) for fiscal year 2015 represented €2,384,067, an increase of 4.65% over that of 2014. 128 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 2.

Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions, or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the Group’s management report and in the documents addressed to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. Year ended December 31, 2015 To the Shareholders of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain S.A. In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2015, on: • the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain; • the justification of our assessments; • the specific verification required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. I Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at December 31, 2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. II Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: Measurement of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets The Group regularly carries out impairment tests on its property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, and also assesses whether there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, based on the methods described in Note 5.5 to the consolidated financial statements (“Impairment review”). We examined the methods applied in implementing these tests and the estimates and assumptions used, and we verified that the information disclosed in Note 5.5 to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate. Employee benefits The methods applied for assessing employee benefits are set out in Note 4.3 to the consolidated financial statements (“Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits”). These benefit obligations were reviewed by independent actuaries. Our work consisted of assessing the data and assumptions used, examining, on a test basis, the calculations performed and verifying that the information disclosed in Note 4.3 to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate. 228 FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION 2. STATUTORY AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Provisions As specified in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements (“Other current and non-current liabilities and provisions, contingent liabilities and litigation”), the Group books provisions to cover risks. The nature of these provisions recorded is described in Note 7.1 to the consolidated financial statements. Based on the information available at the time of our audit, we ensured that the methods and data used to determine provisions as well as the disclosures regarding said provisions provided in the Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements are appropriate. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III Specific verification As required by law, we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

To achieve them, intermediate objectives are established for a three-year period. The base year for the intermediate objectives is the year prior to the period start. The current period 2014-2016 therefore uses 2013 as its base year. 284 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND CROSS-REFERENCE TABLES 2.

We verified that CSR Information covers the scope of consolidation, i.e., the Company, its subsidiaries as defined by Article L.233-1 and the entities it controls as defined by Article L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the methodological information, presented in the management report. 8 Conclusion Based on this work, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. 1 Whose scope is available at www.cofrac.fr. 2 ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information. G4-33 9 285 2015 SAINT-GOBAIN REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2. Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work We conducted around 10 interviews with the persons responsible for preparing CSR Information in the departments charged with collecting the information and, where appropriate, the people responsible for the internal control and risk management procedures, in order to: • assess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, impartiality and comprehensibility, and taking into account best practices where appropriate ; • verify that a data-collection, compilation, processing and control procedure has been implemented to ensure the completeness and consistency of CSR Information and reviewed the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of our tests and controls according to the nature and importance of CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the labour and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainable development policy and best practices. With regard to CSR Information that we considered to be the most important 3: • at parent entity level, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to substantiate the qualitative information (organisation, policy, action), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in concordance with the other information in the management report; • at the level of a representative sample of entities/divisions/sites selected by us on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and risk analysis, we conducted interviews to ensure that procedures are followed correctly and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations made and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents on average 19% of headcount and between 18% and 40% of quantitative environmental data. For the other consolidated CSR information, we assessed consistency based on our understanding of the company. We also assessed the relevance of explanations given for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part. We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes used, based on our professional judgement, allow us to express limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive work. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations intrinsic to the operation of information and internal control systems, we cannot provide absolute assurance that CSR information disclosed is free of material misstatements. Conclusion Based on our work and subject to the qualifications detailed in Chapter 4 and in the methodological note of the Management Report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.
