Communication On Progress 2015 ARKEMA 2 MESSAGE OF THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO Thierry Le Hénaff Dear stakeholders, I am pleased to renew Arkema’s support for the Global Compact and our ongoing commitment to the initiative and its principles, on which Arkema builds its sustainability approach, with the Responsible Care® initiative. Our strategic position as a central player in the industry, dedicated to serving our customers, creates a responsibility for us to set an example of excellence in environmental awareness, safety and sustainability in chemical production. I ﬁrmly believe that implementing an ambitious corporate social responsibility policy creates value for both stakeholders and the Company itself. In ten years, we have become a key player of the sustainability world by bringing sustainable development solutions a centerpiece of our innovation policy and our product lines. Our innovation platforms cover lightweight materials and design, electronics solutions, new energies, bio-based products, and water management. We launched in 2015 a sixth innovation platform on sustainable building materials and solutions with the Smart House by Arkema. With this unique laboratory-house concept, Arkema sets out its ambition to develop innovative, responsible and sustainable solutions for environmentally sounder buildings, throughout their lifecycle. During COP21, Arkema signed the French Companies Act on Climate and conﬁrmed its commitment to invest signiﬁcantly in low-carbon R&D and industrial projects. Building on its excellent results and steady progress over the past 10 years in terms of occupational safety and environmental footprint reduction, Arkema has strengthened its long-term targets with a new ambitious Corporate Social Responsibility framework by 2025. Highlights are for safety a total recordable injury rate of 1.2 or below and for the environment a reduction of 50% of greenhouse gases in terms of EFPI (Environmental Footprint Performance Indicator). This report details our ambitions and commitments in the ﬁeld of Corporate Social Responsibility as well as our achievements there. I sincerely thank you for your continued support and interest in our sustainable performance. 3 Communication On Progress 2015 ARKEMA AN INNOVATIVE GROUP RECOGNIZED R&D EXPERTISE TOP 100 GLOBAL INNOVATORS THE GROUP IS INCLUDED IN THE THOMSON REUTERS TOP 100 GLOBAL INNOVATORS RANKING LIST FOR THE 5TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR BIO-BASED 6 RESEARCH PRODUCTS PLATFORMS NEW ENERGIES LIGHTWEIGHT MATERIALS AND WATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN ELECTRONICS HOME SOLUTIONS EFFICIENCY AND INSULATION PROMISING DEVELOPMENT AREAS Smart House A recognized player Inaugurated in 2015, the in composite materials Smart House is a houseThe Group positions itself laboratory dedicated to as a major player in the sustainable construction, composite materials market, designed to address the with many developments major challenges facing the including Kepstan ® PEKK, building industry: energy known as “the extreme efficiency, environmental polymer”, Elium ® resins, performance, and the health Altuglas® ShieldUp, Rilsan and comfort of building HT® and Polystrand® occupants. thermoplastic prepregs.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Arkema, appointed as independent third party and certified by COFRAC under number 3-1049 (1), we hereby report to you on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information for the year ended 31 December 2015 (hereinafter the “CSR Information”), presented in the Management report included in the Registration document, pursuant to article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code. Company’s responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing a management report including the CSR Information required by article R. 225‑105‑1 of the French Commercial Code prepared in accordance with the guidelines and procedures used by the Group (hereinafter the “Guidelines”), summarised in the Management report and available on request from the Group’s head office. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the French Code of ethics of our profession and the requirements of article L. 822‑11 of the French Commercial Code. In addition, we have implemented a quality control system including documented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the ethical requirements, French professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Statutory Auditor’s responsibility On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to: • attest that the required CSR Information is included in the management report or, in the event of non-disclosure of a part or all of the CSR Information, that an explanation is provided in accordance with the third paragraph of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation of completeness of CSR Information); • express a limited assurance conclusion that the CSR Information taken as a whole is, in all material respects, fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines (Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information). Our work involved twelve persons and was conducted between October 2015 and March 2016 during a twelve weeks period. We were assisted in our work by our CSR experts.

Corporate social responsibility Independent third partyopinion pursuant to article L. 225‑102‑1 of the French Commercial Code We performed our work in accordance with the French professional standards and with the order dated 13 May 2013 defining the conditions under which the independent third party performs its engagement and with the international standard ISAE 3000 (1) concerning our conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information. 1. Attestation of completeness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work On the basis of interviews with the individuals in charge of the relevant departments, we obtained an understanding of the Group’s sustainability strategy regarding social and environmental impacts of its activities and its societal commitments and, where applicable, any resulting actions or programmes. We compared the CSR Information presented in the Management report with the list provided in article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. For any consolidated information that is not disclosed, we verified that explanations were provided in accordance with article R. 225‑105, paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code. We verified that the CSR Information covers the scope of consolidation, i.e., the Group, its subsidiaries as defined by article L. 233-1 and the controlled entities as defined by article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the methodological note, presented in the Management report (2.6. section of the Registration document). Conclusion Based on the work performed and given the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. 2. Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work We conducted around thirty interviews with the persons responsible for preparing the CSR Information in the departments in charge of collecting the information and, where appropriate, responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to: • assess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, and taking into account industry best practices where appropriate; • verify the implementation of data-collection, compilation, processing and control process to ensure the completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the social and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainability strategy and industry best practices. Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important, listed in the following table: • at parent entity level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with the other information presented in the Management report; • at the level of a representative sample of sites and entities (2) selected by us on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied and to identify potential undisclosed data, and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents on average 29% of headcount, between 16% and 99% of quantitative environmental data and 100% of quantitative societal data disclosed.

Societal topic Territorial, economic and social impact of the company activity on the local populations Importance of subcontracting and consideration, in the relationship with subcontractors and suppliers of their social and environmental responsibility Measures implemented to promote consumers health and safety For the remaining consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the company. We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part. We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgement, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated. Conclusion Based on the work performed, no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.
