Established in 2000, we are now a dedicated Nordic community, with offices in Aarhus, Copenhagen and Oslo, currently contributing to the development of over 500,000 m2 in the Nordic countries. Since our establishment, we have gained international recognition for developing architecture that opens up opportunities for people and for businesses across the residential, educational, cultural, health and commercial sectors. 4 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT WE OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES We strongly believe that buildings and public spaces should open up opportunities for people and for businesses and provide people the opportunities to live better lives and give companies the best settings for sharing knowledge, or to help educational institutions engage children and cultural institutions by creating captivating experiences for young and elderly alike. Therefore, we aim to move beyond just style to explore the ways in which the built environment can open up opportunities for better living, learning and working for everyone. For us architecture is not just a matter of a certain style, but more importantly it's a matter of seeing opportunities, shaping them and giving people and businesses the perfect setting for bringing the spaces to life. This is at the heart of everything we do. This is how we make a difference for people and for businesses. We approach every task with curiosity and responsiveness, just as we work with ambitious partners to see and explore opportunities. Rather than using predefined styles or methods, we engage with and become involved in each project. We listen to people, analyse the context and put our creative talents to work as we explore the opportunities each project holds. Based on this exploration, we take a holistic approach to each project in our desire to balance interests: socially, functionally, environmentally and commercially. “We keep challenging everything we know and shape this insight into architectural solutions that open up opportunities for people and for businesses. This is at the heart of everything we do. We are opportunity makers at heart.” Torben Skovbjerg Larsen Partner / CEO 5 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT WE SUPPORT THE GLOBAL COMPACT In our desire to open up opportunities for better living, learning and working for everyone, regardless of age, gender, disability or the like, we have joined the United Nations Global Compact, which is the largest voluntary corporate social responsibility initiative in the world. As a member, we are proud to commit our strategies and operations with the United Nations principles in the areas of human rights, labour rights, environment and anti-corruption. By doing this and promoting the principles within our sphere of inﬂuence, we take part in improving the quality of life and the health of the environment. In this Communication on Progress, we express our continuing commitment to supporting advances in the building industry in ways that benefit everyday life, the economy and the environment. The purpose of this publication is thus to give our stakeholders and the wider community an insight into how we promote and have implemented corporate social responsibility in our core business. Torben Skovbjerg Larsen Partner / CEO 6 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT WE BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY We joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2008 to be part of the partnership between UN with the objective of promoting transparency and social commitment in the international business community. This report is our fifth Communication on Progress in which we commit ourselves to all four areas of the Global Compact: Human Rights, Labour Rights, Environment and Anti-Corruption. Our Communication on Progress 2015 is uploaded to the website of the United Nations Global Compact. It will also be available on our own website, just like it will be a natural part of how we present our company internally and in the media. Thus, we attach great importance to communicate our sustainable visions and values to all our stakeholders – ranging from our clients and employees to the building industry in general. 7 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT WE COMBINE PEOPLE, PLANET AND PROFIT We support all four areas of the Global Compact: Human Rights, Labour Rights, Environment and Anti-Corruption. However, we have interpreted these four areas and combined them into the triple bottom line: People, Planet and Profit. The first (People) includes Human Rights and Labour Rights and focuses on our socially responsible approach to developing buildings and public spaces. The second (Planet) includes Environment and focuses on our environmentally approach, while the third (Profit) includes AntiCorruption and focuses on our aim to lead the development of a more transparent and economically sustainable building industry. PEOPLE We believe that buildings and public spaces Principle 1 should empower people to live safer, healthier and Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally promore meaningful lives.

On the following pages, we have gathered some of our latest and most exciting projects that encapsulate this approach in their very own ways – ranging from one of the world’s most accessible sports resorts to a mixed-use development shaped by the shared economy and a hospital at the forefront of healing architecture. 11 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT MUSHOLM – ONE OF THE WORLD’S MOST ACCESSIBLE SPORTS RESORTS Located by the Danish coastline, just an hour drive from Copenhagen, Musholm challenges the traditional notion of accessible architecture with a view to becoming the preferred sports resort for people with any type of handicap – both in Denmark and abroad. Designed as one of the world’s most innovative sports resorts for people with disabilities, Musholm has been designed to do wonders for people and the tourism in the region. It does so by combining design and architecture into a unique experience that engages the guests and shows how businesses can be financially successful while creating social impact. 12 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT LOCATION STATUS SIZE Korsør / Denmark Completed in 2015 3,200 m² DEVELOPER ARCHITECT COLLABORATORS The Musholm Foundation AART architects MOE / D & N BSAA UrbanLAB Keingart / Bexcom 13 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT THE WAREHOUSES – A NEW KIND OF DEVELOPMENT SHAPED BY THE SHARED ECONOMY The Warehouses are being built as the first combined residential and commercial development on the new harbourfront of Aarhus, Denmark. The Warehouses stands out by exploiting the potential of the rapidly growing shared economy. By combining residential and commercial units in new ways, it has been designed as a distinctive and diverse development that oozes of life every day – from early morning to late in the evening. It rethinks the neighbourliness between businesses and residents and allow them to share a wide range of facilities, including fitness facilities, meeting facilities, a canteen and a public roof terrace; all with a focus on creating architecture that opens up opportunities for businesses, residents and the city in general. 14 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT LOCATION STATUS SIZE Aarhus / Denmark Under construction 35,000 m² PROJECT OWNER ARCHITECT ENGINEER Havneinvest AART architects MOE 15 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT STAVANGER UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL – AT THE FOREFRONT OF HEALING ARCHITECTURE In addition to serving 330,000 citizens and 7,300 employees, the new university hospital has been designed to provide space for research and treatment facilities and to be at the forefront of healing architecture. These objectives are carried out in scenic surroundings in Ullandhaug south of Stavanger, which enhances the patients’ ability to recover. The interaction with nature is a recurring element in the design of the hospital. By merging urban and recreational qualities, patients and their families experience the hospital as a garden city that offers an abundance of daylight and fresh air. Thus, the hospital meets the patients' needs through everything from the choice of materials to the close interaction between indoors and outdoors. 16 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT LOCATION STATUS SIZE Stavanger / Norway Under development 200,000 m² DEVELOPER ARCHITECTS COLLABORATORS Helse Stavanger AART architects / Nordic SLA / Cowi / Aas-Jakobsen 17 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UN GLOBAL COMPACT PHOTO CREDITS Adam Mørk André Helene Høyer Mikkelsen Jens Markus Lindhe Kirstine Mengel Torben Eskerod
