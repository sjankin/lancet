Impairment of property plant and equipment An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there there is any indication that previously recognised impairment is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if asset‚Äôs recoverable amount. An asset‚Äôs recoverable amount there has been a change in the estimates used to determine is the higher of an asset‚Äôs or cash generating unit‚Äôs fair value the asset‚Äôs recoverable amount since the last impairment less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That inÔ¨Çows that are largely independent of those from other increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable years.

The Group engaged independent expert valuers, to determine the fair value of its land and buildings. Fair value is determined by reference to market-based evidence of transaction prices for similar properties. Valuations are based on open market prices, adjusted for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the speciÔ¨Åc property. These valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. The date of the most recent revaluation was carried out on 31 March 2016. The changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and in the statement of equity. The valuer has used valuation techniques such as market values and discounted cash Ô¨Çow methods where there was lack of comparable market data available based on the nature of the property.
