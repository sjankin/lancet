Sokratis P. Kokkalis Chairman, INTRALOT Group Sustainability Report 2014 |9 Message from the CEO 10 | Sustainability Report 2014 Year 2014 was a transition year for INTRALOT. As the gaming sector undergoes rapid regulatory and technological changes with the end consumer as the main focus, our company embarked on a process of change guided by a new three-tier strategy: to strengthen our product offerings, to make the transition from technology provider to B2C operations offering a personalized gaming experience to the player, and to focus on global operational excellence. INTRALOT’s goal is to retain competitive advantage by embracing technology innovation as an enabler and capitalizing on business know-how to offer a responsible and engaging gaming experience while improving the long-term sustainability of business operation. INTRALOT’s Sustainability Report 2014 presents several achievements made toward this goal. We have developed key innovative solutions that secure a monitored, safe and responsible gaming player environment. These include the new Pre-commitment and Player services tool, the innovative responsible gaming module of our trademarked iGEM monitoring system for EGM, as well as the new iRG game design tool for testing the social impact of games across products and channels. We have also made progress toward the creation of a systematic process for monitoring the social and environment impact of operations globally. We have revised our supplier Code of Conduct and devised a new, all-encompassing supplier engagement process so as to advance the standards of the UN Global Compact in our supply chain, including labor, health & safety, human rights, quality, and environmental standards. A new, group wide responsible gaming training program has been developed and shared through GLN, our awarded global intranet platform, to all corporate employees. Further, train-the-trainer programs, as well as responsible gaming training for marketing personnel, have been reinforced. We are making steady progress in the transition to cloud technology and, in addition to energy, emissions and utilities, have also launched a new process for monitoring the consumption of natural resources in hardware production. The accomplishments made in 2014 are reflected in the quantity and quality of disclosures of the present report, made under the strictest international standards, the G4 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative. Our achievements have earned us several well-deserved landmark recognitions. INTRALOT has been awarded Responsible Gaming certification at the highest level as a gaming vendor by the World Lottery Association and several subsidiaries across regions have received equivalent certifications as lottery operators by the World Lottery Association as well as the European Lotteries. Our company has also become the first vendor in the gaming industry certified with the ISO 29990:2010 standard for the training services offered by the corporate Learning Center to employees and customers alike. Finally, INTRALOT has also renewed its business excellence credentials, awarded by top organizations like the EFQM and EBEN. Our achievements give us renewed confidence on our strategy of sustainable leadership through product solutions that offer engaging, safe and responsible gaming entertainment. We hope the incursion into our sustainability programs and practices demonstrates our efforts to make the world, as much as ourselves, a better place. Antonios I.

The activities of the company are monitored via a highly detailed budget, which is assigned to each business unit and each market and is adapted on a regular basis taking into account external factors and changes. Moreover, the management has designed and implements ongoing monitoring targets to guarantee that the Internal Audit System is effective. The Internal Audit System provides Management with a specialized assessment of the inspection mechanisms that are in place in the company, and makes suggestions for their improvement where necessary. Certain areas are considered to be high risk for financial fraud and are thus monitored with the appropriate anti-corruption policies and measures. Protection against such fraud is assisted through the use of a code of conduct, detailed work regulations, clearly defined duties and responsibilities, procedure monitoring and authorization limits. All relevant measures and activities are subject to internal inspection, the results of which are presented to the management board.

Toward this end, the company has developed a series of partnerships, as follows. 68 | Responsible Gaming Corallia Gaming Cluster INTRALOT actively supports efforts to kick-start technology entrepreneurship in the gaming sector. Toward this goal, the company has an ongoing partnership with the Corallia Clusters Initiative since 2010. Corallia is a non-profit organization created with seed money from the Greek government and the European Union whose goal is to be a facilitator of innovation. The gi-Cluster (www.gi-cluster.gr) bears the stamp of a Greek industrial cluster edge innovation with considerable potential to become a world-class pioneering initiative in a highly competitive and extrovert sector of the economy. Established in early 2012 with the support of INTRALOT Group and Corallia as cluster facilitator, the gi-Cluster’s mission is to create a leading, fully functional business innovation ecosystem, producing new technologies and competitive products and building on scientific knowledge and on business and research talent from all areas of Technology & Gaming, so as to have positive impact on the position of Greece in international competitiveness rankings. To date, the main products & services born in Greece to the gi-Cluster include five main gaming technology product categories or creative content and two main support services areas, as per Table 5. TABLE 5: GI-CLUSTER PRODUCTS & SERVICES Product Categories Support Services • Platforms and social networking content • Three-dimensional machines (3D engines) • Creative Content • Serious Games • Research and gaming systems development • i-Gaming • Digital Signage The gi-Cluster has been awarded the Bronze Label by the European Secretariat for Cluster Analysis (ESCA), the European excellence cluster certification body. The strategy of the gi-Cluster is to serve as a national vehicle rallying creative industries’ innovation potential and leading to synergies for other sectors of the economy. To illustrate, such synergies include: Responsible Gaming | 69  The development of tourism applications;  The digitization of cultural content;  The development of digital educational tools. Thus, the gi-Cluster has contributed to the emergence of the Creative Economy as an important vehicle for research, innovation and growth in Greece. During the period 2013 to 2015, the gi-Cluster has managed to achieve a 317% increase in the number of members, now boasting 50 members including 40 companies and 10 research and academic institutions. The SMEs of the cluster show a 29% increase in turnover, a 22% increase in employment, a 19% increase in exports and a 120% increase in joint academia-industry research projects. It is important to note that over the next three years the European market of digital industries alone will increase by €63 billion and create as many as 5 million new jobs. The significant boom in the industry is directly related to the catalytic introduction of IT in Creative Industries, which creates a new environment of cross sector partnerships that combine application development, providing web services and data management, with visual arts, social sciences & humanities, audiovisual productions and other areas, targeting the multiplier factor and resulting in competitive advantage in sectors like Tourism and Culture. INTRALOT Interactive, in collaboration with four (4) more companies members of the giCluster, are currently implementing the collaborative project GameLot, which has been approved in 2013 by the Directorate for Support of Research Programs, Department A, of the General Secretariat for Research and Technology, Operational Programs, of the Hellenic Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports. The commercial exploitation of GameLot, whose purpose is the development of tools / platforms / games in the cognitive area of interactive games, is expected to start within 2015 upon successful project completion. Athens Tech Athens Tech College is an Athens-based international technology education organization, created with the aim to connect technology to entrepreneurship and to new ideas and their practical market applications.

Responsible Gaming | 71 Hohenheim University Research Center on Gambling Promoting the notion of responsible gaming, INTRALOT supports as of 2008 the Hohenheim University Gambling Research Center, which conducts research on the various economic and social aspects of gambling and its impact on player behavior, habits and lifestyle. The Gambling Research Center was established in December 2004 and is the only academic gambling research centre in Germany. It is dedicated to research in the subject areas of regulatory and consumer policy, consumer behavior, public and private law, finance and tax, applied mathematics, statistics and econometrics, communication and marketing sciences, and theories of gaming. While gambling research centres in other countries focus mainly on either the psychological or the legal aspects of gambling, the Gambling Research Centre at the University of Hohenheim stands out due to its multidisciplinary approach to gaming research, boasting a 25-member Scientific Board with diverse scientific backgrounds and expertise. Moreover, the head of the center is a member of the executive board of the European Association for the Study of Gambling (EASG). In 2014, the Gambling Research Center was able to look back on 10 years of existence. The main research topics comprised national and international gambling law and regulation, match fixing, advertising guidelines, responsible gambling as well gender issues in gambling. 4.6 Employee Training on Responsible Gaming INTRALOT’s Learning Center is a department dedicated to the provision of training services. Within the scope of the Department is ‘project-based’ training – i.e. role-based training provided to the personnel of Lottery Organizations and to that of INTRALOT Subsidiaries (both referred to as ‘Customers’) on the Lottery systems provided by INTRALOT. The aim is to enable the designated personnel of a Lottery Organization to effectively and efficiently operate the new systems as this pertains to different roles and allocated tasks. The Learning Center’s training methodology covers the entire training process analysis, design, development, execution and evaluation of provided customized, industry-specific training programs, thus safeguarding the efficient launch and operation of a Lottery. The Learning Center’s training methodology is subject to ISO 9001, ISO 27001/WLA SCS and EFQM certifications and proven in more than thirty projects around the world. INTRALOT’s Learning Center has the responsibility to effectively design and execute the Training Program. The Learning Center works closely with persons designated by the Customer in order to provide the best possible training solution. It also works closely with the organization & human resources department for the provision of skills development and the advancement of knowledge among INTRALOT personnel. 72 | Responsible Gaming As a leader of the gaming industry, INTRALOT has a full-fledged commitment to responsible gaming principles and practices. The supply of responsible gaming products and services depends to a great extent on the Company’s most strategic resource, its workforce. INTRALOT corporate training policy on responsible gaming is to educate and to enable its employees to uphold the highest standards and to follow best practices in order to ensure a fair and safe gaming experience to players and protect them, as well as society in turn, from adverse consequences of gaming. The high-quality training provided is developed in-house by content developers of the Learning Center, who work closely with INTRALOT subject-matter across different departments, including with INTRALOT’s responsible gaming executive. The responsible gaming training program is designed, implemented, evaluated, and continuously improved by the training experts of the Learning Center and has steadily grown and matured into an integrated training framework. Responsible gaming awareness training is provided to all employees as part of their Induction Program. The training program on responsible gaming policies and practices is comprised of the following modules, described hereafter: TABLE 7: RESPONSIBLE GAMING: OVERVIEW OF EMPLOYEE TRAINING PROGRAMS Employee Training on Responsible Gaming Corporate Level • Induction to Responsible Gaming: All new INTRALOT employees • Best RG Practices for Marketing Personnel • RG Technology Updates: INTRALOT Senior Technical Management • RG Awareness & Best Practices for Retailer Trainers (Train-the-Trainer) Job-Specific Level • RG Awareness & Best Practices for Business & Support Personnel (Commercial/ Management, Call Center) • Other modules, as per job role, per product offering ( back-end/front-end training) Responsible Gaming | 73 Induction to Responsible Gaming Upon recruitment, all new INTRALOT employees undergo an induction program. Among other, the induction program includes a specific module on the important topic of Responsible Gaming, which is intended to:  Educate/Raise awareness of our employees on responsible gaming principles and policies;  Communicate the significance of responsible gaming for the competitive advantage of the Company’s core business;  Provide examples of responsible gaming practices of INTRALOT. Best RG Practices for Marketing Personnel An important component of an effective responsible gaming program has to do with marketing operations. In jurisdictions where INTRALOT undertakes the marketing of products, the local marketing staff of INTRALOT is trained by our Marketing experts from headquarters on how to conduct marketing operations based on best responsible gaming practices, as applicable to the local jurisdiction. Moreover, members of the Game Design Department are trained on structural characteristics of games and situational risks associated with gaming. RG Technology Updates for INTRALOT Senior Technical Management As a world leading gaming vendor and operator committed to the principles of responsible gaming, it is important for INTRALOT to always be up-to-date on all gaming-related technology developments. To this effect, sessions on the latest developments in responsible gaming technology are periodically scheduled for the Senior Technical Management of INTRALOT. The information provided is kept in a special collaborative site on the corporate portal and is easily accessible to the designated INTRALOT employees. RG Awareness & Best Practices for Retailer Trainers (Train-the-Trainer) INTRALOT places special emphasis on its Train-the-Trainer programs intended for Retailer Trainers and more specifically on how the participants can raise awareness of retailers on responsible gaming and on how RG practices and procedures can be incorporated into the retailers’ daily sales operations. 74 | Responsible Gaming RG Awareness & Best Practices for Business & Support Personnel (Commercial/Management, Call Center) The topics included in this training module are the same as those included in the module above, but differ only in the learning objectives (which are based on the intended audience), the depth of the knowledge provided and the evaluation method. For example, in those sessions where the intended audience is Business Users (primarily Commercial/Management personnel) the objective is to train them on the same RG topics that retailer trainers are trained on but without the requirement to demonstrate their knowledge through presentations. Similarly, Service Personnel (e.g. Call Center) is also trained on the same topics but their training evaluation method is based on how to convey their knowledge to retailers over the phone. Also, in this case, there is much less emphasis on the ‘sales’ approach and more on the other topics. Other Training Modules Finally, it should also be noted that apart from the modules listed above and that relate directly to responsible gaming, INTRALOT also provides its employees with other training sessions that can be associated with responsible gaming, such as annual training on INTRALOT’s Information Security Management System (ISMS), which is in accordance with WLA standards and emphasizes the importance of information confidentiality, integrity and availability. Training Delivery Methods Different training delivery methods are applied, as per module and intended audience, so as to bring about the desired training result. One of these is instructor-led training (ILT), held in suitably equipped physical classrooms. With the exception of the modules intended for the Marketing and Technology personnel, which are conducted by highly-qualified specialists, all other training modules are conducted by experienced, certified trainers of the Learning Center. In addition, a variety of e-learning methods are used, including asynchronous training – i.e. e-courses on INTRALOT’s e-learning platform and synchronous training – i.e. live, virtual classroom training sessions. The Responsible Gaming Awareness/Updates training is an example of an RG training module created in-house by the Learning Center as an asynchronous e-learning course, which is readily available (anytime/anyplace) to all INTRALOT employees around the world. Responsible Gaming | 75 Evaluation of Employee Training Programs on Responsible Gaming Depending on the learning objectives of each module, discussion, questions and answers, role plays, quizzes and other training methods are employed aiming at determining the knowledge attained by the trainees from each training course. Moreover, in accordance with best international quality assurance practices and standards, a detailed course evaluation is conducted at the end of each training module. The course evaluation form provided to the participants includes multiple choice and open-ended questions regarding the course (e.g. information usefulness, points that need improvement, etc.). The Training Evaluation Forms are submitted by the trainees on an anonymous basis. The trainers also provide feedback concerning the training sessions. All results are then processed by the Learning Center and a composite Training Evaluation Report is prepared. The data is also kept in the training database which is regularly audited, in accordance with all certifications the Learning Center complies with. The principal aim of the training evaluation process is to utilize the input provided so as to ascertain where the training was effective or where extra training may be required so as to bring about the desired result – employees who are aware of, and adhere to, responsible gaming practices. 4.7 Marketing Standards & Research Responsible gaming is embedded in the products, ESOMAR is the essential organisation for tools and systems offered by INTRALOT to its encouraging, advancing and elevating market customers.

Furthermore, the company believes that the treatment of players who develop symptoms of addictive gambling behavior must be undertaken by experts in the provision of health services to addicted gamblers. INTRALOT cooperates with such bodies in several of the jurisdictions where it operates, disseminates information about their work and refers any problem gambling incidents to these organizations. Several of INTRALOT’s lottery customers have developed collaborations with specialized organizations dealing with gambling addiction and problem gambling therapy. As a supplier, INTRALOT promotes regular information about the availability of this support near retailers. In jurisdictions where the company is a lottery operator it has developed treatment referral collaborations.

The company enforces the principle of equal opportunity to all potential suppliers and strives to maintain a diverse portfolio of suppliers, in terms of country of legal establishment, company size, or human resources profile. Neither INTRALOT SA nor its subsidiaries give preferential treatment to local suppliers or adopt policies towards such goal. As an ISO 9001 certified company, INTRALOT business processes follow standardized procedures throughout the entire product chain. The company has adopted a written policy for procurements with step-by-step procedures, supplier requisites, and documentation, which ensure fairness and compliance with quality assurance standards. Furthermore, INTRALOT procurements processes are subject to regular auditing. New 1st Degree Supplier Questionnaire In 2014, INTRALOT designed a new and enlarged questionnaire targeted at 1st degree suppliers on labor, health & safety, and environmental standards. These standards are a requisite for participation in corporate procurements. The main areas covered in the new questionnaire include:  Quality Management  Occupational Health & Safety  Product Design  Labor Standards  Manufacturing & Operations  Environmental Standards & Monitoring  Procurements & Logistics  Governance & Compliance  Corporate Affiliations & Partnerships  Monitoring & Reporting  Merchandise Control The majority of first degree suppliers has received quality and environmental certifications from competent national and international organizations. Several are also listed in national stock exchanges, consequently abiding by the regulatory framework defined by these exchanges. A significant number of contracts with suppliers within the European Union area follow EU regulations and the process, requisites, and eligibility rules of public tender. Stakeholder Engagement | 135 Regarding second degree suppliers of hardware components produced through the commodity sector, INTRALOT actively engages and collaborates with first degree suppliers in the dissemination of adopted quality, labor and environmental standards down the supply chain. There are no incidents of human rights violations by the suppliers of the INTRALOT Group, as both the Group as its suppliers abide by a non-discrimination policy, respect the rights of indigenous people in applicable jurisdictions, and do not utilize child labor or forced or compulsory labor. Both the selection of suppliers and the process of supplier assessment, which the company conducts on an annual basis, are subject to the following main criteria:  financial cost;  quality specifications;  supplier labour policies & practices;  supplier human rights record;  supplier policy towards the rights of indigenous peoples, where applicable;  the impacts of supplier products or services on environmental sustainability;  time to delivery. Finally, the choice of suppliers is also subject to the specific constraints and ad-hoc parameters defined in contracts with customers. INTRALOT has adopted a quality management system (QMS) that supports the effective management of partnerships by ensuring consistent quality standards, keeping regular contact with suppliers, exchanging feedback and implementing product or service improvements. INTRALOT’s QMS is based on an open-channel of communication between the Department of Contracts and Procurements and the Technical Support Department through the company’s intranet portal, where input on subcontractor performance is shared. This input also serves as the basis for recommendations for new or continuing partnerships. 9.3 Customer Training & Support Services As part of the gaming services offered to customers, INTRALOT offers extensive training on INTRALOT products and technology, including on responsible gaming best practices and technology tools.

Prof. Tilman Becker, Hohenheim Research Center on Gambling, Germany The Gambling Research Center at the University of Hohenheim, dedicated to exploring the wide area of gaming and gambling on a scientific basis, exists since 2004. INTRALOT S.A. was among the first companies to join the sponsorship association supporting the research center. Without the dedicated and reliable support of companies such as INTRALOT S.A., the growth and scope of activities of the Gambling Research Center are inconceivable. Milton Rojas, CEDRO, Peru In our country there is little support from official institutions for research and, in general, for addressing the issues surrounding addictive behaviors. INTRALOT has made a valuable contribution to our mission and to enhancing our therapeutic equipment. This support has key positive impact on the prevention of problem gambling. 138 | Stakeholder Engagement Anthony Gortzis, President European Business Ethics Network, Greece As of 2007 INTRALOT has partnered with EBEN, embracing its corporate standard and the commitment to the principles of social responsibility, ethical and transparent governance, and environmental accountability foreseen therein. The company is one of our most cherished members and has effectively adopted and perfected the standard, integrating it into core business strategy and creating shared value for stakeholders and society alike. Brian Miller, Director, Atlanta Cancer Care Foundation, USA The support of INTRALOT, Inc. and the employees has given a much needed sense of relief to some patients who are suffering with a terminal illness. The support provided during the holiday months has allowed many of them to enjoy their families and see smiles on the faces of their children. That would not have been possible without the generous contributions of food and gifts to these families, who are struggling with declining health and very little means. Stakeholder Engagement | 139 140 | Environmental Sustainability Environmental Sustainability | 141 10.1 Policy Overview The gaming sector is among those with relatively low impact on the environment. Most of the sector’s footprint can be attributed to the consumption of natural resources for business operations, such as energy and water, and for product packaging as well as shipping & handling, like timber and plastic. Furthermore, significant environmental impact stems from the global reach of INTRALOT corporate operations and consequent emission of GHG from air travel of corporate staff. With regards to hardware technology, INTRALOT’s production process utilizes natural resources such as metals and electronic components. Even though INTRALOT operates in a lowThe role of the company is to organize, control and impact production sector, its products embrace coordinate all the stages of WEEE management, eco-efficiency from the design phase through to which includes collection, transport, temporary production, operation and de-commission stages. storage and processing of WEEE.

Additional materials are utilized in the process of shipping and handling of technology equipment. In 2014, the company made a first effort to measure the consumption of raw materials in the production process. The measurement made focuses on the production units that manufacture self-service terminals and does not include data from outsourced hardware production. The results follow: TABLE 2: MATERIALS USED IN HARDWARE PRODUCTION* Type of Materials 2014(kg) Wood 10,988 Plastics 4,201 Metals 263,395 Electronics 45,246 Cables 2,585 * Estimate based on in-house production units. 10.4 Transition to Cloud INTRALOT is making steady progress in the evolution towards green IT using virtualized environments and cloud solutions, replacing standalone servers, for some IT and development services. The roll-out of INTRALOT’s cloud solution NEFOS (Novel, Extensive, Flexible, On-Demand, Secure) has been a success. Already used for the new corporate wide applications (IT Services), INTRALOT’s IT department has moved the testing of new software configurations, development, and consolidation of production servers to the virtualized environment. A solution that integrates international best practices & standards on Information security for cloud computing in the gaming sector, NEFOS has had significant positive impact on INTRALOT’s environmental footprint, through both energy and carbon dioxide savings, while enabling significant cost savings for the company. During the year 2014, INTRALOT replaced 31 physical servers by migrating their environments to virtual infrastructure. The migration was supported by three (3) new servers of low power consumption but high processing power. Environmental Sustainability | 145 The resulting savings and reduction in the environmental footprint follow in the table below.

The main materials that the Company utilizes for its operational needs are:  Paper;  Electrical & electronic supplies;  Toners;  Batteries. INTRALOT is sensitive to waste management issues that result from its operations. Waste is not sent to landfills but rather it is collected systematically and sent to a licensed recycling partner, which handles waste disposal in an appropriate and environmentally friendly manner. INTRALOT fully complies with the requirements of RoHS regulations concerning hazardous waste. As per safety regulations and corporate policy, all technical and maintenance requirements of petrol tanks used for central heating of corporate premises are regularly met and, as a consequence, the risk of a fuel spill is nil. To date there is no record of spills (oil, waste or, in general, fuels). INTRALOT’s expenditures on environmental protection cover the following:  Costs related to the processing and to Shipping & Handling of electric and electronic equipment towards recycling facilities; 146 | Environmental Sustainability  Costs related to the processing and to Shipping & Handling of toners towards recycling facilities;  Annual cost of membership in the Hellenic Recovery Recycling Corporation (HE.R.R.Co.) and in Appliances Recycling S.A.. Paper Paper is a raw material of chief importance for INTRALOT operations, due consumption in three main processes:  It is utilized in the production of tickets and game slips;  It is utilized as a consumable for daily office work;  It is utilized for packaging and labelling of technology equipment as well as gaming software and peripherals. Paper waste is regularly collected into special recycle bins placed on each floor of all company buildings. Specialized personnel are responsible for paper handling and regular shipping to a partner recycling company. In 2014, paper recycling has remained stable at 75% of total paper procurement.

This event constitutes a practical and symbolic measure against climate change. INTRALOT and subsidiaries and affiliates on all 5 continents participated by switching off the lights on their premises, both in offices and in production units, for one hour. In addition to corporate-level participation, INTRALOT encouraged its partners and clients and all its employees, including their families and friends, to join the initiative. INTRALOT continues to support the efforts of its Corporate Volunteer Group, created in 2005. The Volunteer Group actively engages in various social causes and outreaches near stakeholders and the wider public on matters of environmental protection. The Volunteer Group has created GREEN SITE, an electronic platform that supports their mission and publicizes their activities. 152 | Environmental Sustainability Environmental Sustainability | 153 154 | Sustainability Report 2014 Sustainability Report 2014 | 155 KEY PERFORMANCE DATA TABLE INTRALOT GROUP Economy (in thousand €) 2011 2012 2013 2014 Sales 1,202,354 1,374,021 1,539,430 1,853,164 Other income 28,452 18,602 17,361 19,309 Finance income 9,972 11,460 8,591 13,587 Total Revenue 1,240,778 1,404,083 1,567,395 1,886,060 Operating costs 979,946 1,106,423 1,247,155 1,571,938 Payments to providers of funds 44,206 53,929 54,457 89,828 Dividends paid 16,755 20,320 16,645 23,663 Interest paid 27,451 33,609 37,812 66,165 Operating income 153,806 177,536 194,831 175,445 Earnings before taxes and minorities 57,038 58,422 53,551 36,553 Earnings after taxes and minorities 17,701 6,116 -4,567 -49,546 Payments to government bodies 22,358 23,602 35,493 28,986 (taxes paid) Total assets 1,086,162 1,114,807 1,135,170 1,355,092 Invested capital (Equity plus Debt) 882,245 899,462 874,837 1,107,259 Marketplace (in thousand €) 2011 2012 2013 2014 Payments to suppliers 279,139 342,100 389,012 512,795 156 | Sustainability Report 2014 KEY PERFORMANCE DATA TABLE INTRALOT GROUP Employees 2011 2012 2013 2014 Total employees 5512 5541 5685 5488 Workforce turnover (%) 2.5 4.1 3.9 7.2 Employee wages and benefits (in 104,965 113,436 117,774 126,265 thousand €) Number of hours of employee 64,369 training Environment 2011 2012 2013 2014 Water consumption headquarters 6,377 6,249 6,783 5,792 (m3) Water consumption subsidiaries (m3) 9,522 Petrol consumption for heating 30,000 22,100 19,450 28,625 headquarters (lt) Green House Gas Emissions, scope 13,474,4 1 & 2 (in tons CO2) Electricity consumption (KWh) 17,632,680 Sustainability Report 2014 | 157 158 | Sustainability Report 2014 Sustainability Report 2014 | 159 Chapter 1.

This Report contains, mainly, information related to our social and environmental policies, practices and initiatives. In the context of improvement of sustainability disclosures according to GRI G4, INTRALOT gathered data concerning selected Group subsidiaries. The scope of the disclosures made in the present report refers to INTRALOT SA and a sample of 18 subsidiaries, and covers the calendar year 2014 unless otherwise noted. The sample of subsidiaries was chosen on the basis of the following criteria:  Contribution to Group revenues;  Balanced representation of three main corporate contract types: licensed operations, technology supply and Management contracts (as per fig. 2 of chapter 1 of the report);  Significant potential economic, social and/or environmental impact (positive and/or negative) of corporate presence on the local communities;  Financial consolidation. Further information about the INTRALOT Group, including financial, product or services information is presented in the corporate Annual Financial Report, available at www.intralot. com. This report was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, which provide a generally accepted framework for reporting social, economic and environmental performance. This Report contains Standard Disclosures from the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines for Sustainability Reporting and is prepared in order to satisfy the requirements of G4 Core Option. This Option provides the background against which INTRALOT communicates the impacts of its economic, environmental and social and governance performance. Sustainability Context & Stakeholder Inclusiveness The scope of the Sustainability Report is to depict the impact of the business activities of INTRALOT on the economy, the society and the environment, in order to inform institutional investors, employees, suppliers, society, regulatory authorities, business partners, stockholders, as well as those interested in Corporate Responsibility and Sustainable Development issues. 166 | Sustainability Report 2014 INTRALOT actively seeks the engagement of relevant social groups, both informally through focus groups, events, debates and formally via opinion surveys, public presentations and publications in the identification of issues, policies and appropriate strategies promoting responsible gaming practices, and the company strives to incorporate these views into its products and services. As a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, INTRALOT is committed to the implementation and dissemination of the organization’s principles. The GRI G4 guidelines have provided a sound basis for the selection of the material issues that are presented in the Sustainability report so as to meet its purpose of offering an effective communication tool (COP) with its stakeholders. Materiality & Completeness During the preparation of the Report, INTRALOT takes into account the dialogue with its stakeholders, conclusions drawn from survey research conducted in local communities and near customers, suppliers and employees, requests for disclosures from financial analysts and the wider public as well as observations made by inspection and auditing bodies. With this approach, the Group endeavors to continue to implement activities under its commitment to Sustainable Development. Materiality assessments are used to help the company to focus its sustainable development report on those issues that are most important to its external and internal stakeholders. The process is developed in line with the GRI guidance on materiality and completeness. It involves identifying issues affecting the company’s business and its stakeholders, and prioritizing these issues considering internal and external perspectives. INTRALOT gathers information and views from a wide range of stakeholders, including institutional investors, employees, suppliers, society, regulatory authorities, business partners, stockholders, NGOs and the media. From this data, it assesses the impact that sustainable development issues have externally, in terms of society and the environment, and corporate compliance with policies and commitments. INTRALOT also considers the importance of the issues for its stakeholders when they are making judgments about the company’s sustainable development performance. Following a materiality assessment process, INTRALOT evaluates how important an issue is internally to its operations. The company examines the potential impact of the issue(s) on its financial performance, brand and reputation, on stakeholder relationships, on production and ability to meet customers’ needs, and evaluates the risks and possible ramifications of non-compliance. Sustainability Report 2014 | 167 All material aspects (management approach disclosures & indicators), sufficient to reflect significant economic, environmental and social impacts, are presented analytically in Appendices I & III. Report Balance & Comparability The Report covers INTRALOT Group activities worldwide, including its subsidiaries, but not joint ventures, suppliers or any other third party related to the Company. The expectations of stakeholders as well as the importance of specific issues to the Company are taken into consideration in order to determine which issues should be included in the Report. This Report covers the complete range of Economic, Social and Environmental issues that stem from the Company’s activity, without limiting the scope and boundary of the report. The company’s corporate commitment to the guidelines of GRI and UNGC support the presentation of information in a manner that enables the reader to identify changes in policies and performance. Using the report, stakeholders can easily compare information reported on economic, social and environmental performance against Group’s past performance (previous reports) and, to the degree possible, against the performance of the sector. Accuracy & Clarity Qualitative approaches to economic, environmental and social issues (Disclosures on Management Approach) and detailed quantitative measurements (Indicators) used for Sustainability reporting assure the accuracy of the provided information. The report’s structure aims to facilitate access to information by the reader. Graphics and tables assist in making information in the report clear and understandable. Timeliness & Reliability The information, facts and data in this report refer to the period between January and December 2014, unless where noted. Sustainability reporting has been set by the company to an annual cycle. The data and information presented in this Report are collected on the basis of monitoring procedures of the Company, as well as on the basis of informational databases of various systems. In some areas, where unedited non-primary data are presented, the information follows the estimation method using the relevant guidelines, indicated in the text. 168 | Sustainability Report 2014 External Assurance For this sustainability report, INTRALOT has not assigned verification to a third party.
