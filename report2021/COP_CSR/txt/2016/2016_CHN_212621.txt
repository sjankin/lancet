CEO Statement 2015 was another successful CSR year for NetDimensions where we continued to build on the foundations we put in place back in 2013. With our highest companywide CSR budget to date, we featured a number of meaningful CSR events and initiatives throughout the year contributing to the Ten Principles under the United Nations Global Compact (“Ten Principles”) and the communities we are part of. Characterizing our increasing CSR efforts in 2015 were NetDimensions winning the Partner of the Year Award by NGO LINGOs and NetDimensions being awarded a Silver rating by EcoVadis, a global CSR assessment company providing supplier sustainability ratings for global supply chains. Going forward, we shall continue to commit to the Ten Principles, improve our CSR practices and build towards a better and more sustainable society and business environment. We thank our employees and partners for their continuing support for our CSR efforts and look forward to our successful continuation of this exciting and important journey. Sincerely yours, Mr. Jay Shaw CEO & Managing Director www.NetDimensions.com 3 2.

Executive Summary 2015 started off with volunteers from NetDimensions’ Hong Kong office participating in the 2015 Hong Kong Walk for Millions organized by the charity Community Chest. NetDimensions matched all sponsor amounts raised by our volunteering employees which resulted in a total raised amount of US$2,900 for the Community Chest. We continued with creating further CSR awareness amongst our employees and partners by redeveloping and substantially improving our ‘Interactive Dialogue System’ (see COP 2014) and requiring 100% of our employees to (re-)take ethics and CSR training through our internal NetDimensions Talent Suite Learning Management System. Nepal was hit by disastrous earthquakes in April and May 2015, killing over 9,000 people and injuring tens of thousands more. NetDimensions launched a companywide fundraising campaign in conjunction with Save the Children Hong Kong in May 2015, raising a total of US$5,700 for the provision of shelter kits, baby kits, tarpaulins, blankest, kitchen kits and solar lamps to children and their families hit by the earthquakes. Throughout the year, we continued to work with LINGOs and saw them increasing the use of the NetDimensions-donated NetDimensions Talent Suite Learning Management System substantially. LINGOs now has a total of 67 of their member NGOs (and approximately 14,000 active users) working with our NTS system. On Giving Tuesday, NetDimensions also communicated LINGOs fundraising efforts through its social media channels, reaching over 1,000 followers. As recognition for work done by NetDimensions over 2015, LINGOs awarded NetDimensions with its 2015 Partner of the Year award. Towards the end of the year, NetDimensions organized another company-wide blood-drive in its Hong Kong and USA offices, donating liters of blood to patients in need in our communities. We also sponsored, and volunteered in, a Hong Kong Heep Hong Society event for children with special needs, donated over 150 feminine hygiene kits to NGO Days for Girls (Philippines) for girls in Baguio, Philippines, contributing to approximately 450 years of uninterrupted schooling for these girls, and donated around US$3,000 to a number of charities globally. Towards the end of the year, NetDimensions was awarded with a Silver rating by EcoVadis, a global CSR assessment company providing supplier sustainability ratings for global supply chains, meaning that we scored comfortably in the top 30% of companies evaluated by EcoVadis. This as well provided an objective demonstration of NetDimensions’ substantial and change-making CSR efforts and we hope to continue making progress in this regard. www.NetDimensions.com 5 The following sections summarize NetDimensions’ engagement with the United Nations Global Compact in 2015 in more detail. They also reflect on CSR goals we had set in 2014 for 2015 and set new goals under the Ten Principles for NetDimensions to strive for in 2016. NetDimensions will continue to communicate on progress under the United Nations Global Compact, and aims to continuously improve its business practices and environment in line with the Global Compact. www.NetDimensions.com 6 4. Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses 4.1 Introduction Respect and support of Human Rights continue to be key to our philosophy on how we do business and treat our employees, partners and counterparts. Over the course of 2015 we took a number of steps to promote the UNGC principles related to Human Rights in our business and value chain. Below is a summary of our achievements in this area and of how we lived up to the measurements we had set ourselves for the year in our COP 2014. We will also set new goals for 2016 to continue our efforts to enhance, respect and/or improve human right in our company and business environment. 4.2 Achievements 4.2.1 Blood Drive A substantial number of employees from NetDimensions’ Hong Kong and Atlanta (USA) offices voluntarily donated blood to local blood banks in November in their support and respect of human rights and health. We believe blood donations are important because blood is a unique fluid required for people to live that cannot be made other than by a human body itself, hence can only be obtained through donations, and can save people’s lives. www.NetDimensions.com 7 4.2.2 Heep Hong Society NetDimensions sponsored Hong Kong based Heep Hong Society’s Halloween Dress-up Party for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, AD/HD, specific learning difficulties and other special needs on October 17, 2015. The event was a great success and both the children attending and NetDimensions staff members involved had an enjoyable and educational afternoon with lots of laughter and interaction. For over half a century, Heep Hong Society has been providing professional training and education in Hong Kong to children of different abilities and their families, with the mission of helping these children develop their potential and lead a fulfilling life. www.NetDimensions.com 8 4.2.3 Fundraising Nepal Earthquakes We started a company-wide fundraising campaign with Save the Children (Hong Kong) on May 21st to help the children and families affected by the 7.8 and 7.3 magnitude earthquakes in Nepal last April and May, respectively. Save the Children volunteers were on the ground within 48 hours after the first earthquake. During the first month of their involvement, they reached over 127,000 people including 76,000 children. Their life saving aid includes the provision of shelter kits, baby kits, tarpaulins, blankets, kitchen kits, and solar lamps. Companywide we managed to raise a total of US$ 2,872 in donations from our global offices and the Company matched these donations dollar for dollar, meaning that we donated Save the Children a total of US$ 5,744, good for 120 kitchen sets to 120 Nepalese families in need to prepare, cook and eat hygienically, containing essential items such as pots, cutlery, mugs, and plates. 4.2.4 Days for Girls We donated over 150 feminine hygiene kits to NGO Days for Girls (Philippines) for girls in Baguio, Philippines, contributing to approximately 450 years of accumulated uninterrupted schooling for these girls. Days for Girls International is a grassroots 501(c)3 non-profit with the vision that all girls and women in the world need to have ready feasible access to quality sustainable hygiene and health education by 2022. www.NetDimensions.com 9 4.2.5 End-of-year charity donation We initiated the end-of-year-US$1-per-employee-per-month charity donation where NetDimensions contributed a total of US$12 per employee to a number of charities as chosen by NetDimensions’ staff members through an online poll. The poll resulted in monetary donations being made to Kinderund Jugendhospiz Regenbogenland (Germany), ABS-CBN Foundation (Philippines), Ryan Seacrest Foundation (USA), Mercy Ships (USA/Global) and Cherry Trees (UK). In addition, we also donated to the Phoenix Foundation Uganda for the establishment of an orphanage in Uganda. Africa. 4.2.6 Fair trade Coffee To show respect to local coffee farmers and their rights to a fair existence, NetDimensions continued to use 100% fair trade coffee in its Hong Kong offices. 4.2.7 CSR and Ethics Training Throughout the year, we (re-)trained 100% of our global staff in Ethics, anti-bribery and CSR principles through our own NetDimensions Talent Suite Learning Management System. 4.2.8 Walk for Millions – the Community Chest of Hong Kong 2015 started off with around 20 volunteers from NetDimensions’ Hong Kong office participating in the 2015 Hong Kong Walk for Millions organized by the charity Community Chest. NetDimensions matched all sponsor amounts raised by our volunteering employees which resulted in a total raised amount of US$2,900 for the Community Chest. The Community Chest of Hong Kong is an independent, Hong Kongbased non-profit organization. As one of the most important charities in Hong Kong, The Community Chest serves as an umbrella organization to provide grants to a wide range of charities and community projects, especially in relation to elderly services, family and child welfare services, medical and health services, community development services and the environment. www.NetDimensions.com 10 4.3 'Measuring Goals 2013 # 2013 COP Goal % Achieved Summary 1 100% of our staff shall have 100% 100% of NetDimensions staff completed the updated Business members (re-)took this course Conduct, Ethics and CSR awareness through our internal course NetDimensions Talent Suite Learning Management System during the year 2 Organize at least 3 CSR 100% Counting the Blood-drive, events/efforts in relation to these Walkathon, Nepal Fundraising principles and Heep Hong society volunteering event as CSR events, we organized 4 CSR events in relation to these principles last year 3 Submit the COP2014 to UNGC and 100% We submitted our COP2014 to remain an active participant under the UNGC on 6 February 2015 UNGC 4 Increase total annual CSR spending 100% We increased our company(calculated in time and budget) wide spent (calculated in time compared to 2014 by at least 25% and budget) on CSR efforts by around 67.5% during 2015 compared to 2014 5 Change 100% of NetDimensions’ 74% Percentage of fair trade coffee global coffee bean consumption to fair beans out of the total trade coffee beans consumed worldwide grew from 1.7% in 2014 to 74% in 2015 www.NetDimensions.com 11 4.4 Setting goals for 2016 We target to achieve the following in 2016 in relation to UNGC’s Principles in relation to Human Rights: 1. 100% of our staff shall have (re-)completed the Business Conduct, Ethics and CSR awareness course; 2.

NetDimensions will not tolerate or accept any forced, compulsory and/or child labor within its company and value chain. Below is an overview of our 2015 efforts in relation to the UNGC Labor-related Principles and related goals we set for 2016. 5.2 Achievements 5.2.1 LINGOs Throughout the year, we continued to work with, and support LINGOs and saw them increasing the use of the NetDimensions-donated NetDimensions Talent Suite Learning Management System substantially. LINGOs now has a total of 80 of their member NGOs (and approximately 22,000 active users) working with our NTS system. On Giving Tuesday, NetDimensions also communicated LINGOs fundraising efforts through its social media channels, reaching over 1,000 followers. As recognition for work done by NetDimensions over 2015, LINGOs awarded NetDimensions with its 2015 Partner of the Year award. As communicated in our 2013 COP, NetDimensions committed to providing its proprietary developed learning platform NetDimensions Talent Suite free of charge to NGO LINGOs and the Last Mile Learning initiative which will make world-class courses and learning opportunities available online at no cost in areas such as basic finance, basic management, project management and other development-specific topics. These courses will be delivered to users via the NetDimensions Learning Management System and accessed through either the Global Last Mile Learning portal or national portals run by local associations and training providers. All content on the platform will be available in various online formats as well as in packages of www.NetDimensions.com 13 facilitation and participant materials for face-to-face instruction. All materials are targeted to be available in a number of languages, including French, English and Portuguese. The core learning paths of Last Mile Learning can be used to develop key management skills in young developing economy entrepreneurs, local NGOs and government ministries as well as locally established non-profits and businesses. 5.2.2. Upgraded the ‘Interactive Dialogue System’ (‘IDS’) We upgraded and enhanced the IDS developed last year substantially throughout the year. Our internal wiki pages now include an easy accessible CSR space, introducing the CSR Committee, its Mission, Goals and Responsibilities, our internal CSR Policies and Documents, CSR Activities organized and planned, as well as the UNGC and its ten principles. We also started a CSR blog (“CloSeR to you”) through our wiki pages and email alerts and published through this channel company-wide nine (9) times during 2015. Communication between our staff and the CSR Committee can take place through wiki and through emails at csr@netdimensions.com and this has been proven effective over the year. www.NetDimensions.com 14 5.2.3 GRI reporting initiative We were successful in gathering around fifteen (15) 2014 Key Performance Indicators for the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and are now in the process of accumulating the relevant data for 2015.

Environment Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9: Encourage the development and use of environmentally friendly technologies 6.1 Introduction NetDimensions is determined to reduce its carbon footprint and add its weight in preserving the earth’s environment and livability for next generations. Whilst NetDimensions is involved in software development, marketing and sales, hence active in a low carbon exhausting industry, NetDimensions recognizes that it can nevertheless act responsibly and make a difference in relation to reducing carbon footprint. Below is a summary of our minor achievement related to the UNGC Principles surrounding Environments and our more ambitious goals for 2015. 6.2 Achievements 6.2.1 Small Start Policy Our company-wide Small Start Policy is easily available through our IDS and there seems to be a growing cultural awareness in our global offices to reduce our carbon footprint. 6.2.2 Supplier and Partner Code of Conduct We continued to communicate our Supplier and Partner Code of Conduct to our partners and suppliers. The Supplier and Partner Code of Conduct clearly articulates NetDimensions’ views on CSR and its support of the Ten Principles under the UNGC. Whilst the code is not binding to those parties it has been communicated to, it does send out a very clear message on the values NetDimensions thinks are critical in doing business. NetDimensions included a copy of the code in a number of its new supplier and business partner contracts. Over the course of the year, an approximate total of 15 partner and supplier organizations have received and read a copy of the code. www.NetDimensions.com 17 www.NetDimensions.com 18 6.3 Measuring Goals set for 2015 # 2014 COP Goal % Achieved Summary 1 Continue implementing the Supplier 90% We continued implementing and Partner Code of Business to as the Supplier and Partner Code many partners and suppliers as of Business to new partner and possible – we will monitor the total suppliers and communicated number of organizations the code was the code to around 15 communicated to throughout 2015 companies in 2016 2 Starting to monitor and calculate 100% We started monitoring this company-wide air traffic in miles as a number with the first available metric to measure and reduce our data representing the year company air travel per employee in 2014 following years 3 Starting to monitor and calculate 100% We started monitoring this company-wide office kilowatt usage number with the first available as a metric to measure and reduce data representing the year our kilowatt usage per employee in 2014 following years 4 Starting to monitor and calculate 100% We started monitoring this company-wide office paper usage as number with the first available a metric to measure and reduce our data representing the year paper usage per employee in 2014 following years 5 Organize at least one CSR event in 50% Whilst most of our 2015 CSR relation to this principle events were related to Human Rights, the Walk for Millions walkathon organized by The Community Chest of Hong Kong also supports environmental charities in Hong Kong www.NetDimensions.com 19 6.4 Setting goals for 2016 We target to achieve the following in 2016 regarding to UNGC’s Principles in relation to Environment: 1.
