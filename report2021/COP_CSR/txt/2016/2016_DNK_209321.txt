IN OUR FIRST ANNUAL COMMUCNICATION ON PROGRESS, WE DESCRIBE OUR ACTIONS TO INTEGRATE THE GLOBAL COMPACT AND ITS PRINCIPLES INTO OUR BUSNIESS STRATEGY, CULTURE AND DAILY WORK. WE ARE ALSO COMMITED TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS USING OUR PRIMARY CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION. WHEN SIGNING UP FOR THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT MEMBERSHIP, WE ESTABLISHED A CSR TEAM WITHIN THE COMPANY. THIS WAS INITIATED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL TOOK AN ACTIVE PART OF THE MEMBERSHIP AND WORKING ON IMPROVING WITHIN THE 10 PRINCIPLES. OUT OF THE 4 AREAS HUMAN RIGHTS, LABOUR, ENVIRONMENT AND ANTI CORRUPTION, WE HAVE DECIDED THAT OUR MAIN FOCUS WILL BE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PART, AS OUR INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE MOST NON ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY. THE FIRST STEP TAKEN WAS TO SEND OUT A QUESTIONARE WHICH COVERED THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT PRINCIPLES. THE GOAL WAS TO MAP THE LEVEL OF CONCIOUSNESS OF THE 10 PRINCIPLES WITHIN OUR 7 BIGGEST SUPPLIERS. OUR GOAL FOR THE NEXT COMING YEAR IS TO FINALIZE OUR CODE OF CONDUCT, HAVING IT SIGNED BY ALL OF OUR SUPPLIERS IN OUR PRODUCTION CHAIN SO WE CAN OBTAIN TRANSPERENCY WITH ALL OUR MAIN SUPPLIERS.
