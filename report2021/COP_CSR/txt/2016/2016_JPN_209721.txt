This committee is tasked with investigating and analyzing the projects in which impairment losses were recognized. Based on the findings, the committee discusses various improvement measures from diverse and broad perspectives with an eye toward increasing corporate value, and subsequently the ­committee makes proposals to the Group regarding areas requiring improvement. In consideration of these proposals and reflections on past events, the Group has determined the areas in which it will pursue improvement and formulated the new medium-term management plan— “Be the Best, Be the One 2017” (BBBO2017)—accordingly.

The Sumitomo Corporation Group places great importance on conducting business activities that earn the trust of society, as represented by the inclusion of the phrase “integrity and sound management” in the Management Principles. I realize these impairment losses will undoubtedly erode the trust of stakeholders that the Group has worked hard to earn over the years, and I am fully aware of the seriousness of this situation. We are fully devoted to regaining any trust we may have lost by implementing managerial reforms and measures to improve profitability and performance in order to return the Group to a growth track. I would like to ask for your continued support and understanding as we undertake this endeavor. 14 Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 Be the Best, Be the One 2017 (BBBO2017) To be launched in fiscal 2015, the new medium-term management plan— Managerial Reforms and Growth Strategies Be the Best, Be the One 2017 (BBBO2017)—calls for us to faithfully Please refer to P. 20, the Special Feature entitled ­execute managerial reforms and growth strategies. “Medium-Term Management Plans— Results of BBBO2014 and Overview of BBBO2017,” for details on BBBO2017. Managerial Reforms The first step of our managerial reforms will be to improve decision-making processes and strengthen risk management systems. In regard to decisionmaking processes, the Management Council will be positioned as the highest authority on business execution matters, thereby creating a system through which important decisions will be made following more multifaceted discussions incorporating a wider range of opinions. Reforms will be extended to the Board of Directors as well; we have strengthened supervisory functions for management execution and created a system for discussion that places greater weight on formulating Companywide strategies and basic policies. As for risk management systems, we have set up a process to deliberate large-scale investments at multiple stages and different levels. Through this process, investment candidates will be discussed several times by the Investment Committee at both the business unit level and the Companywide level as well as during the stages of examining and conducting investments. In this way, we hope to more deeply investigate large-scale investment candidates from various perspectives based on their business feasibility and relation to the strategies of associated divisions. In addition, we will steadily implement other managerial reforms, such as setting stricter investment evaluation standards and revising investment execution frameworks. By creating and displaying results through these reforms, we aim to regain lost trust. At the same time, we will pursue improvements in overall operational efficiency through such means as delegating authority in a manner that prevents these managerial reforms from adversely impacting business—by creating management redundancies or slowing decision-making speed, for example. Growth Strategies Under BBBO2017, we will push forward with growth strategies in the metal Social Infrastructure, Retail Businesses in Asia products, transportation, and media businesses, all areas of strength for the Please refer to P. 26, the Special Feature entitled Company. Moreover, the three areas of automobiles, infrastructure, and lifestyle “Initiatives under BBBO2017,” for details on BBBO2017. and information services will be positioned as targets of Companywide, crossorganizational collaboration in consideration of projected medium-to-long-term macroeconomic trends. Furthermore, we have identified high-potential industrial fields and regions and will continue strengthening efforts to cultivate businesses in these areas on a Companywide basis. Such strategic industrial focuses include energy-related businesses, retail businesses in Asia, and food and agriculture-related businesses, while Brazil, India, Myanmar, Turkey, and sub-Saharan Africa have been identified as strategic regional focuses. Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 15 Management Strategy and Achievements—Initiatives to Realize “What We Aim to Be in 2019”— Message from the President and CEO: To Our Stakeholders The majority of the impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2014 can be attributed to the mineral resources and energy businesses. For the time being, we intend to devote our attention to starting up large-scale projects presently in the preparation phase, such as the Ambatovy nickel project, and reducing the costs of currently operating projects to improve the quality of our asset portfolio. Learning from our experience with these impairment losses, we have set upper limits for investments in individual projects and otherwise strengthened risk management systems. We have also established a specialist organization comprised of individuals with superior market analysis and technological evaluation capabilities assembled from both inside and outside of the Company. We believe demand in the mineral resources and energy field will ­increase in the future as a result of medium-to-long-term growth in the global population as well as in the economies of emerging countries. ­Upstream mineral resources and energy businesses will still be viewed as an area of operations crucial to the future growth of the Sumitomo ­Corporation Group, and we therefore plan to continue operating these businesses going forward, albeit under newly reconstructed systems. Enhancement of Individual Capability and Organizational Capability As an integrated trading company, the fundamental essence of our operations is to create new businesses, and this is a task that is spearheaded by our human resources. For this reason, human resource development has 16 Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 been designated as a priority of utmost importance, and we have continued to provide our employees with opportunities to gain a diverse range of experience immediately upon joining the Company. In this manner, we have been working to enhance the capabilities of Sumitomo Corporation’s human resources. The human resources we have developed through these efforts are establishing various businesses for the Company. I suspect that our employees will be quite capable of creating new value by communicating with local customers and consumers in emerging countries, which are expected to continue developing on the back of brisk economic activity, and thereby form an understanding of their needs. Securing of Financial Soundness A top priority of BBBO2017 is to regain the balance between Core Risk Buffers and Risk-adjusted Assets. The impairment losses recognized in fiscal 2014 resulted in risk assets growing to the point that they exceeded the extent of the Core Risk Buffers, destroying this balance that has underpinned our management. While this upset will not seriously impede the management of the Group, there is no doubt that we must restore this balance at the earliest date possible. At the same time, management is placing a greater emphasis on cash flows to help ensure sustainable growth. The gross balance of interestbearing debt on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position is approximately ¥4.0 trillion. Characterized by low interest rates, the current financial climate in Japan is conducive to a management approach that utilizes borrowings to fund investments and exercise leverage. However, for Sumitomo Corporation to realize sustainable growth, it is crucial to establish a financial constitution that is not overly dependent on interest-bearing debt. We therefore aim to limit investments and shareholder returns to within the scope of the cash generated by the Company through operating cash flows and asset replacement. Accordingly, BBBO2017 contains the basic policy of maintaining a positive free cash flow in terms of the threeDividends per share year, post-dividend total. (Yen) 80 Shareholder Returns 60 50 50 50 46 47 40 Sumitomo Corporation’s basic policy is to provide shareholders with stable dividends over the long term, and we also aim to raise per share dividend 20 payments by pursuing profit growth in the medium-to-long term. We are highly committed to achieving the targets of BBBO2017 and have 0 thus set ¥50 per share as the lower limit for dividend payments over the period 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 (FY) (Plan) of the plan. Dividend amounts for each fiscal year will be decided based on considerations of basic profit and cash flow levels and with a consolidated dividend payout ratio of 25% as our target. In fiscal 2015, we intend to issue dividend payments of ¥50 per share. Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 17 Management Strategy and Achievements—Initiatives to Realize “What We Aim to Be in 2019”— Message from the President and CEO: To Our Stakeholders Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy and the Company’s Long-Term Vision In 2019, we will celebrate the centennial anniversary of the foundation of the Osaka North Harbour Company Limited, the predecessor of Sumitomo Corporation. I hope to make the Sumitomo Corporation Group into a conglomerate that can thrive stably and continuously for another 50 years, 100 years, and on without end. By this, I do not refer to simply keeping the Company profitable; rather, I feel it is important for us to continue growing by adhering to the Management Principles, which are based on Sumitomo’s business philosophy, the principal reason behind Sumitomo’s ability to survive for 400 years. One of the core concepts in Sumitomo’s business philosophy is embodied in the phrase “Benefit for self and others, private and public interests are one and the same.” This phrase is based on the belief that Sumitomo’s business does not exist only for the sake of Sumitomo, but should be an endeavor that contributes to the greater society. Likewise, I feel all ­Sumitomo Corporation Group employees should fully exert themselves to faithfully serve the stakeholders affected by their specific area of business. If all employees act in this manner, I am confident that Sumitomo Corporation will become a better company as a result. Sumitomo’s business philosophy also includes the virtue of integrity and sound management, a core business value. Sumitomo founder Masatomo Sumitomo penned this philosophy in a letter to a family member written in his later years, and this philosophy has continued to be handed down from generation to generation over the 400-year history of the Sumitomo Group. I believe Sumitomo’s business philosophy embodies the distinctive business approach of Sumitomo Corporation. Staying true to this approach, we will push forward with managerial reforms and achieve our earnings targets with the aim of regaining any trust we may have lost with our stakeholders. If we look to the past, we will see the 400-year history of Sumitomo. If we look to the future, we will see ourselves on the path toward realizing Please refer to “Our History” on P. 10. “What We Aim to Be.” We have continued to value trust throughout our history, and this will not change going forward, a fact that all members of the Sumitomo Corporation Group, myself included, should once again take to heart. 18 Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 In Closing In formulating the new medium-term management plan, Sumitomo Corporation’s management engaged in thorough discussions with regard to measures that must be taken for the Company to regain lost trust. It was determined that the shortest path was to regain trust in the same way that we have earned it over our long history: by tenaciously pushing forward with managerial reforms and strengthening earning power, followed by displaying the results of these efforts to our stakeholders. Devoted to winning back the trust of our stakeholders as soon as possible, everyone at the Sumitomo Corporation Group is united in their commitment to advancing BBBO2017 and working to return quickly to a growth track. I humbly ask for your continued understanding and support of our efforts. August 2015 Kuniharu Nakamura President and CEO Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 19 SPECIAL FEATURE 1 Medium-Term Management Plans— Results of BBBO2014 and Overview of BBBO2017 In May 2013, the Sumitomo Corporation Group announced its vision of “What We Aim to Be in 2019, Our Centennial Year,” together with the “Be the Best, Be the One 2014” (BBBO2014) medium-term management plan. Under BBBO2014, we worked to thoroughly enhance the Group’s earning power, and we were successful in reinforcing our earnings base, particularly with regard to non-mineral resource businesses. However, we were forced to record impairment losses centered on the upstream mineral resources and energy businesses, and we therefore failed to meet the quantitative targets of the plan. In April 2015, we launched a new medium-term management plan— “Be the Best, Be the One 2017” (BBBO2017)—which defines our intention to make Groupwide efforts to overcome issues and to outline a path toward the realization of what we aim to be. What We Aim to Be in 2019, Our Centennial Year —Based on Our Management Principles and Activity Guidelines— We aim to be a corporate group that is recognized by society as meeting and exceeding the high expectations directed toward us, creating value that nobody else can match in ways befitting our distinctive identity. We aim to build a solid earnings base and aim for an even higher level of profit growth while maintaining ­financial soundness.

Loss for the year (attributable to owners of the parent) of ¥73.2 billion was posted in fiscal 2014, due to the impacts of lower resource prices and impairment losses totaling ¥310.3 b ­ illion, which were recorded with regard to several large-scale projects, such as a tight oil development project in the United States. Quantitative Targets Results FY2013 FY2014 FY2013 FY2014 Consolidated ¥240 billion ¥270 billion ¥223.1 billion ¥(73.2) billion Net Income (loss) Approx. 12% Risk-adjusted Return Ratio 10.9% — (each fiscal year) 3% or more Return on assets (ROA) 2.7% — (each fiscal year) Qualitative performance Under BBBO2014, we worked to thoroughly enhance our earning power by stimulating the metabolism of our business portfolio through means such as making the existing earnings pillars even more robust, achieving greater value for existing investment projects, fostering and developing new pillars of earnings for the future, and replacing assets. As a result, we were able to reinforce our earnings base centered on non-mineral resource businesses. In addition, we established the Special Committee on Managerial Reform to address the impairment loss issue, and this committee provided the Company with advice on how to improve corporate value. In consideration of this advice and reflections on past events, the Company has determined the areas in which it will pursue improvement.

One aspect of these reforms has been the deregulation of the electricity retail market. Since 2000, the restrictions for entering into the electricity industry have been sequentially lifted. Today, supply to large-scale users with electricity demand of more than 50 kW—a segment of the market accounting for approximately 60% of all electricity supplied—has been deregulated. The complete deregulation of the electricity retail market is scheduled for April 2016. This development will lift the restrictions currently placed on small-scale users, such as stand-alone households and small condominium complexes, allowing electricity sales targeting these users to be conducted freely.

The company provides users with electricity from an ideal mix of power from its three thermal power plants in Japan and power procured from other generators as well as companies possessing in-house generation facilities and the Japan Electric Power Exchange. In addition, Summit Energy is in the process of constructing a new biomass-fired thermal power plant, which will be among the largest in Japan upon its scheduled completion in 2017. At the same time, Jupiter Telecommunications Co., Ltd. (J:COM), a Cable TV and system operator in which the Company holds a 50% stake, is taking advantage of the aforementioned electricity regulatory system reforms to start an electricity retail business targeting medium-to-large-sized condominium complexes. J:COM conducts its cable TV operations in five areas throughout Japan: the Kanto and Kansai regions and the ­Sapporo, Sendai, and Kyushu areas. In these areas, a total of approximately 19 million households are equipped with the cables and other necessary infrastructure for receiving cable TV services. Of these households, roughly 5 million households were subscribed to J:COM’s services as of March 31, 2015, indicating that J:COM provides these services, which are a central fixture in the lives of customers, as the industry share leader. With cable TV operations that link it to communities and households, J:COM aims to become an indispensable part of its customers’ lives. This quest is guided by the concept of “J:COM Everywhere” that inspires this company to provide enjoyable, useful, and reliable services that can be accessed anywhere. Through collaboration with Summit Energy, which possesses its own generation capabilities and the ability to procure power from outside sources, J:COM arrived at the possibility of creating electricity retail operations. The Handa Biomass Power Plant (Aichi Prefecture) J:COM, boasting the largest share of Cable TV subscribing households in Japan Birth of “J:COM Electric Power” In December 2012, the “J:COM Electric Power” batch-electricity provision service for condominium complexes was created. This service was set up through an alliance between Summit Energy, which possesses its own generation capabilities and the ability to procure power from outside sources, and J:COM, which has cultivated a massive customer database and accumulated extensive know-how regarding billing systems and retail activities aimed at residential households. Through the “J:COM Electric Power” service, electricity procured by Summit Energy, with volume adjusted based on supply and demand circumstances, will pass through transformation facilities operated by J:COM and then be sold to individual households in medium-tolarge-sized condominium complexes. Not only will “J:COM Electric Power” offer electricity at lower rates than regional power companies, further discounts will be provided to users that bundle this service with other existing J:COM services, such as an Internet connection. Currently, there are approximately 1 million households in medium-to-large-sized condominium complexes and other facilities classified as large-scale users in J:COM’s service area, and only these are potential targets for the “J:COM Electric Power” batch-electricity provision service at the moment. However, after the complete deregulation of the electricity retail market, J:COM will be able to provide this service to stand-alone houses and small condominium complexes in its service area. With this influx of new potential users, the number of households able to take advantage of “J:COM Electric Power” will rise to roughly 19 million, representing a substantial expansion of the market for this service. 28 Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 Breakdown of Potential “J:COM Electric Power” Users in J:COM’s Service Area (household) April 2016~ Approx. 1 million “J:COM Electric Power” service to be Approx. made available to approx. 19 million 18 million Large-scale users Small-scale users High Low voltage Transformation voltage Medium-to-large-sized Summit condominium complexes J:COM Energy Low Low voltage voltage Stand-alone households, After deregulation in April 2016 small condominium complexes J A PA N The “J:COM Electric Power” service is currently being utilized in conjunction with Sumitomo Corporation’s condominium operations. For example, J:COM participated in developing the CLASSY HOUSE Kamikitazawa condominium complex from the product planning and design stages, leading this complex to introduce both the “J:COM Electric Power” service as well as J:COM’s electricity consumption tracking service “ECOREPO,” which allows users to view the amount of electricity they have consumed. This synergistic relationship presents an opportunity CLASSY HOUSE Kamikitazawa for market expansion for J:COM and a chance to use the Internet and cable TV services provided by this company to boost customer satisfaction. Going forward, J:COM will step up collaboration with the Company’s condominium operations to continue expanding usage of its services. Creation of Social Infrastructure Guided by the concept of “J:COM Everywhere,” J:COM strives to provide a diverse range of services that enrich the lives of customers in local communities.

Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 29 Management Strategy and Achievements—Initiatives to Realize “What We Aim to Be in 2019”— SPECIAL FEATURE 2 Initiatives under BBBO2017 2 Expanding Retail Businesses in Asia Contributing to the Advancement of Emerging Countries by Leveraging the Knowledge and Know-How That We Have Nurtured over Many Years in Business Strategic Industrial and Regional Focus Initiatives Thailand Shop Channel in Thailand Sumitomo Corporation established Jupiter Shop Channel Co., Ltd. (JSC), which is currently Japan’s largest TV shopping company, in 1996, and has pursued this business since that time. After its founding, JSC was successful in providing live broadcasts on a 24-hour-a-day, 365-day-a-year basis, a feat that was revolutionary at the time. Leveraging its strengths in creating and broadcasting TV shopping programs and its ability to procure unique products, this company was a major pioneer in expanding Japan’s TV shopping market. While growing the market, JSC has continued to broaden, simultaneously cementing its position as the industry leader. In consideration of this success, Sumitomo Corporation has continued to examine the possibility of further expanding JSC’s business foundations by commencing TV shopping operations in Asia and other rapidly growing emerging markets. In particular, we turned our focus to Thailand, which was ripe with business opportunities and possessed both the broadcasting infrastructure necessary for stable TV program transmissions and product tastes similar to those in Japan. Partnering with Central Department Store Limited, a core retail company in one of Southeast Asia’s largest conglomerations, and I.C.C. International Public Company Ltd., a central consumer goods wholesaler of the major Thai conglomerate the SAHA Group, JSC established SHOP Global (Thailand) Co., Ltd., in February 2013. SHOP Global draws on the wealth of expertise and experience these partners offer with regard to the consumer market in Thailand as well as their operating facilities, equipment, and other infrastructure. At the same time, SHOP Global has access to the program creation and product procurement know-how that JSC has accumulated in Japan. Leveraging these assets, SHOP Global is pushing forward with the development of its TV shopping operations in Thailand, which is one of Southeast Asia’s leading TV shopping markets. Sales at SHOP Global have continued to grow smoothly since broadcasts commenced in November 2013, and this company aims to conduct broadcasts on a 24-hour-a-day, 365-day-a-year basis, similar to those of JSC in the future. Immensely capable of supplying unique products and conducting live broadcasts, SHOP Global is work toward becoming Thailand’s largest TV shopping company. At the same time, this company is stimulating activity in the TV shopping market in Thailand and helping provide consumers with more rewarding experiences through its business. Creating a TV program that includes guests Supporting staff for live broadcasts 30 Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 Indonesia Automotive Retail Finance Businesses With a population of more than 240 million people, Indonesia has become a major automotive and motorcycle market among ASEAN countries.

Growth Strategies for Becoming What We Aim to Be We will further strengthen value chains centered on such products as steel sheets, tubular products, and aluminum to achieve further growth. Within the steel sheet-related field, we aim to be a leading supplier in the automobile-related field that provides a product lineup ranging from steel sheets through to components. As well as managing tubular product supply chains, in the tubular product field we will provide oilfield equipment, materials, and services to heighten added value. Also, aluminum businesses aim to build value chains in global markets by accelerating the development of production bases in areas from smelting operations upstream to rolling mills midstream. Q Please give us a review of BBBO2014. A We steadily implemented value chain strategies in accordance with plans. In the steel sheet-related field, we sought to expand businesses that supply electrical steel sheets, which are indispensable for the improvement of automotive fuel efficiency. To this end, we advanced initiatives to step up the growth of Kienle + Spiess Gmbh (K+S), one of Europe’s largest manufacturers and marketers of motor cores. We acquired K+S in 2013. In the tubular products field, we expanded synergies between our existing businesses and Edgen Group Inc., which we made a wholly owned subsidiary in November 2013 with a view to strengthening tubular products value chains, particularly in midstream and downstream areas. Regarding the non-ferrous metal products field, we started the implementation of the third-phase expansion of Press Metal Berhad’s alumiSpecialized vessel for transporting long rails num smelting business in Malaysia, which will bring total production capacity to 760,000 tons per year upon completion. Fiscal 2014 Results Profit for the year rose ¥5.9 billion year on year, to ¥32.5 billion, because North American tubular products businesses and steel service center businesses continued to perform robustly. Q Please tell us about the measures you are taking in BBBO2017. A We will deepen and enhance value chains in each field. The effect of recent falls in crude oil and gas prices is unavoidable in the short term. However, oil and gas development is expected to increase in tandem with 36 Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 Performance Highlights (Billions of yen) FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 Forecast Gross profit 97.2 103.5 96.0 Operating profit 34.6 37.4 – Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method 5.6 9.1 – Profit for the year (attributable to owners of the parent) 26.6 32.5 23.0 Basic profit 26.0 33.7 – Total assets 884.4 877.6 – the growth of energy demand over the medium-to-long term. Therefore, demand for tubular products and oilfield equipment and materials is likely to increase. Further, demand for transport materials and equipment is also expected to rise due to the development of railway infrastructure in emerging countries and modal shift initiatives in developed countries. Rising demand for electrical steel sheets is expected to contribute to improved automotive fuel efficiency. Increases in automotive unit production and vehicle-lightening needs will stimulate demand for aluminum-related products. In the steel sheet-related field, we aim to build a system that encompasses steel sheet businesses through to automotive component businesses based on our steel service center businesses. With respect to transport equipment and materials businesses, plans call for establishing an unrivaled position by extending operations from delivery to include the maintenance area. In the tubular products field, our goal is to establish a system that can provide one-stop ­services based on a lineup of materials and equipment that is centered on tubular products. With this goal in mind, we will strengthen the industry-leading global operational foundations of our oil country tubular goods businesses even further. Furthermore, we will develop the oilfield equipment, materials, and services field while realizing synergies with Edgen Group to build distribution networks for line pipes and specialty tubular products. Through these efforts, we will strengthen our ability to provide a one-stop range of equipment and materials centered on tubular products. Regarding the non-ferrous metal products field, we will expand our aluminum smelting business through the third-phase expansion of our aluminum smelting business in Malaysia. Q Could you please explain about CSR initiatives that you pursue through business activities? A We view managing health, safety, security, and the environment (HSSE) as an extremely important aspect of business activities. In the Tubular Products Division, we have built a global HSSE management system in accordance with our basic policy of giving priority to compliance and HSSE in all businesses. Aiming to eliminate industrial disasters and environmental accidents, we are strengthening organizational capabilities, educating ­personnel, conducting risk assessment, and sharing know-how through global HSSE network meetings. As a result of these efforts, the number of accidents is decreasing steadily. In fiscal 2014, we set out “Beyond Zero Harm” as a new slogan, which reflects our determination to inculcate and entrench HSSE as part of our corporate culture and make the absence of disasters and accidents a matter of course.

Increasing Equity Interest in Aluminum Smelting and ­Enlarging Ingot Trading Business Conditions Applications for such non-ferrous metals as aluminum and titanium are increasing. The market for these metals is likely to continue growing given the strong focus on improving the fuel efficiency of automobiles, aircraft, and other vehicles by lightening them. Strengths and Strategies Our aluminum trading activities have dominated the Japanese market. In order to enlarge our presence in the global market, we will accelerate further development of the value chain of the aluminum industry overseas, from upstream to midstream. Current Initiatives Aluminum ingots produced by Press Metal In our aluminum smelting business with Press Metal in Malaysia, with the establishment of stable operations following the second-phase expansion, we are undertaking third-phase P ress Metal is the largest aluminum manufacturer in Malaysia and is currently operating two aluminum smelting businesses in the state of Sarawak.

We obtained a 20% equity interest in the first and second phases of the project in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Further, the construction of a plant in the third-phase expansion has begun; the plant is expected to commence operation in early 2016. Total capacity on completion of the third-phase expansion will be 760,000 tons per year, and we will have obtained a 20% equity interest in each phase of the project. Together with our equity, metal supplied through our Australian smelting activities is also expanding. Particularly in Asia, as we expect more overseas forays among Japanese manufacturers and the localization of automotive manufacturing to grow demand for aluminum globally, we will concentrate efforts on further developing the global aluminum trading business through our partnership with Press Metal.

Growth Strategies for Becoming What We Aim to Be We will enhance the profitability of existing businesses rigorously while making earnings pillars stronger by incorporating related businesses. Further, we will actively tackle new businesses that have the potential to become future earnings sources, even taking on areas beyond the range of existing businesses. At the same time, we will analyze market conditions, economic trends, and potential objectively. Based on our conclusions, we will allocate management resources discriminatingly and develop the personnel required. Q Please give us a review of BBBO2014. A We expanded our earnings base through global business development initiatives. In the ship, aerospace and transportation systems field, although a lackluster shipping market affected ship businesses, aircraft leasing and other existing businesses performed solidly. In the automotive field, we grew such businesses as automobile manufacturing businesses in Mexico into new business pillars. At the same time, we focused efforts on maintaining and expanding existing businesses, including leasing businesses, financing businesses, and sales and distribution businesses. As for the construction equipment field, we grew sales and rental businesses in North America steadily, and we advanced projects to meet increasing demand in emerging markets. For example, we developed new businesses in Saudi Arabia. Further, in Asia’s retail field, we increased our business presence by investing An automobile manufacturing joint venture with Mazda Motor in an Indonesian commercial bank.

Q Please tell us about the measures you are taking in BBBO2017. A We will expand existing businesses by strategically investing capital, realizing returns, and replacing assets while advancing initiatives that respond to external conditions. We expect sales and rental businesses to expand because the increasing 40 Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 Performance Highlights (Billions of yen) FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 Forecast Gross profit 171.5 183.6 192.0 Operating profit 34.0 18.4 – Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method 27.5 31.7 – Profit for the year (attributable to owners of the parent) 47.6 40.6 50.0 Basic profit 47.5 51.4 – Total assets 1,570.1 1,756.4 – * The business results of previous fiscal years have been reclassified to reflect reorganization implemented on April 1, 2015. populations and rising living standards of rapidly growing emerging countries are likely to boost demand for automobiles and transportation steadily. Furthermore, stepped-up infrastructural development is heightening demand for construction equipment. Also, demand for aircraft leasing and railway development are growing centered on emerging countries. In ship businesses, we will replace such assets as owned and jointly owned ships and diversify the portfolio with our sights set on a future market recovery. In relation to aircraft, existing aircraft and engine leasing businesses will accumulate assets to increase earnings. At the same time, we plan to enter new fields, including the provision of component-related services and manufacturing businesses. Regarding railway-related businesses, we will implement existing EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects steadily while expanding high-speed railway projects and other businesses in emerging countries. In automobile businesses, focusing on emerging countries, we will enlarge the sales and distribution business, expand automobile and component manufacturing businesses, and grow and diversify retail financing and auto leasing businesses overseas. Also, we intend to proceed steadily with a plan to restructure tire businesses in North America. In the construction equipment field, we will increase the profitability of existing sales businesses by strengthening “the product support” (after-sales services), and expand rental businesses further. Q Could you please explain about CSR initiatives that you pursue through business activities? A Through our agricultural machinery sales businesses in India, we contribute to increasing agricultural productivity, strengthening the basis of food production, and heightening farmers’ quality of life. In India, which has the world’s second-largest farming population, we established an agricultural machinery sales company in partnership with Kubota Corporation in 2008. Since then, we have been selling high-quality agricultural machinery that reflects local needs. By combining Kubota’s advanced technology and expertise with our extensive experience in overseas marketing, ­this business will contribute to the solution of such issues as low agricultural productivity, which is attributable to a comparative lack of mechanization, labor shortages in rural areas brought about by increased industrialization and urbanization, and the rising demand for food that is accompanying growth of the economy and population. Furthermore, we believe that this business contributes to heightening farmers’ quality of life. Going forward, we will continue contributing to agricultural development in Tanzania, Myanmar, and other developing and emerging countries.

Growth Strategies for Becoming What We Aim to Be To expand our earnings foundations, we will increase the allocation of management resources on priority fields, such as overseas power infrastructure businesses, overseas renewable energy power generation businesses, domestic electricity businesses, and overseas industrial park businesses. We intend to expand overseas power infrastructure businesses mainly in Asia, the Middle East, the Americas, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The focus of our expansion of renewable energy power generation businesses will be offshore wind power. Meanwhile, domestic electricity businesses will focus efforts on expanding our power generation capacity and growing the scale of retail sales. In addition, overseas industrial park businesses will extend existing industrial parks and develop new industrial parks. Also, we will foster water infrastructure businesses and battery businesses as future pillars of earnings. Q Please give us a review of BBBO2014. A Profit for the year increased year on year due to the solid business results of the Tanjung Jati B Coal-Fired Power Plant in Indonesia and other overseas power infrastructure businesses. Overseas power infrastructure businesses began commercial operation of a gas-fired combined-cycle thermal power plant in the United Arab Emirates, participated in gas-fired combined-cycle thermal power plant projects in Kuwait and Ghana, and received orders for large-scale EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects in Malaysia and Vietnam. Renewable energy power generation businesses began commercial operation of wind and solar farms that were constructed in Japan, the United States, and South Africa; participated in offshore wind power generation projects in Belgium; and started to built a biomass power plant in Japan. As for overseas industrial park businesses, we extended existing industrial parks and advanced a new development in Manjung ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plant (Malaysia) Myanmar. Through such initiatives in all of the above businesses, we sought to expand earnings foundations steadily. As measures for strategic asset management, we disposed of certain equity interests in water infrastructure businesses in the United Kingdom and sold the operating companies of solar power generation and wind power generation businesses in Japan and overseas. Fiscal 2014 Results Profit for the year rose ¥3.8 billion year on year, to ¥22.9 billion, reflecting steady performances by overseas power infrastructure businesses.

Overseas, emerging countries’ economic growth and increasing populations are generating ever greater demand for power and water infrastructure. Moreover, demand is heightening for environment-friendly businesses that will help ­establish a sustainable society. In Japan, the full liberalization of power retailing scheduled for April 2016 promises to increase business opportunities. Further, as Japanese companies advance overseas, demand for logistics services and the development of industrial parks is becoming very strong. In overseas power infrastructure businesses, we will give priority to initiatives in regions in which we have abundant experience and expertise, such as Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas. At the same time, we will focus efforts on developing projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and other new markets. Renewable energy power generation businesses will expand business foundations centered on offshore wind power generation in Europe while focusing on strategic asset management. With sights set on the full liberalization of power retailing, domestic electricity businesses will expand our competitive power generation capacity, such as biomass power ­generation, and grow the scale of retail sales. Logistics businesses will contribute to additional growth of businesses throughout the Sumitomo Corporation Group by providing integrated, comprehensive support in Japan and overseas. As for overseas industrial park businesses, plans call for extending and upgrading the capabilities of existing industrial parks while developing new projects in emerging countries. Water infrastructure businesses will focus efforts on the development of new concession business projects, and battery businesses will conduct verification projects for energy management businesses in Japan and overseas that use storage batteries. Q Could you please explain about CSR initiatives that you pursue through business activities?

Further, changing lifestyles in emerging countries are likely to increase demand for food qualitatively and quantitatively. However, concerns over the effects of global warming and the accompanying climate change will have on worldwide agricultural production is creating a need for enhanced ­agricultural productivity. In upstream resources and energy businesses, our basic policy is to replace existing assets with new investments, with a view to heightening the portfolio quality that we had under BBBO2014. Also, we will reduce risk exposure through the early completion of the Ambatovy nickel project in Madagascar and the Sierra Gorda copper and molybdenum mine project in Chile, and we plan to continuously reduce costs and improve the profitability of existing businesses. In midstream and downstream businesses, we aim to expand the ­earnings base of businesses related to crop protection products so that they become a future pillar of earnings, and we are focusing our efforts on building global sales networks for crop protection products and expanding multifaceted support businesses, which handle agricultural materials. We are also working to strengthen energy trading businesses, such as LNG businesses, and ­bolster the foundations of electronics manufacturing services (EMS) ­businesses for automobiles in the United States as well as developing phenol businesses and other petrochemicals businesses in China. Q Could you please explain about CSR initiatives that you pursue through business activities? A With contributing to stable food supplies and environment-friendly agriculture as our guiding vision, we are expanding crop protection product businesses in the global market. As food demand increases due to the growth of emerging countries’ economies and populations, ensuring stable, safe food supplies has become a worldwide issue. Aiming to help solve this issue, we are focusing efforts on providing leading-edge, environment-friendly crop protection products and increasing sales of products created through pheromone-based technology, microbial crop protection products, and other products. In particular, products created through pheromone-based technology are becoming highly valued as a pest control option that does not affect beneficial insects, soil, or water quality because they use insect sex pheromones to obstruct the breeding of harmful insects, preventing their reproduction. Through a crop protection product sales network spanning more than 30 countries worldwide, we will protect food for future generations.

We sometimes extend credit, through such as credit sales, loans, and guaranties, to the companies in which we invest. As our business investments sometimes require the commitment of substantial capital resources, in some instances, we may be required to contribute additional funds.

In addition, since a substantial portion of our business investments is illiquid, we may not be able to exit from such investments at the time or in the manner we would like.

Employee misconduct could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, expose us to legal and financial risks and compromise our reputation. We are dependent on the proper functioning of our information and communications systems to maintain our global operations. System malfunction may result in disruptions of our operations. There is no assurance that our risk management systems will effectively minimize various types of risks in our operations to appropriate levels. Our extensive and diverse businesses expose us to various types of risks. We conduct our business through industrybased business units and regional operations, domestic and overseas. At the same time, we are expanding our business activities into new areas. Accordingly, in addition to the risks and uncertainties that we face as a whole as an integrated trading company, each of our industry-based business units and regional operations may be subject to risks inherent in or relating to each industry, market and/or geographic focus. Our existing risk management systems, which consist of various elements from risk measurement methodology and information system to internal rule and organization structure, may not work satisfactorily with respect to various risks. Furthermore, we may have no experience or only limited experience with the risks relating to our new business activities, products and services. In such cases, our new business activities, products and services may require the introduction of more complex management systems and additional management resources, such as human resources. Moreover, a shortage of management resources, such as human resources, may lead to a restriction of business operation. 190 Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2015 Corporate Profile (As of March 31, 2015) Sumitomo Corporation Date of Establishment: December 24, 1919 Total: 862 Sumitomo Corporation Shareholders’ Equity: Number of Employees: Total, including Consolidated ¥2,481.4 billion Subsidiaries  75,448 Non-consolidated5,371* Fiscal Year: From April 1 of each year through March 31 of the following year Headquarters: 1-8-11, Harumi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-8610, Japan Number of Consolidated Subsidiaries: 596 (Overseas 487, Domestic 109) URL: http://www.sumitomocorp.co.jp/ english/ Associated Companies [Equity Method]: * Including the 163 employees employed at overseas offices 266 (Overseas 215, Domestic 51) Stock Information (As of March 31, 2015) Stock Listings: Tokyo, Nagoya, Fukuoka Toll Free Number: 1-877-248-4237 (CITI-ADR) American Depository Receipts: Overseas Dial-in: 1-781-575-4555 Ratio: 1ADR:1ORD E-mail: citibank@shareholders-online.com Exchange: OTC (Over-the-Counter) Symbol: SSUMY URL: http://www.citi.com/adr CUSIP Number: 865613103 Depository and Registrar: Citibank, N.A.
