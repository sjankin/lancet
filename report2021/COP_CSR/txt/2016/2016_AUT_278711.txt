Some years our progress was moderate, another years we would make big leaps forward in our sustainability drive. Yet, through all ups and downs two things remained steadily unchanged: increasingly challenging environment and our urge to make positive contribution to business, society and environment. Here is our 2015 Communication on Progress which portrays key highlights of our performance and progress in certain areas. Leo Hauska CEO Hauska & Partner Group 3| OUR REPORTING PRACTICES ______________________________________________________________________________________ Our Communication on Progress report provides an overview of Hauska & Partner Group companies in Austria, Croatia and Latvia performance and progress. It is our third stand-alone COP. In addition to stand-alone COPs we also regularly prepare twoyear sustainability reports based on GRI sustainability reporting guidelines (G4), which we complement with the UN GC principles. In our COP 2015 we provide key highlights of our practices and efforts we expect to be of interest to our employees, clients, fellow colleagues in professional associations and other communication consultancies. Our 2015 report encompasses the following: • An overview of our business environment and key material issues • Key highlights and value creation • An overview of key environment features influencing our operations • Key highlights of our achievements in 2015 4| TRANSFORMATION ON THE WAY _________________________________________________________ Hauska & Partner Group operates in very different markets and environments, resulting in each country having its own For more than 25 years, Hauska & particularities which add to complexities. Partner has been providing consulting services based on its Some of these complexities are reflected in the Brunswick and own interdisciplinary approach to communication management and the European Association of Communications Directors 2015 business governance merged under report on The Future of Corporate Communications. According the label Corporate Relations. The to the report, broad and deep transformations are taking place consultancy specializes in strategic in business that will redefine the communications function. The communications consulting, biggest challenges organizations currently face relate to covering various areas, from managing reputation, external perceptions, rebuilding trust, stakeholder relations and reputation management, risks and effective storytelling, targeting message and achieving cutcrisis management, CSR through. In information saturated, digitalized, and increasingly management and reporting, regulated and changing environment organizations are looking environmental issues for consolidation (coordination and integration) of all communications, traditional and communications in order to be able to tell their story in a more digital media communications, consistent and compelling way. As a result the major focus for public affairs and lobbying. communication professionals it to become more strategic and ensure consistent messaging across the business. European Communication Monitor 2015 (ECM 2015) results indicate that communication professionals surveyed also believe that there is overall need to integrate communication activities which affect all functions. Yet, when compared to 2011 results, there was hardly any progress made. Consistently over years “linking communication and business strategy” remains the biggest strategic challenge for communication professionals, and it is followed by coping with digital revolution and the social web, building and maintaining trust and matching the need to address more audiences with limited resources. However, these challenges were differently ranked in Austria and Croatia. Unlike Austria, where matching the needs and building trust where identified as the most important challenges, the most pressing issue identified by Croatian communication professionals was coping with digital revolution, while building trust scored relatively low, although public relations industry in Croatia has ongoing reputation problems. Results of ECM 2015 also reveal an interesting difference in views between organizations and agencies why organizations employ agencies, consistently in all countries. While close in a view on the need to integrate creativity and use additional “arms and legs”, organizations give a far less importance to reasons for employment such as strategic insight, objective and independent counsel, explaining communication trends and new instruments or providing a support in explaining communication strategies to top executives than agencies. 5| Hauska & Partner Group in 2015 Our employees We employed 18 employees in 2015 (Full Time Equivalents, FTE). In comparison to 2014, when average rate of employment in H&P was 9.30 years, in 2015 it was 10.84 years (FTE). It means that we invest a lot of effort to foster and nurture professional and working environment in which our employees feel valued and respected. Results of the Workplace Assessment Survey for 2015 indicate that all our employees agree that they enjoy working for H&P. We are a gender neutral organization. None of our employees is employed, paid or promoted based on gender or age criteria. Instead, we have in place 3600 evaluation and Personal Development Plans which are the basis for career development. Our management H&P Group is managed by the seven-member Management Board: two members from Austria, one from Latvia and four from Croatia. The structure of the Board mirrors the practice of the H&P Group: local top managers are residents of the countries in which the companies operate. It is equally comprised of male and female members. The Management Board regularly evaluates the issues of importance in key strategic areas, planned and actual performance, and makes decisions on the most appropriate course of action. In 2014, we organized the process in which we selected and examined our most important issues, the ones that influence H&P resilience and sustainability, so we manage them in our day-to-day practices. In the end of the process, we have selected 16 issues as the ones with the greatest influences, which are positioned closest to the centre of this visual presentation. 6| Our business results Our business results stabilized in 2015, following the turbulent years in which we experienced consequences of economic crisis and market shrinking (reduced budgets, still slow recovery of economies to the pre-2008 financial crisis levels. During 2015, Hauska & Partner Group managed to maintain financial stability, realizing almost the same level of revenues as in the previous years, while not increasing operating costs. Table 1: Economic values (H&P Group in EUR 1.000) realized 2012 2013 2014 2015 Revenues 1.638 1.308 1.133 1.228 Operating costs 990 615 667 662 Employee wages 755 550 574 516 Payment to prov. of capital 32 125 19 14 Payment to government 10 4 21 22 We manage our economic viability though nurturing long-term trusted relationships with our clients. We continued to keep the loyalty of a relatively high percentage of our clients with the retention rate of 66% in comparison to 2014, when we managed to retain 68% of clients from previous years.

Our revenues were mostly realized from long-term cooperation with our clients. 7| HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: Business should make sure that it is not complicit in human rights abuses A general picture of the Group’s human rights By having signed UN Global Compact in 2006 Hauska & Partner Group supports and respects human rights in all its business relationships. With regard to human rights we are exerting our influence in the following spheres of influence identified in 2010, either directly when it comes to the field of work and freedom from discrimination or indirectly when in our consulting role we respect the freedom of expression and media or promote children rights. 2015 Highlights Let’s discuss human rights At the end of 2015 we organized Human Rights Webinar for Latvian team and two new team members. Mateja, our human rights expert, presented human rights in general, its foundations and key documents and declarations. Additionally, she also presented the latest result of Media Freedom survey and discussed economic, social and cultural rights relating to workplace, social security, family life, participation in cultural life. In the last part of the webinar issues like social media, privacy, rights of children (especially in terms of promotion and marketing) and ageism, which seems to be a growing issue in terms of human rights as well, were also tackled. 8| With the Human Rights Webinar we increased the percentage of employees being trained on human rights issues to 87 % on the H&P group level, in comparison to 2014 when we trained 69% of employees. Table 3: Percentage of Employees trained (Human Rights) 2012 2013 2014 2015 Austria 70% 74% 87% 97% Croatia 100% 96% 92% 100% Latvia 0% 0% 0% 56% Group 56% 66% 69% 87% For culturally sensitive and non-discriminatory environment Results of the Workplace Assessment Survey (WAS) indicated that our employees in all Austria, Croatia and Latvia agree the most that the working environment in H&P is “culturally sensitive and non-discriminatory” as well as that their “privacy rights are always respected” Table 4: Human Rights related WAS results Agree all Rank Agree AT Rank Agree HR Rank Agree LV Rank 10 The work environment is culturally sensitive and non-discriminatory 3,89 1 4,00 1 3,90 1 3,80 4 16 My privacy rights are always respected in our company 3,78 5 4,00 1 3,70 5 3,80 4 This result is reflection of our continuous efforts in providing such an environment in which our employees can exercise and develop their opportunities, choices and capabilities, and feel free of insecurity with relation to age, equal pay and compensation, political or religious views or preferences, pregnancy, or gender. It is reflected in the fact that although we have in place mechanism for addressing any human rights related violation our Ethical Committee did not receive any complaints in 2015, as in 2014. In addition, our employees are always encouraged to discuss any dilemma through an open door policy. 9| LABOUR SECTION Principle 3: Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Principle 4: Business should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor Principle 5: Business should uphold the effective abolition of child labor Principle 6: Business should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation A general picture of the Group labour practices The Group upholds freedom of association and the effective right to bargain collectively. Labor practices are managed and discussed in various ways, through well established mechanisms that we re-evaluate and improve in order to foster value driven working environment. • An open door policy is one of the key features of our corporate culture. It is promoted in many different ways, from regular management-employees meetings or individual direct communication between employees and management. All our new employees are immediately encouraged to openly address any issue of their interest or concern. • Second key feature is the continuous participation of our employees in decision-making processes. It is exercised not only through their participation in reshaping our consulting services or needed reinventions in our labour practices, but also in exploring new niches and shaping our strategies for innovation, consultancy development and competencies needed. • We evaluate individual performance on annual basis. It consists of three parts – 360° evaluation, Personal Development Plans and One-on-One discussions with the local Managing Director or another Board Member responsible for human resources. The executive board members discuss their performance with the Chair. The performance review is value driven and based on multiple indicators. • We also evaluate the quality of our working environment, on the annual basis, through Workplace Assessment Survey (WAS) that comprises the five categories: HR Management & Leadership Style, Career Perspectives, Corporate Culture, General Conditions and Health & Safety 2015 Highlights Employee benefits We continued providing additional health insurance in Croatia and Latvia. Most of the employees are provided with mobile phones, and partly they are granted compensation for cell phone costs. Croatia provides one additional day of vacation for every three years of service with the company. 10 | We also offered flexible working arrangements so our employees can establish better balance between their professional and private lives, which can be quite challenging to achieve in our often stressful and demanding working environment. Satisfaction with working environment WAS 2015 results1 indicated that our employees enjoy working in H&P. They also trust H&P leadership and feel encouraged to take over responsibility for projects, teams and clients, as well as that their privacy rights are always respected in the company. On the other hand, they expect to be told that their contribution is valued and that we shall establish better alignment between their contribution and what they receive in return. Turnover rate In Austria in Croatia no employee left the company, while in Latvia we recorded 44% employee turnover rate, where we face an ongoing challenge to attract and retain quality consultants due to market and cultural specifics. Our overall turnover rate in 2015 was 12%. However, we also had 74% employees who were staying more than 5 years in H&P. Table 5: Employee turnover and retention by region 2012 2013 2014 2015 Austria 0% 0% 10% 0% Croatia 19% 0% 8% 0% Latvia 82% 6% 0% 44% Group 40% 2% 6% 12% Absenteeism With 83 days of absenteeism, we kept almost the same number of days of absenteeism as in 2014, when we recorded 82 days, considerably lower than in previous years. In principle, over the years of tracking absenteeism, our records indicate that causes of absenteeism from work were primarily legitimate, due to personal illness or other outstanding reasons. Table 6: Days of absenteeism per 100 employees (Groupwide) 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total 838 816 467 460 As a small company, we do not report any further details on health issues due to privacy reasons. We had no work-related accidents, fatalities, injuries or occupational diseases. 1 Other results of WAS 2015 are covered in other sections of this report 11 | Education We define ourselves as learning organization, and with each year and each new client we look into and develop new knowledge and expertise. In 2015 we slightly increased the number of average training hours per employees, from 76 in 2014 to 92 in 2015, but our employees indicated in the last WAS that even better training and education opportunities are expected. The biggest increase in number of training hours is recorded in the education of senior consultants, with doubling of hours from 50 in 2014 to 104 in 2015. The educational needs and preferences of our employees were discussed in One-on-One discussions, based on Personal Development Plans developed by each employee in which they articulated their interests. In 2015 we mostly focused on the following educational topics: Performance and career development We reviewed performance and career development opportunities for 55% of our employees in 2015 (100% of employees in Croatia), similar as in 2014 when 56% of employees developed Personal Development Plans and discussed them in One-on-Ones. 12 | ENVIRONMENTAL SECTION Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9: Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies A general picture of the Group’s environmental protection We are primarily contributing to the field of environmental protection through our consulting and a number of expert papers on the different topics we encounter in our daily practices through our support to our clients. Confronted with challenging issues such as Not-In-My-Back-Yard attitude and general lack of interest for genuine dialogue on all sides, we started to feel urge to reflect on issues and practices of stakeholder engagement in environmental decision-making and contribute to the field with our expert knowledge, aiming at improving practice. Through our Green Office program we are managing our consumption of energy, office materials, and organize collection of paper for recycling purposes. 2015 Highlights In 2015 we prepared and discussed with our colleagues from different expert areas the following expert and scientific papers on the various conferences: Pavlović, A.

It is incorporated in our overall management system and it guides us in decision-making and daily operations. 2015 Highlights Results of Workplace Assessment Survey (WAS) indicated that all our employees share a strong view that “nobody in our company is involved in any kind of corruption”, which is an indication that we do live the basic principles defined in our Anti-Corruption Policy aiming at integrity, transparency and accountability. In 2015, in addition to human rights we also organized anti-corruption training aiming at building capacities of our employees in Latvia and two newcomers in Croatia to recognize and address the issues important for implementation of anti-corruption behavior. The training was organized through an e-learning online tool with the interactive learning modules that provide an in-depth understanding of the UN Global Compact principle against corruption and UN Convention against Corruption. With the completion of anti-corruption training percentage of employees trained in anticorruption on H&P level was 87% at the end of 2015, comparing to 2014 when 69% were trained.
