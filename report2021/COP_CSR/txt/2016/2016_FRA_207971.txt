General meetings are held twice yearly in which results and targets are presented, and the actions to undertake collectively or individually are discussed. Staff representatives are elected once per year. The next election is scheduled for the end of 2016. 2.3 Results analysis Internal self-assessment. Annual survey on employee satisfaction relative to their manager.

Each employee can use it to manage their projects remotely, without having to print any paper documents at all. We have replaced all personal printers by a centralised, solid ink printer, which means that there is no toner to recycle. We have implemented specific waste bins for paper recycling. We systematically use recycled paper for printing We have joined up with other local businesses to collect recycled paper. This paper is then purchased by PAPREC, a specialist in recycling and the sale of recycled industrial waste.

For the purchase of PVC fabric, LOSBERGER has chosen to work in partnership with the supplier FERRARI, especially for its ecological approach at the origin of unique PVC composite recycling technology: The TEXYLOOP process. This technique makes it possible to recycle all PVC textile components and applies to production offcuts, process residue and worn textile at the end of its service life. 100% of the treated material is reused in existing industrial processes. TEXYLOOP is the only process that makes it possible to fully recycle PVC textile composites to produce pure, directly reusable materials. 3.2.4 Sustainable development approach Our environmental approach also comes from LOSBERGER FRANCE S.A.S., of which LOSBERGER RDS is a subsidiary. In fact, it has joined a hundred or so other regional businesses in the Idée Alsace network which has been created around the sustainable development values that we wish to affirm and promote economically, socially and environmentally. Furthermore, LOSBERGER FRANCE S.A.S. has undertaken a carbon footprint procedure in order to define its priority improvement themes. 3.2.5 HQE (“Haute Qualité Environnementale“ High Environmental Quality Especially thanks to the materials used in our buildings, LOSBERGER FRANCE S.A.S has undertaken an HQE approach, ( Haute Qualité Environnementale , or High Environmental Quality) with the objective of controlling impacts on the outside environment (eco-construction and eco-management) and of creating a healthy and comfortable interior environment (comfort and health targets). Amongst the fourteen targets listed by the HQE association, our buildings fulfil the following objectives: o Eco-construction, this target covers integration with the site, the type of building and the work site impact  Our buildings are low in height and merge harmoniously with the neighbouring environment, favouring a harmonious relationship with the existing natural surroundings.  The materials used are recyclable, environmentally friendly, healthy and require the lowest possible amount of energy and transport.  The light weight of our buildings and their speed of assembly makes it possible to have low pollution work sites (little machinery and therefore little noise, no waste, no ground or air pollution, very fast construction time, limited deadlines and costs) o Eco-management: this target covers energy, water, activity generated waste, maintenance and servicing management:  Energy management with the use of natural lighting in our buildings: Because the PVC sheeting used as roofing material is translucent, significant lighting savings can be achieved. In fact, the use of natural light from the roof provides true comfort and sufficient light without any glare. The savings over artificial lighting are undeniable.

Similarly, it requires no maintenance or treatment, unlike wood which requires chemical fungicide treatments and hydrocarbon based varnish or surface coating treatments.  Waste management thanks to the assembly principle: Industrialised building assembly technique: no on site drilling: everything is pre-drilled, therefore there is no drilling residue and waste on the site. Our frameworks are fully industrialised. Therefore there is no production activity on the site. Similarly, because of the nature of our trade, our staff is used to working with white canvas. Cleanliness habits have therefore been integrated into the attitudes of our assembly staff. As for packaging and cladding offcuts, there is a waste skip permanently on site so that nothing is left lying around. The assembly processes and principles for our buildings only require light handling machinery, which is often low energy consuming, and construction times are fast. Therefore, work sites generate little pollution, are quickly completed and quicker to commission.  Waste management depending on the anchor systems. If this option is selected, a TECHNIVALOR type anchor system could be suitable. This anchor system requires small amounts of materials (no concrete or steel). If the building is recycled there are no issues involving removing and processing the concrete foundations and beams. This work does not require any heavy machinery and is very fast; thereby using little energy This system also makes it possible to significantly reduce the inconveniences caused by a work site over time.  Natural resource management with the evacuation of rainwater: When specifications allow it, we encourage the direct connection of building rainwater to a buried collector which we install. This is to keep the roof water networks, which are considered to be clean, separate from the road rainwater networks, which are considered to be soiled and require processing using a hydrocarbon separator.  Energy consumption management using the ventilation: The air distribution system represents the terminal and visible part of the building. It impacts the occupant's perception of their comfort as well as hot and cold sensations. Interior air quality is also a part of occupant comfort. Ventilation is used to distribute interior air, to extract pollutants and to contribute to providing the occupant a healthy environment. This distribution also contributes to sustainable development. It has an impact on the building's energy consumption. 3.2.6 Implementation of an ISO 14001 standard environment management system To continue our environmental approach, we have decided to set new environmental protection targets, these involve the analysis of the pollution caused by our activity at several levels: water, air, ground, noise, smells and collective impacts. We shall therefore assess the business’s environmental performances and implement our environment management system in compliance with the ISO 14001 standard. An initial audit has been scheduled for September 2016. 3.2.7 A turnkey solution adapted to energy savings for the United Nations in Central Africa Losberger RDS has supplied, installed and managed the maintenance of turnkey systems for 3 camps that can house about 100 people. Losberger RDS has shown its capacity to act quickly and effectively while offering solutions suitable for energy savings: o A solar farm produces up to 25% of the power needed for each camp.
