Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet 7 BEING A PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet While our company builds and operates mines as our core business, we strive to understand the impacts our operations may have on local communities, and the opportunities that we can provide for long-term development. These impacts and opportunities are often a catalyst for improved quality of life and sustainable development. ENGAGING WITH OUR HOST COMMUNITIES The New Gold Community Engagement and Development Standards guide us to identify our communities of interest, effectively engage and sustain dialogue, and report on performance. They also drive us to look for further opportunities to improve our processes and performance. In 2015, all New Gold sites hosted regular engagement activities, which allowed us to better understand our community impacts and any issues related to our activities, and to collaborate to find opportunities for the communities and the company. In 2015, each site also compiled a register of Significant Social Risks. This register contains the main social risks for each site and allows corporate representatives to test the adequacy and effectiveness of controls as well as emergency preparedness and mitigation measures associated with those greatest potential risks. We foster transparent and open, two-way communication with residents and community leaders, from a project’s earliest development phase, during the mine’s life and through closure.

Across the organization, we reduced the consumption of propane and natural gas, however diesel use increased by 12% overall. This was mainly due to the impact of construction at Rainy River.
