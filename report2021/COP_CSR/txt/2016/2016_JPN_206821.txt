Our business domains extend across Later, we also turned our world-leading land, sea, air, and space. As our expansion has mirrored technologies to the manufacture of that of the Japanese economy, growth has slowed since products to meet military demand, the 1980s, but since the late 2000s we have been such as battleships and fighters. promoting globalization and management reforms to put ourselves on a new growth trajectory. This cover story describes our efforts to create value in the past, present, and into the future.

To overcome these challenges, we have made steady progress since • Tough Competition against Powerful Players 2010 when we embarked on business plans aimed The global market is dominated by “megaplayers,” at management reform. Today, we are bolstering our including prominent European and U.S. companies. competitiveness and undergoing a major corporate We also face increasingly stiff competition as highly cost-competitive manufacturers from emerging transformation. countries come to the fore. • ‌Increasing Project Complexity and Sophistication To avoid losing out in the face of price competition, we will apply our comprehensive strengths to engage proactively in highly difficult, high-value-added businesses. As the number of complex and sophisticated projects increases, we face the risks of ballooning costs and lengthening construction periods. • The Need to Conform to Global Markets We recognize that past methods of conducting business may not necessarily be globally effective, and that our responses will need to be more broadly based. Furthermore, markets are becoming global, leading to additional and dynamic changes in the business environment. Increased Risks To survive in the global market and compete on an equal footing However, as we pursue these measures we expect with the megaplayers, we will need to increase the scale of our the number of issues we face to rise, as a greater number of business. Today, we are striving to grow our existing product large-scale projects and new business initiatives will expose us businesses and conducting M&A activities to expand this scale to business risks we have not yet experienced. To address these from the current level of ¥3 trillion to more than ¥5 trillion.

Perpetual Management Reform In our quest for global growth, we have steadily pursued reforms During this period, the business environment has continued under our 2010 and 2012 business plans, creating a new structo change, with the level of competition increasing. To win out ture. As we move away from the model of vertically integrated against global competitors, we will need to tirelessly pursue manufacturing, our management and business structures are ongoing reforms. Under our newly formulated 2015 Medium-Term evolving to take advantage of comprehensive strengths and Business Plan, we intend to implement further management achieve high levels of efficiency and maneuverability. reforms in our determined quest to become a highly profitable company with a business scale exceeding ¥5 trillion. 8 A global group with the vision to mold an innovative and agile organization that leverages our dedication to technological advancement and engineering excellence in order to deliver solid growth amid constant changes and make a lasting difference in the communities we serve MHI REPORT 2015 9 COVER STORY MHI’s Course The Corporate Image We Aspire To Thanks to the various strategies implemented under our 2012 Medium-Term Business Plan, the MHI Group’s business scale, after hovering for many years near ¥3 trillion, has now reached ¥4 trillion. Simultaneously, our profitability, long in need of expansion, has improved significantly. Today, to propel the MHI Group into its next growth phase, starting in the current fiscal year under our newly launched 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan we are pursuing Strategies for Augmenting Corporate Value a host of new strategies on the global stage. As we proceed to implement these strategies, it is imperative for us to indicate the long-range direction we are aiming for to all our stakeholders—shareholders and investors, members of our value chain, Group employees, and others—and to garner their understanding. With that purpose in mind, in our 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan we defined our corporate aspiration in the following way: “a global group with the vision to mold an innovative and agile organization that leverages our dedication to technological advancement and engineering excellence in order to deliver solid growth amid constant changes and make a lasting difference in the communities we serve.” Achieving our aspired corporate image involves two concrete objectives. The first objective is to attain outstanding competitive strength, a world-class level of customer satisfaction, and greater shares in our business markets; this feat can be accomplished by focusing on business areas in which we can achieve a competitive advantage through product differentiation and by incorporating a wealth of third-party expertise. Going forward, we will invest our management Creating Value through Our Businesses resources into areas where we can manifest our technological and engineering capabilities accumulated through our long history—products offering high added value, such as machinery and equipment, plants, and transportation systems. In addition, through mergers and alliances we will continuously enhance our competitive strength in terms of technological innovation and reliability, quality of lifecycle services, and cost aspects. I have complete confidence that by cultivating supreme customer satisfaction around the globe, we will succeed in securing high market shares that will enable us to realize the overriding goal of our 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan: to achieve a business scale of more than ¥5 trillion. The second concrete objective integrated into our corporate aspiration is to garner an enhanced global reputation toward our overall corporate management. Becoming a company that will continue to be trusted by society will naturally require a significant business scale and solid financial strength, but just as necessary will be the formation of a management structure and corporate governance system responsive to changes in the business environment Building a Framework for Value Creation and adaptable to diverse needs, as well as faithful practice of our code of conduct. Also crucial will be the resolution, through our business activities, of issues that impact society, plus the creation of value unique to the MHI Group. For more than 130 years, the MHI Group has diligently carried out the commitment defined in the first article of its business creed: “We strongly believe that the customer comes first and that we are obligated to be an innovative partner to society.” In the years ahead, we will remain devoted to this commitment, not only to sustain our own corporate growth but, more importantly, to ensure the MHI Group can continue contributing to development all around the world.

Net income undershot the target partially due to the booking of an extraordinary loss related to losses in the cruise ships business. Nevertheless, the targets of the three-year plan were mainly achieved, a feat that had repeatedly been elusive with earlier business plans. In this respect, the generally successful results represent a significant change for the Company, and I believe this success derives primarily from a growing awareness of reforms among the members of the MHI Group, the process by which the 2012 Medium-Term Business Plan was compiled, and improved accuracy in the specific measures devised to achieve the plan’s targets. Another important contributing factor, I think, was a greater shared awareness throughout the Group, both in Japan and overseas and including all workplaces, of the need to drive structural reforms forward and achieve the plan’s targets. The economic environment proved less favorable than we had assumed, with China’s economy in stagnation and the emerging economies mired in slow growth. Despite this backdrop, I believe that we were generally able to achieve the plan’s targets thanks to the implementation of the key elements of our business structural reform initiative, enabled by flexible execution of the various measures devised for that purpose, coupled with the positive merits from the yen’s depreciation during the term.

The Building a Framework for Value Creation Chinese economy is in a slowdown and the emerging economies are in chaos. The U.S. economy is firm and growth can be anticipated, but the economic prospects in Europe are uncertain. These are the conditions that must be presumed when plotting our strategies going forward. Fortunately, thanks to the measures implemented under the 2012 Medium-Term Business Plan, MHI has succeeded in attracting a growing roster of new orders of relatively large scale. By proceeding steadily with these works currently in hand and making consistent efforts to attract new orders, I am confident that, despite the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment, we will achieve the targets of our 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan launched in May. Another factor that is impacting our business environment is intensifying competition on a global scale, which is an outgrowth of the expanding trend toward the adoption of free trade agreements between trading partners and ongoing economic globalization. Going forward, some of our business operations—gas turbines, for example—are expected to face increasing competition in some markets. I recognize that MHI still has ample room to enhance its global competitiveness, and we will need to take further measures in this regard under our 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan. 20 President’s Message Businesses Are Prepared to Compete on Global Terms under the 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan Enhancing global competitiveness is in fact one of the key initiatives and basic policies of our 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan. In the days when the Japanese market was expanding, we were in some ways content having one of the highest levels of competitiveness in Japan and Asia. But as globalization advances, some of our business operations will be unable to survive at our present competitive levels. Exceptions do exist—businesses such as defense develop in ways dissimilar to global competition—but almost all our business areas today are challenged to contend at the very highest levels against competing manufacturers and global competitive standards. As of now, the MHI Group still does not have any areas of business in which we can proclaim without reservation that we are No.1 in the world. Thermal power generation systems, centering on Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, Ltd. (MHPS), is our biggest field of business, and although specific areas exist in which we have a technological edge over global megaplayers—in environmental performance, for example—there are many aspects in which we still need to catch up. Our metals machinery business, marked by our launch of Primetals Technologies, Ltd., as a joint venture with Siemens AG, is now in a position to target becoming No.1 in its field, but achieving that goal will demand accelerated post-merger integration (PMI) and reaping of the resulting synergy merits. We also have a chance to prevail global niche products, such as compressors and turbochargers, commercial aircraft products, and transportation systems. These are areas in which we already are globally competitive and in which we should aim for No.1, and we intend to concentrate our management resources in these areas toward achieving that goal.

I myself have been through global competitions of various types in the past, as exemplified by my previous position of 15 years ago as president of MHI’s joint venture with Hitachi, Ltd., in metals machinery, and since my return to MHI, I have always maintained a keen awareness of our place in the global context. The three years covered by the 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan will be a stage in which we—especially our management members in charge of the various business operations—will have a true sense of the competition we face with other global players. What will be important during this phase is to devise strategies, engage in combat, and strive to finish victorious, and through this process we can acquire the experience and knowledge that will enable us to grow toward the subsequent step. The outcome of attempting to compete against the world may be the realization that we cannot Strategies for Augmenting Corporate Value win solely by battling on our own, and that recognition may guide us to engage in exchanges of human resources with other companies or to seek other means, such as alliances, mergers, or acquisitions. If each business segment ponders what it needs to be victorious on the global stage, which subsequently leads to self-initiated moves to find ways of acquiring the strength and knowledge we currently lack, I think this is a process that should be welcomed. Diverse Engineering Experience Can Be a Differentiating Factor One key to enhancing our global competitiveness will be strength in engineering. In recent years, there has been a growing trend for many of our competitors to shun contract formats involving engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) in favor of doing business only in the development and production of hardware and the provision of after-sales services. For MHI, a company that handles all aspects Creating Value through Our Businesses of EPC, this is a factor that differentiates us from our competition. MHI has undertaken a large number of projects in which engineering functions are imperative: power generation, chemical and other industrial plants, and large-scale transportation systems, such as the Dubai Metro, for example. In the area of cruise ships, we are in the process of developing a new business model as a component of our engineering business. Having experience and knowledge in such a diverse range of engineering operations as these makes it possible for us to consolidate areas suitable to sharing, to raise their level of capability, and to apply our experience and knowledge to a wider spectrum of specialized fields. In addition, engineering is an industry in which pinpoint specialization can cause substantial fluctuations in earnings and workload, and therefore the ability to handle a broad palette of engineering fields can result in leveling and the stabilization of earnings and workload, which in turn make engineering a differentiating factor. From a short-term perspective, concentrating the Company’s management resources engenders risk and cannot always ensure sustained growth. For this reason, based on a long-range perspective, it is vital for us to examine what areas we are best suited to and in which areas we will be able to comBuilding a Framework for Value Creation pete globally during the next generation, and then to strengthen those areas now. Two such areas we intend to focus on, both of which are expected to greet increasing demand in the long term, are oil & gas and the MRJ—areas where we can apply our comprehensive capabilities to maximum advantage. The ‌ Feature section on page 30 highlights the To catch up with competitors, it is important to adopt facets in which competitors excel. But in MRJ business. order to overtake the competition, it is necessary to conduct business in a way that differs from the competition by, for example, attempting to combine strengths already in hand and create new areas of business. Two examples are the cruise ships business, in which engineering functions come into play from all sectors of the Company, and the oil & gas business, in which engineering functions are applied across multiple domains. Today I believe it is necessary, in all areas of business, to create new business models through such trials and errors. 22 President’s Message An Organization Where Each Employee Continues to Take on Challenges to Further Develop the Next Generation To my mind—and this applies to the creation of the business models I just mentioned—MHI is not suited to issuing “commands” from above instructing the various business segments in what direction they should proceed. At MHI, there is a tendency for instructions handed down from above to be carried out in good faith, but the players are the people who are in charge of their respective businesses, and having them mull issues over and forge their paths on their own builds up their strength in business management and adds vitality to the Company. If we can achieve an organizational culture in which everyone continuously ponders the issues at hand and takes action on their own initiative, MHI will then be able to ascend to a higher stage. To this end, I would like to see employees actively voice their opinions and ideas. Some employees may express the desire to temporarily leave MHI and gain experience working for an overseas enterprise or a venture company. I believe it is necessary to give opportunities to such ambitiously driven people or organizations to enable them to grow. Since I returned to MHI in 2006, I have pondered what the Company currently lacks, and I have taken remedial measures from various standpoints and carried out organizational reforms. In the process, I have come to believe that in order to create a strong organization, the people who belong to the organization must possess peace of mind, an intense focus on their work, and a desire to improve themselves. What I would like to see in all members of the Group is a sense of peace and security coming from the ability to enjoy a happy life within our organization—but coupled with an intense determination to always keep on learning and a strong drive for self-improvement. If some businesses fail to succeed as a result of aiming higher, those in charge should not reprimand their subordinates by questioning why they could not get things right; instead, they should join forces, work together, and continue to address their challenges to develop an even-stronger next generation. In that way, by nurturing successively stronger generations to follow, a company can flourish in perpetuity. This is the underlying sense of values I embrace and my philosophy as a corporate manager. Business Must Be Conducted While Seeking Areas That Can Make Social Contributions One other factor that is vital for a company to continue evolving and growing is for it to maintain a stance in which it always operates with a steady focus on its social responsibilities, always remaining open to external circumstances, and never allowing its own sense of values to control its approach to business. If we conduct business by seeking how we can contribute, and in which areas, to respond ‌ The identification of material issues that to the directions in which society is moving and the challenges it faces, we can be a company that will have a major impact on continue to be needed by the global community. It is with this intent that in the 2015 Medium-Term society and our corpoBusiness Plan we defined our targeted image as a company that contributes to, and continuously rate value is explained on page 24. grows in tandem with, global development. Winning the trust of the global community demands that in good faith and with high moral convictions we undertake business activities that will have absolutely minimal negative impact on society and the environment. Since 2004, MHI has been a participant in the United Nations Global Compact, and we have made ongoing efforts throughout the Group to respect and carry out its Ten Principles spanning four basic areas: human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. In May 2015, we established the MHI Group Global Code of Conduct, indicating how our employees worldwide should conduct themselves in the performance of their business activities. In addition to defining compliance rules to be followed by all employees, the new Code of Conduct was created to pursue a commonly shared corporate culture as the MHI Group, along with its global business expansion, acquires ever-greater diversity with respect to background, nationality, and culture, among other factors. Failure to address diversity needs can inject chaos into an organization, and especially in the case of the MHI Group, a conglomerate of businesses of tremendous variety, from my managerial perspective I believe it is necessary to maintain an overall balance while taking into consideration individual aptitudes and traits. With confidence I can say that initiatives in this area will surely serve as a source of sustainable growth. MHI REPORT 2015 23 MHI’s Course Targeting Corporate Governance Appropriate to a Global Company Survival amid global competition will demand changes in corporate governance. One of the key initiatives delineated in our 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan is to “promote global-standard corporate governance and management processes.” Until quite recently, MHI’s business was heavily weighted toward the domestic market, and the bulk of business directed overseas consisted of exports to specific customers. Now, more than 50% of Groupwide net sales derives from business directed at overseas markets, and approximately 20% is booked at Group companies’ overseas bases. Given the attendant increases in overseas employees, customers, and business competitors, governance at MHI must also be brought up to global standards. In addition, over 30% of MHI’s current shareholders are overseas investors, so it is very important that we attain the understanding of our many overseas Strategies for Augmenting Corporate Value shareholders and investors. That said, we cannot merely imitate how excellent companies overseas conduct their governance. The type of governance I look for is governance suited to the unique characteristics of MHI as a company based in Japan that at the core undertakes infrastructure-related business, an area where a long-term perspective is essential. In recent years, we have carried out a number of major corporate governance reforms, including a reduction in the number of directors and an increase in the percentage of outside directors. In June 2015, a further initiative was executed with approval at this year’s regular General Meeting of Shareholders to transition MHI to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee. The establishment of an Audit and Supervisory Committee, in which outside directors comprise the majority of members, is aimed at strengthening the supervisory functions of the directors and entrusting a good share of business execution authority of the Board of Directors to the directors in order to promote swifter decision making. Creating Value through Our Businesses A Company Always Open to the Views of All Stakeholders Above all else, MHI adheres to the importance of securing accountability and transparency. To achieve these goals, we are focused on always keeping an open stance, listening to the views expressed by our shareholders, investors, and all other stakeholders concerning where the Company should be heading, what challenges we face, and how we will address those challenges. In fiscal 2014, our shareholder returns, in the form of annual dividends per share, reached ¥11, up ¥3 per share from the previous year. The increase was carried out in reflection of overall robust earnings, in spite of a year-on-year decline in net income. In our 2015 Medium-Term Business Plan, we are currently targeting a business scale exceeding ¥5 trillion, return on equity (ROE) of more than 10%, and an increase in our net worth to ¥2 trillion. While maintaining a balance between growth investment and building up our net worth, our underlying policy is to sustain shareholder returns at a dividend Building a Framework for Value Creation payout ratio near 30%. We sincerely ask for the continuing understanding and cooperation of our shareholders, investors, and all other stakeholders. We are focused on always listening to the views expressed by our shareholders and committing ourselves to our targets. 24 Identification of Material Issues for ESG Becoming a Company That Is Highly Regarded in International Society As a company that conducts business activities on a global perspective.

We then referred to such guidelines as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) “Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Perspective (Fourth Edition, or G4)” and subsequently grouped together similar items and reduced the list to 49 items in seven departments. Arranging the Issues from the We conducted hearings of our 16 departments, confirming the importance to our business of the 49 issues. We also ascertained that three major changes were consistently raised as issues with the business reorganizations the Perspective of MHI’s Business Company has undergone in recent years: changes in the ideal state of the organization, globalization, and changes in the business model. Confirming Appropriateness We engaged in dialogue with specialized overseas institutions to confirm that our process of identifying material issues was appropriate.

This broad overview is necessary to enable the Company to respond as a whole, and immediately, to risk situations, rather than MHI’s Brand Value attempting to resolve newly arising issues within the limited parameters Nobuo Kuroyanagi of the business operations affected.

Also, since outside directors make up a majority of the participants at Audit and Supervisory Christina Ahmadjian Committee meetings, discussions can be more open than the Board of Directors meetings. Earlier, President Miyanaga spoke of his aspiration This past year, I think MHI has made further progress in terms of improving that Board of Directors meetings might become the scene of active its corporate governance. At Board of Directors meetings, for example, debating of issues between those on the inside of the Company and items up for discussion have been pared down to just the major issues members from the outside, and I think that as a start this is increasingly relating to the Company’s business strategies, so the discussions are being achieved within the Audit and Supervisory Committee meetings. more purposeful than before.

In the context of corporate management as a whole, the Shinichiro Ito—have been given a stronger voice than before. Outside greatest challenge MHI must address is risk management. Today the directors at MHI come from various backgrounds, they vary in age, and Company’s business operations are becoming increasingly complex they bring with them varied viewpoints and ways of thinking.

Now that they have Creating Value through Our Businesses been accorded the status of directors under the new system, this disadvantage has been eliminated. Corporate Management Always Involves A major issue to be addressed as MHI aims to become increasingly globalized will be the development of required human resources. In that Challenges; What Is Important Is Risk respect, the establishment of Primetals Technologies, Ltd., in 2015, Response Capability where the majority of workers derive from Siemens AG, is expected to set an instructive example in terms of cultivating a global workforce.

This autumn the MRJ will be making its maiden flight. Many people around the world are looking forward with anticipation to the first flight of a domestically manufactured commercial aircraft in 53 years, since the YS-11. We have been working as a collaboration partner on the MRJ since ANA became the launch customer in 2008. We have made hundreds of requests aimed at increasing the MRJ’s comfort and making the aircraft more attractive for airlines in terms of ease of operation and maintenance. The maiden flight will be the Hiroshi Kobayashi moment when the aircraft embodying all these changes will take off into the skies. Following that first flight, General Manager we are scheduled to receive our first aircraft in 2017.

Demand also remains robust for new construction of thermal generation systems fired by coal, for which reserves are abundant. However, fierce global competition is unavoidable, given the market presence of so-called megaplayers. Meanwhile, a new international framework of climate-change countermeasures is being prepared to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. Against this backdrop, calls to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power generation are growing more pronounced, and expectations are high for high-efficiency thermal power generation systems; nuclear power generation, which does not emit CO2; carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and other technologies to counter global warming; and power generation systems using renewable energy, such as offshore wind power generation.

Orders are expected to be particularly robust for single-aisle aircraft from low-cost carriers (LCC) operating mainly short flights and airlines in emerging countries. The transportation systems business is estimated to have a current market scale of around ¥22 trillion, expanding at an annual rate of 2% to 3%. In particular, rail transportation is likely to be called upon to address increasingly serious traffic congestion in emerging countries experiencing rapid economic growth, including Asian countries and Brazil, as populations congregate in urban areas. In the commercial ships business, the market is forecast to remain oversupplied for the foreseeable future, but North American shale gas development is engendering demand for gas carriers, an area where MHI excels. Also, the market for cruise ships is expected to grow steadily. In addition, in Japan we anticipate robust replacement demand for large-scale ferries and demand from the public sector for training ships and research vessels.

However, our operating environment is changing. In defense, the Medium-Term Defense Program formulated in 2013 indicated the government’s intent to build a “Dynamic Joint Defense Force.” Furthermore, the 2014 Cabinet decision adopting the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology established clear principles for transferring defense equipment overseas. In space systems, the New Basic Plan on Space Policy formulated in 2015 clearly indicated the promotion of space utilization for national security and the maintenance and strengthening of the domestic production and technological bases. Accordingly, the scale of the domestic market is expected to grow to ¥5 trillion over the next decade. Worldwide, we also anticipate commercial satellite launch demand of 20 to 25 units per year.

The market for our turbocharger operations is forecast to expand, driven by demand for higher fuel efficiency. In the past, demand has concentrated on diesel turbochargers, but the gasoline engine turbocharger market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 10%, with particularly high growth forecast for the Chinese and North American markets. As for compressors, although falling crude oil prices are having a temporary impact, business in the oil and gas sector is forecast to grow over the medium-to-long term, and the market for compressors is slated to continue its long-term expansion. However, the scale of the market in the metals machinery business has shrunk from around ¥3.0 trillion in fiscal 2013 to approximately ¥2.4 trillion in fiscal 2014. Although this business environment appears likely to remain problematic, we anticipate a slight recovery over the long term due to the expansion of markets in India and other emerging countries.
