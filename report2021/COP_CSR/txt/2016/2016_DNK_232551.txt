Thus we are now preparing our sixth report on our services and progress with social responsibility and sustainability. In this report we express our continued support to the UN global Compact initiative. In ALECTIA we believe that society and enterprise are intertwined. It is our ambition to create solutions to the benefit of people, society and the environment. We want to contribute to the solutions of the societal challenge we are facing and thus to contribute to a sustainable development of the society. In our capacity as consultants we see an obvious opportunity to advise on increasing the sustainability of the world. We do that through professional advice to public and private enterprises and institutions on building, climate adaptation, restoration of nature, energy, water supply, environment as well as working environment. With the purpose of intensifying and targeting our CSR-activities, we have begun to use the Global Reporting Inititative (GRI G4) as a tool for our CSR-reporting. It is our ambition to achieve a more structured and systematic approach to our CSR-work and reporting. We have as a first initiative contacted Carve Consulting, a CSR-consulting business. Together we have identified and evaluated which topics under the GRI are important for our business and at the same time which we may influence. We are modest in our approach to the task and realize that Rome was not built in one day. However we feel that we have made a good start in order to understand the system and methodology. Next year we are looking forward to going deeper. Jesper Mailind CEO, ALECTIA A/S cop rapport 2015 en.docx 3 13 COMPANY PROFILE ALECTIA is one of the leading consulting engineering businesses of Denmark. We are owned by the ALECTIA-Foundation, the general purpose of which is to strengthen the competencies of Danish engineers and the Danish engineering reputation. Our professional advice combines high engineering knowledge with deep insight into our clients’ businesses. We are driven by a wish to design sustainable development. A decisive key to this is the high level of competencies of our employees. A natural and important part of our strategy and business driven responsibility towards the society is constantly to ensure a coupling to the research and education environment. We achieve this through our Ph.D. programme which we have been running since 2005. Meaning that we since then have had Ph.D. students attached to our business. We advise on all the building design phases from the conceptual design phase to erection and operation phases. To this we add a series of special competencies within optimization of production facilities, logistics, water supply, environment, energy climate adaptation, nature restoration and working environment. Our clients comprise among others government, regions, municipalities, educational institutions, utility companies, investors, manufacturing companies including breweries, dairies, abattoirs, and pharmaceutical facilities. Our approx. 675 employees work at the headquarters in Virum and at our offices in Aarhus, Odense, Kolding, Ascot in England and Melbourne in Australia. The business is organized into four divisions: Building Processing Environment, Energy and Water Management, Health Safety, Working Environment In 2015 ALECTIA’s gross revenue amounted to 673.1 mill. DKK. Our operating profit (EBIT) was 27.2 mill. DKK. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 4 13 HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 1: The enterprises should support and respect the protection of international human rights and Principle 2: Ensure that they do not violate the human rights OUR ENGAGEMENT ALECTIA operates the enterprise in accordance with the world human rights policy and ILO’s policy on basic principles and rights at work as well as the local legislation and code of practice concerning the worker’s rights. We support the right not to be discriminated and we endeavour to create equal conditions and possibilities for all workers regardless of gender, age, race, religious or sexual orientation. We consider human rights as important, correct and essential. At the same time we recognize that lack of compliance with the rights may result in economic sanctions against ALECTIA and be harmful to our reputation. OUR ACTIONS In 2015 we have initiated or finished the following actions: We are preparing a new CSR policy which will be launched in 2016. It will be followed up by training of our employees. We are preparing a Code of Conduct for our suppliers that will be launched in 2016. In this code of conduct we will express that we expect our suppliers to support and respect the protection of international human rights as well as ILO’s conventions; and that they comply with national legislations and provisions in the countries where they operate. Our ambition is to provide a great place to work. We care for our employees and offer opportunities for personal and managerial development of competences. We have followed up on our employees’ wellbeing by means of annual questionnaire analyses. Based on the results we have identified a series of improvements which will be implemented in the individual departments. OUR RESULTS Employee satisfaction survey 2015 2014 In general, how satisfied are you with your work 3.9 4.0 Values can be indicated from 1 to 5 with 5 as the maximum. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 5 13 DIVERSITY ALECTIA always recruits personnel with the aim of getting competence and experience. At the same time we wish to fill at least 25 per cent of the board members elected at the general assembly, the senior management and the leading managers, by women. Gender distribution 2015 2014 Share of female board members elected by the general 25 % 25 % assembly Share of female managers 31 % 22 % Note: The figures are not 100 per cent comparable, as the 2015-figures represent a weighted calculation, and 2014 represents figures from end of that year. Poverty fighting In the autumn of 2015 the ALECTIA-Foundation granted 100,000 DKK to “Engineers without Borders”. The donation will cover travel expenses and board and lodging for the young engineers of this organization who will assist in building a better future for people affected by catastrophes and poverty in the developing countries. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 6 13 EMPLOYEES’ RIGHTS Principle 3: Enterprises must respect the human rights of organization and effectively acknowledge the right to collective negotiation agreements Principle 4: Support the exclusion of all kinds of forced labour Principle 5: Support effective abolition of children’s work Principle 6: Eliminate discrimination in working and employment conditions OUR ENGAGEMENT The company of ALECTIA operates in accordance with ILO’s policy on basic principles and rights at work and the local legislation and code of conduct concerning the employee’s rights. It deals with i.a. the right not to be discriminated, the right to a healthy and safe working environment, the right to collective negotiations and freedom of union as well as prohibition against forced labour and certain types of children’s work. OUR ACTION In 2015 we have implemented the following initiatives: We are developing a new CSR policy which will be launched in 2016 and which will be followed up by training of employees. We are preparing a Code of Conduct for suppliers, which will be launched in 2016. In this code of conduct it will be stated that our suppliers must not use children’s labour or forced labour. In addition we will state that ALECTIA’s suppliers shall accept their workforce’s right to collective negotiations and freedom of association. They shall be obliged not to interfere in their employees’ choice of organization. ALECTIA is one of the leading health and safety consultants. Over the years we have assisted a series of clients in creating better working places. We have advised on physical and psychological working environment, health and safety as well as on stress and wellbeing. Currently we are improving our own working environment. We have a zero tolerance policy on discrimination. In our annual employee wellbeing analysis we follow up on employee wellbeing including offensive behaviour at our offices. We have initiated improvement actions, where necessary. We have introduced a new structure for our environment activities. It focuses even more on establishing an attractive working place. The working environment organization consists of 22 employees. They identify and anchor working environment initiatives including handling and registration of accidents and the psychological working environment. In September 2015 we introduced a new trainee programme which gives engineering students insight into day-to-day business in one of Denmark’s leading engineering companies thus preparing them for the future working life. By the programme we wish to give the newly graduated engineers a good start in their working life. In 2015 we trained 15 engineering trainees. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 7 13 We have developed and launched a new on boarding programme. Films, practical training and guides the ALECTIA EXPLORE give new employees a structured and efficient introduction to our organization, our processes, systems and tools. The purpose is soonest possible to provide our new employee with confidence and to be dressed for work in ALECTIA. ALECTIA focuses on being an attractive working place offering opportunities for technical, personal and management development. All department leaders have been trained in “Day-to-day Management” which emphasizes actual managerial challenges, such as change management, stress prevention and performance management. Another topic that we pay attention to and which is highly prioritized is post education and training of our employees. It is a standard topic in the employee development talks that leaders undertake with their employees every year. OUR RESULTS Employee survey 2015 2014 I seldom experience stress which makes me uncomfortable 3.4 3.5 Values can be indicated from 1 to 5 with 5 as the maximum. Occupational incidents 2015 2014 Occupational incidents (not serious, maximum 2 day’s absence) 2 1 Freedom of organization and the human right to collective negotiation We are represented geographically in countries where we assess that the rights concerning freedom of organization and collective negotiation are respected. We do not engage with suppliers from countries where we assess there may be a risk of non-compliance with these human rights. Children’s labour and forced labour We do not believe that there is any risk of children’s labour or forced labour in our business. Similarly we do not employ young persons below the age of 18 years to carry out work which may lead to health hazards or threats to life. We do not engage suppliers from countries where there is a risk to non-compliance to the human rights. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 8 13 World Champion in Working Environment Since 2009 ALECTIA has advised and worked closely together with Laan & Spar A/S (bankers) about an integrated health promotion and working environment. In May, the results were obvious, as Laan & Spar won the international prize for the best working environment. Also in 2009 Laan & Spar won the EU-prize for this project. The Global Healthy Workplace Award has been awarded for the recent three years but never before to Danish companies. The prize was awarded at a top meeting in Florianopolis, Brazil in the presence of researchers, company executive officers and NGO’s from all over the world. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 9 13 ENVIRONMENT Principle 7: The enterprises should support a cautious approach to environmental impact challenges Principle 8: Take initiatives to promote more environmental responsibility and Principle 9: Encourage and diffuse the development of environmental-friendly technologies OUR ENGAGEMENT ALECTIA’s environment work is designed to reduce the impact on the environment and promote more environmental responsibility and it is based on a cautious principle in relation to the environmental challenges. OUR ACTION We render consulting services on sustainable building, energy optimization, energy audit, climate adaptation, climate security and water supply. We focus on solutions that are energy efficient and sustainable solutions which are favourable to the environment and the bottom line. In 2015 we have implemented the following initiatives for our clients: We have performed a broad range of tasks related to the nationwide mapping of groundwater and assisted in prioritizing measures to protect the groundwater. We have designed several production facilities securing flexible environment and wastewater permits. We have supported supply companies, businesses and municipalities with climate securing of urban areas, building and values as well as establishing climate friendly solutions when handling stormwater that give value for money. We have designed natural recovery projects for municipalities, regions, government, supplies and private enterprises. Performing energy audits and energy screenings we have supported our clients in establishing areas adaptable for energy efficiency. We have implemented energy saving projects for a series of clients and thus participated in reducing their energy consumption. We have advised many clients on conversion to environmentally friendly power types including district heating and district cooling conversion projects. OUR RESULTS We are active participants in the network on sustainability i.a. GBC. We have six consultants accredited to the certification assessment methods, such as, LEED, BREEAM and DGNB. In addition we have seven certified EMO Consultants (Energy Labelling System under the Danish Energy Agency) and four Energy Audit Consultants. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 10 13 In 2015 we have performed 10 energy audits of office buildings and industry facilities including Royal Greenland (food industry), DFDS (shipping company), DR (Danish radio and broadcasting) and KOFF (a private holding company). Our work and consulting have resulted in savings of about 5-15 per cent of the energy consumption of the companies in question. We have structured the climate and energy management in our own company. We collect data and analyse power, heat and water consumption in the buildings where we are accommodated. We prepare climate accounts according to “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol” (GHG). On the roof of our office in Virum one of Northern Europe’s biggest solar panel systems has been installed. It supplies power corresponding to 19 per cent of our office power consumption. Energy and GHG emissions kWh tCO2e Power Denmark 1,304,000 331 District heating Denmark 2,141,000 222 Climate adaptation of urban areas The Copenhagen Municipality has a vision to create new “Climate Areas” within the metropolis. As a step of realizing this vision the Saint Kjeld’s Square and Bryggervangen at Østerbro shall be transformed to a climate-adapted green neighbourhood and set the standard for future projects. ALECTIA and SLA ARCHITECTS have been awarded the design project. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 11 13 ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Enterprises should counteract against all kinds of corruption including extortion and bribery OUR ENGAGEMENT ALECTIA wants to secure a high level of business integrity among our employees. When working inhouse and with our working partners, we therefore expect that our employees apply common sense in everything they do. All contact to customers, vendors or other working partners must be performed with high ethics in order to avoid any condition that may be compromising. We consider anti-corruption as a very serious topic, and we strongly distance ourselves from any form of corruption including bribery, extortion, palm-greasing, favouring and nepotism. OUR ACTION Our work to sharpen our policies will continue in 2015 and 2016. We plan among other things to launch a new CSR policy, a Code of Conduct for our employees with clear guidelines for anticorruption and an external Code of Conduct for our suppliers. OUR RESULTS We have not received any administrative or legislative sanctions for not having complied with the anti-corruption legislation. We have received no judicial reporting on corruption cases against ALECTIA. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 12 13 MONITORING AND REPORTING We attempt to document the conditions important for CSR and our environmental, social and economic impact on the surrounding environment. We present CSR information in our report to UN’s Global Compact, which is also accessible at our website. To ensure transparency and comparability we have decided that from 2015 we will use the international standard Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G4) for preparation of our reporting. The systematics inherent in GRI G4 identifies and analyses aspects and indicators that are essential and relevant to the individual enterprise and provides a good benchmark for comparing with other businesses. In 2016 we will go deeper into the analysis and the individual aspects including what is the management approach to the individual areas and processes. Sustainable building ALECTIA has been the advisor closest to Microsoft for its new headquarters in Lyngby. ALECTIA has in close collaboration with Henning Larsen Architects and Microsoft designed a building which complies to Microsoft’s global requirements to domiciles in relation to sustainability including energy consumption and optimization of the interior fitting out. cop rapport 2015 en.docx 13 13 Virum England ALECTIA /S A ALECTIA Ltd Teknikerbyen 34 Kings Ride Court 2830 Virum Kings Ride, Ascot Berkshire, SL5 7JR Aarhus United Kingdom ALECTIA /S A Skanderborgvej 190 Australien 8260, Viby J ALECTIA Pty Ltd 715 Rathdowne Street Kolding Carlton North 3054 ALECTIA A/S Melbourne Jupitervej 1 Victoria Australia 6000 Kolding +45 88 191 000 alectia.com info@alectia.com Odense ALECTIA A/S alectia.com Sverigesgade 5 5000 Odense C
