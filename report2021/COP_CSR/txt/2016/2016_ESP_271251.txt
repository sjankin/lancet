The company is also one of Spain’s five largest managers of logistics properties, bolstering its position in that sector as well, It is the second-largest operator of outlet a field that NEINVER has been involved with since its founding. centres in Europe and is the market leader In 2015, the company operated in an economic environment marked by the recovery of consumer confidence and the strengthening of business at outlet centres. There were also challenges: the need to in Spain and Poland” move towards omni-channel sales to meet consumers’ needs through digital technologies, geographic expansion, and investors’ and consumers’ growing demand for socially and environmentally responsible growth strategies. NEINVER’s success has always been rooted in adapting to its environment and shaping itself to the market’s trends. This is why it focuses proactively on identifying business opportunities that let it overcome obstacles and advance resolutely towards a future of growth and leadership. The market’s recognition of our experience and specialisation as a manager of retail and outlet centres is therefore one of our main assets. Other partners rely on NEINVER to perform these tasks, and have signed agreements that strengthen our position in the European market and as a key partner in the outlet sector. Besides the management business, there were major investment achievements in 2015, such as implementation of the agreements signed with Colony Capital and TIAA-CREF the previous year for investment in outlet and logistics properties. Since those agreements, assets were acquired at a total purchase price of €348 million. Lastly, I cannot pass up the chance to thank NEINVER’s entire professional team for their efforts during the past year, which made these important advances possible. I have every confidence that with this great team, we will meet the goals we are pursuing. Madrid, June 2016 José María Losantos y del Campo Chairman SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 _ 4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 _ 5 Message from the CEO (G4-1) “In 2015, NEINVER’s results improved in every market where it does business, reflecting its forward momentum over the past year” It is a pleasure to present the NEINVER Group’s 2015 Sustainability Report. This publication documents our business’s most relevant economic, social and environmental achievements, and sets out our goals for the future. It is part of our commitment to providing information about the company’s performance to our stakeholders, who care increasingly about transparency and responsible management. In 2015, NEINVER’s results improved in every market where it does business, reflecting its forward momentum over the past year. NEINVER’s earnings were solid and much higher than in 2014, largely through increased income from property management and through the appreciation of investments in which the company owns an interest. At the same time, NEINVER continued some notable processes that it began in prior years, such as the disinvestment plan—through which the company has sold off unproductive and non-strategic assets over the past three years—and its debt-reduction process. Besides financial performance, the company’s decisions increasingly hinge on the sustainable development and management of assets. Once again in 2015, NEINVER’s management processes were recognised by the highest certification standards: it obtained quadruple certification of Nassica (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 50001 and OHSAS 18001), BREEAM certification with a rating of “excellent” Other milestone 2015 projects that will solidify in 2016 include the acquisition of 151,500 sq.m. for the Roppenheim centre (BREEAM In-Use) and for the design of the future Viladecans outlet centre of logistics properties from Zaphir Logistics by the joint venture between NEINVER and Colony (BREEAM New Construction). Operationally, the greatest achievement was reducing total energy Capital. Additionally, the autumn of 2016 will bring the opening of the 18th outlet centre managed by consumption by 7.1%. the company: Viladecans The Style Outlets. To continue broadening our commitment, the company recently defined a corporate social responsibility Many of the recent changes will propel NEINVER to the next level, since they mark a qualitative leap in roadmap. It also successfully rolled out its Criminal Compliance Programme, consistent with the the company’s strategy. latest reform of Spain’s Penal Code and with other applicable laws and regulations. The Group SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 _ 6 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 _ 7 established new procedures which, combined with its existing transparency methodologies, ensure We are already seeing the first fruits of this new era, which I am sure will make us all very proud in the both transparency and legal compliance. coming years. Working together, all of us—NEINVER’s management team, employees and professionals, clients and suppliers—will once again reap much success. NEINVER also remains committed to innovation and to shaping itself to the market and to the latest shopping trends. The company has therefore developed an omni-channel strategy to fully integrate all its digital channels and tools with the physical centres. This next step in its management model will help optimise the company’s relationship with brands and shoppers alike. In fact, NEINVER has become the Madrid, June 2016 first operator of outlets and shopping centres to offer an omni-channel experience in the B2B2C (business Daniel Losantos Egea to business to consumer) space, which will favour the company’s growth amid the digital revolution.
