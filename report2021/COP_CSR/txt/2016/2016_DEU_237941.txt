Merkens, Chairman of the Management Board, Aareal Bank Group »We stand for sustainable business practices, solidity, reliability and predictability – on the inside, to our employees, and on the outside, with regard to our shareholders, our clients and the capital markets.« Sustainability Report 2015 Aareal Bank Group 3 2015 was another remarkable year for Aareal Bank Group. In a market situation dominated by capital market volatility, geopolitical risks and a demanding competitive and regulatory environment, we succeeded in expanding our position again and generated another set of record results. In addition, by acquiring and integrating WestImmo we further strengthened our position. This demanded a great deal of hard work by everyone involved, and the Management Board would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution made by all members of staff, and to thank them warmly. Conditions throughout the banking sector are likely to remain challenging. We expect continued intense competition, resulting in increased margin pressure. In addition, we still have to deal with a volatile market environ­ment and the impact of geopolitical conflicts in an increasingly agitated world. And, last but not least, the historically low interest rates and unremitting burden of regulation will be with us for the foreseeable future, too. Equally, technological transformation poses new challenges for us as a bank, and changes the needs of our clients. We aim to play an active role in shaping this highly dynamic environment. This requires us to be more even agile, more innovative and more intellectually curious than we already are. Aareal Bank Group’s strategic agenda, which we announced in February 2016, is designed to safeguard and expand our strong market position. Our ”Aareal 2020 – Adjust. Advance. Achieve.” programme aims to optimise our organisational structures, the Bank’s IT, and processes, as well as its deployment of equity on the one hand, and to s­ ustainably develop the business models pursued by the Group’s two segments on the other. Our objective is not only to better leverage our strong market position, but also to enhance our portfolio by adding forward-looking activities to it. No company can operate as an island outside the social context in which it is located. This is why our sustainability management activities are so important for us. For example, in 2015 the United Nations resolved 17 Sustainable Development Goals, including gender equality and decent work and economic growth. We are implementing these goals in practice both internally and in the way we design and organise our core business. It is only natural for companies such as Aareal Bank Group to think about how they can contribute to sustainability. This is all the more true because we are bound to do so as signatories to the United Nations’ Global Compact, to which we remain expressly committed. In the course of this process, we analysed our core sustainability topics in a dialogue with key stakeholders. The results had a direct impact on the structure of this Sustainability Report, which has been modified as a result. Despite continued challenging circumstances and a volatile environment, we remain a reliable partner for our clients and are ensuring continuity in the way we change. We are doing this through a mix of flexibility and client orientation, but also through ethical integrity and responsible actions. I hope you will find this report interesting reading. Yours, Hermann J.

When adjusted for € 150 million in negative goodwill arising from the acquisition of WestImmo – which was completed on 31 May 2015 –, consolidated operating profit still amounted to an exceptional € 320 million. Aareal Bank benefited from a strong increase in net interest income, on the back of unexpectedly high non-recurring income from early loan repayments.
