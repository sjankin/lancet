CORPORATE SOCIAL 2015 RESPONSIBILITY Report Letter of presentation of the report Air Europa, the airline division of Globalia tourism group, has published its Corporate Social Responsibility Report describing the various actions that were taken in 2015 in accordance with the ten principles governing the United Nations Global Compact, which was joined in 2012. The report describes the different actions that the airline has taken with regard to its employees, suppliers and management, as well as within the company in general, all through the prism of the Global Compact in order to reconcile the airline’s business objective with the interests and objectives of the different parties and sectors involved. During the year 2015 the projects that were started in previous years have been continued and the foundations have been laid for new actions aimed at continuous improvement, achieving customer satisfaction and achieving the involvement and participation of employees in working towards the company’s major objectives. To achieve this, Air Europa has invested in corporate social responsibility and providing safety, security and fair conditions; it has enhanced the environmental performance of its processes and it has established procedures to be followed to ensure that quality, excellent service and continuous improvement are the company’s hallmarks. A commitment to the environment has been another of the major principles that has guided the company’s policy and that has enabled the renewal of its EMAS certification up to the year 2018. International cooperation and Air Europa’s support of the needs identified in our society have resulted in the signing of several co-operation agreements with associations, foundations and/ or entities such as the AEA Solidaria association whose cooperation programs are fully backed by the airline’s management.

Therefore, in order to calculate the values of emissions of SO2, NOx, HC and CO we have used the ICAO Aircraft Engine Emissions Databank for our engines and, because emissions vary depending on the aircraft’s phase of flight and it is not possible to measure the data scientifically, we have developed our own model. Below are the values of each gas that we have calculated emitted per tonne of fuel consumed.

Air Europa is made up of a large workforce that is, beyond its professionalism, expertise and reliability, essentially human. This is why birth, maternity, paternity and taking care of elderly relatives are issues that the organisation takes very seriously. Air Europa fulfils strictly all the provisions of current employment legislation, helping its employees to achieve a balance between their professional and personal lives. One example of the employees’ ability to achieve a balance between their professional and personal lives is the establishment by means of a collective bargaining agreement of different winter and summer working hours. In winter, the employees have Friday afternoons off and in the summer, they have all afternoons off. Likewise, when it comes to allocating holiday periods, employees with family commitments are given priority so that the employees with more personal commitments can choose holidays that match the school year and requests for reduced daily, weekly or monthly work shifts are allowed. With regard to retirement, given that the Company understands that such matters established in their agreement that is based on seniority are best decided by the employees, any employee inteand hours of flight. rested in total or partial retirement, can submit the matter to the HR department, which will carry out a personaThe bargaining agreements establish the right of emlised assessment of the whole process. ployees to take off enough time to attend their exams, providing flexible times for attending classes, on-theThe vacancies that arise in the company are managed job training, and priority when choosing holidays so that by Human Resources, which evaluates whether the they can study for their exams. changes constitute a financial, contractual or professional improvement and if this is the case, and subject Air Europa offers a series of social benefits, which are to the General Management’s approval, the vacancy will published on the Employee Portal, which is one of the be offered internally. continuous communication channels that the company uses to communicate with its employees.

Jaume represents to perfection the association’s values and he became involved in the cause from the moment he found out about the association, attending their events assiduously. Jaume Anglada is also interested in the musical future that some of the partnership project’s children have and does his best to encourage them. A NEW HOME FOR CRISTOFER Cristofer, a deaf-mute boy from the municipality of Bocachica, lived in a house destroyed last October in a terrible fire that devastated everything and left his entire family homeless. The house they used to have was not the best, but at least they had a roof over their heads. Fortunately, an anonymous person heard about his story and provided the amount necessary for AEA Solidaria to build a new home for Cristofer and his family. “Santa Claus exists and he is amazing,” said the AEA Solidaria team when they heard about the donation and so it was Santa Claus himself that gave Cristofer the house, giving him the biggest of smiles and making him feel and his family all feel special. This just goes to show that fire may destroy many things but it did not destroy the generosity in some people’s hearts. SANTA CLAUS’ VISIT TO THE PROJECTS Santa Claus also visited Santo Domingo. And just like last year, the Hotel Be Live Hamaca prepared a very nice party for the children from the Boca Chica School for the Deaf and the poor neighbourhood of Los Cocos.

With regard to data link communications with Control Centres, particularly those known as CPDLC (ControlThe coverage of the communications system used by Air ler Pilot Data Link Communications), it should be noted Europa is global and allows the aircraft to be permanentthat they are becoming widespread now. This type of ly connected regardless of their location at all times. communications is considered a key to increasing airspace capacity as well as efficiency and safety. It is one The following figure shows a diagram of the data link of the fundamental technological pillars on which the system used by Air Europa. ELEMENTS OF THE DATA LINK COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM AIR SIDE SATCOM INMARSAT VHF SATCOM Ground station Ground / air VHF / VDL2 Network Ground stations Router Earth / Earth Network COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER EARTH SIDE 82 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 One of the modules offered by the data link system used by Air Europa is for the continuous Monitoring and Tracking of all aircraft in real time. This system capability is illustrated through a graphical representation of the aircraft on a world map as shown in the following pictures: In the example shown below a flight to Milan has been selected. The planned route is displayed (in blue) along with the actual path flown by the aircraft (in red). The latter is determined from position reports automatically sent by aircraft itself: each red dot represents a position report received (note the large number and the high frequency of the reports received). This makes it possible to compare the planned route with the actual path flown and to see any deviation of the plane from its route clearly and in real time. 83 This feature has taken on greater relevance after what happened in March 2014 to the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, when a Boeing 777 disappeared without a trace. Following this event, ICAO proposed the use of aircraft tracking systems by aircraft operators. As a result of this, on 16th December the European Commission approved a regulation applicable from 2018 ordering European operators to implement systems for monitoring their aircraft. With this system, Air Europa is one of the few companies in the world that already meet this requirement in advance, which is illustrative of how advanced the systems used by our Company are. The position reports come from multiple sources (ACARS, ADS-B, radar data, transoceanic air traffic control systems, etc.): all of them are received and integrated into the system and are represented graphically. This feature provides redundancy in the system, which makes it very robust. 84 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 In addition to position information, the system provides a large amount of additional information about the flight selected, as can be seen in the lower window of the figure below, including information about the airport of origin, destination and alternate (destination), actual departure time from the parking position (“Out”) and take-off time (“Off”), estimated time of arrival (“In”) and the amount of fuel on board (“FOB”). It should also be noted that the monitoring is carried out continuously, in this example including the Atlantic area, for which satellite communications have been used. In addition to the above information, the system incorporates another module with a lot of information about (current and forecast) weather and other conditions that could affect operations, which can be displayed on the same screen. This way it is easy to see if a flight could be affected by these circumstances and to alert the flight crews so that, if necessary, they can make the appropriate changes to their route. 85 In the following example stormy areas are displayed: 86 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 In this other example areas of turbulence are displayed: In this example there is information about weather fronts, pressure centres, jet streams, the tropopause and icing areas: 87 In this other case, information from weather radars is displayed: Here there is information about hurricanes and tropical storms: 88 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2015 Other information that is of great interest is information about volcanic activity and the presence of volcanic ash clouds that can significantly affect flight operations: The use of these new technologies has opened up new and exciting opportunities for the Company, enabling the use of new techniques and procedures that significantly improve the efficiency, safety and comfort of operations and, ultimately, the quality of the product offered to passengers. In recent years, Air Europa has actively participated in several innovative international projects promoted by A common element in these projects was the data link leading European organizations such as SESAR and EUsystem, an essential tool that has played a key role in all ROCONTROL or American ones such as the FAA, most of them. of which are aimed at reducing emissions, lowering fuel consumption and increasing safety.
