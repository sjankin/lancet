Supplier mgmt program HP continues to work with suppliers to develop management processes for suppliers to monitor their own suppliers (including labor contractors) for SER. Labor Freely chosen employment Processes are generally in place to ensure that employment is freely chosen. Child labor avoidance Workers below the age of 16 are extremely rare. Nonconformances generally relate to young workers between the ages of 16 and 18 working at night or conducting hazardous work. Nondiscrimination HP continues to work with suppliers to make its expectations clear in this area. Humane treatment Nonconformances generally relate to unclear communications to workers about disciplinary processes and wage deductions. Wages and benefits Nonconformances generally relate to use of deductions, varying accounting procedures, lack of worker understanding of pay calculations, and payment of flat hourly rates or wages despite overtime. Working hours HP continues to work with suppliers on processes for controlling excessive overtime and providing rest days. Freedom of association Means for communications between management and workers are generally in place. Labor management system Management system elements Some suppliers lack basic management system elements (policy statements, management commitment, internal risk assessments, ongoing training for workers beyond new employee orientations, effective corrective action process, communications) for proactively managing risks and ensuring continual improvement in human resources. Health and safety Machine safeguarding Nonconformances generally relate to enforcement and monitoring of ongoing use of machine safeguards. Industrial hygiene HP continues to work with suppliers to evaluate and control workplace exposure to controlled materials and to use personal protective equipment (PPE) appropriately. Occupational safety Nonconformances relate to the need for appropriate PPE and enforcement of the use of PPE. Emergency preparedness HP continues to work with suppliers on emergency and fire response procedures, evacuation drills, and equipment. Occupational injury and illness Risk assessment, reporting, tracking and corrective action processes should be improved in some cases. Physically demanding work HP continues to work with suppliers on use of ergonomics programs. Dormitory and canteen Nonconformances generally relate to hygienic conditions and personal space in dormitories and canteens. Environmental Product content restrictions See “Eliminating materials of concern” in Materials innovation section. Hazardous substances HP continues to work with suppliers regarding on site hazardous materials labeling, handling and storage and monitoring of vendor processes for off site disposal of hazardous wastes. Wastewater and solid waste Nonconformances generally relate to monitoring of water and solid waste treatment processes. Air emissions Exhaust systems for capturing fumes are widely used; air emissions monitoring is widely conducted. Environmental permits and reporting Permits generally available for inspection. Pollution prevention and resource reduction In some cases, reduction goals and performance metrics are not in place or reviewed to ensure that they are met. EHS management system Management system elements While ISO 14001 and/or OHSAS 18000 certifications are in place, some suppliers do not perform comprehensive risk assessments. Ethics Business integrity Nonconformances generally relate to lack of formal ethics policies or standards of business conduct by suppliers and lack of worker ethics training and awareness of requirements. Disclosure of information Processes and contracts generally in place. No improper advantage Suppliers generally have policies ensuring that bribes are not accepted by management. Fair business, advertising & competition In some cases, ethics policies do not include fair business and competition statements. Protection of identity (whistleblower) In some cases, suppliers lack processes for workers and external stakeholders to report confidentially ethical concerns. Community engagement Suppliers generally participate in community activities and provide donations. Intellectual property Processes and contracts generally in place. 54 HP 2006 Global Citizenship Report Supply chain Goals for 2005 (continued) The main findings and challenges highlighted by our Supplier processes for monitoring and controlling audits and HP’s approaches to addressing them are disovertime out of line with accepted standards are a particCollaboration cussed below. ular challenge in the electronic industry supply chain.
