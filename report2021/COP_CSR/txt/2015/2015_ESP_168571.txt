NH HOTEL GROUP 10 Key figures nhow Amsterdam RAI Amsterdam, The Netherlands SIGNIFICANT MILESTONES ACHIEVED UNTIL APRIL 2015 Acquisition of Hoteles Royal In early 2015 NH Hotel Group entered into an agreement for the acquisition of the Latin American chain Hoteles Royal. Hoteles Royal is an international company of Colombian origin focused on the development and management of city hotels and is a benchmark player in the corporate segment. The agreement enabled NH to add 20 hotels and 2,257 rooms divided between Colombia (15 hotels), Chile (4 hotels) and Ecuador (1 hotel). The mix of contracts used by Royal fits with the asset-light growth model envisaged by NH for the years to come. The Hoteles Royal establishments provide a homogenous and consistent product offering which presents a strong match with the high standards upheld by NH and will facilitate the integration of these new properties into the latter’s hotel portfolio. This transaction reinforces NH’s portfolio in the region in attractive locations. As a result, the Group will emerge as the leading player in Bogota and one of the leading operators in Santiago de Chile. The Company already does business at these two destinations, which had been targeted by NH Hotel Group for growth. The Group will also start operating in Ecuador. As a result, NH accelerated the growth plans contemplated in its five-year Strategic Plan, taking advantage of a unique opportunity to achieve a leadership position in various destinations throughout the region. The proceeds from the sale of the NH Bogotá Parque 93 hotel in Colombia in January, coupled with some of the proceeds from the sale of Sotogrande last year, positioned the Group to fund the Hoteles Royal acquisition without having to increase its debt. Joint venture in CHINA NH Hotel Group set up a joint venture with the Chinese group HNA for the management of a significant portfolio of HNA and third-party hotels in the middle and upper-middle segments of the Chinese market in the years to come. The new company will initially assume the management of six of the Chinese group’s hotels, encompassing 1,312 rooms, which are operated under various HNA trademarks. In addition, the new company will design a prototype hotel for tackling growth in the market under the NH brand and will define a strategic plan to boost its development. Both companies will benefit from NH’s management, reward and booking systems, as well as its brand, while leveraging HNA’s know-how and local contacts to identify the best locations and professionals within the Group in the Chinese market. NH wins the global tender to operate the largest hotel in Benelux After a highly competitive contest, NH Hotel Group’s ‘nhow Amsterdam RAI’ project was chosen as the winning hotel concept by the City of Amsterdam and Amsterdam RAI. The new building will open its doors in 2018 under the nhow brand and it will be the largest hotel in the Benelux area.
