Occupatinal Health and Safety Activities; • In the reporting period high risk chemicals based on the effect of the health has not been used as in the previous periods. • Industrial hygiene measurements have been realized in 2013, all results are under the limit values in the regulations. • Company Vehicle Rules have been prepared and the drivers were informed. • An equipment has been supplied to clean the drinking water dispensers. • A special cabin has been made on the collator of RK 26 switch electrical control robot in order to reduce the noise.

Raw materials and wastes are stored properly, chemicals are kept under control. The use of less material, creating less waste, water and energy consumption reduction, prevention of chemicals and wastes from polluting the nature are among our environmental improvement activities and goals. Energy efficiency activities: • The use of high efficiency lighting fixtures and bulbs. • The use thermal insulation jacket on injection machines. • Analyzing the down times of injection machines, improvements of energy efficiency according to the analysis results. • The use of air pistons which consume less compressed air in pneumatic processes. Maintenance and repairs performed to prevent leakage and losses. • Increase in efficiency with planned and periodic maintenance activities. • As a result of room temperature controls, closing the unnecessary radiators. • Bringing radiators closer to employees in large areas, to provide comfort and savings. • Reduction of lighting with fixtures in areas that benefit from the daylight. • Use of the lighting system with motion sensor in areas that are not occupied all the time. Other environmental activities: Waste management is carried out in accordance with the legislation. • Hazardous wastes are collected separately according to their codes and are disposed of through a licensed company. In January 2014, temporary storage area for the hazardous wastes has been renewed. 2011 2012 2013 2014 343 kg 500 kg 384 kg 445 kg Page 29 • Waste batteries are collected separately and waste batteries employees bring from their homes are also accepted. In 2011 24 kg batteries have been sent to Portable Battery Manufacturers and Exporters Association. • Packaging wastes have been sent for recycling in the scope of Pendik Municipality system. • The amount of packaging put into circulation has been declared. • Industrial Waste Management Plan has been approved by Provincial Directorate of Environment and Urbanization. Gating’s from injection machines are grinded to be reused in production process. These materials are used without disturbing the product properties and in acceptable proportions as specified by the raw material manufacturers. Safety Data Sheets of all chemicals in use are examined and the necessary information about chemicals is given to employees. Any new chemical which will be supplied is started to be used after it is approved in terms of environmental and occupational safety. Chemicals are kept in containers which carry a label including the name and the hazard sign. Secondary containers have been provided for the chemicals. In the result of the investigation made by Provincial Directorate of Environment and Urbanization, our facility has been evaluated as the out of scope of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulation, also it has been determined that our facility is not subject to environmental permit. We do not have an industrial wastewater discharge. Municipal (tap) water is purified by reverse osmosis system for obtaining drinking water. Spill Response Kits that are necessary to respond to environmental emergencies were obtained. Environmental impacts of our processes are evaluated in scope of ISO 14001 Environmental Management System studies. Compliance with Legal Requirements RoHS In 2000, in line with customer demand, our activities about restriction of using lead, cadmium, mercury and bromine-containing flame retardants has begun. In 2004, informing all suppliers about this subject has been completed. With the tests carried out, the use of raw materials that do not contain these substances has been achieved. Thus, the production is compatible with RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive. As a result of harmonization efforts in Turkey, Regulation on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical Page 30 and Electronic Equipment has been published in the Official Gazette on 30.05.2008 and entered into force on 30.05.2009. Regulation on Control of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment has been issued in Official Gazette on 22.05.2012. Article on some responsibilities of EEE producers related to authorized organization and Coordination Center will come into force in May 2013. The regulation has been prepared in parallel to EU RoHS and WEE directives. The new ROHS 2 Directive (2011/65/EU) has taken place to the RoHS Directive (2002/95/EC) which is related with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in the Electric and Electronic Equipment (EEE). Restriction of the lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium compounds, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) which is flame retarder and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) is continuing with ROHS 2 Directive. REACH – Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) Substances of very high concern are the substances that are candidates to REACH Regulation’s “Authorization List”. These substances are cancer-causing (carcinogenic), mutagenic, toxic to reproduction, persistent organic pollutant and bio accumulative substances. This category also includes chemicals that have equivalent risk like “endocrine system disruptors”. There are already 161 substances in the list of SVHC. SVHC List is updated on 17 December 2014 and 6 new substances are added and an existing entry has been updated. Our products do not contain these substances. We are able to follow this by the declarations of conformity we receive from our suppliers. In scope of the study for the harmonization of REACH Regulation, the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization has presented the draft Regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals to seek the views of interested parties.
