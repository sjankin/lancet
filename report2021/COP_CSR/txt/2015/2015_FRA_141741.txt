To the shareholders, In our capacity as one of the Statutory Auditors of Legrand SA, and appointed as independent third-party, for whom the certiﬁcation request has been approved by the French National Accreditation Body (COFRAC) under the number 3-1048(1), we hereby provide you with our report on the social, environmental and societal information presented in the management report for the year ended December 31, 2014 (hereinafter the “CSR information”), pursuant to Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).

Our work was carried out by a team of six people between November 2014 and February 2015, i.e. a period of around fourteen weeks. To assist us in conducting our work, we referred to our corporate responsibility experts. We conducted the following procedures in accordance with professional auditing standards applicable in France, with the order of May 13, 2013 determining the methodology according to which the independent third party conducts its assignment and, with regard to the formed opinion on the fair presentation of CSR Information, with the international standard ISAE 3000(2).

Attestation of completeness of the CSR Information Based on interviews with management, we familiarized ourselves with the Group’s sustainable development strategy, with regard to the social and environmental impacts of the company’s business and its societal commitments and, where appropriate, any resulting actions or programs. We compared the CSR Information presented in the management report with the list set forth in Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. In the event of omission of certain consolidated information, we veriﬁed that explanations were provided in accordance with the third paragraph of the Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code. We veriﬁed that the CSR Information covered the consolidated scope, i.e., the company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of Article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code and the companies that it controls within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, subject to the limitations set forth in the methodological note presented in the corporate social responsibility section of the management report. Based on these procedures and considering the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information is presented in the management report. 2. Formed opinion on the fair presentation of CSR Information Nature and scope of procedures We conducted around ten interviews with the people responsible for preparing the CSR Information in the departments in charge of data collection process and, when appropriate, those responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to: W assess the suitability of the Reporting Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and 05 understandability, taking into consideration, when relevant, the sector’s best practices; W verify that a data-collection, compilation, processing and control procedure has been implemented to ensure the completeness and consistency of the CSR information and review the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of our tests and controls according to the nature and signiﬁcance of the CSR Information with regard to the company’s characteristics, the social and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainable development strategies and the sector’s best practices. Concerning the CSR information that we have considered to be most important (see Appendix 1): W for the consolidating entity, we consulted the documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions), we performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and veriﬁed, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the data consolidation, and we veriﬁed their consistency with the other information presented in the management report; W for a representative sample of entities and sites that we have selected (see Appendix 2) according to their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we held interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and performed substantive tests using sampling techniques, consisting in verifying the calculations made and reconciling the data with supporting evidence. The selected sample represented 39% of the headcount, between 21% and 41% of the environmental quantitative information. Regarding the other consolidated CSR Information, we have assessed its consistency in relation to our understanding of the Group. Lastly, we assessed the relevance of the explanations relating to, where necessary, the total or partial omission of certain information. We believe that the sampling methods and sizes of the samples we have used in exercising our professional judgment enable us to express limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required more in-depth veriﬁcations. Due to the use of sampling techniques and the other limits inherent to the operations of any information and internal control system, the risk that a material anomaly be identiﬁed in the CSR Information cannot be totally eliminated.

At the beginning of 2009, the Board of Directors had set the economic result * targets to be achieved. The number of free performance shares awarded to Messrs. Gilles Schnepp and Olivier Bazil was determined by the Board of Directors on March 4, 2010 based on achievement of those targets and voluntarily limited at the suggestion of the beneﬁciaries. (2) 2011 Plan: With regard to allocations in respect of the 2010 ﬁnancial year, the Board of Directors had set at the beginning of 2010 the economic result * targets to be achieved. The number of free performance shares allocated to Messrs. Gilles Schnepp and Olivier Bazil was determined by the Board of Directors on March 3, 08 2011 based on achievement of those targets. In addition, since the 2011 Plan, the vesting of most of the free performance shares allocated to the executive Directors has been subject to performance conditions deﬁned by the Board of Directors. Those performance conditions combine an external criterion (performance of the net consolidated margin in comparison with a basket of comparables over a four-year period) and two internal criteria (performance of economic result * and economic margin over successive four-year periods). For the 2011 Plan covering the 2010 ﬁnancial year, the vesting of the free performance shares allocated to corporate officers was therefore subject to a double set of performance conditions applying at the time of the initial allotment and at the ﬁnal vesting date. As the vesting period of the free performance shares allocated to corporate officers matured in 2013, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 6, 2013, proceeded to review the performance conditions applicable to corporate officers and conﬁrmed that these had been 100% achieved. Therefore, the ﬁnal allotment received by the corporate officers was 100% of the initial allocation. (3) 2012 Plan: With regard to allocations in respect of the 2011 ﬁnancial year, the Board of Directors had set at the beginning of 2011 the economic result * targets to be achieved. Based on the level of achievement of the economic income * target, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 7, 2012, determined the initial allocation of 30,710 performance shares to Mr. Gilles Schnepp. On the recommendation of the Nominating and Compensation Committee, the Board also decided to strengthen the performance conditions relating to the ﬁnal vesting of all performance shares by Mr. Gilles Schnepp, thereby retaining the option of cancelling all or part of the initial allocation. According to these conditions, the vesting of the full initial allocation was conditional upon an increase in economic result * for a four-year period preceding the vesting of performance shares, thereby demonstrating long-term value creation. However, in the event this ﬁrst criterion was not met, a second criterion was to be reviewed to determine whether the Group’s performance, as measured by economic margin, was above that of a panel of peers over the same period. As the vesting period of the free performance shares allocated to the Executive Director matured in 2014, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 5, 2014, proceeded to review the performance conditions applicable to the Executive Director. After examining the ﬁrst performance criterion, the Board of Directors found that it had been achieved. Therefore, the Board of Directors set the ﬁnal number of shares to be awarded to the Executive Director at 30,710, equal to 100% of the initial allocation. * Adjusted operating income less the cost of capital employed.

Based on the Group’s actual economic earnings compared with the target, Gilles Schnepp and Olivier Bazil were awarded a certain number of performance share rights determined by the Board of Directors at its March 3, 2011 meeting. In addition, starting with the 2011 Plan, a second set of performance conditions decided by the Board of Directors applies to substantially all of the performance share rights granted to executive directors. They include an external performance condition (consolidated net margin compared with the margins reported by Legrand’s peer group over a four-year period) and two internal performance conditions (economic earnings* and economic margin performance over successive four-year periods). In summary, shares granted to executive directors under the 2011 Plan in respect of 2010 were subject to two sets of performance conditions, one applicable at the date of grant and the other at the 09 end of the vesting period. The vesting period for performance share rights granted to the executive directors of the Company ended in 2013. Therefore, at its meeting of March 6, 2013, the Board of Directors reviewed the related performance conditions and, noting that these conditions had been met in full, determined that all of the performance share rights initially granted to the executive directors had vested. (3) 2012 Plan: For this plan, which concerns 2011 performance, the Board of Directors set the 2011 economic earnings* target at the start of 2011. At its March 7, 2012 meeting, the Board of Directors granted 30,710 performance share rights to Gilles Schnepp based on actual 2011 economic earnings* compared with the target. In addition, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Compensation Committee, the Board decided to adjust the vesting conditions by setting an additional performance objective. If this objective was not met, some or all of the performance shares could not vest. As a matter of fact, the shares in the initial grant would not vest in their entirety unless value creation over the long term had been demonstrated by achieving growth in economic earnings* over the four-year period immediately preceding the vesting date. However, if this ﬁrst condition was not met, Mr. Schnepp could still retain the right to some of the shares based on a second condition, i.e. whether the Group’s economic margin performance exceeded that of the companies in its peer group over the same period. The vesting period for performance share rights granted to Mr. Schnepp ended in 2014. Therefore, at its meeting of March 5, 2014, the Board of Directors reviewed the related performance conditions and, noting that the ﬁrst performance condition had been met, determined that all of the performance share rights initially granted to Mr. Schnepp, i.e. 30,710, had vested. * Adjusted operating proﬁt minus cost of capital employed.

The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information speciﬁcally required by French law in such reports, whether qualiﬁed or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain signiﬁcant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, LEGRAND Société anonyme 128, avenue du Maréchal de Lattre de Tassigny 87000 Limoges In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meetings, we hereby report to you for the year ended December 31, 2014 on: W the audit of the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Legrand; W the justiﬁcation of our assessments; W the speciﬁc veriﬁcation required by law. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. R I. OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, using sample testing techniques or other selection methods, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall ﬁnancial statement presentation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the ﬁnancial position of the Group as at December 31, 2014 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. R II. JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of French Company Law (Code de commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: Goodwill and intangible assets represent respectively € 2.563.7 million and € 1.853.3 million of the total consolidated assets of your Company and have 09 been recorded as a result of the acquisition of Legrand France in 2002 and of other subsidiaries since 2005. As mentioned in Notes 2.6 and 2.7 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, your Company performs, each year, an impairment test of the value of goodwill and intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives; and assesses whether changes or circumstances relating to long term assets, which could lead to an impairment loss, have occurred during the year. We have reviewed the methods by which the impairment tests are performed as well as the projected cash ﬂow and assumptions used for these impairment tests and veriﬁed that information disclosed in Notes 4 and 5 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements is appropriate. These assessments were made as part of our audit approach of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the ﬁrst part of this report. R III. SPECIFIC VERIFICATION As required by law, we also veriﬁed the information presented in the Group management report in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We have no matters to report regarding its fair presentation and consistency with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

The Board of Directors set the 2009 economic earnings* target for the 2010 Plan at the start of 2009. Based on the Group’s actual economic earnings compared with the target, Gilles Schnepp and Olivier Bazil were awarded a certain number of performance share rights determined by the Board of Directors at its March 4, 2010 meeting. The number of rights was deliberately limited, on beneﬁciaries’ suggestion. (2) 2011 Plan: This plan concerns performance share rights granted in 2011 in respect of 2010 performance. The Board of Directors set the 2010 economic earnings* target for the 2011 Plan at the start of 2010. Based on the Group’s actual economic earnings compared with the target, Gilles Schnepp and Olivier Bazil were awarded a certain number of performance share rights determined by the Board of Directors at its March 3, 2011 meeting. In addition, starting with the 2011 Plan, a second set of performance conditions decided by the Board of Directors applies to substantially all of the performance share rights granted to executive directors. They include an external performance condition (consolidated net margin compared with the margins reported by Legrand’s peer group over a four-year period) and two internal performance conditions (economic earnings* and economic margin performance over successive four-year periods). In summary, shares granted to executive directors under the 2011 Plan in respect of 2010 were subject to two sets of performance conditions, one applicable at the date of grant and the other at the end of the vesting period. The vesting period for performance share rights granted to the executive directors of the Company ended in 2013. Therefore, at its meeting of March 6, 2013, the Board of Directors reviewed the related performance conditions and, noting that these conditions had been met in full, determined that all of the performance share rights initially granted to the executive directors had vested. (3) 2012 Plan: For this plan, which concerns 2011 performance, the Board of Directors set the 2011 economic earnings* target at the start of 2011. At its March 7, 2012 meeting, the Board of Directors granted 30,710 performance share rights to Gilles Schnepp based on actual 2011 economic earnings* compared with the target. In addition, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Compensation Committee, the Board decided to adjust the vesting conditions by setting an additional performance objective. If this objective was not met, some or all of the performance shares could not vest. As a matter of fact, the shares in the initial grant would not vest in their entirety unless value creation over the long term had been demonstrated by achieving growth in economic earnings* over the four-year period immediately preceding the vesting date. However, if this ﬁrst condition was not met, Mr. Schnepp could still retain the right to some of the shares based on a second condition, i.e. whether the Group’s economic margin performance exceeded that of the companies in its peer group over the same period. The vesting period for performance share rights granted to Mr. Schnepp ended in 2014. Therefore, at its meeting of March 5, 2014, the Board of Directors reviewed the related performance conditions and, noting that the ﬁrst performance condition had been met, determined that all of the performance share rights initially granted to Mr. Schnepp, i.e. 30,710, had vested. * Adjusted operating proﬁt less the cost of capital employed.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of ﬁnancial position of the Company as at December 31, 2014 and the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.
