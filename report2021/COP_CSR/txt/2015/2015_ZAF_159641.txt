1 2014Annual Report 2 2014 Sustainability Report Page 2 ! —————————————————————————————————————— COMPANY PROFILE Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT) is a world class coal export terminal situated in the Port of Richards Bay. The coal terminal was opened in 1976 with an original capacity of 12 million tons per annum. The terminal provides South Africa’s Coal ExporHng Mining Companies (CEP’s) with a world class logisHcs service that facilitates the export of coal to Asia, Europe and other regions. RBCT is posiHoned at one of the world’s deep sea ports, and handles large ships and large volumes of coal. The 276 hectare site currently boasts a quay that is 2, 2 kilometres long with six berths and four ship loaders, with a stockyard capacity of 8, 2 million tons. RBCT shares a strong co-­‐operaHve relaHonship with South Africa’s naHonal uHlity, Transnet, which provides the railway services linking the coal mines to the port, and the shipping coordinaHon of more than 900 ships per annum. All its operaHons and administraHve funcHons are conducted in Richards Bay. The History of the Terminal The Port of Richards Bay oﬃcially opened the Richards Bay Coal Terminal. 1976 Phase 1 of the terminal; with a capacity of 12 million tons per annum (Mt/a); started exporHng coal. The terminal completed Phase II expanding its exporHng capacity from 12 1979 Mt/a to 24 Mt/a. The terminal further expanded its capacity to Phase III taking its export 1984 capacity to 44 Mt/a. 1991 Phase III was upgraded to an exporHng capacity of 53 Mt/a. The terminal enhanced its capacity and increased its exporHng capacity to 63 1995 Mt/a. The Brownﬁeld’s expansion project was completed, increasing exporHng 1999 capacity to 72 Mt/a. 2008 The terminal increased its design capacity to 76 Mt/a.

Our vision Moving coal passionately through a world class Port Terminal Our core values • We will not engage in any unsafe acHvity • We treat each other with respect and dignity • We care for the wellbeing of employees • We work to the best of our ability • We are innovaHve and pro-­‐acHve • We care for the environment • Our slogan Coal to the world, growth to the naHon 2014 Sustainability Report Page 4 ! —————————————————————————————————————— FROM THE CEO’S DESK Business growth at RBCT is directly linked to the long term sustainability of the business. This incorporates economic, environmental, social performance and safety pracHces. RBCT has implemented the shared value principles and has taken Corporate Social Investment (CSI) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to the next level that ensures that it’s not just fulﬁlling the licence to operate but rather creaHng social entrepreneurs with sustainable businesses in the areas where they reside. The partnerships RBCT has formulated with the stakeholders including communiHes have been a great example of integrated business soluHons and what can be achieved when working together. Our people at RBCT are our assets and the Human Resource Strategies we adopt are linked to Company performance. We, therefore, ensure that our people are engaged, informed, developed and nurtured to get the results we aim for. For the ﬁrst Hme in the history of RBCT our employees voted for the values that they want to live by and as a result our ﬁve values are a reﬂecHon of this process. A good interacHve and cooperaHve relaHonship has been established with Transnet SOC LTD who through its Transnet Freight Rail Division(“TFR”), RBCT and the Transnet NaHonal Ports Authority (“TNPA”) Division completes the coal export value chain. TFR provides the rail service from the mines to the port, and TNPA oﬀers marine services for the vessel operaHons. Through the improved Global ReporHng IniHaHve (GRI) framework we adopted the reporHng pracHces that promote transparency and enhance the credibility of our communicaHon with our stakeholders. This also facilitates benchmarks across various organisaHons and address issues that stakeholders may raise as concerns. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 5 ! —————————————————————————————————————— The key people strategies that we implemented have yielded results and the employees felt them. RBCT broke the performance records against the set targets twice in two years. When I went undercover to work on shigs with the employees, I understood the challenges beher, fulﬁlled every promise we made and created a beher working environment for all of us. What stood out for me as a CEO was that people treat each other with dignity and respect and enhance diversity. This is one of our key values at RBCT and it is a value that was voted for by our employees. The 5 key pillars of our strategy for the last three years were the following:-­‐ • Human Resource Strategy • OperaHonal Eﬃciencies • Stakeholder Management • Health, Safety and Environmental Strategy • Maintenance and Plant Life Cycle Planning For the next three years RBCT will be focussing on infrastructure development, plant health and cost opHmisaHon strategies to create value for our shareholders who are also our customers. This will not be achieved if RBCT regresses from the focus on people and safety, so the strategy is divided into two phase where the ﬁve pillars will be maintained to sustain the business and the three pillars will be the key focus for the next three years. Framework of the RBCT strategy 2014 Sustainability Report Page 6 ! —————————————————————————————————————— SAFETY • In 2014 RBCT focused on the safety of employees and contractors and declared the year as the year of safety. RBCT achieved a Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) of 0.14 and incurred only two LTI’s during the year. The Minor Injury Frequency Rate (MIFR) dropped to 0.56 from a rate of 1.02 which is below the target of 0.97 for the year under review. The strategy focused on safety awareness campaigns and visible felt leadership by management. The terminal achieved one million LTI free hours at the end of June 2014, a very good eﬀort by the employees of RBCT and its contractors. • RBCT achieved its re-­‐cerHﬁcaHon on both ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 which means the terminal is compliant. • The Wellness Management Programme focused on the overall wellness of employees and contractors. RBCT has an onsite BiokineHcist working hand-­‐in-­‐hand with the Company Doctor and Clinic to improve the wellness of employees and contractors, to sustain a healthy and producHve workforce. • One of RBCT’s key prioriHes is environmental legal compliance and RBCT did not incur any major environmental incidents during the year. RBCT is sHll in the process of ahaining a Water Use License as it is one of the key outstanding prioriHes. The agenda for diversity and women development in the hard core areas of the business is criHcal to RBCT’s transformaHon agenda. We get the opportunity to expose our employees to our shareholder businesses so that they gain experience and on the job training from global players in the coal industry. We have reduced our absenteeism by 3.29% since 2012 and we developed and implemented a talent management process, a transparent process that allows employees the opportuniHes for proper career planning, succession and training. Going forward our commitment to our shareholders is to conHnue to look for opportuniHes to improve our service and ensure that they retain their global compeHHveness. RBCT will be celebraHng 40 years of facilitaHng the movement of coal exports from South Africa to the rest of the world in 2016. This document is clear evidence of our commitment to the principles of sustainability and long term growth of our businesses and the communiHes around us. NOSIPHO SIWISA-­‐DAMASANE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER – RBCT 2014 Sustainability Report Page 7 ! —————————————————————————————————————— OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE The principles of sustainability were at play in 2014 for RBCT when two incidents that challenged the business occurred. • There was a 9 day power outage that was experienced in February 2014 which was as a result of the failure of both Municipal cables that connect power to RBCT. These cables were 38 years old and required conHnuous maintenance and ulHmately to be replaced. Eskom built an emergency 8km overhead line which was installed and commissioned within 13 days. This was achieved through collecHve stakeholder discussions and interacHons. During the 9 day power outage the coal value chain lost a volume of 2mt of coal railings and exports. • In April 2014 the terminal had an oil spill from a decommissioned Engen pipe which burst and aﬀected the ability of the terminal to turnaround vessels on Hme. Despite these incidents RBCT managed to break another record year in performance compared to the previous year. Tonnages received by rail for 2014 ﬁnancial year Volumes RBCT received a total tonnage of 72,43mt in 2014 which represents an increase of 2.3% from the 70,81mt in 2013. This performance was a great achievement by the coal supply chain given the events that took place and the subsequent volume loss described above. Rail Performance The Train System Time (Hme taken by train from hand over to RBCT to hand back to TFR) was 4 hours and 11 minutes which is beher than the target of 4 hours and 18 minutes as per the signed Service Level Agreement between the terminal and TFR. TFR improved its performance consistently and in a predictable manner in 2014 and is targeHng to achieve 77mt in 2015. This target is achievable as TFR has already reached the 76mt mark for their ﬁnancial year ended 31 March 2015. Vessel Performance RBCT exported 71,129mt in 2014, which is an improvement of 1,5% from the 70,23mt that was exported in 2013. The turnaround Hme of the vessels is what the terminal uses to measure world class performance and RBCT achieved 37.49hrs turnaround Hme in 2014 compared to a target of 41.98hrs. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 8 ! —————————————————————————————————————— RBCT PLANT The key maintenance performance measures for the plant are the availability and reliability of the machines. RBCT achieved plant availability of 94.5% which was achieved against a target of 90% and the plant reliability was 94.8% against a target of 95%. The plant downHme was worse than the target at 16.24 minutes per 10 000 tons. The annual target is 13.82 minutes per 10 000 tons, this is however a consistent improvement of 3% on the 2013 plant downHme of 16.76 minutes per 10 000 tons. Good progress has been made during the year and the focus is now on preventaHve maintenance to avoid breakdown management as a strategy. The terminal has stabilised conveyor belt incidents and has improved periodic inspecHons. The Engineering team managed to complete the majority of the planned plant outages through sound planning with OperaHons and ensuring prioriHes are adhered to. This is part of the life cycle planning that the terminal has undergone and completed. The terminal will be the replacing all of the four major pieces of equipment in Phase 1 which are the two stacker reclaimers and the two ship loaders. This is a big milestone and commitment for RBCT given the current economic condiHons. It is conﬁrmaHon that the coal industry is conﬁdent of the coal exports out of South Africa to the rest of the world. Finance RBCT has embarked on a cost opHmisaHon exercise to reduce the cost per ton of coal moved out of RBCT per year. RBCT is commihed to being a low cost operaHon and conHnues to research means of reducing the cost per ton of coal to the users. The operaHng cost per ton for 2014 increased by 4% from the prior year which was 1% lower than the budget. The 2015 budget is a tough challenge for RBCT management but the terminal is determined to achieve the delivery of an eﬃcient service at an opHmised cost. RBCT is in the process of implemenHng six sigma and other business improvement projects; including resource opHmisaHon and contract management to ensure that the budget is achieved. TERMINAL HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2014 In summary, RBCT achieved the following accolades in the 2014 ﬁnancial year when the terminal received 5 awards in various spheres of the industry and recognized for: • Best Terminal/Port Operator – Transport Africa Awards • InsHtute of people Management (IPM) CEO of The Year Award • ZCCI Business Excellence Award: Best Employer • ZCCI Business Excellence Award: SABCOHA Wellness • ZCCI Business Excellence Award: Corporate Social Investment 2014 Sustainability Report Page 9 ! —————————————————————————————————————— IN DETAIL THE AWARDS COMPRISED OF: BEST TERMINAL/PORT OPERATOR – TRANSPORT AFRICA AWARDS RBCT demonstrated evidence of operaHonal eﬃciencies and eﬀecHveness implemented and provided a service that kept its customers compeHHve.

The ethical behavior, compliance with legislaHon and sound accounHng pracHces, underpins the internal control process at RBCT. In the current year RBCT rolled out the Integrated Business Policy. This robust process included the engagement of the services of Anglo American Business Assurance Services (“ABAS”) to perform the internal audit and risk management funcHon in a co-­‐sourced arrangement with RBCT. The audit focuses not only on ﬁnancial processes but also on operaHonal processes to ensure that there are no gaps in the plant and that best pracHce is used at all Hmes. General management and Directors of RBCT consider that systems are properly designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against material loss or unauthorized use and that the transacHons are properly authorised and recorded. Nothing has come to the ahenHon of the Directors to indicate a material breakdown in the funcHons of these systems during the year under review. Risk Management Internal Audit and Controls The Board acknowledges their responsibility for the Internal Audit funcHon as this ensures RBCT keeps up to date with the complexity and rapid changes of the business environment, organisaHonal dynamics and regulatory frameworks. The Internal Audit funcHon plays an important role in the combined assurance framework by providing independent assurance over governance, systems of internal control and risk management, as well as over the combined assurance framework. In 2014, we entered into the ﬁrst of our three year co-­‐sourced business relaHonship with Anglo Business Assurance Services “ABAS” who were approved by the FINCO to provide Internal Audit and Risk Management services. ABAS’s key focus areas during 2014, was to conHnue to assess the risks that would prevent RBCT from moving coal and to provide management with reasonable assurance that the system of internal controls implemented by management are eﬀecHve. The RBCT Internal Audit funcHon with ABAS applied a risk-­‐based approach to planning, assessing the needs and expectaHons of its key stakeholders and ensured a level of audit reporHng was maintained to meet the needs of management and FINCO. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 25 ! —————————————————————————————————————— The assessment of RBCT’s strategic, ﬁnancial, IT, operaHonal, human and environmental risks were conducted to ensure: • Alignment of RBCT risk assessment process and an assessment of the eﬀecHveness of the control environment. • Addressing risks idenHﬁed by management. • Keeping up to date with emerging industry risks. In 2014, we saw a strong working relaHonship develop between RBCT Risk Management & Internal Audit personnel, ABAS and the FINCO, who would meet quarterly to present reports on their audits conducted. The Internal Audits covered in 2014 included the following: • Overall Licence Use • Major Events Risks • Stockpile AccounHng • Fuel Management • Business Integrity • CompeHHon Compliance General Management and the Directors of RBCT consider the internal control systems in place are properly designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, ﬁnancial and operaHonal informaHon is reliable, operaHons are eﬀecHve and eﬃcient, laws, regulaHons and contracts are complied with and risks are managed to acceptable level. While there has been no major breakdown in the internal controls in 2014 which could materially compromise the system of internal controls, control breakdowns and weaknesses were idenHﬁed. Management has addressed those control breakdowns Hmeously. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 26 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Risk Management At RBCT work is carried out daily to idenHfy measure and manage risk. RBCT classiﬁes its risks into two main categories: • Strategic risks including a possible source of loss that might arise from the pursuit of an unsuccessful business plan. For example, strategic risk might arise from making poor business decisions, from the substandard execuHon of decisions, from inadequate resource allocaHon, or from a failure to respond well to changes in the business environment. • Opera^onal risks including a probability of loss occurring from internal inadequacies of a business or a breakdown in its controls, operaHons or procedures. A detailed register of RBCT Strategic and OperaHonal risks is available in the CURA system RBCT Risk Assessment 2014. This register is updated annually. The Board of Directors is ulHmately responsible for the total process of Risk Management and sets the risk strategy, which is based on the need to idenHfy, assess, manage and monitor all forms of known forms of risks, in liaison with the Chief ExecuHve Oﬃcer and General Management. The FINCO (through its audit Commihee funcHon) seeks to ensure that there are adequate systems of internal control in place to miHgate signiﬁcant risks faced by the company to an acceptable level. Systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure or to maximize opportuniHes to achieve business objecHves. RBCT management team is inherently accountable to the Board for designing systems, implemenHng and monitoring the process of eﬀecHve risk Management and integraHng this process into a day-­‐ to-­‐ day acHviHes at RBCT. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 27 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Integrated Business Policy The Integrated Business Policy (IBP) is RBCT’s mandatory, company-­‐wide policy for appropriate business behaviour and responsibility towards our stakeholders. Its content is based on both naHonal and internaHonal policies, including the United NaHons Global Compact (UNGC). The IBP applies to all employees and relevant stakeholders. The RBCT managers are responsible for communicaHng and demonstraHng the content and spirit of the policy and for complying with its rules and objecHve. The IBP includes the business ethics, human rights, social jusHce and environment principles to be applied in all our policies, decisions and acHviHes and outline the RBCT’s principles and minimum standards for conducHng business in an appropriate, responsible and transparent manner. It is complemented by around 20 other policies-­‐ relaHng to areas such as accounHng and reporHng, code of conduct, anH discriminaHon and environmental care,-­‐ that describe in more detail how to address the policy’s minimal standards. Our code is reviewed three yearly and conHnuously updated as and when required. It is publicly available on RBCT SAP DMS. During 2013, we rolled out the IBP to all employees through a group training program and we conHnue to train all new employees as part of the formal inducHon program. Whistleblower Procedure All employees are expected and encouraged to report suspected violaHons to our IBP to their superiors or risk management department. If reporHng to superiors or risk management is not feasible or possible, the whistleblower procedure is available, which gives employees recourse to the Whistleblower Commihee consisHng of the CEO, GMSC, GM Finance and Risk Specialist. RBCT does not tolerate retaliaHon against a person for making complaints of suspected improper behaviour in good faith. All incidents are invesHgated and appropriate acHon taken. In total, 3 cases were reported in 2014, 2 under risk management and 1 through the Whistleblower. One of these cases was dismissed following the invesHgaHon, as there were no grounds for the allegaHons. In 2 cases we found grounds for the allegaHons and proceeded with appropriate acHons. All cases were invesHgated and reported to the FINCO of the RBCT Board of Directors. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 28 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Business Ethics For many sectors globally, business ethics was a hot topic in 2013, with various stakeholders demanding greater transparency from CorporaHons. Ethics is not just a policy statement at RBCT but a way of life in conducHng the business with all relevant stakeholders. As a globally recognised enHty, we are aware that corrupHon is a high risks to any business. We have robust systems in place to ensure we respond and adapt our business pracHces and acHviHes to address higher – risk areas. Fair Compe^^on FINCO undertakes to ensure compliance with all legislaHon applicable to RBCT including but not limited to the CompeHHons Act 89 of 1998 as amended. FINCO consists of representaHves of RBCT’s shareholders who may be compeHtors of each other. RBCT ensures that the Shareholders are guided by the CompeHHon Law principles, contained in the Terms of Reference from various Shareholders Commihees, which applies to all RBCT Shareholders.

Lean Six Sigma is a Business Strategy tool that educates the OrganisaHon on idenHfying ineﬃciencies in business process which are corrected by implemenHng sustainable improvements. Lean Six Sigma has 5 standing levels namely White Belt, Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt and Master Black Belt. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 31 ! —————————————————————————————————————— LEAN SIX SIGMA RCBT’s strategic approach to introducHon of Lean Six Sigma in the OrganisaHon was through the training of 10 Green Belts. Green Belts speak to the level of staHsHcal and strategic tools an individual gets trained on and the type of a project that individual will then work on. The other consideraHon is the level of interacHon within the departments which is required and the amount of staHsHcal analysis that might be involved. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 32 ! —————————————————————————————————————— THE TEAM THAT HAS BEEN TRAINED ON SIX SIGMA GREEN BELTS Shane Naidoo Alvin Padayachee George Ngcobo Process Engineering Manager Stockyard SecHon Manager Shig 4 OperaHons Manager Luis Meneon Tshianeo Nethononda Sihle Shezi Drawing oﬃce Manager Industrial Engineer Technician Environmental Specialist Vassie Naidoo Nyameko Dudula Anil Bhagirathi OperaHons Services Manager Maintenance Manager: Garage SecHon Manager Technical Services Silven Chehy Shipping Co-­‐ordinator 2014 Sustainability Report Page 33 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Innova^ons The InnovaHon System at RBCT is a living tool where the whole OrganisaHon gets an opportunity to take part in generaHng ideas that promote Safety, Eﬃciency and Cost Saving.

Handling this role properly and eﬃciently will enable the business to be in a beher posiHon to increase its output. In our case, moving coal eﬃciently to the world, other than machinery and structure, depends on skills and competencies of personnel we need as a business. Our human resource planning strategy is exhausHve and it entails answering the following quesHons, inter alia: • How many people we need? • What skills, knowledge, competencies and culture we will require? • Will the exisHng human resources meet the idenHﬁed operaHonal needs? • What are training and development needs? • Do we have capacity to meet human resources needs? Our recruitment and selecHon strategy for 2014 was not executed in isolaHon. The successes and milestones that were achieved in 2013 had a direct impact and also inﬂuenced our recruitment and selecHon decisions in 2014. We remained steadfast in our recruitment and retenHon strategies considering challenges we have had, in relaHons to electricity supply and coal price in the internaHonal markets. The laher had somewhat threatened job security and dented our ability to ahract and retain the right skills during these diﬃcult Hmes. We remained resolute in our endeavours to maintain focus on the bigger picture. The good story to tell includes but is not limited to: • Low labour turnover in comparison to high rate in the market. • Increased employee morale measured on the basis of number exits and absenteeism rate. • Low vacancy rate in key posiHons. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 37 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Remunera^on Philosophy The company retained conHnuity in respect of oﬀering compeHHve intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. This is achieved by parHcipaHng in local and naHonal salary and beneﬁts benchmarks. We conHnued to benchmark our remuneraHon strategy against major corporates at local and naHonal level. The benchmark and surveys provide us with insighxul data that is key in seqng up compeHHve and ahracHve remuneraHon structures. The RBCT remuneraHon philosophy is based on skills, competencies, job content, seniority and internal equiHes. Race, gender and age are irrelevant ahributes in deciding applicable rates of pay for employees. Employment Equity RBCT’s transformaHon agenda is well on track and our workforce proﬁle is indicaHve of our eﬀort to respond to the imbalances of the past and to acHvely implement the mandate espoused in the Employment Equity Act.

RepresentaHon at management level conHnues to improve. See below: 1. Talent Management Forums Talent Management Assessment and Review Forum remains the essenHal foundaHon for talent acquisiHon and talent management within RBCT. The talent management matrix (9 Box Grid) was embedded in 2014, having been introduced in year 2013 ager the business had observed a sharp increase in employee turnover levels compared to the previous two years. The focus was more on performance management and less focus on talent management and retenHon. All employees in the C Upper to D Upper were ‘assessed’ and fair comparison made by the employee line manager, General Management and customers of the employee to elicit a holisHc assessment of the employee. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 39 ! —————————————————————————————————————— The RBCT 2014 Company Talent Proﬁle is shown below: This transparent process is in line with our core values of building trust. Management and employees are fostering a relaHonship built on trust and courageous feedback. The introducHon of the Nine Box matrix was in response to employees’ feedback about a need for a more open and transparent system where employees can be trusted with criHcal informaHon that relates to their development and parHcipate in decision making on their future, based on concrete data discussed and understood by both parHes. Each of the Nine Boxes has a set of acHons associated with it. The line manager is then trusted with partnering with the employee to follow up on all acHons listed against the employee name. The employee is encouraged to drive his or her own development, supported by line manager and Human Resources. This process is now in year three, it will conHnue to be embedded and reﬁned to ensure a standardised approach and common understanding. This process has proved to provide an integrated talent management process that links employee performance to development and retenHon. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 40 ! —————————————————————————————————————— No concerns were reported or recorded about this process in year 2014. Individual Development Plans that were discussed and agreed with are being followed to compleHon. Employees and management are embracing the level of elevated objecHvity and the beneﬁts of being appraised by the general management and their customers whom they provide service to. Some of the internal talent in 2014 movements have been shaped by this process and this process will conHnue to be used as a map in ploqng employee development and organisaHonal planned changes. 2. Culture Ini^a^ves RBCT’s corporate culture values diversity and forums such as Employment equity – aim to guide the Business in promoHng diversity in the terminal. RBCT celebrates the Heritage Day as we recognise and value our uniqueness that when brought together is a rainbow. Diversity is a company-­‐wide strategic project, providing numerous beneﬁts to both RBCT and its customers. In South Africa, a diverse organisaHon is more than a necessity – it provides a compeHHve advantage in the form of a wealth of ideas, skills, experience, knowledge and innovaHon. The wonderful diverse RBCT team strives to appreciate and uHlise every individual skill to help the individual, teams and company reach its full potenHal. On Tuesday, 23 September – RBCT employees cheerfully gave 67 minutes of their Hme to RBCT through painHng RBCT roads and signage. This iniHaHve was a true culture shig; instead of spending our heritage Day, employees gave back to RBCT with the culture of ownership and teamwork. This was truly in line with our values which were embedded in year 2014 and on Heritage Month that were translated into four languages: Zulu, Xhosa, Sesotho and Afrikaans. WHAT THE TEAM ACHIEVED ON THE DAY The before Picture AKer Picture 2014 Sustainability Report Page 41 ! —————————————————————————————————————— 3. Employment Equity Analysis NaHonal Stats of people living with disability is 0.8%. The Sector Target is 2%. RBCT has met and exceeded the sector target as the Department of Labour. The Sector target is 2%, the RBCT achievement is 3%. This is commendable. RBCT personal target was above the Sector Target of N =17. The actual number achieved is sixteen (N= 16). Over a period of two years the Business has accelerated inclusion of people living with disability and strengthened their retenHon. There has been a healthy incorporaHon of people living with disability from traineeship to permanent posiHons. RepresentaHon of African Female at all levels is a key area of development, for RBCT both at management and semi-­‐skilled levels. At semi-­‐skilled level, this gap is being addressed through the female traineeship programme and at professional/management level, this gap is being addressed by special focus in developing women through formal and informal methods. Below is the list of barriers idenHﬁed and provides an indicaHon of categories of employment policy or pracHce barriers to employment equity were idenHﬁed. With indicaHon of whether or not there are aﬃrmaHve acHon measures developed and the Hme-­‐ frames to overcome them.

Companywide Forums The focus on transparent and open lines of communicaHon with all our stakeholders was another key culture enhancement for year 2014. This is evident through all communicaHon channels, ExecuHve and Extended ExecuHve, Leadership Forum, SATAWU and employees (through IMBIZO). This year, we have seen openness in communicaHng both the good news and the less desirable news. IMBIZO was eﬀecHvely used to brainstorm cost saving opportuniHes and measures to enhance safety performance. InformaHon was communicated swigly and in an open and honest manner. The following forums took place:-­‐ 2014 Sustainability Report Page 42 ! —————————————————————————————————————— 2014 Sustainability Report Page 43 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Pillar 7: Performance and Talent Management During 2014 the RBCT Talent Management and Performance Management systems conHnued to operate, with no real changes, the Nine Box System was conducted for senior managers, middle managers and supervisory staﬀ. This was underpinned by the Performance Management comprising of Individual Performance Management, the company scorecard – linked to the Monthly and Annual Performance Bonus, Individual (at manager level), Team and Departmental scorecards. Pillar 8: Training and Development The overall goal of training and development at RBCT is to ensure that RBCT permanent staﬀ have the correct skills, knowledge, moHvaHon and alignment to perform opHmally in support of the company’s vision, mission, values and strategic/operaHonal objecHves. Training and Development is primarily carried out to meet the business needs of RBCT while, where necessary and possible, also addressing the wider skills development needs of the country. Our focus is to facilitate conHnuous operaHonal improvement through the development of intellectual capacity. Therefore it is our aim to provide everyone in RBCT with an environment in which they can ﬂourish based on well-­‐deﬁned and developed competencies. Our process oﬀers employees clear purpose and roles that will develop knowledge, skills and ahributes in a focused manner while providing clear objecHves that are linked to the concept of reward for performance. Training and development will be pursued on the basis of the following guidelines: • All training and development will be based on the needs of the company, as well as wider stakeholder engagement, especially, at strategic levels, as established through a needs analysis. • Managers are responsible for the competency levels of their staﬀ in order to ensure adequate succession management in their departments. • All acHviHes will aim at opHmally saHsfying the long and short term needs of various competencies required by RBCT. Training and development at RBCT is delivered through the most appropriate medium for the organisaHon in line with naHonal requirements. In order to maximise investment in our staﬀ and training development programs, managers and staﬀ who have ahended training or development programs may be requested to provide mentorship and coaching where necessary. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 44 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Speciﬁc policies and programmes for skills management or for lifelong learning are designed to empower employees who aspire to be in management posiHons. To achieve OperaHonal Excellence, Superior People Performance becomes key to succeeding in a challenging business environment. As part of RBCT’s company-­‐wide commitment to ahract, develop and retain valuable talent, skills management programmes are in place in all divisions.

The implementaHon of the coaching and mentoring processes are on-­‐going. Management Development During 2014 the focus was on following up on the MAP assessments and leadership training done in 2013, with individual follow-­‐ups on IDP’s put in place through this process. Map Assessments and 360 degree session follow-­‐up by training where completed for the DL and CU employees. The standard Programs such as CORE, BMS, MDP and FMP were also conHnued. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 45 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Management Development Programme (MDP) RBCT conHnues to develop Management and Supervisory skills, through an intense Management Development Programme aimed at creaHng criHcal management capacity amongst our employees. The main aim is to bridge gaps in previous qualiﬁcaHons and to address those who do not have any formal qualiﬁcaHon, in parHcular in management science. The Formal Programmes being the UNISA MDP and FMP programs, while FoundaHonal Skills are laid through more hands-­‐on SAQA accredited skills programs at the Supervisory (CORE) and Management (BMS) levels. Employee Development Programme (EDP) Having begun as a programme for staﬀ from previously disadvantaged groups, this programme has developed into a company-­‐wide program, taking employment equity requirements into account. The aim of the program is to develop the core competencies required by employees making the transiHon to management or supervisory posiHons. The key focus is on managing yourself and a project is idenHﬁed, invesHgated and where possible completed. Ager compleHon of this programme, delegates present their projects to the General Managers those requiring further work or capex and deemed suitable are then further developed via the bright ideas system. Bursaries RBCT grants bursaries in various forms, Open Bursary Scheme, Closed Bursary Scheme (Study Grants) and Staﬀ EducaHon Assistance. Open Bursary Scheme RBCT grants bursaries to assist with sourcing and developing bright young talent in anHcipaHon of meeHng our future skills requirements and in key areas of the community. We sponsor learners, in ﬁelds such as Engineering, Industrial Psychology, Finance, EducaHon and Nursing. Employment equity targets require at least 80% of bursaries to be awarded to previously disadvantaged persons; during 2014 RBCT achieved 98.31% in this area. To ensure that bursars succeed in their studies, individual progress is monitored and assistance is provided where required. During holidays, bursars work at RBCT where they are helped to grow their knowledge through pracHcal applicaHon. This approach helps each bursar bridge the gap between educaHon and the world of business. Closed Bursary Scheme As an extension of the bursary system, each year RBCT oﬀers 20 study grants to employees’ children who are registered to study at a recognised terHary insHtuHon, 50% of which should be focused on conHnued educaHon. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 46 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Educa^on Assistance Program Employees have access to funding for part-­‐Hme educaHon through our EducaHon Assistance Programme (EAP) where RBCT pays for tuiHon and employees are only required to repay should they not pass the courses. This encourages employees to improve their knowledge and work-­‐related skills and to prepare them for the next step in their careers; 91 staﬀ members parHcipated in this scheme during 2014. Appren^ceships and Traineeships At RBCT we have an apprenHceship system registered with TETA (Transport EducaHon and Training Authority); apprenHces are registered with the MERSETA (Manufacturing, Engineering and Related SETA) via a Memorandum of Agreement (MOU) between the SETA’s. Bursars who have completed their Degrees and Diplomas are ogen given opportuniHes to gain the experience required.

Taking this into consideraHon, RBCT created a Technical Training Workshop During 2013, a mini substaHon, PLC racks and small conveyor system were completed to assist with Electrical Fault Finding and a larger number of RBCT speciﬁc technical training programmes were run with the aim to improve the quality of arHsans and reduce down Hme, based on s skills set idenHﬁed by line managers. During 2014 this was further developed to include backstops training and basic Hydraulics Training. During 2015 we will invesHgate the possibility of MERSETA accreditaHon, the intenHon is that over the next two years 2016 – 2017 to move the Maintenance Assistant training on-­‐site reducing costs and disrupHon to the secHons. The long term aim is to do the apprenHce insHtuHonal training on site. The centre is also used as an arHsan assessment centre to test new arHsans during the recruitment phase ensuring they have the appropriate minimum skills. Plant Operator Traineeships RBCT also has a one year training program for plant operators to ensure succession is in place and operaHons are therefore not interrupted in the event of a resignaHon. RBCT has reviewed and implemented Key OperaHons Training Programs as part of our ongoing conHnuous improvement program. Training Accredita^on In addiHon to being accredited with the MERSETA for on-­‐site training of Millwrights and Boilermaker ApprenHces, RBCT is also a fully accredited training provider with the TETA for OperaHons Training courses that include courses in Ship-­‐loading, Bulldozing, Tipping, Stacking and Reclaiming, ShunHng and Loco OperaHng. All trainees who undergo this training can have their credits registered on the NaHonal Learner Record Database. Assessments on the programs above are done by accredited line assessors with a training assessor in ahendance. The assessments are then internally moderated and are further moderated by the TETA on an annual basis. Each year RBCT’s assessments have been approved by the TETA with minor recommendaHons for improvement. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 48 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Industrial Rela^ons The Industrial RelaHons climate of 2014 was stable without any labour disputes, stayaways from work, or industrial acHon impacHng on the operaHonal requirements of the Company. Mahers referred to the CCMA, such as disciplinary-­‐related individual disputes were all procedurally fair and were concluded without jeopardizing or seqng precedents in relaHon to any fundamental business principles. As part of the ongoing revision of collecHve agreements between RBCT and SATAWU, more documents, including the RecogniHon Agreement, were re-­‐signed between the parHes. The Company’s 12 hour shig work system condiHons are exempted by the Department of Labour unHl November 2015, when a renewed applicaHon will have to be submihed for a further exempHon cerHﬁcate. Corporate social investment We at Richards Bay Coal Terminal recognise that we have an important role to play in developing our communiHes, and we fully understand that the needs of our communiHes are vast, and the “ﬁnish line” is far from sight for many deserving community organisaHons, as they strive to meet these needs. Our social and economic development iniHaHves are aligned with the company’s overall growth strategy. We fully understand that we are operaHng within our communiHes and thus we always strive to ensure growth through our community development iniHaHves. We pride ourselves with the long-­‐standing relaHonships with our communiHes within the uThungulu District. Our employees also play a signiﬁcant role through our SCD Commihee, consisHng of volunteers from all levels within the company, as well as union and employee representaHves. Our SCD eﬀorts predominantly focus on: • EducaHon • Early Childhood Development • Skills Development • Community welfare • Sport Development Criteria for funding of projects • It must be sustainable. • It must be developmental in nature. • It must beneﬁt a wider community. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 49 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Our Commitment Our slogan, “Coal to the world, growth to the na^on” depicts our sustainable commitment to community development over the years. Our aim is to build global ciHzens who can build a beher South Africa. We also recognise the need for businesses to make eﬀorts to address the skills shortage, which has become a global concern, more so in South Africa and parHcularly in Zululand. Our communi^es maaer to us Over the last six years RBCT commihed the following amounts to our communiHes: Our approach to Socio-­‐Economic Development (SED) has moved towards a philosophy that is fully accountable and geared towards providing sustainable soluHons to real needs idenHﬁed in the community. The success of this philosophy hinges on the recogniHon that any social involvement should make a meaningful improvement to the lives of the people and communiHes that it is designed to beneﬁt. Our employees also play a signiﬁcant role through our SCD Commihee, consisHng of volunteers from all levels within the company, as well as union and employee representaHves. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 50 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Ntabeni Primary School – The Tree Story The school started in 2000 with 79 learners, lessons were conducted under a tree. It became clear to us as RBCT, a responsible corporate ciHzen that there was a real need for the school and that the community, government and parents would support it. There were no resources, no other primary school nearby and children had to walk extra long distance just to ﬁnd a school. The community rallied around Mrs Thandi Magubane, who had started the school under the tree. They gave her all the support and it became evident to RBCT that a fully ﬂedged primary school was something that the community needed but could not make it happen on their own without ﬁnancial support. We again renewed our commitment to Ntabeni Primary School by providing funds for the renovaHons for the whole school. Last year RBCT spent R500 000 on renovaHons at the school. The school has developed from lessons being conducted under a tree by a single teacher to a fully ﬂedged primary school sporHng 12 classrooms, electricity, an abluHon block, walk ways, an admin block, concrete quad area and oﬃce equipment with 14 full-­‐Hme staﬀ members. Shared Value Principles Social Entrepreneurs Project: Entabeni, Wildlands & Ndindima Community The concept of shared value which focuses on the connecHons between societal and economic progress has the power to unleash the next wave of global growth as demonstrated by RBCT’s collaboraHon with mulH-­‐stakeholders. Through our partnership with Entabeni and Wildlands ConservaHon Trust we built a partnership on clear principles and sound governance, RBCT invests R300 000 towards Wildlands ConservaHon Trust on an annual basis towards this self sustainable scheme in conjuncHon with the Ndindima community and learners from Entabeni Primary School. Each year RBCT is a catalyst to many Treepreneurs to be able to feed their families, buy school uniforms; receive bicycles, and basic building materials for their homes. This is achieved by the Treepreneurs growing more indigenous tress and exchanging these for items that they need. The project also teaches communiHes about environment. The young Treepreneurs receive basic training and the iniHal resources required to grow indigenous trees. They then collect seeds from their local areas and propagate them, nurturing the trees unHl they are large enough to be sold. Wildlands ConservaHon Trust buys the trees back from the learners and sells them to various greening projects around the province. The young entrepreneurs barter the trees for a variety of goods while fostering the environmental issues among the children at a young age. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 51! —————————————————————————————————————— THE EARLIER DAYS OF ENTABENI PRIMARY SCHOOL ENTABENI PRIMARY SCHOOL AFTER RBCT INVOLVEMENT 2014 Sustainability Report Page 52 ! —————————————————————————————————————— RBCT DONATION TO WILDLANDS CONSERVATION TRUST WILDLANDS TREES FOR LIFE PROJECT PUPILS RECEIVING SHOES FROM THE TREES PROJECTS 2014 Sustainability Report Page 53 ! —————————————————————————————————————— COMMUNITY BOUGHT THEMSELVES WATER JOJO TANKS FROM PROCEEDS OF TREES SOLD COMMUNITY BUYING GROCERIES FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE PROJECT RBCT Ubhejane 100m Swim 4Rhinos Richards Bay Coal Terminal in partnership with Fish Engle Swimming Club hosted the RBCT Ubhejane 100m Swim 4 Rhinos to raise funds for the ﬁght against rhino poaching. The threat to South Africa’s rhino poaching is a call to acHon for all those who treasure our heritage. Since its incepHon, RBCT has been commihed to the environment as our logo is a pelican and we are proud of our contribuHon to protecHng our environment. Fantocy Creche From 2 crowded classrooms to a fully ﬂedge crèche with 4 classrooms, a kitchen and an oﬃce. The community of Mandlanzini near Richards Bay Airport was overwhelmed by the conﬁrmaHon that RBCT is funding the crèche with more than R500 000 to build four new classrooms and the administraHon block. The community came together and built two classrooms ager idenHfying the need for a crèche in the area. It was diﬃcult for them to conHnue with building as most parents are unemployed and rely on child support grants, unHl RBCT got involved in 2013. Today the crèche accommodates more than 65 children of which 50% don’t pay crèche fees, it has 178 registered children with proper classrooms and a kitchen. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 54 ! —————————————————————————————————————— RBCT Charity Relay Run – 2014 On 26 July 2014; for the ﬁrst Hme in history of this event, seventeen charity organisaHons made their way to RBCT’s annual Charity Relay Run to receive their cheques from RBCT. An amount of R524, 000.000 was ploughed back to the community. The chariHes were: • Empangeni Child and Family Care • Empangeni SPCA • Life Line Zululand • Sea Rescue • Richards Bay Family Care • Richards Bay SPCA • SANCA Zululand • Siyabonga Shelter • SA Red Cross • Thuthukani Special School • Unizul Science Centre • Zululand Hospice AssociaHon • Zululand Mental Health Society • UThungulu Community FoundaHon • Pathway School for AuHsm • Reaching Out (Against Women & Child abuse) • Business Against Crime (BAC) Inkanyezi Academy Saturday Classes Through Inkanyezi Academy Saturday Classes, which is a project that is spear-­‐headed and fully funded by Richards Bay Coal Terminal, dedicated RBCT as well as other local corporate employees volunteer their Saturday mornings tutoring Grade 12 students at Khula Senior Secondary School (Esikhawini). The main purpose for this project is to supplement and upgrade the pass rate for Maths, Science and AccounHng in among students at Khula Senior Secondary School. In 2013 the school obtained 79% with one learner achieving 100% in both Maths and Science. This project focuses on problem areas which would have been idenHﬁed in the classroom during the week but due to Hme constraints not fully discussed. This learning opportunity aﬀords learners a chance to interact with tutors who also share knowledge and insights on these subjects. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 55 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Department of Educa^on Awards – Uthungulu District Richards Bay Coal Terminal in partnership with the provincial department of educaHon staged UThungulu District Awards to celebrate the educaHon excellence for the class of 2013. RBCT ﬁrst donated 12 laptops to 12 top students in the province and then 10 laptops to 10 top students in the UThungulu District Municipality. RepresenHng RBCT at the awards were SCD commihee members. “we are here today to celebrate and reward the educaHon excellence, We are proud to announce that our project in partnership with Khula High School produced a student that obtained 100% in mathemaHcs” said RBCT GM HR, Judith Nzimande. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 56 ! —————————————————————————————————————— OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE Sustainable Development Performance Richards Bay Coal Terminal is a world class Port Terminal. As the vital link in the coal export chain, we work closely with our key partners Transnet Freight Rail (TFR), Transnet NaHonal Ports Authority (TNPA) and Coal ExporHng ParHes (CEPs). RBCT coal is railed by TFR, the only naHonal rail operator. TNPA provides the marine services to berth and un-­‐berth the vessels. RBCT prides itself on being an eﬃcient and reliable export terminal. RBCT’s eﬃciency is dependent on the diﬀerent RBCT business funcHons and external partners working together. The joint eﬀort of RBCT and our partners ensured that the performance targets are exceeded. Railings Tonnage received increased from 70.81 Mt in 2013 to 72.44Mt in 2014, the ﬁrst Hme coal deliveries exceeded the 72 million mark. The key performance indicators were also exceeded as Train Turnaround Time (TTT) reached a record of 3:20. An improved TTT contributes to reducing the cycle Hme of the trains and indirectly contributes to the rail capacity by making the wagons available to reload. RBCT will conHnue working with Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) to improving rail eﬃciencies. Exports 2014 exports improved from 70.23 to 71.29 Mt, which is the ﬁrst Hme in the Terminal’s history that we reached and exceeded 71 million mark. Exports have conHnued to improve year on year. The improved shipping is ahributed to a corresponding eﬀort from TFR through sustained railings to the terminal. The key performance indicator on the water side is Port Load Rate (PLR) and we achieved 2169 tons per hour against a target of 1 748 tons per hour. Our Customers RBCT’s customers are its terminal users, which includes shareholders, Quahro parHcipants, and other commercial users. Engaging with them, through the OperaHons Commihee, helps us to beher understand their needs. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 57 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Customer informa^on and conﬁden^ality RBCT takes appropriate steps to preserve conﬁdenHal or market-­‐sensiHve informaHon. Where deﬁciencies are idenHﬁed within our systems or processes, acHons are taken to remedy the situaHon. RBCT Plant Long term plant health is being ensured both at operaHonal and strategic levels, by focusing on periodic inspecHon programs and refurbishment outages (Plant Life Extension Strategy). Health, Safety, Environment and Compliance (“HSEC”) Safety, health and the wellbeing of employees is a priority for RBCT, and conHnued to be the area of focus during 2014. In order to ensure ongoing compliance with the OccupaHonal Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993, RBCT put some necessary structures in place. Employees and contractors are conHnuously informed of key safety issues, policies and procedures that aﬀect their day-­‐to-­‐day jobs and other stakeholders in general. Health and safety training is provided on an ongoing basis. Environmental management is in accordance with ISO 14001 and the legislaHon which RBCT subscribes to. RBCT’s HSEC Management systems are assessed against the requirements of OHSAS 18001:2007 and ISO 14001:2004. RBCT’s ongoing compliance with ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007 and its eﬀecHveness was conﬁrmed during the surveillance audit conducted in May 2014, with 6 minor environmental and 3 minor health and safety ﬁndings being recorded. This is in-­‐line with our conHnued commitment to maintaining excellence in HSEC management systems.

The collecHve industry including RBCT plays a signiﬁcant role in the country’s socio-­‐ economic development. The terminal’s focus is on the sustainability of iniHaHves within the communiHes in which our employees reside with a strong focus on educaHon, social welfare, job creaHon and sports development. Preferen^al Procurement – BBBEE RBCT’s procurement policy is aligned with the Department of Trade and Industry’s Broad-­‐ based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Codes of Best PracHce. The focus remains on encouraging suppliers to embrace the codes thereby assisHng in the empowerment of our business partners. Where possible, preference is given to local suppliers, with a number of suppliers in the small, medium enterprise category. RBCT has acHvely driven BBBEE spend over the past 11 years with pleasing results. Ensuring compliance with the Codes, RBCT insists on suppliers providing approved veriﬁcaHon cerHﬁcates. An extensive data base has been developed and SAP is customised to provide up to date and reliable staHsHcs; the database also tracks the number of black women-­‐ controlled businesses that are suppliers and potenHal suppliers to RBCT. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 59 ! —————————————————————————————————————— RBCT’s preference is to transact with business partners who are accredited at level 4 or above so that 100% of procurement spend from these enHHes counts towards RBCT’s empowerment performance. RBCT encourages all non-­‐compliant suppliers to strive to achieve a minimum of a level 4 cerHﬁcaHon. Where commercial criteria are the same, preference is always given to the higher BBBEE rated supplier. RBCT does not pay a premium to empowered companies, as commercial compeHHveness is a key determinant in decision making. RBCT may require long-­‐term suppliers to demonstrate their plans on how they maintain and improve their empowerment raHngs within agreed Hmeframes. Standard procurement criteria • RBCT quality requirements must be adhered to at all Hmes • All goods and services must be at compeHHve prices • All contractors are required to have a veriﬁed scorecard • Service is a given • All service providers are required to comply with the terminal’s health, safety, and environmental standards The graph below aﬃrms RBCT’s commitment to procuring from empowered suppliers, thus contribu^ng to economic transforma^on.

Through RBCT, our shareholders have made four million tons of export capacity available to junior miners at a commercially ahracHve rate. This allocaHon is managed by the Department of Mineral Resources. The signiﬁcance of this is that junior miners can now access the export market through RBCT, making their operaHons more proﬁtable and in many cases signiﬁcantly more commercially viable. The four million tons that is made available is in an environment where export allocaHon throughout all South African based faciliHes is signiﬁcantly constrained through infrastructural challenges; this opportunity aﬀorded to junior miners by RBCT’s shareholders is therefore a direct enterprise development iniHaHve. RBCT conHnues to strive to develop self-­‐suﬃcient business partners, however this is an ongoing challenge because of the nature of the terminal’s operaHonal and maintenance spend which is predominantly on specialised high quality engineering items. HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT AND COMPLIANCE Management and compliance RBCT recognizes that by its very nature, the movement of coal can and will have an impact on the environment. RBCT’s coal logisHcs acHviHes are conducted within the framework of ISO 14001:2004 and a site speciﬁc Environmental Management Program. Compliance with ISO 14001:2004 is audited annually and recerHﬁed every 3 years. Protection of the environment and compliance to environmental legislation remains paramount to RBCT. In 2014, the ISO 14001 surveillance audit was a success, with 6 minor ﬁndings. This is in line with RBCT’s commitment to maintaining excellence in environmental management systems. RBCT seeks to comply with, and remains commihed to environmental legislaHon, regulaHons and permits that govern its operaHon. RBCT has prevenHon strategies which, together with ongoing miHgaHon measures, are aimed at reducing and miHgaHng the impact of its acHviHes on the environment. Responsibility for environmental management at RBCT rests with Senior Management, supported by the Environmental Specialist and HSEC Oﬃcer. OperaHons and Maintenance departments also play a vital role in the management of our environment. Monthly ExecuHve HSEC meeHngs address and discuss issues relaHng to environment, safety and health risks within RBCT and external aﬀected parHes. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 61 ! —————————————————————————————————————— During the year, no major environmental incidents and no environmental complaints were reported. Stringent environmental monitoring and site cleaning services can be attributed to the good environmental performance during the year. The Environmental Systems Upgrade project to harness all process water to prevent pollution of the harbor and to recycle water was commissioned in 2009. An analysis carried out in 2014 shows that potable water consumpHon has been reduced by approximately 37.2% compared to 2013. A serious drive towards conservation of energy was also maintained during the year. Significant savings have been realised. Energy saving programmes continue, the goal being to achieve the site’s objective for reducing energy consumption by up to 15% by 2015. RBCT is ﬁrmly commihed to protecHng the environment and resource conservaHon. RBCT has assessed the environmental impacts of our operaHon and has an Environmental Aspects and Impacts Register in place. Controls have been put in place to reduce the negaHve impact of our business onto the environment. Currently, our primary environmental focus areas are: • Air quality management, • Reducing the impact of coal transport on the environment, • Controlling the water quality of our storm water and process water discharges into Richards Bay Harbour and surrounding waterways, • Reducing our fresh water usage. • Energy eﬃciency Compliance and permits RBCT has its Waste Licence received in 2013. Progress towards geqng the Water Use Licence in terms of the NaHonal Water Act 36 of 1998 is at an advanced stage; our Environmental Consultants are consolidaHng the last outstanding informaHon. RBCT’s contractors and suppliers are required to comply with RBCT’s HSEC Policy, copies of which are conspicuously displayed onsite. The HSEC inducHon process highlights key environmental aspects that all stakeholders should consider and work towards miHgaHon or total eliminaHon of the impacts thereof. Primary impacts RBCT’s primary environmental concerns are: • Resource and energy use • Water usage and management • Dust (air polluHon) • Waste Management 2014 Sustainability Report Page 62 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Resource and energy use RBCT’s energy is sourced from electricity, diesel and petrol. Electrical energy is supplied by Eskom through the uMhlathuze Municipality. Moving conveyor belts, stackers & stacker reclaimers, shiploaders, locomoHves, dozers and vehicles are main consumers of electricity, diesel and petrol. During 2014, there was improvement in energy consumpHon compared to 2013. The focus in 2014 will be in ﬁnding sustainable ways to improve on diesel and electricity consumpHon. RBCT signed the Energy Accord in 2006, and agreed to reduce energy levels by 15% by 2015. RBCT has thus far performed excellently with petrol, but sHll below target with diesel and electricity. RBCT’s focus is therefore on improving eﬃciencies in the use of diesel and electricity. Year on year improvement on energy eﬃciency is being realised. RBCT’s carbon footprint improved over the years, and there have not been any ﬁnancial implicaHons for RBCT due to our acHviHes. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 63 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Water usage and management The Integrated Waste and Water Management Plan (IWWMP) is central to the applicaHon process for a Water Use Licence with the Department of Water Aﬀairs. The main objecHves of the IWWMP are to: • Provide technical and management related informaHon to underpin the applicaHon for water use licence. • Update RBCT’s water balance; • IdenHfy (qualify and quanHfy) water and waste related impacts from RBCT’s acHviHes; • Comply with RegulaHon 704 of the NaHonal Water Act 36 of 1998 Storm water and water collected from the coal stockpiles does not go directly into the marine environment, instead it is drained into sehling ponds, where contaminants are separated from the water before it can be pumped into the ESUP dam. RBCT uses this recycled water for suppression of dust, mostly from coal stockpiles. As a result of use of this recycled water, the overall consumpHon of potable water over the past 3 years decreased signiﬁcantly by more than 75% since the commissioning of the ESUP dams in 2009 Potable water is now only used for domesHc purposes. 136.41 megaliters were used in 2014 compared to 217.22 used in 2013. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 64 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Potable Water Usage The quality of the recycled water is conHnuously monitored and treated to minimize the polluHon of ground and groundwater which may result from reuse of this water. Sewerage eﬄuent parameters of the ﬁnal eﬄuent have in the past 12 months met the requirement of the NaHonal Water Act, 1998. The quality of our underground water is monitored quarterly through borehole sampling to ensure no adverse polluHon of the underground water. The results are sent to an independent laboratory for analysis and all samples were within legal limits in the past year. We are currently conducHng a geohydrological survey to monitor sulphate content of the underground water. Dust (air pollu^on) Dust management is a priority at RBCT. Dust fallout rates recorded during 2014 have averaged well below 0.6g/m2 (the maximum allowable level). 2014 Sustainability Report Page 65 ! —————————————————————————————————————— RBCT currently uses RDC20 as dust suppressant on dirt roads around the stockpiles. Dust-­‐ aside is a water-­‐based binding agent that forms a layer on the road surface to suppress dust. The stockpiles are sprinkled with water through rain guns located around the stockpiles to further reduce dust. The two PM10 monitoring staHons installed on the south and north perimeters of RBCT to further improve dust monitoring on our site have shown that RBCT complies with NEM: AQA. Waste Management The management of waste remains one of RBCT’s most important environmental challenges. In 2014 RBCT obtained Waste License 59 of 2008, RBCT improved its waste management programmes by improving its waste audits and implemenHng sustainable plans. The implementaHon of a comprehensive waste management strategy aims to reduce the amount of waste being consigned to local dumpsites. A greater awareness for the need for recycling pracHces is being achieved. RBCT’s waste streams are, but not limited to the following: • Used oil • Oil contaminated waste • Clinic waste • Sewerage eﬄuent • Sehling pond eﬄuent • Electronic waste • Paper • Rubber The generated waste is measured on a monthly basis and targets have been set to reduce the quanHHes. Some waste is recycled and some disposed of in environmentally responsible manner. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 66 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Biodiversity RBCT facility is situated within the Port of Richards Bay in the uMhlatuze Local Municipality which has a warm to hot and humid subtropical climate, with warm moist summers. The 276ha facility is completely transformed from its once natural state; however, maintained vegetated and landscaped areas do exist within the site boundary. Eight specimens of Hibiscus Jliaceus (Lagoon Hibiscus) are available at RBCT on the South of Phase 3. These trees are listed as protected indigenous plants in terms of The KwaZulu-­‐ Natal Nature ConservaHon Management Amendment Act, 1999 (No. 5 of 1999). These species were planted for landscaping purposes. 2750 Casuarina equiseJfolia (Coastal Beefwood) exist in the eastern parts of this Phase 3, planted for wind diversion. Three specimen of Bersama lucens (Glossy White Ash) are available onsite. This tree is listed as a protected indigenous plant in terms of the KwaZulu-­‐Natal Nature ConservaHon Management Amendment Act, 1999 (No. 5 of 1999). Included in the landscaped gardens are species that are protected by Provincial and/or NaHonal legislaHon which include 2 specimens of Podocarpus falcatus (Outeniqua Yellowwood) to the north of the control tower, Aloe, Encephalartos (Cycads), Hibiscus Jliaceus (Lagoon Hibiscus) and Eugenia capensis (Dune Myrtle). In the northern side of RBCT, there occurs a species-­‐rich wetland dominated by relaHvely short herbs reﬂecHng the variaHon of species. Amongst the many interesHng components of this assemblage is tropical sedge, Pycreus unioloides, possibly the best standing in this region nowadays. White and black mangroves are also found on this wetland where water is fresher and plenty. The black mangroves are >17m in height, making these amongst the taller to be found along the KZN Coasts. Dolphins are regularly seen alongside the coal quay and a ﬂourishing marine reserve exists on RBCT’s doorstep – home to pelicans, ﬂamingos, ﬁsh eagles, waders, crabs and a host of other bird and marine life. An area within this reserve has been idenHﬁed as a possible NaHonal Heritage Site, bearing tesHmony to the health of the surrounding natural environment. On annual basis, RBCT partners with Department of Agriculture and Environmental Aﬀairs to commemorate speciﬁc days such as environmental week and water week. Employees and their families are always encouraged to parHcipate in our annual coastal clean-­‐up programme which is very popular with employees. RBCT’s acHviHes have not impacted the biodiversity within RBCT and surrounding areas. In order to manage and miHgate impacts on diversity, the following plans were implemented: • Alien Invasive VegetaHon Management Plan • Indigenous PlanHng Plan 2014 Sustainability Report Page 67 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Sustainable health and safety performance RBCT’s HSEC policy sets out our commitment to eliminaHng illnesses, injuries and fataliHes from our business. RBCT maintains comprehensive HSEC management system which is fully aligned to OHSAS 18001:2007. Ensuring the safety of our employees and contractors in the workplace is of paramount importance. We aim to conduct our operaHons with ‘zero injuries’ to our employees and contractors, and believe that all work-­‐related illnesses and injuries are preventable. In accordance with our commitment to preventing accidents, occupational illnesses and environmental pollution, we aim to: • Appropriately idenHfy risks and manage hazards; • Comply with applicable naHonal, provincial and local safety, health laws; • Apply internaHonally recognized standards, codes and other requirements applicable to RBCT; • Set, monitor and conHnuously review safety and health objecHves and targets at every level of the organizaHon; • EﬀecHvely communicate with, and involve, all our key stakeholders on our safety, and health policy; • EﬀecHvely report, invesHgate and respond to incidents, ensuring appropriate emergency response and crisis management; • ConHnuously striving to improve our safety, health and environmental performance; • Provide adequate resources for the achievement of the SHE policy objecHves and targets. SAFETY The safety of employees remained a priority for RBCT during 2014. RBCT falls under the jurisdicHon of the OccupaHonal Health and Safety Act 85 (1993). The necessary structures and pracHces are in place to ensure compliance to this legal framework. Employees and contractors are well informed of the safety issues, policies and procedures that aﬀect their jobs and those of other employees and contractors, as well as the community in general. All employees on site receive regular safety and health training and are issued with protecHve equipment where hazards cannot be totally eliminated. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 68 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Health and Safety training conducted during the year: • Behaviour Based Safety (COBRA) • OccupaHonal Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 • Risk and impact assessment • Basic Fire • Basic First Aid • OHSAS 18001 • ICAM invesHgaHon methodology • General Health and Safety Training • SHE RepresentaHves training We ensure that every hazardous task undertaken in our workplace has a safe system of work idenHﬁed and that our employees and contractors have tools and equipment that are ﬁt for purpose and well maintained. RBCT uses a risk-­‐management system to idenHfy, assess and eliminate or control safety risks. When an unsafe condiHon is idenHﬁed or when a safety incident occurs, it is invesHgated immediately and acHon is taken to eliminate the risks involved. Safety audiHng occurs regularly across our business to improve safety standards and pracHces. In addiHon, safety performance, iniHaHves and issues are regularly communicated to all of our stakeholders. Safety Performance RBCT is proud to report that we conHnued to make a signiﬁcant improvement in safety. Our quest to create and sustain injury-­‐free work environments for our employees and contractors conHnued during 2014. Safety performance improved considerably over the previous year. There were no fataliHes at RBCT during the year and the lost Hme injury frequency rate (LTIFR) for the year was at 0.14 per million man-­‐hours worked. This is a marginal decline on 2013. The minor injury frequency rate for the year was 0.56 per million man-­‐hours worked. The primary causes of injuries remain those associated with hand injuries. Risk assessments and behaviour based safety form part of RBCT’s eﬀorts to reduce these and other incidents. We conHnued to make progress on our safety culture, and engagement of all stakeholders has been idenHﬁed as key to achieving HSEC excellence. Formal joint health and safety commihees, comprising management, the workforce, contractors and unions meet regularly ensuring consultaHon with all relevant stakeholders concerning all mahers relaHng to occupaHonal health and safety in the workplace. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 69 ! —————————————————————————————————————— 2014 Sustainability Report Page 70 ! —————————————————————————————————————— In 2015, we will redouble our safety eﬀorts with a goal to achieve to maintain the LTIFR at zero, and further minimise MIFR by at least 5%. We focused our safety eﬀorts on Behaviour Based Safety process, uniquely named Change of Behaviour Reduces Accidents (COBRA) at RBCT, which has delivered some good results in improving our safety performance. With all 514 employees and 600 contractors trained on COBRA and being acHve observers, the eﬀort going forward is to embed COBRA to ensure quality observaHons are submihed and that the idenHﬁed barriers contribuHng to at-­‐risk behaviours are removed. A great deal of Hme was spent training contractors on COBRA, risk assessments and reviewing the adequacy of their safety programmes. The result has been great improvement of our contractors in HSEC compliance. Occupa^onal Health and Hygiene The wellbeing of our employees and contractors in the workplace and the community is criHcal to the success of our business. RBCT is commihed to achieving zero work-­‐related illnesses through idenHfying, assessing and controlling occupaHonal health hazards. An OccupaHonal Health Medical PracHHoner works on a part-­‐Hme basis visiHng our site twice a week; and four full-­‐Hme OccupaHonal Health Nurses are available to cover two shigs. Comprehensive health risk assessment is done every two years to help us improve on our medical surveillance programme. During 2014, RBCT has put a number of occupaHonal health strategies in place, including: • Biggest loser compeHHon – all employees are encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle by exercising, eaHng healthy. A healthy workforce is a happy workforce. • A conHnuing occupaHonal hygiene program for monitoring stressors in the workplace i.e. noise, gravimetric dust and silica, ergonomic, illuminaHon, vibraHon, diesel, Belt splicing and welding fumes , thermal stress. • Development of a plan to reduce the above based on recommendaHons from the occupaHonal hygienist; • Hearing conservaHon programme. • Dust and Silica programme. • Medical surveillance programme. • Back care programme. • ConHnuous health and hygiene awareness training conducted during the annual HSEC inducHon and monthly health topics. Serious injuries/illnesses are referred to the local hospitals. Medical surveillance medicals are conducted on-­‐site. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 71 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Wellness Week has become an annual event in RBCT. It is always held during the last week of August. An ongoing extensive in-­‐house Wellness and disease management programme is given at the Health Care Centre which includes: o HIV Counselling and TesHng (HCT) o Integrated Health and Wellness services with a 24 hour psychological counselling. The service provider concentrates mainly of four pillars of wellness popular known as ‘four pack’ i.e. EmoHonal, Legal, Physical and Financial. o BiokineHcist – He addresses all the ergonomic related issues in RBCT. The BiokineHcist runs the rehabilitaHon program of employees recovering from diﬀerent condiHons i.e. stroke, muscular skeletal injuries etc. The Careways group consults employees with diﬀerent issues ranging from emoHonal, ﬁnancial and physical wellness. Primary Healthcare • Chronic disease monitoring (diabetes, hypertension, gout, high cholesterol etc.) • Treatment of minor ailments 24 hours (colds, diarrhoea, headaches etc.) • We have a visiHng DieHcian who manages our employees who are on the Biggest Loser programme and chronic disease monitoring. HIV Counselling and Tes^ng HIV& AIDS remains a signiﬁcant risk to South Africa. RBCT recognises that the management of HIV & Aids is an integral part of its approach to ensuring the well-­‐being of its employees. The company aims to maintain and conHnually improve its HIV&AIDS Management programmes. In 2014, the company’s drive was on ensuring that employees know their HIV status by undergoing HCT (HIV counselling and tesHng). We are happy to report that as at the end of December 2014, 85 % of RBCT employees had undergone HCT and know their status. This was made possible through: o Ongoing awareness campaigns at team levels; o Annual tesHng campaigns through wellness week and World Aids day; o PromoHon of a sHgma-­‐free culture in which tesHng is ‘normal’; o Guaranteed conﬁdenHality by the Clinic personnel; o Oﬀering of rouHne tesHng during any medical consultaHons at RBCT Clinic. RBCT is targeHng 100% of employees to know their status by the end of 2015. 2014 Sustainability Report Page 72 ! —————————————————————————————————————— Coal Dust and Silica Coal dust and silica levels at RBCT are kept at a minimal. RBCT has taken reasonable steps to ensure dust and silica exposures to employees and contractors are kept at a minimum. Dust and silica monitoring takes place biannually, and where dust levels are found to be high, measures to minimize dust are applied. Noise Hearing loss may result from long-­‐term exposure to high noise levels. RBCT conducts baseline, periodic, transfer and exit audiometric examinaHons. Noise is generally treated at source, and where noise cannot be eliminated, signage is posted to remind employees and contractors to wear their hearing protecHon. All personnel working in noisy areas are provided with hearing protecHon equipment.
