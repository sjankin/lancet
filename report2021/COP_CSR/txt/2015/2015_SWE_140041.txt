However, Castellum still managed to deliver 8% growth in income from property management in 2014 – slightly Castellum operates here, in these parts of Sweden where better than for 2013. In addition, Castellum also strengthened 65% of the country’s population lives and works. We’re its financial position. creating the conditions to further participate in the construction of the workplaces of tomorrow. Our project Due to the changes implemented, our good earnings capacity, activity is high and here are some examples: low loan-to-value ratio and access to long-term credits, Castellum now has an investment capacity of SEK 6 billion.

Ulrika Danielsson acquired a new role as CFO of the Group. 2 C A S T E L L U M 2 014 CEO’s Comments I’m convinced that proficient and committed employees generate satisfied customers, and we’re happy to say that in 2014, our NKI (Satisfied Customer Index) rose to a level well above the sector benchmark. Castellum also continued important sustainability activities, which are a condition for the company’s development and long-term economic growth. I am proud that we have offered apprentices, holiday workers, interns and trainees a chance to gain hands-on work experience. Castellum has the lead when it comes to environmentally classified buildings: For example, our portfolio includes 30% of all Swedish Green Building certified properties. In 2014, we signed the Global Compact, the UN’s ten principles on how the business sector can take global responsibility concerning the environment, working conditions and corruption. Furthermore, we established a whistleblower function to report concerns that could seriously affect the company – or a person’s life and health – to ensure compliance with company values and ethical principles. Castellum, currently one of the largest real estate companies in Sweden, has never had the goal of becoming the largest player, but has managed in accordance with our ambitious cash-flow goals to achieve continuous growth. The company continues to operate with lower financial risk than the industry average. It is pleasing to note that the Board once again proposes an increase in dividend, and that the long-term net asset value after dividend, increased by 7% in 2014. I look forward to 2015 a year with continued, if cautious, growth in Sweden. To achieve our growth objective in such an economy and against the background of Castellum’s strategic sales during last autumn, it is important that we continue high activity and focus on efficient and sustainable management, as well as on investments. I would like to take this opportunity to once again sincerely thank all our shareholders and stakeholders for your trust during 2014.

C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T 7 Real estate portfolio Market share is important. But choice of market is even more important. Financially, Castellum is one of Sweden’s largest real estate companies, but we have no ambition to become the largest. On the contrary – an important part of our business model is to focus on selected markets which demonstrate optimal conditions for development. Castellum operates in five strong growth regions in Sweden; from Mälardalen and Greater Stockholm, down via Eastern Götaland to Greater Gothenburg and the Öresund Region. Together, these five markets represent 65% of the Swedish population. Castellum’s objective is to be one of the three largest real estate companies in each market. 8 C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T Real estate portfolio Market comments Swedish economy Sweden, with over 9.7 million inhabitants, is a country was also revised down, and no interest rate rise is indicated with an open and strong economy.

A local labor market is characterized by that it can function independently concerning work and commuting. Some markets are due to their size and business structure less dependent to changes in the world around than others and have their own inherent power to grow, where the size provides economies of scale. Sweden is currently in an strong urbanization trend where growth is concentrated in the long-term to medium-sized and larger regions, while the number of regions is reduced. The three major urban regions in Sweden have the greatest development potential which is explained by a larger population, which in turn creates a larger labor market, a diversified industrial structure, research opportunities and greater variety of shopping, entertainment and culture. Successful regions are also characterized by tolerance.The most attractive cities offer opportunities for quality education in universities and colleges. They embrace diversity and openness.

The investments are made in order to improve cash flow and increase the value of the properties. New development projects are added on an ongoing basis through the acquisition of properties with development potential and unutilized building rights. In order to achieve the overall growth objective of 10%, Castellum needs to invest. The strategy is yearly net investments of at least 5% of the total property value.

Hans Stridh Until the 1970s, Sweden was still one of the world’s leading shipbuilding nations, and the major shipyards were to be found in Gothenburg. Today it is an area vibrating with developments and new ideas: New collaborations continuously form between companies, academia and the community and these generate new job opportunities. “It’s interesting to be able to watch close up how an international engineering cluster evolves, and we are happy to be part of building modern workplaces in this environment,” says Hans Stridh, Project Development Manager at Eklandia Fastighets AB, a Castellum subsidiary. In Eklandia’s properties on Lindholmen we find companies such as CEVT, a vehicle development company with the same owner as Volvo Cars; Getinge, whose headquarters were moved here from Halland; and Esab, the world’s leading supplier of welding equipment. With the ball rolling, the conversion of Lindholmen proceeds at a fast pace. It is the result of a collaboration in which the municipality, academia and the business community work together to support innovation processes. “Some actions became of crucial importance: the initiative of the municipality in kicking off the Lindholmen Science Park; Ericsson’s decision to consolidate business to central Gothenburg, the importance of Volvo as a major player and the courage shown by Chalmers in moving a number of institutions and activities to the other side of the river,” Hans continues. Situated next to Eklandia’s headquarters is the Aurora office building, completed in 2013. Furthermore, Semcon’s new headquarters were completed at year end 2014/2015 and are situated next to the SVT [Swedish Television] building and the Frihamnen area, where parts of a whole new city district will be completed in time for Gothenburg’s 400th anniversary in 2021. In addition, Eklandia bought one of Lindholmen’s last buildable sites for commercial properties, located quayside, near the existing portfolio. 18 C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T • Green Building 1.

C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T 21 • Miljöbyggnad Atollen 3 and Algen 1, Jönköping The biggest makeover of Jönköping since 1612, when Gustaf II Adolf decided to build the new city and develop the eastern city-centre. A fair description of the Atollen project. Peder Karlén The project entails the urban development of three new blocks – the single largest investment on the northern side of Munksjön. This area will play an important role in the development of Jönköping’s city centre. “At Castellum we’re proud of helping to make the waterfront accessible. I’m sure that the inhabitants of Jönköping appreciate this,” says Peder Karlén, Property Manager at Castellum-owned Fastighets AB Corallen in Jönköping – one of the three companies involved in the project. The Atollen project includes office and retail space, restaurants, rental and co-op apartments, and a parking garage. Atollen is being developed only steps away from the Spira Cultural Centre, whose silhouette can be glimpsed between the new buildings. Atollen will vibrate with life almost 24/7 and become a place where you can live and work as well as shop and eat – or just stroll around. These new blocks will form a natural link between the retail-dense parts of central Jönköping and the new neighbourhoods around Munksjön. This is our current contribution to the process of developing this expansive municipality – Sweden’s tenth largest – where population increases by more than 1000 people annually. “These days, life in central Jönköping is strongly linked to the area around Munksjön,” says Peder Karlén. “Our cornerstone was the ten-year-old urban construction vision. Among other things, this vision led to the construction of a new bridge. One can conclude that Castellum is meeting the requirements for developing what’s often referred to today as a “mixed-use city”. 22 C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T Atollen in Jönköping C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T 23 Central Uppsala • Miljöbyggnad 2 4. Dragarbrunn 20:4, Uppsala Zinc house Reconstruction of the “Copper house” in central Uppsala was completed in June, 2014 – a contribution to the development of the city’s new main street, between Vaksala Square and the venerable university library, Carolina Redivia. Björn Johansson Major ongoing developments are currently happening in central Uppsala. At one time, Sweden’s largest department store Epa was housed in a building in the Svalan block. This was built in 1964 with its characteristic façade of green-glazed bricks. Here, Castellum has been engaged in major reconstruction activities through its subsidiary, Aspholmen Fastigheter AB. “In Uppsala, there is a strong demand for offices located close to public transportation. Hence, the Svalan block in Dragarbrunn covers an optimal location between the Main Square and the Travel Centre,” states Björn Johansson, Property Manager at Aspholmen in Uppsala. The efforts of Aspholmen in the Svalan block have been divided into stages, one of which was the reconstruction of the Epa department store – and its conversion into the Copper house: the façade was changed and moved three metres out, towards Vaksalagatan. Aspholmen also pulled in the walls of two upper storeys, to make room for new roof terraces that overlook the city. The second stage was the reconstruction of a building at Dragarbrunnsgatan, housing a restaurant. This had previously been a two-storey building. Today, there are five floors and the building has become known as the ”Zinc house” – alluding to its façade. Aspholmen’s involvement in Dragarbrunn started 2007 and the latest step includes reconstructions totalling 6,000 sq. m. and extensions of the Copper house – that is, the vertical addition of extra space amounting to 4,000 sq. m. In the autumn of 2014, the reconstruction was awarded the Urban Environment Award by Uppsala Nya Tidning, the daily newspaper. “We’ve both rebuilt and extended – or rather added on. Thus we have 14,000 square metres at our disposal today, compared with 10,000 before,” says Björn Johansson. “We’ve built a space-efficient solution and complied with high technical and environmental specifications”. 24 C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T • Miljöbyggnad 1.

The most significant of these is the zoning development plan, i.e. the probability for future development, the permitted buildingBuilding rights by region and sq.m. rights volume and the development timeframe. In Castellum submarkets, such as Bromma/Mariehäll and Johanneshov in Stockholm, there is an ongoing process of plan changes which will lead to gradual conversion of older office and industrial premises into residential space. However, as the city grows, new areas are being added to the list of areas subject to conversion. Urban development Urban development is complex and can be carried out in a number of ways within different societal structures. Castellum works actively with real estate development, project development and early stages of urban development. We participate actively in the various phases of zoning plan and development. Each subsidiary is an active player in the growth region where it operates and maintains a close dialogue and collaboration with municipalities and stakeholders. It is time-consuming to participate in zoning plan processes and project development from “soup to nuts”, i.e. all the way from drawing up a detailed plan to the finished building ready for occupancy. When it comes to local planning, Castellum’s strengths are local presence, expertise, investment power and long-term commitment. The figure illustrates an overview of the different phases of the zoning plan process.

We can thus offer customers shorter decision-making processes, quicker responses and smoother-running business activities. In addition, customers can enjoy the increased security provided by a large national corporation. High-quality and long-term customer relations are a prerequisite for creating growth at Castellum.

Castellum is one of the largest players in the real estate business, but survivability is dependent on continuous development. Sustainability has always been a natural part of our operations, and Castellum has a pronounced focus on environmental efforts. This means that resources, such as energy, are used as wisely and efficiently as possible. Castellum works with constant environmental improvements, and today, 20% of the real estate portfolio is certified in accordance with the criteria of Miljöbyggnad, Green Building or BREEAM. Castellum currently owns 30% of Sweden’s Green Building-certified properties. Sustainable development is also about our social environment, and Castellum actively participates in the communities wherein we operate. We participate in ongoing collaborations with customers and other stakeholders on issues such as improved public transport and increased cooperation with schools and universities. In addition, the Group supports young people by offering summer jobs and apprenticeships. And not least, we take care of our satisfied employees at Castellum.

To achieve this, Castellum works with environmental inventories and recognized environmental classification systems vis-à-vis the properties. The objectives include environmental evaluations for all properties, and environmental classifications for all new constructions and major reconstructions. Both goals were achieved in 2014. The updated objectives adopted in 2014 require classification of office and retail premises as Miljöbyggnad, minimum Silver level.

The average valuation yield for Castellum’s real estate portfolio, excluding development projects, undeveloped land and building rights can be calculated to 6.9%. The valuation was carried out in a uniform manner using internal valuation based on a 10-year cash flow model with individual assessments for each property in order to reflect both future earnings capacity and required market yield. In order to provide further assurance and validation of the valuation, 154 properties representing 57% of the value of the portfolio have been valued externally. 62 C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T Property value Internal valuation Assumptions in Castellum’s internal valuations Castellum records the investment properties at fair value and Office/retail Warehouse/industrial has made an internal valuation of all properties as of December Cash flow year 1 31, 2014.

This also applies to the handling and accounting of taxes, an issue of such importance to the real estate industry. The Group’s main approach is that correct tax will be paid in compliance with prevailing regulations. Swedish corporate tax rate is 22% and is based on the company’s taxable income. Taxable income is based on income before tax adjusted for items according to the current tax legislation: tax depreciations, tax deductible reconstructions, tax effects resulting from sales of properties, changes in value and finally, utilization of tax loss carryforwards. 66 C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T Ta x Income tax such as interest rate derivatives may be reported at fair value Castellum’s reported income from property management for in legal entities.

Some financial instruments C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T 67 Risks and risk management As a listed real estate company, Castellum’s task is to generate long-term shareholder value by focusing on cash-flow growth, at a low financial risk. The overall objective is to increase income from property management by 10% annually. Owning and managing properties means that operations are exposed to a variety of risks, both internal and external – or to uncertainties that may affect the Group’s ability to achieve the objective. Castellum therefore works with a regular and structured process to identify and actively monitor the full range of financial and non-financial risks that the Group encounters or has to take on. The Group’s risk management involves a structured process of decision making with the aim of establishing a balance between the desire to limit uncertainty or risk and the task of generating growth and shareholder value. 68 C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T Risk and risk management Risks, risk management and classification of risk Castellum defines risk as an uncertainty factor that may affect the ability to achieve company goals. Risk management involves a structured decision-making process with the aim of balancing the desire to limit uncertainty with achieving the objective. In order to assess the effect of identified risks an internal risk rating is carried out where each risk is assessed, both from the perspective of impact and probability. This process determines whether the risk should be monitored, corrected or handled through the standard review and management. To facilitate risk management, Castellum has chosen to classify risks into the following categories: • External environment – risks due to the influence of external factors and events • The real estate portfolio – risks associated with the ownership of Castellum’s real estate portfolio. • Employees – risks associated with recruiting, training and retaining the right employees • Management – risks associated with everyday management of Castellum’s real estate holdings • Financing – Castellum’s financing risks External environment External environment risks refer to risks due to the influence of external factors, mainly outside Castellum’s control and to which Castellum has to relate. These risks can be divided into macroeconomic risks, crises and changes in legislation. Macroeconomic risks Risk Exposure Risk management Macroeconomic risks are risks associated with a A weak economy affects the demand for premises • Strong balance sheet and low loan to value ratio general reduction in demand in the economy, low negatively, leading to increased vacancies, falling • Well-composed contract portfolio with a wide spread inflation, deflation or situations which entail general market rents and loss of indexation for existing leases. regarding notice of termination, type of business, difficulties in obtaining financing – or funding at higher In addition, the risk of payment problems, or even type of facility, contract size and geographical location credit margins. bankruptcies, among tenants increases, resulting in • Deflation protection or a minimum upward immediate negative effects on cash flow.

These value changes occur primarily due to changes in market interest rates. Castellum also uses currency derivatieves to provide financing in foreign currency, which are included in the derivative portfolio market value. During 2015, current interest-bearing liabilities amounting to SEKm 3,384 (1,952) are due for payment. Since they are covered by unutilized long-term credit agreements, To calculate the market value of derivatives, market rates for each term and, where they are treated as long-term interest-bearing liabilities. appropriate, exchange rates, as quoted on the market at the closing date are used. Interest rate swaps are valued by discounting future cash flows to present value while instruments containing options are valued at current repurchase price. As of December Note 15 Deferred Tax Liability/Asset 31, 2014, the market value of the interest rate derivatives portfolio amounted to SEKm –1,357 (–683) where fair value is established according to level 2, IFRS 13.

Castellum´s tax loss carry forwards as of December 31, 2014 are estimated to SEKm 1,193 (921). The change is presented in note 9. In order to limit counterparty risk, Castellum’s derivative transactions are covered by general agreement with netting clauses (ISDA).

Note 25 Subsequent Events The Financial Reports are a part of the Annual Report and were signed by the Board of Directors on February 2, 2015. The Board of Directors of Castellum AB intends to propose the annual general meeting a dividend of SEK 4.60 per share, which is an increase of 8% compared to previous year. The Income Statement and the Balance Sheet for the Parent Company and the Group shall be adopted at Castellum AB’s Annual General Meeting, which will take place on March 19, 2015. In January Castellum AB (publ) has acquired, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Fastighets AB Brostaden and Fastighets AB Briggen, properties in Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Helsingborg for totally SEKm 762. Via the acquisitions in Copenhagen Briggen more than doubles its holding in Denmark. C A S T E L L U M 2 014 10 9 Proposed Distribution of Profits The following funds are at the Annual General Meetings disposal: Retained profits SEK 4,236,074,638 Net income for the year SEK 234,653,941 SEK 4,470,728,579 The Board of Directors propose that the retained profits be appropriated as follows: Dividend to shareholders, SEK 4.60 per share SEK 754,400,000 Carried forward to the new accounts SEK 3,716,328,579 SEK 4,470,728,579 The company has 172,006,708 registered shares, of which 8,006,708 are currently the company’s own repurchased shares and are not entitled to dividends. The total dividend payment proposed above of SEK 754,400,000 can be changed if the number of the companys own repurchased shares changes before the record date for the dividend. 110 C A S T E L L U M 2 014 D I R E C TO R S’ R E P O R T Statement regarding Proposed Distribution of Profit Reasons The group’s equity has been calculated in accordance with IFRS standards, approved by the EU, and the interpretations of these standards (IFRIC), as well as in accordance with Swedish law by application of the recommendation RFR 1 (Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups) by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. The equity of the parent company has been calculated in accordance with Swedish law and by application of the recommendation RFR 2 (Accounting for Legal Entities) of the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. The proposed distribution constitutes 52% of the group’s income from property management, which is in line with the expressed objective to distribute at least 50% of the group’s income from property management, having considered investment plans, consolidation needs, liquidity and overall position. The group’s net income after value and tax changes amounted to SEKm 1,211. The distribution policy is based on the group’s income from property management, and as a result non-affecting cash flow increases and/or decreases in value on the group’s properties and on interest and currency derivatives, do not normally affect the distribution. Such non-affecting cash flow profit or loss, have neither been taken into account in previous year’s resolutions regarding distribution of profit. The board of directors concludes that the company’s restricted equity is fully covered after the proposed distribution. The board of directors also concludes that the proposed distribution to the shareholders is justified considering the parameters in section 17 subsection 3, second and third paragraphs of the Swedish Companies Act (the nature, scope and risks of the business as well as consolidation needs, liquidity and overall position). Accordingly, the board of directors would like to emphasise the following. The nature, scope and risks of the business The board of directors estimates that the equity of the company as well as of the group will, after the proposed distribution, be sufficient in relation to the nature, scope and risks of the business. The board of directors has in this context considered, inter alia, the historical development of the company and the group, budgeted development, investment plans and the economic situation. Consolidation needs, liquidity and overall position Consolidation needs The board of directors has made a general estimation of the financial position of the company and the group, and the possibilities to fulfil their obligations. The proposed dividend constitutes 16% of the company’s equity and 6% of the group’s equity. The group’s loan to value ratio and interest coverage ratio 2014 amounted to 49% and 318% respectively. The expressed objective for the group’s capital structure, implying a loan to value ratio which not permanently exceeds 55% and an interest coverage ratio of at least 200%, will be maintained after the proposed dividend. The capital structure of the company and the group is sound considering the prevailing conditions of the real property business. In light of the above, the board of directors concludes that the company and the group have all the necessary requirements to manage future business risks and also to carry potential losses. Planned investments have been considered when deciding on the proposed dividend. Liquidity The proposed dividend will not affect the company’s or the group’s ability to meet their payment obligations in a timely manner. The company and the group have good access to liquidity reserves through short-term as well as longterm credits. The credits may be utilised at short notice, implying that the company and the group are prepared to handle liquidity fluctuations as well as possible unexpected events. Overall position The board of directors has considered all other known conditions which might affect the financial position of the company and the group and which have not been considered within the scope of the above considerations. In this respect, no circumstances have been found that indicate that the proposed dividend would not be justified. Evaluation to actual value Derivatives instruments and other financial instruments have been valued to the actual value in accordance with section 4 subsection 14 a of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The valuation has presented an undervalue of SEKm 1,058 after tax, which has affected the equity by the mentioned amount.
