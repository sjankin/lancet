Camfil was the first air filter product ranges to meet new environmental standards and manufacturer to launch a sustainability programme and this requirements. section of our annual report presents some key activities This is hardly the case at Camfil, where sustainability has and figures from our sustainability work in 2014. been the core concept since we started operations more than 50 years ago. From the very beginning, our business model has been to provide clean air with the most effective and most energy-efficient filtration solutions on the market. People, processes and the environment benefit from our technology. Our air filtration solutions contribute daily to healthier indoor air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save energy. Our on-going global sustainability programme is therefore a natural extension of our fundamental belief in being the most eco-friendly air filter manufacturer on the market. For years we have been constantly greening our technology and products for customers and end-users, helping them to reduce their energy consumption and shrink their environmental footprint. Every year, we make our production units leaner and greener to reduce their environmental impact. With sustainability embedded in our product portfolio for more than half a century, we can team up with our customers to help safeguard the planet for coming generations. Camfil’s CEO, Magnus Yngen: “Camfil is the most eco-friendly air filtration manufacturer on the market and sustainability has been embedded in our business model since day one. A strong belief in sustainability empowers us to innovate, improve and advance on the product, process and service front, improve business performance and reduce the eco-footprint of our operations.

These improvements resulted in Camfil saving over GBP 200,000 on energy bills through minimal cost, self-funding opportunities.” u Read more at: http://www.keepthecityout.co.uk The 1215 London copy of the Magna Carta, displayed here in the Magna Carta Unification Display at the British Library. The award was given at the Annual IAMFA Conference in Scotland to Dr. Chris Ecob, Camfil’s Global Business Manager for Molecular Filtration. The conference is IAMFA’s platform for exchanging ideas about the l­atest technologies for cultural facilities. From the British Library to the Uffizi Over the years, Camfil has designed and supplied activated carbon filtration systems to preserve the art treasures and artefacts of many prestigious museums and galleries, including the Uffizi in Florence, the British Library in London, the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg and the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, California. C AM FI L 2 0 1 4 / 2 3 Sustainability Report Meeting Eurovent’s tougher demands Eurovent is the professional trade organization for the European heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry, which includes air filtration products. Eurovent recommends and sets performance standards and introduced a new and tougher energy efficiency classification system for air filters in 2015. The new Eurovent classification places much higher demands on air filters and the amount of energy they use. The system is similar to the energy ratings for household appliances. Energy efficiency is classified from A+ (most efficient) to E (least efficient). The filtration efficiency of filters for ventilation systems is also ranked in various classes, such as F7, F8 and F9. To illustrate the tougher energy efficiency demands, Eurovent’s previous energy efficiency requirement for an F7 filter in the A class was 1200 kWh per year. In the new and higher A+ category, the requirement for F7 filtration is stricter and lower at 800 kWh per year. Selecting a quality filter with A+ efficiency for F7 filtration will potential energy savings would be substantial for building owners, therefore have an impact and save as much as 400 kWh annually per enabling them to comply with new energy efficiency standards and filter.
