On behalf of Fuji Electric, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to our stakeholders for their continued support and commitment to our company. At Fuji Electric, it is our pledge as responsible corporate citizens in a global society to strengthen our trust with stakeholders. Every day, we strive to carry out this mission for the benefit of our company, our stakeholders, and the world around us— this is our core philosophy. Through our innovation in energy technology, we contribute to the creation of responsible and sustainable societies. Solving energy-related problems can be seen as one of the most important global issues facing us today. As the demand for energy grows, it becomes necessary to find ways to achieve both economic growth and reduced environmental impact. Fuji Electric contributes to that effort through the electric and thermal energy technologies it has continued to refine over its 90-year history and the manufacturing capabilities that underpin those technologies. At the same time, we also consider these circumstances to be a business opportunity, and are moving forward toward further growth through aggressive management. Positioning fiscal 2014 as a year for expanding our focus on aggressive management, we focused on strengthening profitability and establishing a growth foundation On a consolidated basis, net sales in fiscal 2014 increased ¥50.8 billion year on year to ¥810.7 billion, while operating income grew ¥6.2 billion year on year to ¥39.3 billion. Moreover, net income improved ¥8.4 billion year on year to ¥28.0 billion, a record high, partly because of recording a gain on a change in equity in association with the listing of an affiliate.

Fuji Electric Report 2015 24 Contributing to Solutions to Customers’ Problems Special Feature through New Technologies and Services Through innovation in electric and thermal energy technologies, Fuji Electric aims to provide society with technologies and products that contribute to solutions for customers’ problems. These special features introduce some of the initiatives intended to bring us closer to that goal. Saving Energy through Reuse of Factory Exhaust Heat With changes in the energy situation in recent years, Reusable Steam Volume by Industry (Ton/hour) factories and other production sites have also turned to smart energy systems that enable them to use energy 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 intelligently. One method that is garnering attention is Pulp/Paper/Paper products reusing factory exhaust heat. Expectations for reuse are Food high, particularly in industries that make wide-ranging use Chemical (organic) of heat applications, including the pulp, paper and paper Petroleum and coal products products, food, and (organic) chemical industries. Transportation machinery (automotive) Applying technology honed through the manufacture of Chemical (inorganic) vending machines, Fuji Electric developed one of the Beverage/cigarette/feed industry’s first products to make use of a heat pump for Textile heat exchange. By targeting industries with significant Steel volumes of reusable steam, we will promote efficient use of heat energy within factories to contribute to our clients General machinery/equipment in the industrial sector. (Fuji Electric estimates based on data from Fuji-Keizai Co., Ltd.) Reusing Heat Energy through Steam-Generation Heat Pumps During the production process, factories use and emit a great deal of heat, particularly in cleaning and sterilization equipment. Steam-generation heat pumps can collect and re-heat the exhaust heat from such equipment, making it available for reuse. Because this method reduces the high-temperature reheating load on boiler equipment, it can lower fuel costs and enable the factory to save energy. Boiler room Building within a factory Pipes Steam (heat) flow Cleaning Sterilization equipment equipment Raise Collect temperature, exhaust heat return Reheating through the heat pump reduces the load on boiler equipment for Steam-generation heat pump high-temperature reheating. Hot Cold compartment compartment Explanation What is a “heat pump?” Because the equipment pumps heat from a “cold side” to a “hot side,” similar to a system used for pumping water, it is known as a “heat pump.” In vending machines, the heat absorbed in the cold Heat dissipation Heat absorption compartment where beverages are chilled is condensed in a compressor, and the heat generated in Heat Heat exchanger exchanger this process is then used to heat beverages in a hot compartment. This greatly reduces the amount of energy used for heating, and contributes to energy saving. Compressor Vending machine heating and cooling system 25 Fuji Electric Report 2015 Case Example Iiyama Factory, Fuji Electric Power Semiconductor Co., Ltd. Saving Energy by Utilizing Surplus Heat from Diesel Engines Energy Use Reduced by More Than Half Fuji Electric Power Semiconductor Co., Ltd.’s Iiyama Factory is a manufacturing base for power semiconductors used in automobiles. To ensure a stable supply of electric power to sustain the factory’s operation 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, power is generated on site using a diesel engine generator. The exhaust heat generated by this engine is reused in the factory’s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, but about 50% of the overall exhaust heat remained unused. We evaluated possible ways to use that heat more effectively to achieve greater energy savings. Our attention was drawn to the steam supplied to the factory’s clean rooms. Power semiconductors are precision components, and any static electricity generated and Power semiconductor post-process released in the manufacturing process can have a negative impact on quality. To prevent this, particularly in the winter The steam-generation heat pump itself is about the size of season when the air is dry, steam is generated and supplied a typical vending machine. It is simple to operate and can be to the clean rooms using a dedicated boiler. In March 2015, installed in just a few hours without requiring any special the factory began field testing a steam-generation heat construction. After installation, the volume of energy used in pump developed at Fuji Electric’s Mie Factory, aiming to April was down about 55% compared to before, while CO2 make further energy savings by using the exhaust heat from emissions dropped by about 40%. Use of the boiler was also their diesel engine to generate a supply of steam for the reduced. With energy savings exceeding original estimates, clean rooms. the factory intends to continue its testing to verify product quality and accelerate efforts to commercialize the product.
