Page 10 Strategy and Profile 1.0 Strategy and Analysis 1.1 Statement From Jim Prokopanko, CEO Mosaic Company Question 1: What role does fertilizer play in achieving global food security? Over half of the world’s crop yields are attributable to fertilizer, so fertilizer must be central to any discussion of global food security. The fact is, each day the world has 150,000 new mouths to feed. The expanding middle class, with its increasing demand for resource-intensive proteins such as meat, plus climate change and water scarcity—all of these factors add to the pressure on global agriculture. Clearly, feeding a growing, changing world is one of the defining challenges of our lifetime. Mosaic’s mission is to help the world grow the food it needs. We believe the answer to this monumental challenge lies in “sustainable intensification”—producing more food, sustainably, and in a way that respects and preserves our natural world. We simply cannot achieve this without the many benefits of mineral fertilizers. Fertilizer nourishes plants, which in turn nourish people. When appropriately applied, Mosaic’s products—phosphate and potash crop nutrients—help farmers get more food and grain out of each acre they farm. Without fertilizer, much more land would be required to meet global demand—which contributes to deforestation and biodiversity loss. To help promote efficient fertilizer use, Mosaic supports the 4Rs Nutrient Stewardship Framework— using the Right Source of fertilizer at the Right Rate, at the Right Time and in the Right Place. This program encourages farmers around the world to be good stewards of the environment while maximizing their yields. Question 2: How does the challenging business environment affect your sustainability efforts? Business conditions—good or difficult—do not and will not change Mosaic’s commitment to sustainability. Success comes when we make smart choices about our stewardship of the environment, how we engage our people and our communities, and how we manage resources. Our financial strength allows us to continue investing in our company’s sustainability progress, regardless of market conditions. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 11 We were tested in 2013 by lower market prices for potash and phosphates due to increasing global supply and inconsistent demand in certain parts of the world, most notably India and China. I’m proud that at Mosaic, we navigated through these challenges and produced solidly profitable business results, all the while keeping the sustainability of our business in mind. We chose to use the tough environment as an opportunity to grow and refine our business portfolio. We are increasing our investment in Brazil’s agricultural promise by agreeing to purchase Archer Daniels Midland Company’s fertilizer distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay, a move that complements our expansion plans already underway. We also acquired CF Industries’ phosphate operations in March 2014, and entered into a phosphates joint venture with Ma’aden and SABIC in Saudi Arabia. We also reached difficult decisions to divest underperforming assets in Chile, Argentina and Michigan. We expect these decisions to increase not only our operational efficiencies, but also our agronomic and economic impact in key agricultural markets. Question 3: What are Mosaic’s priorities when it comes to sustainability? As the world’s largest producer of phosphate and potash, our top priority is helping farmers in key agricultural areas produce more corn, wheat, soybeans, potatoes and other crops. We also have a responsibility to promote good nutrient stewardship throughout the supply chain—from mine to market. We wanted to better prioritize and understand all the myriad issues material to our stakeholders, so in 2013 we conducted a materiality study with a third-party auditor. The valuable and impartial insights we received are helping us identify the most important actions we must take to further reduce our environmental footprint, in ways that are most meaningful to our stakeholders. We expect to finalize our materiality analysis in 2015. Maintaining a healthy, safe work environment has been, and will always be, a primary focus for Mosaic. We were extremely troubled by the tragic accident in February 2014, which resulted in the fatality of a contract employee working on one of our Florida phosphates properties. We have conducted a thorough investigation and have shared what we learned, to avoid a future fatality. Mosaic’s safety culture has evolved significantly, and our overall safety performance in 2013 was statistically our best ever—but we must continue in our relentless pursuit of an injury-free workplace. This is more important than ever as we welcome 1,200 new employees through our completed and pending acquisitions. Question 4: What is Mosaic doing to reduce its environmental footprint? We have made good, consistent progress in the five years since we first published a sustainability report. In our operations, we’re particularly proud of our efforts in the areas of water conservation, land reclamation, the use of alternative energy sources and reducing our carbon footprint. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 12 Our Florida phosphate manufacturing facilities operate on more than 90 percent recycled water, and we continue to find new ways of reducing our water footprint. We’re even working with other local businesses on responsible water use: Mosaic partnered with Duke Energy to eliminate up to 4.6 million gallons per day of groundwater withdrawal in Polk County, Florida. To better understand our environmental performance, we have tracked our greenhouse gas emissions since Mosaic’s inception in 2004—and we work to reduce emissions intensities year over year. Since 2008, we have improved our total energy consumed per tonne of finished product by over 10 percent. A portion of that savings is due to clean electrical cogeneration from the recovery of waste heat in our operations. In 2013, we produced enough electricity—approximately 6.24 million gigajoules—through cogeneration to satisfy 44 percent of our companywide electrical demand. We used more than 1 million gigajoules of this emission-free cogenerated electricity in our mines. Mosaic’s best-in-class Florida reclamation activities begin before we mine. First, we work with a dozen local, regional, state and federal regulatory agencies to ensure all mined areas can be successfully reclaimed—and to identify areas of high environmental sensitivity that should be protected. Our teams of professional biologists, hydrologists and other specialists take great pride in the exceptional quality of our reclamation work, and we focus on creating successful, sustainable habitats for diverse wildlife. We are also finding new ways to reduce our indirect energy consumption. In 2013, we completed the conversion of our Central Florida truck fleet to clean-burning compressed natural gas. We are pleased that the new fleet will allow us to operate more safely, lower our customers’ costs and reduce emissions. Thanks to the work of our teams in operations, environmental, health and safety, supply chain and engineering, Mosaic has made great strides in reducing energy use and emissions profiles, earning the company recognition. Since 2009, Mosaic has reported the greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory of more than 50 facilities in seven countries to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). In 2013, we were included in the CDP S&P 500 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index and the CDP S&P 500 Climate Performance Leadership Index. We are proud Mosaic is the first crop nutrition company to be recognized for inclusion in these indices. Additionally, Mosaic was one of 35 global companies included in the Trucost Natural Capital Leaders Index. We were noted for our record of economic success without environmental degradation. Question 5: What are Mosaic’s sustainability challenges? The concept of sustainability has evolved tremendously through the years, and we must continue to learn so that we can keep pace with change. We are evolving in our approach to sustainability. Part of that process is assessing the myriad challenges, and determining where we can make the greatest impact for our stakeholders. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 13 Some of our biggest challenges belong to the crop nutrition industry as a whole, and require consensus and collaboration. One of those issues is nutrient stewardship. We make products that are essential to humankind, and, like many other products, responsible use is critical. As an industry, we need to do more to ensure that our retail and distribution partners, as well as farmers, have the tools they need to grow crop yields sustainably. Another issue of critical importance in our industry is product safety and security. We have joined with The Fertilizer Institute and the Agricultural Retailers Association in support of the new ResponsibleAg initiative, which will facilitate fertilizer retailers’ compliance with federal safety and security regulations and provide access to comprehensive inspections. The safety and wellbeing of our people and our communities is paramount for us at Mosaic, and we are pleased that this program will help our customers more easily understand and conform to a common standard. In the end, sustainable intensification remains our most compelling challenge—and it gives our business purpose. Every day, our people are driving new innovations, finding ways to work safer and smarter, and developing better, more efficient processes that move the company forward. We believe that our sustainability efforts lead to greater shareholder value—and help us achieve our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs. 1.2 Description of Key Impacts, Risks and Opportunities Key Impacts and Risks Factors affecting our market, including impacts and risks, are summarized within Mosaic’s 10-K Report (pages 25-47).

Calendar reporting better aligns with our business cycle and with our competitors. This report is aligned with our 10-K Report for the transition period from June 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 and our 2013 Annual Review and Business Outlook and should be read in conjunction with the information in those reports. In this year’s GRI report, much of the information is provided on the basis of the calendar year. We departed from the fiscal year reporting, where possible, to allow for direct comparison of our © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 18 sustainability data with our peers' sustainability data. As such, a significant portion of the data is for calendar year 2013. For fiscal year reporting, references in this report to a particular fiscal year are to the 12 months ended May 31 of that year. For example, “fiscal 2013” or “FY 2013” refers to the 12 months ending on May 31, 2013. In some cases we have not included historical information for every company time period. Generally, those omissions were due to concerns about data availability or consistency or because we determined that collecting such information would not add to the value of this report. Reporting generally covers actions and decisions for calendar year 2013. However, information and data from Mosaic’s inception on October 22, 2004, through the company’s year ended December 31, 2013, is also included where appropriate. This report includes entities over which Mosaic exercises majority control, including all their operations and departments that have the potential to generate significant impacts. 3.2 Date of Most Previous Report 2013. 3.3 Reporting Cycle Annual. 3.4 Report Contact Mr. Neil Beckingham, Sustainability Manager, can be contacted by e-mail at neil.beckingham@mosaicco.com. 3.5 Process for Defining Report Content, Including Materiality and Stakeholders In 2013, Mosaic worked with a third-party auditor to analyze how Mosaic defines significant economic, environmental and social impacts. AccountAbility’s AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard guided the review process that reflects our company's commitment to more fully inform all stakeholders on matters that influence our business and society. How we engage stakeholders—whether supportive or critical—in our communities, our industry and globally, helps us anticipate and manage complex issues and develop targets by which we measure and report our progress. Our goals and reporting will evolve as we refine our understanding and identify further material issues. Based on the GRI definition of materiality, Mosaic has developed a set of content indicators that focuses on the role key stakeholders play in Mosaic, including our customers, employees, shareholders and communities. To meet our vision of accountability and transparency around the key indicators that Mosaic and our stakeholders consider most relevant, we focus reporting in the areas of food, environment, people, community and company, as detailed below. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 19 Food Helping the world grow the food it needs is what gives our business purpose. Mosaic’s continual focus on new product development ensures we can meet the unique needs of growers in every part of the world. Our products, agronomic expertise and financial support for the Mosaic Villages Project have helped smallholder farmers in Guatemala, India and eight countries in Africa move from subsistence farming to producing a surplus. Mosaic promotes the efficient use of crop nutrients so farmers can maximize crop yields and mitigate potentially negative environmental impacts stemming from improper use. Environment Mosaic’s crop nutrients play a crucial role in nourishing the crops that are needed to feed our growing global population, and our respect for the earth is fundamental. We demonstrate our commitment to environmental sustainability through our land reclamation and water conservation efforts, our nutrient stewardship and our cogeneration projects. Mosaic works to optimize our production processes and reduce our environmental footprint. We are also committed to educating growers on the sustainable use of our products. People Mosaic aims to be the employer of choice for an engaged, inclusive workforce, and we are committed to preserving a safe, healthy and respectful work environment. We are proud of our stringent safety programs for employees and contractors alike. Additionally, all Mosaic employees, service providers and contractors are held to the same high standards outlined in Mosaic’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Community Our community investment focus is simple and direct – we seek out projects in the areas of food and water, as well as projects that benefit our local communities. As a global leader in the crop nutrient industry, Mosaic recognizes the importance of partnering with industry associations, nonprofit organizations and stakeholders, both globally and in local communities where we operate. We are proud of the long-term economic impact we make in our communities, as well as the improved profitability and quality of life we help achieve for farmers and their families. Company Mosaic’s sustainability goals are closely aligned with our operational and financial goals. We respond annually to the Carbon Disclosure Project and utilize the Global Reporting Initiative’s G3.1 framework with the Mining and Metals Sector Supplement to report on our environmental and sustainability performance. Mosaic is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, affirming our deep commitment to operate according to universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. © Copyright 2014.

Page 22 4.0 Governance, Commitments and Engagement 4.1 Governance Structure of the Organization, Including Committees Mosaic’s corporate governance structure is characterized by the Board of Directors, Board Committees and Senior Leadership Team (SLT). Our Board Committees include an Audit Committee; Compensation Committee; Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee; and Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainable Development Committee. Additional information regarding directors, executive officers and corporate governance is detailed in our Proxy Statement (page 12). We are committed to making informed choices that improve our corporate governance, financial strength, operational efficiency, environmental stewardship, community engagement and resource management. Through these efforts, we intend to sustain our business and experience lasting success. In 2010, Mosaic formalized its commitment to sustainability by establishing a Sustainability Steering Committee to ensure companywide transparency and accountability. This group works to define priorities, needs and performance gaps across the company. The Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainable Development (EHSS) Committee of Mosaic’s Board of Directors provides oversight of the company’s overall environmental and sustainability strategy. Composed of four members, three of whom are independent, the EHSS Committee provides oversight of our environmental, health, safety and sustainable development strategic vision and performance, including the safety and health of employees and contractors; environmental performance; the systems and processes designed to manage EHSS risks, commitments, public responsibilities and compliance; relationships with and impact on communities with respect to EHSS matters; public policy and advocacy strategies related to EHSS issues; and achieving societal support of major projects. The EHSS Committee's recommendations are comprehensively reviewed by Mosaic’s Board of Directors and SLT. 4.2 Chair Mr. Robert L. Lumpkins is Chairman of the Board of Directors. He is an independent director and not an executive officer of the company. 4.3 Number of Members of the Highest Governance Body Mosaic’s Board of Directors has 12 members. All of our directors, except our CEO and one director, who is an executive officer of Cargill, are independent. Please refer to our Proxy Statement (page 21) for more information. The listing standards of the NYSE require that Mosaic’s Board be comprised of at least a majority of independent directors and that the Board maintain Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees comprised entirely of independent directors. The NYSE Corporate Governance Rules also require the Board to make a formal determination each year as to which of its © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 23 directors are independent. In addition to meeting the minimum standards of independence adopted by the NYSE, no director qualifies as “independent” under the NYSE Corporate Governance Rules unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the corporation. 4.4 Mechanisms for Shareholders and Employees to Provide Recommendations or Direction to the Highest Governance Body The Governance Committee believes that open communication is best achieved by offering stakeholders, including security holders, employees and other interested parties, several methods of communication with the Board, including phone, e-mail or written communication in care of the General Counsel at the address of the Company’s executive offices. For more information, please see Mosaic’s Policy Regarding Communications with the Board of Directors. 4.5 Linkage Between Compensation of Members of Governance Bodies and the Organization’s Performance Performance measures for incentive compensation for members of Mosaic’s governance executives (Management Incentive Plan) are based not only on financial results but also on operational excellence measures. Details of our corporate governance are provided in Mosaic’s Proxy Statement (pages 21-31). 4.6 Processes for the Governance Body to Avoid Conflicts of Interest Mosaic employees and directors must abide by the applicable provisions in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which provides that personal conflicts of interest (i.e., when an individual’s private interests interfere in any way with the interests of the company) are prohibited as a matter of Company policy, except under the guidelines approved by the Board. Each of the Company’s directors and executive officers completes a questionnaire on an annual basis designed to elicit information about any potential related person transactions. In addition, it is the responsibility of each director and executive officer to bring any related-person transaction in which he or she is involved to the General Counsel for review and approval in accordance with this policy. Any potential related-person transaction that is identified will be analyzed by the General Counsel, in consultation with management and with outside counsel, as appropriate, to determine whether the transaction or relationship constitutes a related-person transaction requiring compliance with this Policy. Related-person transactions that are brought to the attention of the General Counsel shall be submitted for consideration by the Governance Committee. Any related-person transaction that is not approved or ratified, as the case may be, shall be voided, terminated or amended, or such other actions shall be taken, in each case as determined by the Governance Committee, so as to avoid or otherwise address any resulting conflict of interest. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 24 4.7 Process for Determining the Qualifications and Expertise of Members of the Governance Bodies The responsibilities of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee are detailed in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. Per the Committee charter, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors identifies individuals believed to be qualified to become Board members pursuant to its “Policy Regarding Identification and Evaluation of Potential Director Nominees.” In evaluating candidates, the Committee shall take into account the applicable requirements for directors under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the listing standards of the NYSE. The Committee may take into consideration such other factors and criteria as it deems appropriate in evaluating a candidate. 4.8 Mission Statements, Codes of Conduct and Principles No matter where Mosaic operates in the world, our employees adhere to the same companywide values. This common sense of purpose and responsibility ensures that we approach our work with a shared goal. Mission Our mission is to help the world grow the food it needs. As the world’s largest supplier of phosphate and potash, we consider this mission to be a noble one that carries vast responsibility. Values Our values of integrity, excellence, sustainability and connectivity define how we conduct our business, how we interact with each other and how we treat our communities and our planet. Our Role in Feeding the World We live in an increasingly populous and prosperous world, one in which the accelerating demand for food is a powerful force. Today the world’s population is growing at a rate of about 1.1% per year. That might not sound like much, but it means we need to set the dinner tables for an additional 73 million people each year. This population explosion poses a serious challenge to the food producers of the world. Another factor driving the demand for food is increasing prosperity, particularly in the developing world. As millions of people continue to increase their earning power, a protein-rich diet is generally one of their first lifestyle improvements. The demand for more protein has a significant impact on grain and oilseed demand, as protein-based diets are more dependent on these products than carbohydratebased diets. Considering the ever-expanding world population, the increased demand for protein and the fact that there is limited arable land on our planet, the most efficient way to meet the increasing demand for © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 25 food is to increase crop yields. That’s where Mosaic comes in. Our crop nutrients can double, triple or even quadruple a farmer’s yield per acre. Agronomists estimate that commercial crop nutrients directly account for 40 to 60% of crop yields. The optimum use of crop nutrients is essential to growing the food the world needs. Our crop nutrition products are complemented by our customized services. From field mapping and soil testing, to agronomic consulting and fertilizer blending innovations, our services provide real-world benefits to our customers. 4.9 Procedures for Overseeing the Organization’s Identification and Management of ESG Performance Pursuant to their respective charters, committees of our Board assist in the Board’s oversight of risk. The Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainable Development (EHSS) Committee oversees management’s plans, programs and processes to evaluate and manage EHSS risks to our business, operations and products; the quality of management’s processes for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing the principal EHSS risks in our business; and management’s objectives and plans (including means for measuring performance) for implementing our EHSS risk management programs. Please refer to Mosaic’s Proxy Statement for more information. Please refer to Mosaic’s 10-K Report (page 47). 4.10 Process for Evaluating the Highest Governance Body’s Performance Mosaic’s Board, Mosaic’s Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainable Development Committee (per Mosaic's Proxy Statement, page 22), Compensation Committee, and Corporate Governance Guidelines 4.11 Explanation of Whether and How the Precautionary Approach or Principle Is Addressed by the Organization Mosaic addresses the precautionary principle through the organization’s management of risk. It is the role of management to operate the business, including managing the risks arising from our business, and the role of our Board to oversee management’s actions. Management reports on enterprise risks to the full Board on a regular basis. Please see our Proxy Statement for more information. In fiscal 2013, Mosaic submitted our first United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Communication on Progress, affirming our commitment to operate according to the UNGC’s 10 universal principles, including Principle Seven, which states, “Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.” © Copyright 2014.

Community Investments In 2013, Mosaic targeted to invest 1% of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) over a three-year rolling average into our communities. The Mosaic Company, The Mosaic Company Foundation and The Mosaic Institute in Brazil make investments in our global communities through philanthropic funding, employee engagement and in-kind donations. Combined contributions in 2013 reached $27.16 million. Mosaic focuses its community investments in three areas: © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 33 1. Food: hunger relief, agricultural development, and agricultural research and education 2. Water: Watershed restoration, habitat conservation and nutrient stewardship 3. Local: Philanthropic or civic partnerships that enrich the long-term strength of communities in which Mosaic has offices and operations The graph above reflects investments made in communities where targeted beneficiaries are external to the company. This may include contributions to research institutes unrelated to Mosaic’s research and development activities, funds to support community infrastructure and other philanthropic efforts. EC2 Financial Implications and Other Risks and Opportunities for the Organization’s Activities Due to Climate Change Mosaic’s 2012 published “Commitment on Climate Change” states that global climate change creates uncertainty for our business and poses challenges for the health and well-being of the world’s populations – ecologically, socially and economically. The potential financial implications with regard to the physical changes associated with climate change, as well as potential regulatory response changes, are discussed in Mosaic’s CDP public response and in Mosaic’s 10-K Report. We evaluate whether, and to what extent, environmental issues and associated regulations could adversely impact our costs and operating activities, as well as the supply, demand, cost and location of grain production. This evaluation is part of a broader strategic business plan designed to help Mosaic meet or exceed production and profitability requirements. Other aspects of this plan include strategies for lowering purchased energy consumption through more efficient processes and maximizing the use of energy generated through the fertilizer manufacturing process. Risks and Opportunities Driven by Physical Changes Changes in temperature, drought, floods, storms and plant disease could affect agricultural production and negatively impact the demand for crop nutrient products. The effects of these impacts could be material to Mosaic. Mosaic’s balanced approach to crop nutrition is a strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of drought, floods, storms and plant disease. We have established relationships with key universities and research organizations around the globe to develop and test innovative products like the MicroEssentials® product line, which is designed to help farmers make the most of every inch of farmland. The same physical changes could result in an increase in demand for Mosaic’s higher yield crop nutrition products, which could have a positive effect on our operating results and financial condition. Risks and Opportunities Driven by Regulatory Changes While there is uncertainty with regard to what final material regulatory provisions and targets applicable to Mosaic will be adopted in reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) in the United States and Canada, if any, the commitment by federal, province-based (Canada) and state-based (United States) regulatory bodies © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 34 is in motion. Any agreement, regulation or program that limits or taxes direct and indirect GHG emissions from our facilities could increase operating costs directly and through suppliers. These initiatives could restrict our operating activities; require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs; reduce our efficiency or limit our output; require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our energy, raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability; or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. Any of these costs could be material to Mosaic. In order to manage the potential risks from changing regulations, Mosaic is taking a proactive approach, with particular emphasis on improving energy efficiency and waste management. These initiatives will assist Mosaic in emission reduction. Any change in regulation that incentivizes production and/or use of renewable energy could provide a variety of opportunities to Mosaic, many of them with financial benefits. Similarly, if climate changerelated restrictions were global in nature, Mosaic could gain a competitive advantage over our global competitors due to our current environmental performance and/or planned performance and initiatives related to environment and greenhouse gas emissions. See Mosaic’s 2013 Carbon Disclosure Project response for more information on Mosaic’s efforts to address the risks and opportunities associated with climate change.

Page 37 EC7 Procedures for Local Hiring and Proportion of Senior Management Hired From the Local Community at Significant Locations of Operations As a matter of practice, and in accordance with Mosaic’s global job posting policies, we will “hire from within wherever possible.” For midto lower-level positions, a search is conducted locally to find a qualified candidate. If no local candidates are identified, then the search broadens until a qualified candidate is found. Mosaic provides a generous relocation package to support the movement of talent to our locations. For senior management roles, if no internal candidates are identified, a search will be conducted externally to find the best candidate for the leadership role. The hire may or may not come from one of the communities where we have a local presence. These candidates are also supported with relocation assistance. Indirect Economic Impacts EC8 Development and Impact of Infrastructure Investment and Services Provided Through Commercial, In-Kind or Pro Bono Engagement At Mosaic, our mission is to help the world grow the food it needs. As the world’s largest combined producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash – two of the three macronutrients essential to plant life – this is both a business and social mission. We focus our community investments in three core areas that help us achieve this goal: Food, Water and Local Community Investments. Furthermore, our community investments are allocated to align with the size of our operations and industrial footprint in each of our locations. In fiscal 2013, combined contributions by The Mosaic Company, The Mosaic Company Foundation and The Mosaic Institute in Brazil through philanthropic funding, employee engagement and in-kind donations totaled approximately $27.16 million. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 38 Additionally, Mosaic partners with the United Way, an important community nonprofit at Mosaic’s North American operations. Each fall, teams of employee volunteers organize a series of events that focus our employees’ attention on their communities through agency tours, volunteer projects and fundraising. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 39 © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 40 Since 2012, Mosaic has used an online grant system to track and monitor proposals for funding and report outcomes. Potential nonprofit partners can access the online grant system and the formal application for funding, our focus areas, our giving guidelines, our application deadlines and our nondiscrimination policy through our Website. Establishing a standardized funding system, reporting outcomes and listing policies online provides greater transparency to our partners, shareholders, employees and communities. Mosaic works closely with best-in-class nonprofit partners to address the needs of individuals and communities on issues ranging from local hunger relief, global food security, watershed restoration, nutrient stewardship and local civic needs in operating communities. A few examples of these partnerships are listed below. Food The Florida Association of Food Banks: Headquartered in Southwest Florida, the Florida Association of Food Banks (FAFB) is comprised of 14 regional food banks serving all 67 counties in Florida. In 2013, The Mosaic Company Foundation supported FAFB’s Farmers Feeding Florida program, which collaborates with Florida agricultural producers, packers and distributors to deliver fresh produce to Central and Southwest Florida food banks. These area food banks serve approximately 640 community agencies’ food shelves and food programs. The Mosaic Villages Project: Initiated in 2008, the award-winning Mosaic Villages Project in India, Guatemala and eight African countries have helped more than 300,000 people move from food insecurity to food surplus. The Mosaic Villages Project is a physical manifestation of our mission to help the world grow the food it needs. Our investment includes cash grants, product, logistics, and the time and talents of many Mosaic employees, including agronomists who work alongside implementing partners in training farmers. In 2013, Mosaic invested more than $1 million in cash donations to The Mosaic Villages Project. In February 2013, Mosaic was awarded the President’s Excellence Award in philanthropy for The Mosaic Villages Project by CECP, formerly the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy. Water American Farmland Trust: Formed in 1980, American Farmland Trust (AFT) works to prevent the loss of farmland and promote environmentally sound farming practices. In 2013 Mosaic provided a grant to support AFT’s efforts on the Ohio River Basin Water Quality Trading Project, designed to improve water quality by helping farmers adopt conservation agriculture practices and participate in a first-of-its-kind interstate water quality trading market. In partnership with the Electric Power Research Institute, AFT identified and recruited farmers, educated stakeholders about water quality trading, and customized the application process for each state during the year. The Nature Conservancy: Mosaic continues to support The Nature Conservancy’s Great River Partnership whereby the Conservancy has worked with local partners and producers to address nutrient © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 41 and sediment runoff in agricultural landscapes located in five key watersheds. In 2013, The Mosaic Company Foundation provided funding that will help the Conservancy extend and expand work with farmers and partners to improve water quality in three watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River Basin: Minnesota’s Root River, Iowa’s Boone River and Illinois’ Mackinaw River. Local Habitat for Humanity: Mosaic has a strong partnership with Habitat for Humanity in Regina, Saskatoon, Moose Jaw and Yorkton, and in fiscal year 2013, Mosaic donated $1 million to the organization to build 68 new homes over a three-year period. In all, Mosaic has helped build more than 85 homes for at-risk families since 2008, directly impacting the low income housing shortage in the province. Mosaic employees continue to support builds, dedicating over 1,250 hours at builds, with over 120 employees lending a hand in the past year. Child is Life: Through The Mosaic Institute in Brazil, Child is Life received funding to expand its Living Well Project, which provides health and self-esteem education to hundreds of children living in favelas, or shanty towns. Through schools and communities, the program trains teachers to administer curriculum on four topics: health and nutrition, physiology and respect for the human body, health and the environment, and decisions for better living. The United Way In 2013, 73% of Mosaic employees pledged a combined $1.73 million to 50 local United Way organizations across North America. With the Mosaic dollar-for-dollar match, the total amount donated to United Way in 2013 was over $4 million. Additionally, Mosaic was awarded the United Way Worldwide’s Summit Award for Corporate Philanthropy and the United Way Suncoast Spirit of Tampa Bay award. Infrastructure Investments Integrated Land Management Program (ILMP): Over the past 13 years, Mosaic has embarked upon an ambitious restoration initiative that includes an extensive exotics/nuisance plant removal program and planting of native species on its Riverview property. Mosaic is continuing the ILMP created as part of the Riverview phosphogypsum stack expansion project. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) filling station: Mosaic’s transportation partner in Central Florida, Dillon Transport, is building a CNG filling station to fuel CNG trucks used for Mosaic’s fleet. Trillium CNG will operate the plant. This is not public domain infrastructure, but it will be the first CNG station capable of accommodating heavy-duty trucks that is open to the public. The station is currently under construction. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 42 EC9 Understand and Describe Significant Indirect Economic Impacts Mosaic has diverse and varied indirect economic effects on communities across the world. However, due to the complex nature of the business and philanthropic activities in which Mosaic engages, Mosaic does not attempt to estimate its indirect economic impact by using a measurement of currency. Global food security is one of the most pressing issues of our time and calls for the judicious use of resources, as well as an innovative spirit. Today’s crop nutrients are responsible for 40 to 60% of global crop yields, and Mosaic’s products play a crucial role in meeting the global demand for food. Our worldwide research programs focus on the development of new products for the specific soil characteristics in different parts of the world, such as Mosaic’s proprietary MicroEssentials® line, which is designed to help farmers make the most of every inch of farmland. By delivering sulfur and zinc with MicroEssentials and boron with Aspire™, another premium product, farmers are able to apply the top three most deficient secondary nutrients and micronutrients efficiently and uniformly, creating the opportunity to maximize yields in a sustainable manner. Farmers who produce enough food to support a profitable business bring economic benefits through their hiring and spending practices. Likewise, the dealers who distribute our fertilizers and the vendors who support our operations are meaningful contributors to the economic vitality of the rural and regional communities where they operate. Additionally, participants in The Mosaic Villages Project receive no-interest loans to buy fertilizer at planting, and repay the loans through the sale of surplus yield at harvest. Fertilizer acts as an injection of capital to the region, helping farmers break the cycle of poverty that has gripped these developing regions of the world. Participants in The Mosaic Villages Project have reported that, on average, yields have increased three to five times over that of traditional farming practices. Furthermore, many of Mosaic’s charitable community investments are focused on supporting hunger relief in communities and providing access to emergency food systems. Studies show that children who have sustained hunger have reduced abilities and capacity to learn in school. Access to regular food improves educational outcomes. The mining, production and distribution of potash and phosphate contribute to global economies through the import and export of the minerals themselves and the complementary goods needed to manufacture fertilizer, animal feed and industrial products. The multiplier effect of the money that Mosaic’s employees, suppliers and other stakeholders spend is dramatic. For example, in 2009, The Fertilizer Institute commissioned a study that found the phosphate fertilizer industry in the United States—of which Mosaic is the largest participant—provided a total economic contribution of $21.2 billion and almost 90,000 jobs. Additionally, the Areawide Environmental Impact Statement (AEIS) for continued phosphate mining in the Central Florida Phosphate District that was administered by the Army Corps of Engineers studied the economic impact of Mosaic’s continued operations in the region. The evaluation included Employment, Labor Compensation, Value of Production or Output and Value Added. It concluded that the indirect economic impact of continued Mosaic mining in the Central Florida region over the next 50 years will be © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 43 $1.4 billion. Furthermore, according to a 2013 study by the Port of Tampa of the port’s 2012 fiscal year, the phosphate industry accounted for more than $10 billion of the port’s $15.1 billion annual economic activity; supported more than half of the port’s 80,000 direct, indirect and related jobs; and created more than half of the 10,573 direct jobs at the port from the movement of phosphate rock and raw materials, as well as crop nutrition and animal feed supplies and products. Through work with the United Way and other local charities, Mosaic’s community investments help families achieve greater economic independence and improve educational outcomes for children. From workforce development programs to K-12 education initiatives, communities receive significant support to advance results in our operating communities and in NGO partner programs globally. Additionally, Mosaic’s partnerships with community organizations continue to support positive healthcare, education and housing opportunities for our neighbors. In Saskatchewan, Canada, Mosaic proudly supports Shock Trauma Air Rescue Service (STARS), which brings emergency medical transport to critically ill and injured patients in Saskatchewan. The service is the first of its kind in Saskatchewan, and with the largely rural communities in the regions where Mosaic operates, this program has already begun saving lives. After its first year in operation, over 250 lives were impacted due to the service. Mosaic also continues to support Habitat for Humanity in Regina, Saskatoon, Moose Jaw and Yorkton – helping to build 68 new homes over a three-year period. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company.

Page 44 Environmental Materials EN1 Materials Used by Weight or Volume Our business used the following raw materials in 2013: Materials Mined or Consumed Reported in Million Tonnes CY 2013 Ammonia 1.34 Limestone 0.28 Micronutrients 0.01 Phosphate Rock 13.90 Potash Ore 29.75 Sulfur 3.69 Notes: Ammonia purchases depicted in table above are for production of crop nutrients in Phosphates business unit only. Limestone is used to produce our animal feed products and for water treatment processing. Sulfur, a byproduct of crude oil and natural gas de-sulfurization, is used to produce steam, electricity and sulfuric acid, which is used to produce phosphoric acid. We use by-product heat from sulfuric acid production to generate steam that we use in our operations and to generate electricity. Sulfur is also used in the production of our MicroEssentials® product line. Various micronutrients, including boron, zinc, sulfur and cupric oxide, are key ingredients in our MicroEssentials product line. Ammonia is used in our finished products, DAP, MAP and MicroEssentials, and to neutralize the pH of the stack gases at our Esterhazy potash mine. EN2 Percentage of Materials Used That Are Recycled Input Materials Sulfur is the most significant recycled raw material in our manufacturing processes. The sulfur used is recovered from crude oil and natural gas processing and then recycled in our plant operations to produce sulfuric acid, which we use to make phosphoric acid, steam and electricity. In 2013, sulfur made up approximately 7.5% by weight of our total raw materials. We recycle the catalyst used in our sulfuric acid production and recover the vanadium for recycling. We also use recycled oil as a flotation aid in our phosphate beneficiation process. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 45 Energy EN3 Direct Energy Consumption by Primary Energy Source Mosaic’s worldwide total direct energy consumption in 2013 was 87.69 million gigajoules (GJ). Direct Energy Consumption – by Energy Source Approximately 98% of Mosaic’s worldwide total direct energy consumption in 2013 was from two sources: waste heat from sulfuric acid production and natural gas. The remaining portion was made up of petroleum products and propane. Our Phosphate operations require the production and consumption of sulfuric acid to liberate crop nutrients (phosphorous) from raw material inputs. The manufacture of sulfuric acid is an exothermic process, generating tremendous amounts of waste heat. Most of our finished phosphate crop nutrient manufacturing operations have installed bottoming cycle combined heat and power systems to convert this waste heat primarily into steam, used in the phosphate manufacturing facilities and mines. In 2013, our Phosphate operations used a portion of this energy to produce 5.17 million GJ of electricity, 86% of which was used internally. We consider the waste heat from sulfuric acid production to be a direct primary energy source for our operations. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 46 Natural gas is primarily used in our Phosphate and Potash operations to generate thermal energy for drying. However, a small portion of this fuel is used to produce steam for internal combined heat and power generation. Direct Energy Consumption Almost all of Mosaic’s worldwide total direct energy consumption is attributable to its phosphate and potash crop nutrient manufacturing operations. Specifically, approximately 79% is consumed in the production of phosphate crop nutrients while almost 21% is consumed in production of potash. The remaining portion – less than 1% – is consumed within Mosaic’s product distribution network and international production facilities. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 47 EN4 Indirect Energy Consumption by Primary Energy Source Mosaic consumes indirect energy solely through the purchase of electricity produced by third parties. Mosaic’s worldwide indirect energy consumption was 9.44 million GJ for 2013. The Phosphates business unit reduced the amount of purchased electricity in 2012, due primarily to resuming operation of a turbo generator used to convert waste heat into cogenerated electricity at our Uncle Sam facility. The Potash business unit increased production at some facilities, resulting in an overall increase in purchased electricity. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 48 Indirect Energy Consumption – by Fuel Source Approximately 11% of Mosaic’s worldwide indirect energy consumption is from renewable sources, including hydroelectric, bio-mass sources and wind power. Since 2009, almost 100% of the electricity used in our Brazilian operations has come from hydroelectric sources. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved.

Canada-purchased electricity sources are based on Saskpower 2011 Annual Report. International facilities’ power generation sources are based on the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s national energy profiles. As mentioned in EN3, Mosaic’s Phosphate operations produce a significant amount of electrical power through steam turbine generation from waste heat generated in sulfuric acid production. Phosphate © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 50 crop nutrient manufacture requires the production and consumption of sulfuric acid to liberate crop nutrients (phosphorous) from raw material inputs. The manufacture of sulfuric acid is an exothermic process, generating excess waste heat. In 2013, Mosaic’s Phosphate operations produced 5.17 million GJ of electricity through this process. Of this 5.17 million GJ, Mosaic consumed approximately 4.45 million GJ internally, offsetting the purchase of electricity from third-party utilities. Mosaic continuously looks for opportunities to improve the efficiency of, and expand the electricity output of, our cogeneration assets. In 2013, Mosaic completed construction of a new interconnection station to transport cogenerated output for use at our largest phosphate mining facility at Four Corners. EN5 Energy Saved Due to Conservation and Efficiency Improvements Mosaic emphasizes continuous energy improvements in our manufacturing facilities and support functions. This process is part of a broader strategic business plan designed to help Mosaic meet or exceed production and profitability requirements. This plan includes strategies for lowering purchased energy consumption through more efficient processes and maximizing use of energy generated through the crop nutrient manufacturing process. To identify and capture potential energy opportunities, we have formed teams of energy representatives at our sites. These teams investigate a number of issues, such as improvements in natural gas use (e.g., efficiencies in boilers, dryers, mine air heating and cogeneration) and improvements in electrical systems (e.g., efficiencies in cogeneration systems and slurry pumping, including extensive use of variable speed drives, air compression, and heating and lighting systems). In addition, Mosaic regularly conducts energy audits to help identify potential efficiency projects and assess major manufacturing processes such as combustion, general electrical, electric motor systems, compressed air systems and heating. We also have utility engineers assigned to individual facilities to help identify and execute energy efficiency initiatives. Projects are monitored and audited, and the resulting metrics are used to establish key performance indicators. These efforts reduce Mosaic’s overall energy profile, operational costs and use of indirect natural resources. Mosaic also emphasizes energy efficiency in our office facilities. In 2013, Mosaic’s Florida Corporate Headquarters received ENERGY STAR certification. Mosaic’s leased Regina, Canada, offices were built to LEED standards and included the purchase of interior design elements, furniture and products, as well as other energy efficiencies associated with LEED. Similarly, Mosaic’s Colonsay Mill Dry building was designed and constructed according to LEED standards. The LEED certification process for both buildings is underway. Due to conservation and efficiency improvement projects that were executed in 2013, Mosaic forecasts annual energy savings of approximately 120,000 GJ. Several examples of energy efficiency efforts by our operations are outlined below. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved.

EN6 Energy Belle Plaine Through an agreement with an industrial partner in 665,760.00 34,488.26 efficiencySaskatchewan, Mosaic’s Belle Plaine facility sends process water to be used in a cooling process at a nearby plant. The heated water returns to Mosaic’s facility to be used as part of the potash production process. This synergy allows Mosaic to reduce the amount of energy that would have otherwise been spent on heating the water while allowing the industrial partner to avoid cooling costs. EN6 Low carbon Uncle Sam In February 2013, Mosaic began full operation of an 11 278,074.80 39,957.80 energy megawatt hour turbine generator for heat recovery installation cogeneration at the Uncle Sam sulfuric acid plant in Louisiana, which reduced the amount of electricity the plant purchased in 2013.

EN6 Initiative to Provide Energy Efficient or Renewable Energy Based Products or Services, and Reductions in Energy Requirements as a Result of These Initiatives Renewable Energy Based Products or Services Mosaic’s three-pronged approach of energy management through cogeneration, conservation and greater efficiency aims to lead the industry in reducing the energy we use and maximizing the clean energy we generate. In Mosaic’s Sustainability Goals, published in 2012, we iterate our commitment to evaluating alternative energy sources to satisfy Mosaic’s energy requirements. Since 2008, we have improved our total energy per tonne of finished product by over 10%. A portion of the electricity required in Mosaic’s operations is satisfied through internal generation of electricity. This process of waste heat recovery, called cogeneration, allows several of our plants and mines to significantly reduce the amount of third-party electricity required from utilities. In October 2005, the Florida state legislature formally recognized that cogenerated electricity is “renewable energy” under Florida statute 366.91. In 2013, Mosaic produced enough electricity in all business units – approximately 6.24 million GJ through cogeneration – to satisfy approximately 44% of our companywide electrical demand. Over 1 million GJ of this cogenerated electricity was sent for use at our mines. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 53 Energy Efficient Based Products or Services Innovation is one of Mosaic’s strategic priorities. Built on our industry-leading product, process and sustainability solutions, it shapes our long-term strategy as we seek to reduce energy use and GHG emissions while delivering unique value to our stakeholders. Mosaic has a vested interest in the success of our customers, for it is their efforts that provide the food that feeds the world. To this end, Mosaic has developed several products and services that enhance customers' productivity and positively impact their energy efficiency. For example, in 2013, Mosaic continued full-scale production of Nexfos®, the next generation feed-grade phosphate that is characterized as being a combined source of highly available phosphorous, calcium and sodium. Not only is Nexfos the first innovation in feed-grade phosphate in 40 years, the product is helping Mosaic meet its commitment to sustainability by reducing its environmental footprint. The Nexfos production process has significantly reduced the carbon footprint associated with the production of comparable feed phosphates by requiring approximately 60% less water, 70% less natural gas and 55% less electricity per ton to produce. It also reduces purchasing, storing and handling costs for consumers. In addition, Mosaic maintains active partnerships with industry-leading research centers, targeting agriculture efficiency and productivity improvements. For more information on our partnerships, please see EN26. In 2013, energy efficient or renewable energy based initiatives resulted in approximately 950,000 GJ of energy savings. Please refer to the table in EN5 for additional information on our efforts to provide energy efficient or renewable energy based products or services. EN7 Initiatives to Reduce Indirect Energy Consumption and Reductions Achieved Mosaic is concerned with the overall energy impact of our business, including effects outside our operational boundaries. We actively pursue opportunities with the potential to reduce our indirect energy consumption. Energy efficiency savings are outlined in EN5 and discussed in detail in the Energy Efficiency Efforts by Operations table. Some additional examples of our efforts related to indirect energy consumption reductions include: • In 2013, Mosaic completed the conversion to a natural gas-powered truck fleet for raw materials and finished products in our Central Florida operations. The 50 trucks, operated by transportation company Dillon Transport, have increased capacity and are powered by cleanburning compressed natural gas. Benefits of the conversion include significantly lower emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides (up to 50% lower) and GHGs (potentially up to 25% lower). © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company.

Page 54 • Video Conferencing Systems – Mosaic has invested capital into, and is currently commissioning video conferencing systems, for seven facilities within the Phosphates business unit. These systems will supplement the existing conferencing equipment located at Mosaic's worldwide facilities, including locations in Canada and South America. We believe that the technology of enterprise video conferencing systems has matured to the point that it can effectively offset a portion of domestic and international employee travel. By eliminating a portion of car and air travel with these conferencing systems, Mosaic’s indirect energy consumption from travel is expected to decline. • Alternative Work Schedules – Several of Mosaic’s Potash business unit locations implemented temporary or full-time alternative work schedules that have the potential to reduce employee commute time and expense. For example, the Belle Plaine site has implemented schedules where a portion of the workforce works a combination of four work days for 10 hours instead of the more traditional five days for eight hours. By reducing the work week by one day, participating employees lower their commute-related fuel consumption by 20% and, therefore, contribute to a decrease in Mosaic’s overall indirect energy consumption.

Approximately 49% of Phosphates business unit surface water withdrawals are used for once-through cooling. The primary sources of water for operations are surface water, groundwater and rainwater. Secondary sources of water include water supplied by local authorities and partially treated industrial and domestic © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved.

Mosaic operations capture rainfall, a portion of which is impounded and used in the various production processes, with some discharged through permitted outfalls at Phosphates facilities. Traditionally, Mosaic has considered captured rainfall use as an “alternative water supply,” and it is used in part to estimate recycle/reuse water usage rates at Florida concentrate and minerals operations. Mosaic’s water withdrawals per tonne of dry product crop nutrient and animal feed production are as follows: CY 2013 Water Withdrawals/Production Intensity m3 per tonne of finished product Potash 3.03 Phosphates 35.40* International 0.311 3 Notes: Water intensity = Volume water used in making product (m ) per mass of product manufactured (metric tonnes), per business unit. (*) Includes once-through cooling water. Approximately 49% of Phosphates business unit surface water withdrawals are used for once-through cooling. Production includes all crop nutrients, animal feed ingredients and co-products produced in the calendar year. EN9 Water Sources Significantly Affected by Withdrawal of Water Mosaic’s Central Florida fertilizer production facilities operate on more than 90% recycled water. Deep well pumping from the Floridian Aquifer is used as a supplemental water supply on an as-needed basis. Local regulations favor the use of available alternative water supplies, such as reclaimed water from municipalities, before groundwater use. Currently the city of Bowling Green delivers its reclaimed water to Mosaic’s South Fort Meade Mine as a supplemental water supply to further reduce the need for groundwater. Once water use permits are issued, permit holders must regularly evaluate and report to the Southwest Florida Water Management District on water conservation efforts to minimize groundwater use for processing needs. To demonstrate the substantial results achieved through water conservation efforts over time, in 1991, Mosaic’s predecessors used approximately 1,000 gallons of water to process one ton of phosphate rock; currently the water demand has been reduced by 50% to about 500 gallons of water per ton of phosphate rock. Mosaic’s water use permit also reflects this decrease in demand. In fact, the Integrated Water Use Permit was renewed in 2012 with an annual average permitted quantity of 69 million gallons per day (MGD) versus the previous permit for the same area authorizing water use of 99 MGD, representing a reduction of 30%. In the Phosphates business unit, with respect to impacts on surface water sources and their associated ecological communities, active mining areas are surrounded by a protective recharge ditch and berm system to maintain the groundwater table elevation adjacent to the mining area and preclude adverse impacts to nearby wetlands and streams. In addition, the Phosphates business unit does not withdraw © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 56 water from rivers or lakes for water supply supplementation, further protecting ecological resources from undue stress. The final Areawide Environmental Impact Statement (AEIS), a two-plus-year study released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) in April 2013 and supplemented in July 2013, evaluating the cumulative impacts of phosphate rock mining in Central Florida, concludes that the effects from mining on groundwater resources would be “minor” in magnitude and not “significant.” A similar conclusion was reached for surface water resources in the July 2013 AEIS Addendum, which also indicates that surface water and ecological impacts would be “minor” and with mitigation would not be significant. As another example of our commitment to responsible water use, Mosaic has joined with Duke Energy to eliminate up to 4.6 million gallons per day of groundwater withdrawal in Polk County, Florida. In May 2012, Mosaic and Duke Energy commenced construction on pipelines that link Mosaic’s Green Bay and Hookers Prairie facilities to Duke’s Hines Energy Complex, which allows Mosaic to transfer treated water and storm water to the Hines Complex. The transfer alleviates the need for the Hines Station to pump groundwater. EN10 Percentage and Total Volume of Water Recycled and Reused Responsible use of water is a fundamental component of Mosaic’s global sustainability vision. Our water management programs involve facility-specific and business unit-wide initiatives to reduce our water footprint. Facilities continuously monitor and evaluate water use to ensure it is minimized, and water recycling and reuse are maximized. Recycle and reuse percentage rates for Mosaic’s Potash and Phosphate operations are presented below. Rates and volume are based on total water used by facility, less freshwater withdrawals. Recycle and Reuse Volume and Rate 3 Business Unit Recycle Volume (,000m ) Recycle Rate Potash 155,385 87% Phosphates Concentrates 319,024 95% Phosphates Minerals 465,679 94% Notes: Carlsbad, NM, South Pierce, FL, and Faustina and Uncle Sam, LA are not included in respective business unit calculations. Belle Plaine and Hersey are solution mines and therefore, water use and methodology for recycle/reuse rate differs from shaft mining operations. Mosaic operations capture rainfall, a portion of which is impounded and used in the various production processes, with some discharged through permitted outfalls at Phosphates facilities. Traditionally, Mosaic has considered captured rainfall use as an alternative water supply, and it is used in part to estimate recycle/reuse water usage rates at Florida concentrate and minerals operations. © Copyright 2014.

Page 57 Biodiversity EN11 Location and Size of Land Owned, Leased, Managed in or Adjacent to Protected Areas and Areas of High Biodiversity Value Outside Protected Areas As of December 31, 2013, Mosaic owned or controlled about 329,595 acres of land in Florida related to our Phosphates mining operations. Approximately 100,000 acres of Mosaic’s land holdings in Florida are either in the mine permitting process or have not yet entered the permitting process. For each permit, Mosaic works with a team of professional biologists, hydrologists and other specialists, and in conjunction with as many as 12 local, regional, state and federal regulatory agencies to ensure that all mined areas can be successfully reclaimed and to identify areas of high environmental sensitivity that should be protected. As of December 31, 2013, Mosaic owns more than 19,000 acres in Florida that are designated as nonimpacted floodplain, preservation and granted conservation easements in order to ensure long-term protection of lands or waters of particular sensitivity. We operate three Canadian Potash facilities, all located in the southern half of the province of Saskatchewan, including our solution mine at Belle Plaine, two interconnected mine shafts at our Esterhazy shaft mine and our shaft mine at Colonsay. Mosaic has mineral rights over approximately 500,000 acres in Saskatchewan for potash mining and surface rights to approximately 30,000 acres. Our U.S. Potash operations include a shaft mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico, and solution mine in Hersey, Michigan. We have mineral rights to approximately 65,000 acres in Carlsbad and 1,800 acres in Hersey for potash mining. Since shaft mining occurs at over 3,000 feet below surface and solution mining requires limited acreage for pipeline and cluster infrastructure, the only surface areas that are disturbed are the actual footprint of the mine shaft and the adjacent above-ground processing facilities. EN12 Description of Significant Impacts of Activities, Products and Services on Biodiversity in Protected Areas and Areas of High Biodiversity Value Outside Protected Areas Mining for phosphate ore in Florida is primarily undertaken using surface mining techniques with large earthmoving equipment such as draglines. This is primarily because the ore body is overlaid by sandy soils with a high water table that is not conducive to underground mining. Due to its unique geology, a dredging technique is used at our Wingate mine. Discussions regarding ecological resource preservation are held between Mosaic and the regulatory agencies during the permit application process. Preservation areas can include floodplains, as well as high-quality wetland or upland habitats and buffers. Such evaluations take into consideration the type © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 58 and quality of the habitat. Balancing the supply of phosphate, an important natural resource, against what is generally a temporary disturbance of ecological resources, is an essential consideration through this process. During the phosphate mining process, parcels are directionally cleared for mining to allow highly mobile animals to move to adjacent undisturbed or preservation areas. In addition, Mosaic obtains permits to relocate specific species in compliance with federal and state laws. After permit approval, state law requires mining parcels to be recontoured and planted with vegetation within two years of the completion of mining activities; all wetlands are replaced acre for acre and type for type, with additional wetlands constructed as needed to meet mitigation requirements. Once a particular parcel is mined and reclaimed, many vertebrates and invertebrates will repopulate the site through migration from wildlife corridors and protected riverine systems. Such migration corridors generally receive permanent protection after mining, with perpetual conservation easements. To ensure biodiversity, Mosaic may also restock the areas with certain species, such as the gopher tortoise, that may have previously resided on the parcel but had been moved from the site prior to mining. Phosphate mining in Florida, representing our largest phosphate reserve holdings, is heavily regulated by as many as 12 local, regional, state and federal permitting authorities. This robust regulatory oversight is combined with (a) areas that are set aside from mining, (b) reclamation practices that are best in class and (c) monitoring activities such as the Horse Creek Stewardship Program and Peace River Monitoring Programs, which are designed to monitor for and protect against significant impact on biodiversity either within or outside of our property boundaries. Potash mining operations in Canada and the United States use shaft and solution mining techniques. Because of the limited footprint on surface features, impacts are highly localized to surface infrastructure. Therefore, the impacts to wildlife and habitats are similarly highly localized. MM1 Amount of Land Disturbed and Rehabilitated Mosaic reports our Florida mining and reclamation activities to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Mining and Mitigation Program. As of the date of this publication’s release, 2012’s figures have not been deemed complete by the agency.

Acres Reclaimed through Vegetation or Under Industrial Use Criteria: Acreage on which contouring and final vegetation has been completed. Some of the acres include lands granted permission to allow reclamation of mandatory lands to an alternate use and have been reclaimed for their intended use. Total Reclamation is the sum of Acres Reclaimed through Vegetation or Under Industrial Use Criteria and Acres Released. All data through December 31, 2010, was compiled from Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s Bureau of Mining and Minerals 2010 Rate of Reclamation Report. EN13 Habitats Protected or Restored In our Phosphate mining operations, we restore or reclaim every acre of land that is impacted by our activities, with certain areas of high environmental sensitivity set aside for preservation. Mined lands are reclaimed to land uses such as wetlands, uplands, wildlife habitats, parks, neighborhoods and agricultural lands. Much of this land is also suitable for future conventional development such as housing and commercial use. Mosaic planted 1,389,416 trees in 2013, reclaiming uplands, significant upland habitats and wetlands that require, at a minimum, acre-for-acre and type-for-type per permitting requirements. Additionally, Mosaic works closely with one of our primary regulators, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Mining and Mitigation Program, to integrate habitat networks and wildlife corridors into our reclamation planning efforts. The FDEP created, implements and encourages permittees to participate in the development of an Integrated Habitat Network to benefit the water quality and quantity in the area, improve wildlife habitat, and serve as a connection between the mining region’s rivers and significant environmental features outside the mining region. Mosaic has fostered partnerships with, and funding for, a variety of NGOs and academic institutions to advance our understanding of the habitats we manage through reclamation. Examples of these groups include the Tampa Bay Watch, The Nature Conservancy and Audubon of Florida. Mosaic’s Potash Business Unit is similarly committed to habitat restoration. For example, Mosaic made a grant to Ducks Unlimited for $2 million that will restore a minimum of 500 acres of wetlands over a 10year period in Saskatchewan. EN14 Strategies, Current Actions and Future Plans for Managing Impacts on Biodiversity Mosaic is committed to minimizing our impacts on the environment through responsible mine planning, permitting, operation and reclamation practices. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s Mining and Mitigation Program oversees mining operations in Florida. The mine permitting process includes performing extensive ecological, wildlife and hydrological surveys, leading to the establishment of boundaries for preservation of areas identified as having important ecological or hydrological value. In addition to the required state, federal and county © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 60 permits and approvals, FDEP requires the preparation of a Conceptual Reclamation Plan (CRP). The CRP is inclusive of the entire mine site, including the preserved areas outside the operational boundaries. The CRP compares the post-mining, or reclamation plan, to existing site conditions, evaluating site topography, surface water hydrology and impacts to habitats. The CRP also outlines the project schedule. With respect to water quality, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, through its delegation to the FDEP, oversees protection of water quality for storm water, groundwater and surface water originating from mined areas. Phosphates and Potash operations’ interaction with wildlife in the United States is regulated by state agencies and by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). These state and federal agencies maintain lists of species, and Mosaic develops species-specific habitat management plans to ensure species are properly protected. In addition, Mosaic works closely with regulators to fund and conduct research that promotes the goal of wildlife and habitat conservation. Mosaic uses a combination of database searches and geographic information system (GIS) mapping in conjunction with field surveys to document the occurrence or potential for occurrence of state and federally listed floral and fauna species within operational areas. Mosaic evaluates potential impacts on plant and animal species based on those protected by applicable state and federal regulations and defines the appropriate protective measures in the habitat management plan. Wildlife surveys are performed prior to the submission of mine permit applications. Once approved, but prior to mining disturbance, additional surveys are performed to ensure the most up-to-date information is available in the event there has been wildlife immigration or changes to nesting/breeding areas. At that time, relocations or nest removal for certain species may occur with proper permits, while for other species protection zones and setbacks are established as required by law. Nest removals, regardless of the species, require all eggs to have hatched and that no flightless young be reliant on the nest. Significant electrical infrastructure is required to support phosphate mining operations. For Mosaic, as for electrical utilities, electrical structures present a risk of avian injury or mortality. Consequently, Mosaic developed an Avian Electrocution Prevention Plan, submitted to the USFWS and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. This plan, under which Mosaic currently operates, helps to identify high-risk structures and guide retrofitting lines and facilities that pose the greatest risk of electrocution or collision to large avian species. The plan is based on nesting and feeding sites and demonstrates and furthers Mosaic’s long-standing corporate policy of wildlife protection and wildlife habitat management and restoration. In our Potash facilities located in Saskatchewan, Canada, our approach to evaluating potential impacts to biodiversity includes biological assessments of proposed expansion sites. These assessments include field surveys to identify rare species of plants, birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians of special concern that may be impacted. Survey methods follow those recommended by the Saskatchewan Conservation Data Centre. Biological assessments for the proposed Phase IV and V Brine Ponds at the Esterhazy K2 site, tailings expansion area at our Colonsay mine site, K1 Pond F expansion areas and the entire Esterhazy K3 mine site also followed this approach. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 61 The potash mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico, has developed an Avian and Bat Protection Plan to minimize risks to migratory birds and bats that can be attracted to mining and milling areas. Mosaic has also partnered with the USFWS to study risks associated with migratory birds and bats in order to develop future strategies aimed at minimizing avian and bat mortality. MM2 The Number and Percentage of Total Sites Identified as Requiring Biodiversity Management Plans According to Stated Criteria, and the Number (Percentage) of Those Sites With Plans in Place All active sites within the United States and Canada operate in compliance with federal, state/provincial and local regulations related to management of habitat and wildlife. Phosphate mining operations within the United States require extensive assessment of the proposed area of operation. Mosaic performs environmental site assessments, impact studies, hydrologic modeling and prepares conceptual reclamation plans prior to receiving a permit to operate on a parcel of land. Biodiversity in flora and fauna is an important part of reclamation. Most mitigation plans have biodiversity requirements that must be monitored by qualified ecologists and reported to appropriate regulatory agencies as part of permit conditions or regulations. In fact, compliance with these biodiversity standards is a requirement that must be met before regulatory agencies will deem a site successfully reclaimed.

The table includes species and designations of the IUCN and not species and designations of federal or state/provincial agencies in the United States and Canada, by which Mosaic monitors threatened species. Mosaic’s Phosphates and Potash operations’ interaction with wildlife in the United States is regulated by state agencies (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and New Mexico Game and Fish) and federally by the USFWS. These state and federal agencies have their own lists of species and management plans that vary by agency. Mosaic works closely with these regulators not only to ensure compliance with management plans, but also to fund and conduct research with the goal of conservation of wildlife and conservation of ecological habitats. Mosaic does not specifically track wildlife species per the IUCN Red List designations, but instead tracks species as designated by regulatory agencies with authority in the regions in which we operate. For example, the area near our Florida Phosphate operations is home to species listed by federal or state authorities as endangered, threatened or of special concern. Potential impacts have been comprehensively evaluated for each potential mining area. Wildlife agencies have determined that operations would have no impact on those species, or that impacts could be mitigated by minimizing operations in sensitive habitats, creating new habitats for relocation and raising awareness of potential impacts among workers. In our Potash business unit, the rare and endangered species are evaluated as part of our biological assessments for expansion projects. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved.

Indirect emissions include electricity purchased from third-party utilities. Mosaic uses guidance from the CDP for calculating and reporting carbon dioxide equivalence (CO2e). Mosaic’s reported 2013 direct and indirect CO2e emissions data was reviewed and provided a statement of assurance by Trucost in accordance with AA1000AS standards. In 2012, Mosaic returned to regular production levels at our Faustina ammonia plant, which resulted in increased emissions of CO2, the primary byproduct of anhydrous ammonia production. Emissions associated with purchased electricity also increased due to downtime of a turbo generator at our Uncle Sam plant. The 2012 emissions also included some areas not previously reported, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from refrigeration units. Production levels between 2012 and 2013 remained fairly constant, resulting in a subtle year-over-year change in total emissions. Mosaic has established targets for an overall 10% reduction of absolute GHG emissions and a 5% reduction in GHG emissions intensity per tonne of product produced for the Phosphates business unit, from 2005 levels by 2015. These targets exclude emissions associated with ammonia production and our Potash business unit. We have reduced the North American Phosphates business unit’s absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 (direct and indirect) GHG emissions by more than 21% since 2005. Mosaic’s 2013 GHG emissions per tonne of dry product crop nutrient and animal feed production are as follows: 2013 GHG Emissions/Production Intensity Tonnes CO2e per tonne of finished product Business Unit GHG Emission Intensity Potash 0.20 © Copyright 2014.

EN17 Other Relevant Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Weight Mosaic has engaged upstream and downstream stakeholders in our supply chain to better quantify the impacts of our business. In 2013, Mosaic collaborated with vendors and contractors to quantify GHG emissions associated with business travel and rail transport of raw materials and finished products.

We continue to evaluate additional sources of Scope 3 emissions and anticipate expanding the scope of our reporting to include additional sources in the near future. EN18 Initiatives to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Reductions Achieved Mosaic is taking a proactive approach to reductions in emissions, with particular emphasis on improving energy efficiency and waste management. Mosaic’s Sustainability Goals, published in 2012, outline our target to reduce Mosaic’s absolute Greenhouse Gas emissions by 10% and our GHG intensity by 5% in our North American Phosphates business unit from 2005 levels by 2015. (Intensity per tonne of product and GHG targets exclude ammonia production due to pending decision on capacity expansion.) We have reduced the North American Phosphates business unit’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 (direct and indirect) GHG emissions by more than 13% since 2005. Mosaic has implemented innovative efficiency programs in our Phosphates facilities and Potash facilities to target improving energy efficiencies. With dedicated budgets and staff allocation, the goal of these programs, collectively, is to make our businesses more efficient and effective by growing value, increasing our return, transforming business practices, reinventing our culture and promoting accountability. Focus areas to date are procurement optimization (bidding, consolidation of vendors and © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 65 materials, and consumption of process chemicals); maintenance workflow or execution efficiency, which translates into reduced use of third-party contractors, overtime and Mosaic personnel; energy and operations effectiveness through the understanding of our organization’s “health” or readiness to change and execute change; implementation of a performance management process (metrics-driven top to bottom, along with a cadence of effective discussions and action over those metrics); and OEE, or asset utilization optimization (downtime and utilization improvements to increase production where needed, or decrease emergency downtime, assets needed, etc.). Greenhouse gas emission reductions resulting from voluntary initiatives reported in EN5, EN6 and EN7 equal approximately 93,000 tonnes of CO2e. For more information on Mosaic’s efforts to reduce GHG emissions and address climate change, please see our 2013 Carbon Disclosure Project Response. EN19 Emissions of Ozone-Depleting Substances by Weight Mosaic does not produce CFCs, HCFCs, halon or methyl bromide in any of our operations. Refrigerants used in air conditioning units at our offices and production facilities represent a nominal quantity and only appropriate outside firms or certified internal technicians maintain these units. Air conditioning systems on some vehicles and equipment are maintained by Mosaic personnel. Ozone-depleting substances are phased out as required when units are replaced. In 2012, Mosaic inventoried refrigeration units in over half of its worldwide facilities for potential emissions related to global warming potential and ozone depleting potential (OZP). Mosaic has targeted the remaining facilities, including acquisitions, to be inventoried in 2014. Potential GHGs from refrigerants, expressed in CO2e, are included in EN16. EN20 NOx, SOx and Other Significant Air Emissions by Type and Weight Mosaic recognizes the importance of careful air emissions management and proactive reduction of these emissions from our operations. We use published emission factors and engineering estimates, as well as analytical stack sampling results, to calculate the following criteria air and other pollutants emissions for Phosphates and Potash operations. Due to regulatory reporting timelines, 2013’s data was unavailable at the time of this publication’s release; we expect to publish 2013 data here after June 2014.

These limitations are based on the water quality standards applicable to the receiving water body for that discharge and are set at levels that protect the designated uses of that water body, as defined by state environmental regulatory agencies. As an overarching principle, water that falls within the active, operational footprint at Mosaic’s mining and fertilizer production facilities is actively managed, treated if necessary and discharged only through outfalls, whose locations are permitted through the NPDES program. Discharges are monitored, sampled and analyzed regularly by Mosaic, and reported to these regulatory agencies to demonstrate ongoing compliance with these permit limitations. By maintaining compliance with all NPDES permits, Mosaic ensures that its discharges meet existing regulations. In 2013, Mosaic’s Canadian Potash facilities helped preserve water quality off-site by maintaining a zerodischarge approach, with the capture of surface water runoff from the sites. In certain circumstances of high precipitation events, off-site discharges of surface water runoff are warranted and are approved in advance by the Ministry of Environment. There were no such instances in 2013. A significant percentage of the total outfall from Phosphate operations is from rainwater, and discharge rates can vary year to year according to levels of precipitation. In Florida, our operations occur in the © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved.

Clay is pumped wet to surface impoundments. The drying process for clay takes many years. Mosaic uses best industry practices to manage overburden, tailings and byproducts associated with our mining and production. In addition, Mosaic complies with federal, state and local regulations related to these materials. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 70 Mining and processing of potash and phosphate generate residual materials that must be managed both during the operation of a facility and upon a facility’s closure. Potash tailings, consisting primarily of salt and clay, are stored in tailings management areas. Portions of excess salt generated from potash mining is processed and then used for commercial purposes, including road salt, water softener salt, and use in food grade products and industrial uses. Phosphate clay residuals from mining are deposited in clay settling ponds. Certain solid wastes generated by our phosphate operations may be subject to regulation under RCRA and related state laws. The EPA rules exempt “extraction” and “beneficiation” wastes, as well as 20 specified “mineral processing” wastes, from the hazardous waste management requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Accordingly, certain residual materials which our phosphate operations generate, like phosphogypsum, as well as process wastewater from phosphoric acid production, are exempt from RCRA regulation.

They were not significant enough to report in our financial statements. Such releases identified for Potash facilities involved brine, dedusting agent, calcium chloride and finished product; and for Phosphates facilities involved storm water, sulfuric acid, waste clay and process water. EN24 Weight of Transported, Imported, Exported or Treated Waste Deemed Hazardous Mosaic facilities generate hazardous waste during production and maintenance operations. In the United States, Mosaic’s Phosphates and Potash facilities are typically either categorized as Small Quantity or Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (which generate less than 2,200 pounds of hazardous waste per month). The four concentrate facilities in the Phosphates business unit are designated as Large Quantity Generators (which generate more than 2,200 pounds of hazardous waste per month). Canadian facilities comply with all national regulations regarding these materials. The types of hazardous waste generated at Mosaic’s U.S. facilities typically include spent cleaning solvents, paint-related wastes and some spent laboratory chemicals. At concentrate facilities, wastes generated during production and maintenance operations include waste that is characteristically hazardous for corrosivity and/or toxicity (e.g., low pH and/or metals content). Each location has an appropriate hazardous waste management system to ensure that the waste is properly and safely disposed. No hazardous wastes are shipped internationally for disposal. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 71 EN25 Identity, Size, Protected Status and Biodiversity Value of Water Bodies, and Related Habitats Significantly Affected by the Reporting Organization’s Discharge of Water and Runoff The discharge of water and runoff from Mosaic’s mining and fertilizer manufacturing is a highly regulated activity that has stringent reporting and compliance requirements. The release of water via storm water or discharge must comply with these requirements. The standards enforced by the regulatory authorities are designed to protect water bodies and associated habitats from degradation and secondary environmental impacts. None of the points of discharge releases water directly into a designated protected area. The four riverine basins in which Mosaic operates in Florida include the Peace, Alafia, Little Manatee and the Myakka Rivers. These riverine systems vary in size, as indicated below. Florida Riverine Basins Where Mosaic Operates Water body/basin Basin size (hectares) River length (km) Peace River 608,000 169 Alafia River 109,000 38 Little Manatee River 58,000 58 Myakka River 155,000 106 Some key examples at our major facilities: • Any releases are subject to water constituent limitations designed to be protective of downstream biological communities. The final AEIS released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in April 2013 and supplemented in July 2013, which provides a comprehensive two-plus-year study on the direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of proposed and reasonably foreseeable phosphate mining projects in the Central Florida Phosphate District, concludes that the effects of mining will not have a significant water quality impact, in part, because the proposed projects are not expected to cause violations of water quality standards. While NPDES-permitted discharges associated with the proposed alternatives may add some authorized quantities of certain regulated or targeted constituents to receiving waters, the anticipated, resulting levels of these parameters would not constitute health risk nor present an unacceptable risk to stream biota. • In Louisiana, our Faustina and Uncle Sam plants intake and outfall to the Mississippi River. This process is highly regulated by the state to ensure that gross contaminant levels are acceptable. • For our Canadian Potash operations, we have no off-site releases of water or runoff as part of normal operations. See EN21 for additional context. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 72 Products and Services EN26 Initiatives to Mitigate Environmental Impacts of Products and Services Mosaic has a dedicated agronomy team that conducts field trials to evaluate the performance of our products and develop recommendations to mitigate any potential environmental impact. In 2013, we conducted 435 small-plot trials in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Canada, India, Northern Latin America (Mexico to Peru) and the United States. These trials were conducted by highly regarded private researchers and universities that follow rigorous scientific standards. In addition, more than 65 demonstration plots were conducted in the same countries via collaborations with customers and growers. In total, nearly 500 plots of research were established in 2013. Mosaic continues its collaboration with a highly regarded crop sciences professor and researcher at the University of Illinois to develop advanced agronomic systems aimed at sustainably increasing corn productivity by combining fertilizer best management practices with other agronomic technologies. This research evaluates nutrient requirements of modern corn hybrids and soybean varieties under different field conditions. A complete understanding of field conditions is a precondition of a balanced crop nutrition program. Educational Tools Mosaic will continue to support a new educational initiative to help the industry understand fertilizer best management practices as a way of reducing environmental impact. CropNutrition.com is a resource for retailers, growers and media members seeking to better understand soil science, grow crops that are stronger, and increase productivity and yield in a sustainable manner. By simplifying highly technical and agronomic information, CropNutrition.com is an approachable and digestible digital hub of soil fertility and balanced crop nutrition information. CropNutrition.com provides a wealth of information in various ways, including: • Interactive and dynamic content • The Agronomy Resource Center, featuring expertise from members of the Mosaic Agronomy Team and timely regional updates • Timely and topical blog posts shared on the Agronomy Blog • An interactive periodic table of crop nutrients, highlighting each nutrient’s role in plant health and photos to identify nutrient deficiencies • Monthly Fertility Facts videos • Quarterly AgriSight™ fact sheets highlighting the latest research and industry trends © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 73 The CropNutrition initiative is an integrated effort to inform growers and retailers. Through various vehicles, such as print, radio and digital advertisements, as well as social media channels, Mosaic will provide a consistent flow of information around the topics and trends that contribute up to 60% of farmers’ yields. CropNutrition will give unprecedented access to information and expertise from within the walls of a leading agriculture company and its industry-leading partners. Retailers and growers will benefit from Mosaic sharing information that will allow them to think progressively about crop fertility. Industry Initiatives The Nutrient Use Geographic Information System (NuGIS) is a Web-based application developed by IPNI that integrates multiple tabular and spatial datasets to create county-level estimates of nutrients applied in fertilizer and livestock manure, nutrients removed by harvested agricultural crops, and the resulting balance. Mosaic’s membership in the IPNI helps fund this North American database. We have leveraged this information by providing reports specifically for our customers to help them assess nutrient use efficiency and balance. 4R Nutrient Stewardship (4Rs) is about doing everything “right” in regard to fertilizer application and effectively reducing agriculture’s potential for negative externalities. The 4Rs is an innovative and science-based approach that when applied offers enhanced environmental protection, increased production, increased farmer profitability and improved sustainability. The concept is to use the Right fertilizer source, at the Right rate, at the Right time, in the Right place. For fertilizer use to be sustainable, it must support cropping systems that provide economic, social and environmental benefits. Because the 4Rs is critical for sustainability, Mosaic’s goal is to partner with the fertilizer industry to enhance understanding, adoption and promotion of 4R Nutrient Stewardship among stakeholders. To help address this challenge, TFI has been working collaboratively with the IFA, the IPNI and the CFI to advance the 4R Nutrient Stewardship initiative. Two goals of the initiative include establishing 4Rs as a recognizable strategy for economic, social and environmental sustainability, and expanding the adoption of 4R Nutrient Stewardship globally. Partnerships Mosaic established and continues to fund the Mosaic Fertilizer Technology and Research Centre initiative at the University of Adelaide, Australia. The centre focuses on soil chemistry and fertilizer technology, and uses the latest technology to develop innovative fertilizer formulations to improve nutrient use efficiency. Mosaic also has a long-term partnership with a globally recognized plant nutrition expert at Sabanci University in Turkey, whose research focus is balanced crop nutrition and nutrient interactions conducted through greenhouse experiments. © Copyright 2014.

Page 74 The Mosaic Company partners with The Nature Conservancy as it conducts a three-year conservation pilot in three watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River basin, including the Root River in southeastern Minnesota, the Boone River in northern Iowa and the Mackinaw River in central Illinois. The Conservancy works with local partners, including farmers, in those watersheds to implement and study conservation techniques that best lower nutrient and sediment concentrations by reducing runoff from agricultural landscapes. Through this project, the Conservancy seeks to determine which tools work best in a larger, sub-watershed system, and will then communicate findings to crop producers to guide their farm stewardship decisions. EN27 Percentage of Products Sold and Their Packing Materials That Are Reclaimed by Category Mosaic products, predominantly fertilizer and animal feed ingredients, are used in various stages of agricultural operations with multiple steps and biological processes. To the extent possible, bulk transport is used to minimize the need for extensive packaging throughout the supply chain. Agricultural operation processes are not within Mosaic’s purview to control; however, the nutrient elements of our products often are recycled into these or other agricultural systems. Examples of these systems include: • Fertilizer is applied to the soil and then taken up by plants; the plants can be used for human or animal food. This food is processed and excreted by humans and animals as manure or biosolids, which may be recycled and used as nutrients similar to fertilizers, depending on infrastructure (e.g., publicly owned treatment works reuse water distribution systems). • Animal feed materials are taken up by animals as food and excreted as manure. These materials may be recycled and used as nutrients similar to fertilizers, depending on infrastructure (e.g., feed lot versus free-range grazing). To further encourage stewardship of our products, Mosaic has formed a product stewardship team from various disciplines and is pursuing opportunities to cooperate with supply chain and logistical partners to identify and implement stewardship enhancements on a global basis. A reclaimed product example is our use of sulfur, which is a co-product of the petroleum industry and is reclaimed from the crude oil desulfurization process. Our use of this product prevents an excess of sulfur that otherwise could be disposed of in landfills. Finally, Mosaic supports and helps promote TFI’s Bulk Blend Workshops and Manual, which eliminates the need for packaging of major raw materials or the final product. This process completely eliminates the need for bags, as the product is transferred from dealer to farmer. Because of the sizing and blending capabilities of our bulk materials, we encourage the use of the bulk blending and delivery system in farming operations. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company.

Page 75 Compliance EN28 Monetary Value of Significant Fines and Total Number of Nonmonetary Sanctions for Noncompliance With Environmental Laws and Regulations In Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs, Mosaic reports any environmental fine or sanction that it has identified as potentially material to investors, or if not potentially material, as potentially meeting or exceeding a significance threshold of $100,000. In 2013, Mosaic paid a penalty of $245,000 in connection with a settlement of alleged Clean Air Act violations at our Riverview, New Wales, Bartow, South Pierce and Green Bay facilities. Transport EN29 Significant Environmental Impacts of Transporting Products and Other Goods and Materials Used for the Organization’s Operations, and Transporting Members of the Workforce In 2013, Mosaic moved approximately 58 million short tons of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished products. To compare fuel efficiency, the industry standard is to measure ton-miles per gallon (ton/miles/gallon). The following chart compares the efficiency of the various modes of transportation that Mosaic uses to move our raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 76 The most fuel efficient transport is by Panamax vessels, which carry approximately 66,000 tons of cargo great distances. In North America, cross-Gulf (Gulf of Mexico) barges are quite efficient. Conversely, trucks can carry approximately 25 tons and yield approximately 155 tons/miles/gallon. For 2013, our spending on North American transport of materials and products was divided across modes as follows. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 77 The following table summarizes the amount of material transported and number of North American shipments. Transport Mode and Weight CY 2013 Mode Tons % by Weight Vessel and XGULF 13,403,602 23% River Barge 6,898,620 12% Rail (Cars) 25,672,589 44% Truck 11,140,013 19% Pipeline 1,236,899 2% Total 58,351,723 100% Notes: This table includes shipments of raw materials and finished product from origin to final destination that originated or ended in North America. Energy Use and Emissions – Because diesel or a heating oil derivative fuels most of the transportation, the lowest-cost option for the customer is often the option that uses the least fuel and has the lowest potential environmental impact. The vast majority of our truck shipments occur within Florida and are associated with time-sensitive intra-company shipments of sulfur, sulfuric acid and phosphate rock. In addition, the distance traveled in most cases is less than 50 miles, making trucks a generally less expensive and more reliable solution. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 78 Environmental impacts of transporting our materials are primarily related to GHG emissions. When distance traveled is less than 50 miles, trucking is generally the most reliable and cost-effective mode of transport. During the 2013 reporting period, Mosaic and its transportation partners used various fuel and GHG emission-saving initiatives, including: • Mosaic created the PhosPro Initiative to improve our handling raw materials that travel by rail. Consisting of cross-functional teams at Mosaic and CSX, the PhosPro initiative focuses on increasing efficiencies and reducing costs for both companies. Mosaic anticipates benefits such as moving more finished products upstream by rail instead of truck, which will result in improved fuel efficiency and lower GHG emissions. • As part of our commitment to sustainability, Mosaic uses RightShip, a vetting service that allows the supply chain team to select vessels that meet certain safety and environmental criteria, including energy efficiency and GHG emissions performance. By chartering the most efficient vessels available in terms of fuel consumption, we are reducing the environmental impact associated with transportation of materials. • In 2013, Mosaic completed the conversion to a natural gas-powered truck fleet for raw materials and finished products in our Central Florida operations. The 50 trucks, operated by transportation partner Dillon Transport, have increased capacity and are powered by cleanburning CNG. Benefits of the conversion include significantly lower emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides (up to 50% lower) and GHGs (potentially up to 25% lower). Based on forecasted shipping volumes, we estimate that this change will save at least $1 million annually. • Mosaic, along with our trucking partners, has implemented a number of fuel-saving initiatives, such as automatic engine shutoffs and reduced intra-company truck scaling. We have also invested in faster loading processes to both reduce fuel consumption and total trucks deployed. • Mosaic uses specialized Saddleback trailers to increase backhaul usage to reduce “dead head,” or empty loads. These unique trailers can transport molten sulfur from the Port of Tampa to our production facilities and return to the port with a load of our finished product for shipment to customers. • An N-ViroMotive locomotive, used at our South Fort Meade mine, uses approximately 57% less fuel and emits approximately 80% fewer GHGs than single-engine diesel locomotives. Waste – Mosaic has funded and promoted the TFI Bulk Blend Workshops and Manual. Transporting and distributing our crop nutrient products in bulk greatly reduces the amount of packaging required to deliver our products to consumers. Most of our crop nutrient products are transported from production facilities to consumers in bulk quantities. Therefore, environmental impacts associated with packaging are eliminated. In some areas where small-scale farmers purchase our products, bulk distribution is not possible. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 79 Overall EN30 Total Environmental Protection Expenditures and Investments by Type Mosaic has expended, and anticipates that we will continue to expend substantial financial and managerial resources to comply with EHS standards, and continue to improve our environmental stewardship. In the seven months ended December 31, 2013 and in fiscal 2013, we spent approximately $130 and $230 million, respectively, for environmental capital expenditures, land reclamation activities, gypstack closure and water treatment activities. © Copyright 2014.

Page 84 Society Community SO1 Percentage of Operations With Implemented Local Community Engagement, Impact Assessments and Development Programs In alignment with Mosaic’s Environment, Health and Safety policies, Mosaic is committed to conducting all business activities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees, our contractors, our customers and the public. Mosaic’s core values of integrity, excellence, sustainability and connectivity define how we conduct business, how we interact with colleagues, and how we treat our communities and planet. As such, 100% of Mosaic operations have impact assessment and development programs. Mosaic employs a variety of approaches to systematically assess and manage the diverse impacts of industry on the various communities in which we operate. Across the globe, our employees adhere to the same companywide values. This common sense of purpose and responsibility ensures that we approach our work with a shared goal. Mosaic has key distribution facilities in eight countries, serving customers in approximately 40 countries around the world. In Central Florida, where Mosaic mines phosphate rock and manufactures phosphate fertilizers and animal feed ingredients (AFI), the company owns seven mining and finishing facilities. The company also mines potash from five mines in North America, primarily in Saskatchewan. Additionally, Mosaic owns 12 facilities in Brazil, which is an important region for future growth. Although Mosaic continues to refine and adapt community investment programs throughout South America and Asia, due to the nature of our business and potential impact, this report heavily emphasizes Central Florida, Saskatchewan, Canada and Brazil. Our operations in Saskatchewan, Central Florida and Brazil work diligently to engage local communities. Mosaic's engagement within local communities includes monthly meetings with a series of community advisory panels, civic organizations, elected officials, civil servants and other opinion leaders. Mosaic reaches the broader community through print, broadcast, billboard and digital ads, news and social media outlets, direct mail, and public education initiatives. When the business plans to expand operations, we host community forums and participate in public hearings convened by local and regional governments. Mosaic is committed to conducting and reporting the results of environmental impact assessments. In April 2013, the final Areawide Environmental Impact Statement (AEIS) on Phosphate Mining in the Central Florida District was released by the ACOE for public review. In August 2013, the AEIS for continued phosphate mining in the Central Florida Phosphate District was finalized. Administered by the ACOE in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, this process analyzed the © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 85 environmental scope and potential impacts of phosphate mining in Central Florida. Additionally, as it becomes available, information about our permit applications is posted online on microsites targeted to each permitting county in Central Florida. This transparency provides the public with a clearer view of the regulatory process for permitting and gives local residents the ability to communicate directly with the experts overseeing a given project. The Mosaic Potash business unit conducts regular environmental impact assessments, reporting the findings to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment. All environmental impact assessments have been submitted and approved to date. Additionally, the Mosaic Potash facilities in Saskatchewan, Canada, conduct thorough biological assessments of proposed expansion sites, such as the assessments for the tailing expansion at the Colonsay and Esterhazy mines, as well as the new K3 mine shaft site at Esterhazy. Each of these assessments includes field surveys to identify rare species of plants and animals of special concern to identify if mitigation programs are required. Community Development and Consultation Each year, Mosaic aims to invest 1% of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) over a three-year rolling average into our communities. The Mosaic Company, The Mosaic Company Foundation and The Mosaic Institute in Brazil make investments in our global communities through philanthropic grants, employee engagement and in-kind donations. Combined contributions in 2013 reached $27.16 million. In 2013, Mosaic operations in Florida committed more than $10 million, and operations in Saskatchewan committed more than $5 million to enrich and improve communities where we have offices and operations. Mosaic employs regional, full-time public affairs (PA) staff to support all communities where we have an operating footprint. Mosaic PA staff is committed to maintaining an open dialogue with the people in our communities, assessing local needs and building partnerships designed to improve community vibrancy for local residents. Independent Community Advisory Panels (CAPs) help facilitate this work. Underwritten by Mosaic, CAPs serve as a forum for open discussion among representatives of the local community, and provide a place for companies to discuss community response to industry developments and plans. In some locations, there are cultural implications to our business that Mosaic addresses through community engagement. Through the efforts of the manager of Aboriginal Engagement in Canada and Mosaic’s Representative Workforce Strategy, Mosaic continues to build a more inclusive workforce by working with various provincial tribal councils. Mosaic recognizes the significance of building relationships with educational institutions throughout Saskatchewan, as well as other First Nation and Metis organizations that serve the career development needs of aboriginal people in Saskatchewan. For example, Mosaic partners with the Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technologies’ Mining Industry Prep Programs, which are based in Saskatoon, Yorkton and Regina, to prepare the aboriginal workforce for careers in mining. © Copyright 2014.

Through face-to-face meetings, social media, government relations, facility tours and more, Mosaic connects with stakeholders to keep them well informed and engaged with our mission to help the world grow the food it needs. • Mosaic employees conduct tours of mines and manufacturing facilities for local, state and federal elected officials and staff, customers, investors, students, community leaders, the media, and nonprofit and civic groups throughout the year. • Mosaic has an engaged social media presence (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube). These media enable us to share information with the general public and engage in conversations about our business, making thousands of impressions on users and community members. • Additionally, Mosaic manages micro Web sites in support of future permitting, with the goal of being transparent with the general public. These sites invite the public to be engaged with the permitting process, review maps of the proposed mining areas, ask an expert and submit questions about our activities in and around their communities. • In 2013, The Mosaic Express – an educational exhibit on wheels about phosphate – traveled across the United States sharing with more than 15,000 people in Florida, South Dakota, Alabama and Minnesota information about our business, nutrient stewardship and the role of fertilizer in food production. • Mosaic is committed to being an engaged business partner. In the past year, Mosaic held meetings inviting current and potential vendors to discuss our corporate values and how we interact with other companies and our communities. Mosaic also regularly engages its customers in crop nutrient education and business management principles through various events, such as Mosaic’s AgCollege, which hosts 250 of Mosaic's strategic customers from the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Chile, China and India for the premier education, personal growth and leadership development event for fertilizer retailers. • As a member of The Fertilizer Institute, the Canadian Fertilizer Institute, the Saskatchewan Mining Association and the Saskatchewan Potash Producers Association, Mosaic presents important information to government groups and decision-makers who directly impact operations, our current expansions and our investments in our communities. • Individually, Mosaic participates in ongoing consultation with both the provincial government of Saskatchewan and the federal government of Canada. Topics presented to key stakeholders include energy – particularly the high cost of natural gas in Saskatchewan, including the need for new exploration and sources to sustain potash mining and future industry. Other topics include air emissions and the ability to work in partnership with the government to approach environmental sustainability. • Mosaic has plans to expand in various geographies, and skilled labor is a key priority. Working with the government to make immigration a priority, Mosaic has not only helped bring new skilled labor to Saskatchewan, but has also assisted in building community infrastructure in the © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 87 areas where we operate. In 2013, Mosaic donated scholarship funds to various college engineering programs such as Virginia Tech, the University of Kentucky, Louisiana State University, the University of Florida and the University of South Florida. Additionally, the Mosaic Phosphates business unit in Florida operates an apprenticeship/internship program. SO9 Operations With Significant Potential or Actual Negative Impacts on Local Communities Mosaic provides a great number of economic and social benefits to the local communities in which it operates. However, as with all mining activities, the extraction and beneficiation of phosphate rock and potash to meet the global demand for mineral fertilizer has the potential to cause environmental impacts. Mosaic operates in a highly regulated and monitored industry. We work closely with state/provincial and federal officials on operations, expansions and sales to ascertain the environmental impact of industry activities on local communities. Through this collaboration, Mosaic has identified and implemented mitigation opportunities that safeguard local communities from potential negative impact. For information on actual or potential impacts, please see the discussion of risk factors in our 10-K Report (Pages 25-47). SO10 Prevention and Mitigation Measures Implemented in Operations With Significant Potential or Actual Negative Impacts on Local Communities Mosaic is committed to conducting business in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and communities. In order to assess and ensure the safety of our operations and communities, Mosaic instituted the Risk-Based Inspection Mechanical Integrity program, which was launched in 2010 at our Esterhazy operations in Saskatchewan and New Wales plant in Florida. The program provides an industry-leading process to proactively identify risk and prevent failure of assets at our mines and facilities by giving employees the information and resources they need to: • Assess the condition of all stationary assets at a specific location • Develop an inspection plan that will prevent mechanical failure • Help to ensure action is taken to correct any and all deficiencies Mosaic was one of the first companies in the industry to take a look at this approach, demonstrating our commitment to continuously improving the way we operate and ensuring the safety of our facilities and local communities. Additionally, a cross-functional team comprising of representatives from EHS, Operations and Public Affairs has identified 12 scenarios that would have the most dramatic impact on the company's brand, reputation or financial well-being. The team built a crisis and critical issues program that tests and drills employees on their preparedness for various issues. These drills have been completed at all major © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 88 facilities across the company. The next step in Mosaic’s crisis-management preparation will build on the coordination facilities already have with local first-responders and community leaders. Environmental impact is an increasingly important issue against which all human activities must be weighed. Mosaic has been a leader in habitat conservation, land reclamation projects for previously mined land and water conservation, which mitigate potential environmental impacts on the communities in which we operate. In April 2013, the final AEIS on Phosphate Mining in the Central Florida District was released by the ACOE for public review. Administered by the ACOE in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, this process analyzed the environmental scope and potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of proposed and reasonably foreseeable phosphate mining projects in the Central Florida Phosphates District. Among the report’s noteworthy conclusions was that with mitigation, there will not be any significant adverse impacts on wetlands and wildlife habitat from proposed future Mosaic mining activities. MM6 Number and Description of Significant Disputes Relating to Land Use, Customary Rights of Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples In 2013, Mosaic had no disputes to report relating to land use, customary rights of local communities and indigenous peoples. MM7 The Extent to Which Grievance Mechanisms Were Used to Resolve Disputes Relating to Land Use, Customary Rights of Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples, and the Outcomes; Includes Use and Outcome of Any Grievance Procedures There were no such disputes in 2013. Before concerns or disputes arise, Mosaic strives to engage in an interactive dialogue with stakeholders, including local communities and interest groups, through means such as our Internet site and community microsites, tours of plants and mines, community advisory panels, town halls, and/or open houses. MM8 Number (and Percentage) of Company Operating Sites Where Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) Takes Place on, or Adjacent to, the Site; the Associated Risks and the Actions Taken to Manage and Mitigate These Risks In 2013, no artisanal or small-scale phosphate or potash mining took place on, or adjacent to any Mosaic site. Mosaic's mining operations encompass potash and phosphate ores, which are less suited to © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 89 artisanal or small-scale mining (as compared to precious metals, for example). Our mine operations are capital intensive, and therefore, risks are required to be defined and managed well before any mining occurs. MM9 Sites Where Resettlements Took Place, the Number of Households Resettled in Each and How Their Livelihoods Were Affected in the Process Mosaic’s Potash and Phosphate operations are well established mining regions with 50-plus years of operations. Mosaic has community relations managers who ensure potential impacts from our operations are communicated effectively to community associations. Community relations managers also work in conjunction with our land management office to address any questions or concerns raised by the community. The Potash Business Unit’s Land and Minerals Department works with individual landowners to ensure the appropriate level of consultation is employed, as is required by provincial legislation and internal policy. Mosaic recently participated in an AEIS, a two-year study by the ACOE, evaluating the cumulative impacts of phosphate rock mining in Central Florida. The study involved extensive community consultation, and the final report was issued in June 2013. MM10 Number and Percentage of Operations With Closure Plans Mosaic’s phosphate mining is a land intensive operation. As such, our mine sites have to go through a detailed permitting process that involves determination and approval of ultimate closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation of our facilities. Please refer to MM1, EN13 and EN14 for specific details of our reclamation efforts. Mosaic has plans in place as required by governmental regulations for the closure and post closure care of our phosphogypsum management systems at seven former and current phosphoric acid manufacturing plants in Florida and Louisiana. Similarly, Mosaic has plans in place as required by governmental regulations for the closure and post-closure care of its Carlsbad and Saskatchewan mining operations. For specific details on our estimated asset retirement obligations (ARO), please refer to our 10-K (pages 34, F-29, F-33, F-36, F-84-85). Similarly, Mosaic has plans in place as required by governmental regulations for the closure and postclosure care of its Carlsbad and Saskatchewan mining operations. For specific details of our estimated AROs, please refer to our 10-K. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 90 Corruption SO2 Business Units Analyzed for Risks Related to Corruption Mosaic’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics demands strict compliance from our employees and requires any employees who have been assigned a company computer user id – which is approximately 3,500 employees – to complete online code of conduct training and certify compliance with the code annually. Mosaic also maintains a 24-hour independently administered confidential and anonymous incident reporting hotline for all Mosaic employees. In addition, Mosaic conducts a robust risk assessment to identify risks related to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). A robust fraud risk assessment is also completed in the Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts. Mosaic recognizes the importance of the FCPA and has established a Worldwide Anti-corruption Policy. Mosaic conducts periodic FCPA audits of selected various geographic locations and respective individuals – including but not limited to country managers, sales representatives, accounting/finance personnel and supply chain – whose job responsibilities require a keen awareness of and compliance with the FCPA. The total number of business units analyzed for risks related to corruption: three (Potash, Phosphates and Corporate). The percentage of business units analyzed for risks related to corruption: 100% (all three business units, which is our total population of business units). We also review select joint ventures including Miski Mayo in Peru. SO3 Employees Trained in Organization's Anti-corruption Policies and Procedures Mosaic requires all salaried employees (which includes all management employees) to complete online training regarding the FCPA, and since May 2009, over 5,200 Mosaic employees have completed such training. In addition to the online training, instructor-led training is also provided to certain employees, based on their location and job responsibilities. As part of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics certification process, which is required annually of all salaried employees, employees are specifically asked to certify as to their compliance with the FCPA. SO4 Actions Taken in Response to Incidents of Corruption Mosaic has not had any incidents of corruption during the life of our company. Accordingly, we have not dismissed or disciplined any employee for corruption, nor have we declined to renew a contract with a business partner due to violations related to corruption. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 91 Public Policy SO5 Public Policy Position As one of the world’s leading crop nutrient companies, Mosaic has a responsibility to be actively engaged in the promotion of sound and sustainable public policies. We are proactive in educating government officials and staff at all levels on our company’s operations, the key issues our company faces, our company's importance to local communities and the critical role we play in the world's food supply. Mosaic supports elected officials who are supportive of Mosaic's mission and share our views on important issues, such as maintaining a strong American manufacturing and mining base, recognizing the importance of crop nutrients in maintaining domestic food security, and supporting reasonable science-based regulation with responsible environmental stewardship. Our primary public policy activities this reporting period have focused on: • Water quality. We continue to advocate in the United States for science-based policies that are protective of precious water resources in the communities in which we live and operate, while also allowing for the continued growth of job-creating businesses and the local and regional economies. Specifically, Mosaic supported the legislative and administrative codification of the landmark agreement between the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that details how numeric nutrient criteria water quality standards will be implemented in Florida – standards that are the strongest and most comprehensive in the nation. In addition, we have filed comments with EPA on proposed regulations for water quality standards that would pose burdens on our ability to obtain mining permits. • Taxes. We have advocated in the United States for the passage of state and federal tax policies that encourage the continued viability of the manufacturing sector, including the passage of a Florida manufacturing-related sales tax and corporate income tax that allows companies to make significant capital investments without incurring additional tax burdens. In Canada, we have advocated for a resource-based tax structure that allows us to be competitive within the global potash industry. We have also received tax reductions through the recognition of our capital expansion plans in the province of Saskatchewan. • Electricity cogeneration from waste heat. It is Mosaic’s belief that the generation of electrical energy from cogeneration sources should be considered a renewable energy source. We have advocated in the United States for comprehensive, rational renewable energy and tax policies that would incentivize and expand the generation and use of existing, low-cost renewables— such as non-GHG-emitting waste heat electricity generated from industrial operations—and promote fairer pricing for third-party renewable producers when selling power to the electrical grid. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 92 • Transportation infrastructure investment. We have advocated in the United States for investment in transportation infrastructure, particularly at the Port of Tampa in Florida and in the Central Florida region. • Growth/land use. We have advocated in the United States for balanced growth and land use policies that would maintain and ensure the continued extensive local, state and federal reviews of our mining activities, while streamlining areas that have become unnecessarily redundant and costly. • Mine Safety & Health. Mosaic is committed to conducting all business activities in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and communities. We have advocated for policies that recognize the latest technological advancements for the protection of our miners. • International Trade. As a company that sells its products around the world, Mosaic continues to advocate for policies that promote free and fair trade. Fertilizer companies are currently placed at a major disadvantage in the European market due to the high tariff rates of 6.5% that are imposed on U.S. produced fertilizer products. As the United States and Europe negotiate a Free Trade Agreement, we have urged officials to level the playing field for U.S. companies that export to the EU by eliminating these unfair import duties currently placed on our industry. SO6 Value of Financial and In-Kind Contributions to Political Parties, Politicians and Related Institutions by Country Amounts are reported based on when Mosaic wrote the check, which in some cases may be in a different fiscal year than when the check was delivered and reported by the receiving candidate or organization. Contribution levels vary in accordance with election cycles in local and regional communities where we operate. Political Contributions ($ U.S.) CY 2010 CY 2011 FY 2012 CY 2013 U.S. $174,500 $146,250 $350,500 $195,423 Canada $7,500 $42,000 $4,000 $5,800 Note: U.S. political contributions include both “hard” and “soft” money donations, with contributions made from Mosaic PAC included in the U.S. total. Anti-Competitive Behavior SO7 Legal Actions for Anti-competitive Behavior, Antitrust, and Monopoly Practices The settlement of a civil lawsuit filed in 2008 was approved by the court in 2013. The suit against Mosaic and other potash companies alleged that the defendants conspired to fix prices of potash sold in the © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 93 United States. The settlement was made to avoid the expense and uncertainty associated with such litigation, and as part of the settlement Mosaic expressly denied any wrongdoing. Compliance SO8 Significant Fines and Total Sanctions for Noncompliance With Laws and Regulations not Covered by EN28 and PR9 In 2013, Mosaic did not have any fines or non-monetary sanctions other than as described in EN28 or PR9. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 94 Product Responsibility Material Stewardship MM11 Programs and Progress Relating to Materials Stewardship Mosaic has established programs that address materials stewardship elements. Most recently, Mosaic participated in the certification process for the International Fertilizer Association’s (IFA) Protect & Sustain Product Stewardship program, beginning with a single production facility. Mosaic received the Product Steward Excellence rating and is addressing improvement recommendation items identified by the third-party assessor, specifically tying together existing risk assessments and closing gaps to assemble a risk assessment across the products/materials life-cycle. This assessment covered communications, EHS reviews, and collaboration with regulators, NGOs, trade associations, researchers, and business partners to address EHS, security, efficiency and sustainable practices. Communications are directed up and down the value chain, such as Supplier Certification requirements as part of sourcing and procurement of inputs, (Material) Safety Data Sheets (M/SDS), labels, registrations, quality/traceability information, training and educational materials. Mosaic’s R&D processes include internal and external research and science-based data generation to advance product advocacy and customer results. Finally, process improvements include ISO 14001/OHSAS 18001 certification and EHS management system (EHSMS) processes, enterprise mechanical integrity programs and contractor accountability programs. Mosaic’s phosphate is among the most responsibly sourced in the world, and we're committed to the sustainable production and use of our products. Crop nutrients must be applied sustainably to mitigate potentially negative environmental impacts stemming from improper use. Among industry organizations to which we belong and the farmers who use our products, we encourage the adoption of the 4Rs of nutrient stewardship: Right source, Right rate, Right time and Right place. Customer Health and Safety PR1 Life-Cycle Stages in Which Health and Safety Impacts of Products and Services Are Assessed for Improvement Mosaic’s principal products are crop nutrients that we continually evaluate and monitor for quality, effectiveness and compliance. Our quality policy states that our intent is to lead the industry in delivering a superior quality experience for our customers, stakeholders, neighbors and environment. Mosaic is committed to supplying high-quality products that meet or exceed customer expectations. Our © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 95 process for developing such products is driven by sharing best practices, innovation and partnering with our customers to excel in the global marketplace. Mosaic’s Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) policy stresses commitment to protect the environment and health and safety of employees, contractors, customers, and communities as we conduct our business activities. It is manifested in multifaceted risk identification and reduction/elimination processes. As our business activities traverse the product life cycle – from sourcing and R&D to manufacturing, supply-chain, and point-of-use advising – these health and safety practices also apply the product life-cycle. Mosaic complies with industry standards and regulations issued by various nongovernmental and governmental organizations that set policies and standards. Mosaic ensures that our products are continuously monitored to ensure regulatory compliance and are reviewed for health and safety impacts to identify opportunities for improvement. Mosaic promotes use of TFI’s Bulk Blend Manual and Bulk Blend Workshops that include health, safety and environmental educational segments. The Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO) is a body representing state fertilizer control officials; Mosaic complies with their policies and programs regarding proper labeling, health, safety and environmental communication to users. Mosaic facilities meet Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) certifications. C-TPAT improves overall international supply chain and U.S. border security, and is widely recognized as one of the most effective means of providing the highest level of cargo security. Based on the United Nations Globally Harmonized System for Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (UN GHS), we certify that our internationally shipped products are not harmful to the marine environment (non-HME) as recognized by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. Mosaic’s animal feed ingredients require a heightened level of attention to health and safety. We have adopted a relevant stringent product safety policy. It is Mosaic’s policy that our products be manufactured, stored and delivered to our customers in a manner complying with all applicable regulatory programs and industry best practices. In addition, Mosaic complies with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulation 21 CFR 589.2000, “Animal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed,” to protect the feed and animal industries as well as consumers. Our Animal Feed monitoring programs are based on principles of Quality Assurance Management using Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP) and meet United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), FDA and state regulations. These principles assure production, management, handling and delivery of our products to minimize tampering or other actions impacting their quality and safety. Our warehouses and production facilities handling animal feeds are certified Safe Feed/Safe Food by the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA). New product development follows the Stage-Gate® Business System Product Innovation System process. Mosaic has customized the system to include specific EHS review prompts for innovators to engage with EHS professionals as the project progresses and to include future life-cycle stages in these reviews. We currently have over 20 potential products in various stages of this process. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved. Page 96 Mosaic has implemented an EHS Management System (EHSMS), specifically focused at the manufacturing stage of the life cycle, but whose benefits extend across activities for all life cycle stages. As examples, Mosaic’s supplier certification and chemical review and data management processes assure inputs and raw materials are evaluated for health and safety impacts for our customers as well as Mosaic employees and the environment. Mosaic self-audits for EHS elements across its business activities and is assessed by various third parties. Mosaic received International Fertilizer Association (IFA) Product Steward Excellence rating at its inaugural site evaluation. These include systems to maintain integrity and provide for recovery of intermediates and products for their successful reprocessing, reuse or recycling. As well, these practices and assessments address proper disposal. PR2 Incidents of Noncompliance With Regulations and Voluntary Codes Concerning the Health and Safety Impacts of Products and Services During Their Life Cycles Mosaic has automated systems to manage, track and monitor incidents related to the health and safety impacts of products and services. Mosaic had no significant reported incidents of noncompliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of our products and services. Product and Service Labeling PR3 Product and Service Information Required Mosaic sells and distributes fertilizer, animal feed and industrial products in many countries around the world. Mosaic complies with all safety, environmental, labeling and registration requirements of the local governments. In addition, where U.S. standards are more stringent, we follow those more rigorous standards on the products that we produce both in the United States and for export. Mosaic provides the required country, state and local product documentation for all shipments. This includes detailed labels, data specification sheets and a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for all products. These documents provide information about proper product handling, safety precautions and guaranteed analysis. Situations requiring disposal are also addressed in the SDS. For product undergoing vessel transport, the SDS includes certification that the discharge of cargo hold rinsate is not harmful to the marine environment. Though not addressed in typical labeling, Mosaic promotes customer education following the 4R principles of Nutrient Stewardship (4Rs): the Right product, applied at the Right rate, at the Right time and at the Right place. Mosaic agronomists share this message worldwide. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved.

Mosaic had no significant incidents of noncompliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning labeling of our products and material services. PR5 Practices Related to Customer Satisfaction, Including Results of Surveys Measuring Customer Satisfaction At Mosaic, customer satisfaction and loyalty are paramount to sustaining and growing our world-class organization. On an annual basis, we adhere to a trusted feedback methodology to measure satisfaction levels of our crop nutrition, animal feed and industrial businesses. This global feedback system also allows us to monitor recent performance and to identify which performance factors likely have the biggest impact on customer loyalty, either positively or negatively. We use the same methodology to better understand customer satisfaction throughout Mosaic’s global operations. The survey results are shared with our customer service team, as well as with our key customers around the world. In 2013, Mosaic earned a score of 8 on a scale of 0 to 10. This score is described as “Quite Satisfied.” Our key customer loyalty metric – Net Promoter Score (NPS) – is a standard index across a variety of industries around the world. We use this metric to benchmark our results against others’, allowing us to identify and target areas that are opportunities for improvement. Year over year, we work to improve our performance by providing quality products and ensuring on-time delivery and logistical support. In 2013, Mosaic earned an NPS score of almost 50%. A 50% score is widely considered to be the threshold NPS for high performing companies. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company. All rights reserved.

Page 100 Labor Employment As of December 31, 2013, Mosaic employed 8,402 regular employees. Mosaic aims to be the employer of choice for a diverse and inclusive workforce. This includes the representation of women, which can be challenging in the agriculture and mining industries. Our global philosophy is to provide competitive compensation and benefits, with flexibility to choose programs that best meet our employees’ needs. Mosaic provides health, welfare and retirement benefits to all full-time employees and eligible dependents. We attract employees through methods including, but not limited to, job boards, social media, diversity career fairs, veterans career fairs and college job fairs. In addition to our regular workforce, individual business units retain contract workers and interns. Our robust student hiring programs provide a work opportunity to summer, co-op and intern students in Canada, the United States, Argentina and Brazil. Individual business units track contract workers by hours worked and in compliance with relevant local legislation, but additional data aggregation and demographic analysis is not currently possible at the group level. © Copyright 2014.

Page 104 LA15 Return-to-Work and Retention Rates After Parental Leave, by Gender Parental leave is offered to employees in North America, South America and Asia. As parental leaves vary in accordance with local laws and customs across the regions where we operate, Mosaic is unable to track retention rates of employees returning from parental leave. For example, in the United States, parental leave is undistinguished from broader reporting on the Family and Medical Leave Act, as well as state laws. Labor/Management Relations Mosaic values collective bargaining as an important form of collaborative employee engagement. In addition, Mosaic is sensitive to the needs of its employees, and much consideration is placed on applicable notice periods for any such changes that may impact employees. Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining is respected in all of Mosaic’s operations per our Commitment to Human Rights, which is guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the most widely recognized definition of human rights and the responsibilities of national governments; the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

In the United States, we adhere to federal and state WARN (The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) laws that requires a 60-day notification of plant closings and mass layoffs. We provide the minimum notice required, which varies by local legislation and collective bargaining agreements in the regions where we operate. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company.

Page 105 MM4Number of Strikes and Lockouts Exceeding One Week’s Duration, by Country Mosaic has not been subject to organized labor actions, including strikes or lockouts of any duration, at any of its locations in the 2013 reporting period.

Occupational Health and Safety LA7 Rates of Injury, Occupational Diseases, Lost Days and Absenteeism, and Total Number of Work-Related Fatalities, by Regions and by Gender There were no work-related fatalities at Mosaic in 2013. Mosaic follows U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards to calculate recordable injury frequency rates (RIFR) on a global basis. An OSHA recordable injury is an occupational injury or illness that requires medical treatment that is more than simple first aid. Lost day frequency rate (LDFR) calculates the frequency rate of calendar days lost. Lost days begin the day after the lost time occurs and calendar days are counted, with no exception for weekends, holidays, vacation or scheduled time off. Twelve Mosaic facilities have received ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System) and OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management System) certification. The Mosaic Environmental, Health and Safety Management System will ultimately be implemented at all material Mosaic operations worldwide.

While our processes ensure Mosaic’s compensation is competitive and equitable, we also take steps to understand how our employees perceive their pay. In three consecutive bi-annual engagement surveys – administered globally to all Mosaic employees – we asked for responses to the following statement: I am paid fairly for the contributions I make to the company’s success. Both women and men have continued to respond favorably to this question, with 56% and 55%, respectively, either strongly agreeing or agreeing. © Copyright 2014. The Mosaic Company.
