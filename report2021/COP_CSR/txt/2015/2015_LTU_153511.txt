Comparison of incomes of the company The Company‘s net result for 2014 is a profit of LTL 206 thousand (2013: loss of LTL 6.240 thousand). Income from sales, other activities and financial activities for 2014 is LTL 147,687 thous., which has increased by 23.7% as compared with income for 2013. Cost of sales, other activities and financial activities increased by 17.4% up to LTL 147.481 thousand.

UAB “VILNIAUS VANDENYS” ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED AT 31 DECEMBER 2014 Figure 2. Structure of costs in 2014 The National Commission for Energy Control and Prices publishes average work efficiency (intensity) coefficients for water management companies. The work efficiency (intensity) indicates the ratio between the normative staff number (determined on the basis of technical capacities: network length, number of pumps and pumping stations, capacities of waste water treatment plants, quantities of meters) and the actual staff number. The larger the ratio, the higher the work efficiency at the company. A comparison of the efficiency coefficients shows that the average efficiency of employees of UAB “Vilniaus vandenys” is higher than that of other water management companies in terms of both core operations and sales: the number of staff operating the facilities is, on average, smaller than at other companies. In addition, a single administration employee is in charge of 14 normative staff members engaged in core operations, compared with 12 normative staff members at other companies. Figure 3. Comparison between the work efficiency at UAB “Vilniaus vandenys” and at other major companies WATER SUPPLY The service of water supply to each customer is considered to be a major and vital service: the water is supplied continuously, irrespective of weather conditions, season, or time of the day. Drinking water is supplied from deep wells – such water is considered to be the one of the highest quality. UAB “VILNIAUS VANDENYS” ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED AT 31 DECEMBER 2014 Figure 4. Water supply quantities in 2014 The Company operates 16 water supply areas: Vilnius City, N. Vilnia, Grigiškės, Trakų Vokė, Kalnėnai, Salininkai, Daniliškės, Naujieji Verkiai, Nemenčinė, Kabiškės, Kreivalaužiai, Gėla, Švenčionys, Švenčionėliai, Šalčininkai and Eišiškės. In these areas the Company operates 32 wellfields, 115 pumping stations, 1649.2 km of water supply lines, 16 water treatment facilities, 524 water extraction hydrants and 4919 fire hydrants. In 2014, the reconstruction of Bukčiai pumping station was completed, water purification facilities were built, part of the water supply and sewage networks as well as water supply wells were rehabilitated. In addition, water purification facilities were installed in Salininkai and Daniliškės. Upon commissioning of the water purification facilities, the excess amount of iron is removed and the manganese content is reduced twice, therefore, more than 100 thousand residents of Bukčiai, Lazdynai, Lazdynėliai, Karoliniškės, Pilaitė, Salininkai and Daniliškės receive water of better quality. The Buivydiškės settlement was connected to the centralised water supply network of Vilnius City, and consumers residing at the settlement are supplied with water from Bukčiai waster supply station. In order to minimize water losses, status of the water supply system, supply pressures and flow rates as well as water level of clean water tanks are monitored at various points of the system. In 2014, the Company rectified 1012 water supply accidents. Figure 5. Number of accidents in the water supply network in 2014 WASTE WATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT Waste water collection and treatment are very important activities in terms of the protection of the environment and the sparing use of the groundwater resources. The Company operates 10 waste water systems, namely, systems of Vilnius City, Nemenčinė, Kabiškės, Kreivalaužiai, Gėla, Švenčionys, Švenčionėliai, Pabradė, Šalčininkai and Eišiškės. The waste water is collected and transported to the waste water treatment facilities by 1123 km of waste water networks and manifolds, 159.6 km of pressure lines and 160 waste water pumping stations. UAB “VILNIAUS VANDENYS” ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED AT 31 DECEMBER 2014 Figure 6. Quantity of treated waste water, million m3/year The Company operates 8 waste water plants, namely, plants of Vilnius City, Švenčionys, Švenčionėliai, Pabradė, Nemenčinė, Gėla, Šalčininkai and Eišiškės. At all waste water treatment plants, the indicators of waste water after treatment are in compliance with the environmental regulations. The waste water is treated to a very high degree before discharging it into the Neris River. In 2014, a modern skimmed matter and sand catching system has been installed at the Nemenčinė Waste Water Treatment Plant and a technology for removing nitrogen and phosphorus compounds is being installed, which allows to treat waste water to a very high degree before discharging it into the Neris River. In 2014, a hangar was built on one of the aeration ducts of the Švenčionys Waste Water Treatment Plant. The hangar, designed for preventing the aeration duct from freezing, has also improved the working conditions for the staff. Small waste water treatment plants in Salininkai, Daniliškės and Buivydiškės were taken out of operation; the waste water from these residential areas is collected to the central sewage network of Vilnius City and then delivered to the Vilnius Waste Water Treatment Plant. In 2014, the Company rectified 3,238 failures, breakdowns and blockings in the sewage network. Figure 7. Number of failures in the sewage network in 2014 FLEET OF VEHICLES In 2014, the Company’s fleet of vehicles and mechanisms consisted of 191 items (cars, vans, specialpurpose vehicles, tractors, excavators, front loaders). The Company purchased 29 new vehicles thus modernising its fleet by 15.2%. Some of the replaced items of equipment were 10 years old or older. Special-purpose sewerage cleaning vehicles 2 hydrodynamic vehicles for flushing of sewerage systems 1 sewage vehicle for the cleaning of sewerage pits and chambers Vehicles for transportation of staff and equipment 14 vans 6 cars with multi-purpose bodies 4 cross-country vehicles UAB “VILNIAUS VANDENYS” ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED AT 31 DECEMBER 2014 1 truck with manipulator 1 car with 9 seats Table 3. List of vehicles acquired in 2014 INFORMATION SYSTEMS UAB “Vilniaus vandenys” places a special emphasis on technological innovation in order to be a modern and innovative company that aims at increase the efficiency of its operations. In 2014, the Company successfully completed one of the most important projects – preparation for the introduction of new currency Euro. The currency change process was smooth and now all accounting, sales and human resources applications are based on two currencies. UAB “Vilniaus vandenys” was the first in Vilnius City to start the digitalization of the manhole cards and the transfer of their information to GIS (Geographic Information System). The card information provides the data on the Company’s assets and their configuration. Prior to this, the information was provided in hardcopy format only and was stored in the Vilnius City Archives. All the facilities remotely managed by the Company have been joined into a single data and video transmission network operating on the MPLS technology basis. The solution ensures stability and reliability of all operations; the standardisation enabled unification of all the facilities resulting in reduction of support and maintenance costs. A video monitoring and back-up system covering all the Company‘s facilities has been installed. A common printing, copying and scanning service has been implemented at the Company. Now all the printing, copying and scanning jobs are managed centrally and analysed in order to enable optimisation of the costs. Already after the first six months of use of the service the Company directly benefited from the decrease of costs of the related operations by more than a half. Additional, non-material benefits include the free choice of printers, text recognition of scanned documents, and safe printing of confidential information. A digitalisation of the archived client files has been started, which enables an easier and faster access to the required information for a larger number of users, at the same time saving both working time (searching for documents in the archives) and materials (paper, copying materials). A new mobile system for the management of controlling staff‘s work has been implemented. It enables to record almost all the information related to the tasks including attachment of the relevant photographs, information on the task localisation, entry of billing data, and real-time transmission of required data. A new corporate document and task management system has been developed. In order to increase both mobility and flexibility of work, the Company decided to use Office 365 service. The service offers wide opportunities for effective communication and collaboration, improved licence management mechanism, increased flexibility of work, and optimal use of funds. Upon implementation to this service, infrastructure costs have been reduced and additional indirect benefits have been obtained (unlimited storage capacity, a better data security, versioning, sharing opportunities, prevention of information disclosure, video storage, news groups). CUSTOMER SERVICE In 2014, the Company aimed at its one of the major goals, i. e. to provide high quality services, which meet customer needs. The main task during the year was to prepare for and adapt all operations to the new currency Euro. In 2014, the total number of subscribers and customers was over 260 thousand, including over 253 thousand of private customers. During the year over 12 thousand new service supply agreements have been concluded with subscribers and customers. In 2014, the Company received over 54 thousand requests, applications and complaints from subscribers and other consumers. The Customer Service Centre received, on average, about 3000 daily visits of interested people. In 2014, over 135 thousand customers have contacted the Call Centre (11,300 calls per month on average). The questions mainly included requests to explain customer debts, update meter readings, and check water metering devices. Compared with 2013, the number of calls has increased by more than 50%. The increase was mainly due to the change in the service prices in May 2014 and the introduction of the Euro. The company is encouraging its subscribers and customers to register at the online self-service portal, which allows to quickly receive required information of payable amounts, debts and overpayments and enables to UAB “VILNIAUS VANDENYS” ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED AT 31 DECEMBER 2014 reduce the volumes of paper bills and payment notices. In 2014, 3,290 subscribers (2013: 2,870) and 38,260 customers (2013: 28,186) were using the self-service portal (which is over 30% increase). In 2014, over 32,000 water meters were replaced for subscribers and customers (i. e. over 10,000 more than in 2013). This work will be continued in 2015. The following initiatives were launched/completed in 2014:  Implementation of a new accounting system has been started.  Restrictions were started to be imposed on subscribers and customers that had temporary agreements with the Company, i. e. the diameter of the inlet meter was limited to 15 cm, which allows to exercise stricter control over the timely commissioning of water supply and sewerage networks by customers.  An external service provider was hired for the replacement of water meters in flats and this has speeded up the replacement process. It is estimated that within the next 5 years all the meters installed in flats will have passed the metrologic inspection.  The readings from the meter inspections are sent to the accounting program via a mobile application, which saves human resources and time costs related to the readings entry. INVESTMENTS AND PROJECTS BEING IMPLEMENTED Each year the Company invests into development and modernisation of its assets in order to ensure that the water supply and waste water treatment services meet requirements on quality, environmental and health protection. In 2014, UAB “Vilniaus vandenys” continued a number of infrastructure modernisation and development projects, co-funded by the EU Cohesion Fund. The amount of completed works totalled LTL 33.847 thousand (excluding VAT). Figure 8.
