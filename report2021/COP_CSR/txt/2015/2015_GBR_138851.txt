Although underlying proﬁt would ordinarily exclude the cost of any regulatory ﬁnes, for the purposes of the scorecard, such ﬁnes would be fully taken into account the actual level of performance achieved. 3.

In addition, the Committee has the discretion to take into The Committee will review the scorecard annually and may vary the measures, weightings and targets each year. account at the end of the performance period any changes in regulatory capital and risk-weighted asset requirements that might have been announced and implemented after the start of the performance period At the end of the year the Committee will follow a three-step process: 1. Consider eligibility for TVC Conﬁrmation that the Group’s ﬁnancial performance has been achieved within the Group’s risk appetite and the forward-looking capital position, and therefore nothing prevents TVC awards being made. In addition, each executive director had achieved a minimum standard in terms of living the Group’s values. 2. Evaluate performance against the Group’s priorities If each of the scorecard targets are met, then, subject to any further adjustment, 50 per cent of the maximum TVC would be the outcome. If performance is below target for any of the measures, the Committee will use its judgement to determine an amount below 50 per cent of the maximum. Superior performance (that is, in excess of the target) of any of the measures may receive a payout above 50 per cent. Retrospective disclosure of its assessment of annual performance against both the ﬁnancial measures and other strategic priorities will be made, together with any overriding discretion exercised by the Committee. 3. Assess personal performance and ﬁnalise TVC for each executive director The payout under the Group scorecard can be adjusted by the Committee positively and negatively for an individual director’s performance and for factors such as the risk and control environment in an individual director’s area of responsibility. Taking into account the combination of the initial scorecard and the long-term performance conditions, 75 per cent of TVC will be linked to ﬁnancial or shareholder-return performance measures and 50 per cent of TVC will be subject to a double hurdle of annual scorecard measures and long-term performance conditions. 178 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2014 179 Directors’ remuneration report 2014 report on remuneration The long-term performance conditions for the 2014 TVC awards How much is being awarded in TVC this year? Details on the long-term performance conditions for awards to be made in 2015 in respect of 2014 performance 2014 total variable compensation Given the ﬁnancial performance for 2014 and the refreshed ﬁnancial priorities for the next three years, the Committee determined Determining 2014 TVC it would be appropriate to review the target levels of performance for the performance share awards alongside setting the targets for the new underpin share awards. The Committee views the determination of TVC in a holistic way, reviewing a number of factors (both ﬁnancial and strategic) to determine an appropriate Group TVC. The current intention of the Committee is that the measures for awards in 2016 will be similar to those awards to be granted in 2015. However, the Committee will review the measures and targets again in advance of making awards in 2016 in respect of 2015 An automatic risk adjustment is applied in determining Group TVC. This is calculated by using a risk-adjusted, proﬁt-based funding performance, including an assessment against continued alignment with the Group’s priorities. mechanism (known as risk capital adjusted proﬁt or RCAP). The Committee then quantiﬁes other adjustments for speciﬁc risk and control matters that are not already taken into account through automatic risk adjustment. In 2014, this included consideration of Performance share awards the cost of the settlements with the US authorities¹, in addition to the automatic risk adjustment. For awards in respect of 2014 performance, the Committee concluded that the current performance measures (earnings per share The Committee also exercises its judgement to ensure that the overall payout appropriately balances Group performance, and any (EPS) growth, RoRWA and relative total shareholder return (TSR)) continue to provide a balanced set of metrics with an equal other factors, such as return to investors, the strength of the Group’s forward-looking capital position, performance relative to peers, weighting between performance, investor interests and prudent risk-taking. There will therefore be no change to the measures investors’ views, political sentiment on compensation, and regulatory requirements. or weightings. In recent years the Committee has progressively reduced the share of proﬁts paid in TVC. Between 2010 and 2013 Group TVC The target levels for performance share awards are designed to be challenging but realistic. The Committee’s starting point for fell 20 per cent, compared to a reduction in proﬁt of less than 1 per cent. Competitors in the Group’s markets have continued determining target levels was to review the ﬁnancial plan and the Group’s priorities. The Committee then considered the ability to pay aggressively for scarce talent. This has created signiﬁcant competitive pressures in some of the Group’s key markets: of any targets to incentivise executive directors to get back to improved returns. Clearly, in the context of current performance, the annualised voluntary attrition rate continued to be high in 2014, particularly at more junior levels. The Committee is mindful combined with the impact of risk-weighted asset (RWA) model changes, the starting point for returns is now lower. of the external sentiment in some markets on bankers’ pay, and is particularly conscious of the Group’s disappointing ﬁnancial performance, but it operates in a competitive global marketplace for talent. This requires the Committee to make, and justify, The RoRWA target has therefore been changed to ensure it remains stretching yet realistic over the next three years.

It is represented as a percentage of the face value. Face value is the monetary value of the award at the date of award. In the 2014 Directors’ remuneration report, unless speciﬁcally noted, all disclosures are on a face value basis.

Variable compensation for Code Staff is structured in line with the PRA’s Remuneration Code requirements. For the 2014 performance period, employees who are not directors will see between 40 and 60 per cent of their TVC deferred over a period of up to ﬁve years. Non-deferred TVC will be delivered 50 per cent in upfront shares and 50 per cent in cash. Deferred TVC is delivered entirely in shares unless an eligible employee elects for 50 per cent of their deferred award to be delivered as deferred cash. TVC awards are subject to the Group’s claw-back policy. Deferred TVC (cash and shares) is subject to continued employment (which may be terminated by the Group in the event of material misconduct). Both upfront and deferred shares are subject to the Group’s shareholding and retention requirements.

Price veriﬁcation uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market in which the instrument is traded. To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence, relevance, reliability, availability of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pricing provider are taken into consideration. Formal committees for the business clusters, consisting of representatives from Group Market Risk, Product Control, Valuation Control and the Business meet monthly to discuss and approve the valuations of the inventory. The Principal Finance Valuation Committee meetings are held on a quarterly basis. The business cluster valuation committees fall under the Valuation Benchmarks Committee as part of the valuation governance structure. Valuation hierarchy Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classiﬁed into three levels according to the observability of the signiﬁcant inputs used to determine the fair values. 256 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2014 257 Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 15.

There have Bid-offer valuation adjustments been no signiﬁcant changes to valuation or levelling approaches in 2013. Where market parameters are marked on a mid-market basis in the revaluation systems, a bid-offer valuation adjustment is required to quantify the expected cost of neutralising the Business’ positions through dealing away in the market, thereby bringing long positions to bid and short Valuation techniques positions to offer. The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves netting between long and short Loans and advances positions and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy. Where long positions are marked to bid and short positions These include loans in the global syndications underwriting book which are not syndicated yet. These loans are generally bilateral in nature and marked to offer in the systems, for example for cash securities, no bid offer valuation adjustments are required. their valuation is primarily based on recent trades or proxies, such as comparable loans with similar credit grade, sector, etc. Products are classiﬁed as Level 2 in cases where observable credit spreads applicable to those products are available. Where there are no recent transactions Credit adjustments and reliable comparable loans to proxy from, the valuation of these loans is based on unobservable inputs resulting in them being classiﬁed as The Group makes a credit adjustment (CA) against derivative products. CA is an estimate of the adjustment to fair value to account for the Level 3. possibility that the counterparty may default and the Group would not receive the full market value of the transactions. Advanced internal ratings-based approach (AIRB) models are used to calculate the probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) which, together with Debt securities – asset backed securities the results of the exposure simulation engine, generates a view of expected losses. Collateral positions are taken into account for the calculation Due to the lack of liquidity in the market and the prolonged period of time under which many securities have not traded, obtaining external prices of CA. is not a strong enough measure to determine whether an asset has an observable price or not. Therefore, once external pricing has been veriﬁed, an assessment is made whether each security is traded with signiﬁcant liquidity based on its credit rating and sector. If a security is of high credit Own credit adjustments rating and is traded in a liquid sector, it will be classiﬁed as Level 2, otherwise it will be classiﬁed as Level 3.

The Group’s own credit adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit These securities are also classiﬁed as Level 3. standing improves. The Group’s own credit adjustments will reverse over time as its liabilities mature. Other debt securities For derivative liabilities, an own credit adjustment is determined by applying the Group’s PD to the Group’s negative expected exposure against These debt securities include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes. Where quoted prices are available through pricing the counterparty. The Group’s PD and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on internally assessed credit ratings and market vendors, brokers or observable trading activities from liquid markets, these are classiﬁed as Level 2. Where there are signiﬁcant valuation inputs standard recovery levels. The expected exposure is modelled based on simulation methodology and is generated through simulation of which are unobservable in the market, due to illiquid trading or the complexity of the product, these are classiﬁed as Level 3.

Equity shares – Private Equity For issued debt and structured notes designated at fair value, an own credit adjustment is determined by discounting the contractual cash ﬂows Financial statements The majority of private equity investments are valued based on earning multiples – price-to-earnings (P/E) or enterprise value to earning before using a yield curve adjusted for market observed secondary senior debt issuance spreads above average interbank rates. income tax, depreciation and amortisation (EV/EBITDA) ratios – of comparable listed companies. The two primary inputs for the valuation of these Model valuation adjustments investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies. In Valuation models may have pricing deﬁciencies or limitations that require a valuation adjustment. These pricing deﬁciencies or limitations arise circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced due to the choice, implementation and calibration of the pricing model. and notes from reliable external sources, alternate valuation techniques (for example, discounted cash ﬂow models), which use predominantly unobservable inputs or Level 3 inputs, may be applied. Even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from third-party Funding valuation adjustments sources (for example, Bloomberg), and those inputs can be deemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments (excluding those where observable In general, uncollateralised derivatives are discounted on the assumption that the Group is able to fund at Libor.

The percentage shift is determined 1. The ranges of values shown in the above table represent the highest and lowest levels used in the valuation of the Group’s Level 3 ﬁnancial instruments as at 31 December by statistical analysis performed on a set of reference prices, which included certain equity indices, credit indices and volatility indices, based on 2014. The ranges of values used are reﬂective of the underlying characteristics of these Level 3 ﬁnancial instruments based on the market conditions at the balance sheet date. However, these ranges of values may not represent the uncertainty in fair value measurements of the Group’s Level 3 ﬁnancial instruments the composition of our Level 3 assets. Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the 2. Weighted average for non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments have been calculated by weighting inputs by the relative fair value.

An increase in EV/EBITDA multiple in isolation will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted ﬁrm. P/E and price to book (P/B) multiples P/E multiple is the ratio of the market capitalisation to the net income after tax. P/B multiple is the ratio of the market capitalisation to the book value. The multiples are determined from multiples of listed comparables, which are observable. An increase in P/E multiple or P/B multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted ﬁrm. Yield Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash ﬂows in a discounted cash ﬂow model. Correlation Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable inﬂuences the movement in another variable. Credit correlation generally refers to the factor that describes the relationship between the probability of individual entities to default on obligations and the joint probability of multiple entities to default on obligations. Similarly, equity correlation is the correlation between two equity instruments. An interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates. Foreign exchange correlation represents the correlation between two different exchange rates. Liquidity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments A liquidity discount is primarily applied to the valuation of unlisted investments to reﬂect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded. An increase in liquidity discount in isolation will result in unfavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted ﬁrm. 264 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2014 265 Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 15.
