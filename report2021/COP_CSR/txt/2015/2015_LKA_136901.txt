Cargills (Ceylon) PLC / 97 / The Annual Report 2013-2014 Notes to the Financial Statements contd. The Gratuity liability is based on the actuarial valuation carried out by Mr. M. Poopalanathan, AIA, Messrs. Actuarial and Management Consultants (Private) Limited, a firm of professional actuaries, as at 31 March 2014. The principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were as follows: 2014 2013 % % 1. Discount rate (the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows in order to determine the present value) 10.5 11 2. Future salary increase Executives 7 10 Staff 7 10 In addition to the above, demographic assumptions such as mortality, withdrawal and disability, and retirement age were considered for the actuarial valuation. “A 67/70 mortality table” issued by the Institute of Actuaries, London was used to estimate the gratuity liability of the company. Sensitivity of assumptions used If a one percentage point change in the assumed discount rate would have the following effects: 2014 Group Company Rs.'000 Rs.'000 Discount Future salary Discount Future salary rate increment rate rate increment rate Increase in one percentage point (21,974) 27,257 (15,263) 18,983 Decrease in one percentage point 24,955 (24,337) 17,362 (16,929) 27.
