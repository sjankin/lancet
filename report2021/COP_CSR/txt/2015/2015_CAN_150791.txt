This makes the CSeries aircraft family the perfect fit for China, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. RIGHT PARTNERS Working with the right partners is essential to compete in markets across the globe. In China, for example, more than 4,000 employees work at our seven joint ventures and seven wholly foreign owned enterprises. These wholly foreign owned enterprises will help increase our revenues in the Chinese market for urban and airport transportation and subsequently help us establish a low-cost production site for export activities. We develop customized technologies and products with our Chinese partners to ensure they meet local needs and requirements. At the beginning of 2015, we entered into a joint venture with the New United Group (NUG). activity report 2014 > PAGE 41 RIGHT STRUCTURE aircraft customers, we opened four RIGHT SUPPLIERS new support facilities in 2014, three of Our reorganization puts in place the right which were in non-traditional markets: Despite recent progress, it can be a structure to maximize profitable growth.

BOMBARDIER INC. > PAGE 42 RIGHT ENGAGEMENT Part of working in a community is supporting that community. This is equally important to us in our traditional and non-traditional markets. We aim to support local needs and contribute our expertise to help grow the economy everywhere we operate. In 2014, we contributed more than $8 million in donations and sponsorships to our local communities worldwide, the majority of which was aligned with our 3E strategy. Focusing on Education, Environment and Entrepreneurship, this approach enables us to take full advantage of our core competencies and business activities. HOW WE ENGAGE North America Passion from Within: Bombardier launched Passion from Within in 2013 to give employees worldwide the opportunity to share their passion for aviation and knowledge with elementary school children. In the first year of the program more than 100 employees participated reaching more than 2,400 children. The information was also shared with other aerospace companies to increase our impact. We are working with Aéro Montréal in Canada to expand these efforts to high school students with the launch of Passion for Flight in 2015. No.9 Imagining My Sustainable City: We support Toronto-based No.9’s Imagining My Sustainable City program in Canada, a week-long course that teaches grade seven students about eco-design, renewable energy, energy conservation, waste and water management and sustainable transportation. Europe Huerdenspringer+ Mentoring Program: As part of our priority to implement skills-based volunteering projects in key markets by 2020, we launched a mentoring project in Germany in November 2014. Employees from our Berlin and Hennigsdorf sites have been trained as mentors to give advice on the work environment to teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds. Nine employees have finished the training and qualified to begin serving as mentors in February 2015. Asia-Pacific Rebuilding Schools in the Philippines: In the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, we partnered with Habitat for Humanity Philippines to rebuild three schools in the northern part of Cebu Island where one of our Finance Shared Services Centres is located. The three double-classroom buildings officially re-opened in October 2014, allowing 4,500 school children to resume classes in a safe learning environment. Africa and the Project Management Academy: Bombardier has a strong partnership with King Saud University (KSU) in Middle East Saudi Arabia and offers internships and career perspectives to the university’s graduates. Since 2012, 11 KSU graduates have enrolled in the Project Management Academy and have all since secured positions within our rail transportation business segment. We are continuing our work with KSU to explore how we can contribute to their Railway Engineering program and potentially develop a new transit system to ease congestion around the university. We also financially support the J. Armand Bombardier Foundation, which contributes to the development of local communities in our home country of Canada. Projects from the Foundation in 2014 included: National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec Foundation: The National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec Foundation holds an annual summer art camp for children ages 6 to 17 but increased demand required the institution to add a registration fee, making access difficult for low-income families. In 2014, the J. Armand Bombardier Foundation enabled 108 children from low-income homes to participate without having to pay the registration fee. Group for Research and Social Intervention (GRIS): Statistics show that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youth attempt suicide 14 times more often than heterosexual youth and that homophobic behaviours are causing grave disruptions in school classrooms. To help combat suicide and dropout rates, the Foundation made a $10,000 Cdn donation in 2014 to support the GRIS in publicly advocating for LGBT persons, especially at high schools and colleges. As a result, 1,000 young people were given access to GRIS interventions in 2014 – with testimonials from LGBT community volunteers specially trained to answer questions from youth. activity report 2014 > PAGE 43 Achieve Flawless Execution Every Step of the Way As our company evolves, In 2014, we faced execution difficulgreater standardization in our templates ties, including issues on passenger and processes to help reduce errors every aspect of our business train projects and challenges in aircraft and empower our project managers to becomes more complex from program management.

Bombardier continues to invest in innovative mobility solutions to decrease dependency on traditional fuel sources. For example, we have already begun to explore alternative fuel sources including biofuels. These investments will help decrease the impact of a potential rise in the cost of fossil fuels and help us adapt to a new energy economy. activity report 2014 > PAGE 69 INTERNAL RISKS These risks relate specifically to our internal operations and the decisions we make to respond to changing market conditions.
