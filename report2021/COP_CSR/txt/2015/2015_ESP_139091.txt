www.sanlucar.com SanLucar Progress Report 2015 United Nations Global Compact Dear Readers, When I started in the fruit and vegetables business about 30 years ago, I had no idea to where all this would lead. If someone had said that I would invest millions in environmental protection and social projects to me, I certainly would have shaken my head in disbelief. Today, this makes me extremely happy. Projects such as El Puchero, a soup kitchen for families facing difficult social circumstances, projects such as d.r.e.a.m.s., a workshop of dreams for African women or simply establishing social working conditions in our growing countries – which is unfortunately not a matter of course everywhere there – are reasons I love going to work every day. Just like with fruit and vegetables, I am just as enthused about projects growing like solar systems for sustainable energy or LightweightBox® that leads to lower emissions. You have now had a quick rundown on what moves me the most about Corporate Responsibility. For more information please visit our website and have a close look at our Sustainability Report. A revised Sustainability Report will come out in February of 2016. All the best, Stephan Rötzer 2 Progress Report (CoP) and Corresponding GRI Indicators Global Compact Principle Progress No. Principle Projects and Corresponding Initiatives Corresponding Indicators Human Rights 1 Businesses should support SanLucar stands for equal opportunities and is committed 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, and respect the protection of to equal rights for all.
