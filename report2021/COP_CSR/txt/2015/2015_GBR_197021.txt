Adel Al-Saleh Chief Executive Officer NGA Human Resources Proprietary and Confidential to NGA Human Resources Page 1 OUR COMMITMENT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY As a global business, operating in 35 countries, NGA HR is committed to sustainable growth that promotes social, economic and environmental improvement. Our aim is to conduct our business in a socially responsible way, contributing to the communities in which we operate, minimising our impact on the environment and respecting the needs of employees, clients and other stakeholders. GOVERNANCE Our corporate responsibility agenda is included within the overall framework set by the Corporate Responsibility Group (CRG). The CRG sets our Corporate Responsibility policy and strategy and is responsible for best practice across the Group. Adel Al-Saleh, our Group Chief Executive, is Executive Sponsor of the CRG. Our corporate responsibility programme is managed to ensure that corporate responsibility is embedded into day-to-day practice. SUSTAINABLE SERVICES Our services have an impact on people all over the world. In NGA we work to make organisations more efficient and effective, saving money and reducing environmental impact. Improving organisational performance is at the core of what we do – at work, at home, in school and within the community. Globally, we understand the business of HR and the role it plays within an organisation. We help our clients become better employers through smarter, more streamlined business processes to save money, manage employee life cycles and support globally-connected, agile organisations. The combination of deep HR experience and insight, advanced technology platforms and applications, and a global portfolio of flexible service delivery options is how NGA makes a measurable difference for our clients outsourcing services. We work with our clients to introduce remote and flexible working, reducing environmental impacts and improving quality of life for employees. We continue to extend our Software as a Service delivery model, reducing environmental impact and making services more readily available for our clients. Combating climate change remains integral to developing sustainable services for NGA HR’s clients. Our business continues to place a strong focus on improving our clients’ environmental performance by enabling them to access modern ‘on demand’ technologies, which enable working practices that reduce environmental footprint and generate considerable savings. Environmental sustainability is fully embedded into our service delivery methodology. We focus both on reducing the number of assets required as well as favouring energy-efficient energy consumption models. Assets are reused wherever possible and where they are beyond economical repair, they are recycled in accordance with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE). Further reductions are gained by equipping our employees with the tools and technology to enable flexible and mobile working. Proprietary and Confidential to NGA Human Resources Page 2 NGA has introduced a number of initiatives designed to reduce carbon emissions and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HR systems. These include online pay slips, recycled pay slips, self-service HR and the development of a carbon emissions calculator that enables employees to calculate their CO2 emissions for business travel. The implementation of paperless HR, by using self-service and online payslips, results in reduced environmental impact and costs for our Clients. SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT NGA HR is committed to ensuring that the products and services that we buy are sustainable. As such, we have integrated corporate social responsibility criteria into our group-wide procurement activities. Sustainability considerations are integrated across our entire procurement process in the identification of needs, evaluation of options, evaluation of tenders, and post-contract management. This approach is applied globally to all new and existing major suppliers. Together with our Legal, Finance and Compliance departments, our Procurement department has developed standards to ensure we meet NGA’s commitment to the UN Global Compact principles and work to ensure that all suppliers who wish to do business with any NGA HR Company sign up to those same standards we hold ourselves up to. This approach helps propagate the benefits and global best practices onto the workforces across our supply chain. We are continuously evaluating suppliers who might not meet those principles with the objective of bringing our entire supplier base to the same global standard. OUR PEOPLE NGA HR continues to enhance skills and increase employability in our communities through Apprenticeships, Graduate Trainee Schemes, Careers Visits, Work Experience and partnership with companies. In the UK, within the last year, the company welcomed a number of apprentices working across a range of services and clients, while gaining valuable experience in ICT / Social Media and Payroll they also gain work experience that will help them gain permanent employment with the company or other organisations. By enhancing employability through these schemes, NGA HR is addressing shortages of skilled staff, gender issues and supply chain issues, creating a skilled future workforce that will benefit the growth of the IT sector. Every employee is encouraged to do something, however small, to help deliver value and build sustainable and healthy communities, embracing sustainability, community involvement and engagement. The company has encouraged employees to become involved with numerous charities throughout the year, including Macmillan Cancer Care, Comic Relief, Children’s Toy Foundation (CTF), India National Association for the Blind (NAB), United Way and the Red Cross, amongst others. Proprietary and Confidential to NGA Human Resources Page 3 KEY HIGHLIGHTS AND MEASUREMENTS FOR THIS YEAR: New employees, as part of our mandatory onboarding process, are required to complete our Business Fundamentals Program. This program includes a module on CSR that explains our commitment to the UN Compact, explains the ten principles and what we do as a Company toward fulfilling our obligations. The course also includes information on responsibilities for our employees to ensure they are aware and committed to helping us fulfil this commitment.  NGA HR aims to be an employer of choice for people from different backgrounds, and to promote respect for the individual and equality of opportunity. NGA is committed to eliminating discrimination and encouraging diversity. Our aim is for our workforce to be truly representative of all sections of the wider community and for each employee to feel respected and able to perform their duties to the best of their ability. We have recently updated our Equality, Diversity and Dignity Policy and have published this on our intranet so all employees are aware of our expectations on acceptable conduct.  We have mandatory Annual Compliance Training for all employees and this year the completion rate was 95%. The small amount who did not complete this training were on long-term absences – i.e. Maternity leave, longterm sick leave etc.  We are a diverse organization — geographically and culturally — and we celebrate our different talents and skills with personalized development plans for each of our 8,500+ employees around the world. All employees at NGA HR are required to participate in the yearly performance development review with their manager. We aim for 100% completion for this program and this year 99.1% of employees received a performance review rating and had a performance and development conversation with their manager. The small percentage of employees who did not complete this program, have various reasons for non-completion, such as long term sick, maternity leave or they have joined NGA HR after the start date for the program. D O N A T I O N S / CSR A C T I V I T I E S Throughout all regions, NGA HR supports employees to find ways to give back to their communities, including mentoring, volunteering and donations to their favorite charities. Below are some examples of the last year of activities we have supported.  Over our last Financial Year (FY14/15) our employees in the UK donated to many different charities. We have also begun a partnership with The Princes Trust, who believes that every young person, no matter what their background, has the potential to succeed and build a better future for themselves. The young people supported by the Trust have often overcome tremendous barriers: ill-health, poverty, homelessness and lack of confidence. Our employees are able to work directly with young people on voluntary programmes, boosting their self-esteem and employability, as well as participating in a whole host of fundraising challenges.  Our Australia business sponsors two children through World Vision. Employees are invited to donate each month and NGA matches the donations received.  Our Sydney office undertook a clothing drive for Christmas 2014. The drive provided clean clothes, towels and other necessities for a homeless charity based in Sydney. The clothing and towels enabled the homeless men to have access to clean clothes and a shower.  One of our Australian employees based in Melbourne undertook a 50km walk to raise funds for Women’s Cancer Research. All donations she received from NGA HR employees were matched by the company.  Employees in our Malaysia offices raise and collect funds to feed the poor in the local community. Proprietary and Confidential to NGA Human Resources Page 4  The Kochi office in India continues with its CSR initiative ‘DIYA’. This year the Kochi employees Held a World Environment Day where they provided saplings for each employee as well as raising environmental awareness within the office.  In our New Zealand offices we employ a number of local volunteer fire-fighters. NGA supports these employees by continuing to pay their salary whenever they are required to respond to emergencies.  Our Hyderabad office continues with its employee driven CSR initiative, NGAging Lives. Through this initiative the employees have: o Supported a Digital Education Program for Children o Undertaken numerous fundraising activities to provide food and support for HIV affected children o Provided stationery to local school children at the start of the school year  In Argentina, employees support two main charities: o The Garrahan Foundation a civil society whose mission is to encourage in every way the development of the Hospital of Pediatrics Prof. Dr. Juan P. Garrahan. The charity works with the conviction that health is a right that everyone deserves to achieve. o Construir un Futuro Foundation – which consists of a children’s / adolescent’s home where shelter, food, clothing and health care is guaranteed; ensuring primary education, secondary or other forms of training, recreation and leisure, according to the characteristics of the child. ENVIRONMENT We constantly seek ways to lower our emissions and improve our energy efficiency. Some initiatives are localised, such as installation of energy efficient lighting and improved recycling schemes. In the UK, for example, we completed the replacement of air conditioning units and heating boilers at our Peterborough, along with a new Building Management System which will enable the heating/cooling systems to operate more effectively together, further reducing energy and emissions. A similar project was also completed at our Bristol site. Our Sydney office is located in a NABERS rated building which continually monitors the environmental performance of the building. Through this system the energy efficiency, water usage, waste management and indoor environmental quality of the building and the tenancy are regularly measured to monitor the impact on the environment. UPCOMING INITIATIVES Below are examples of some of the initiatives we have already committed to:  We are relocating one of our larger UK offices from a building with an Energy Performance Certificate rating C to a building with an EPC rating of A which will substantially reduce our building emissions.  Under the UK Energy Savings Opportunities Scheme, we have appointed an External Assessor to review and recommend further opportunities for additional energy saving initiatives. The scope of their review will cover buildings and business travel.  We continue to evaluate our Global footprint of leased office space. Through better space utilisation and office planning we are able to reduce our building emissions. A recent review has identified potential saving opportunities, which will be considered and implemented during 2016.  We are evaluating the use of more energy efficient lighting at Manila and Peterborough in early 2016. Proprietary and Confidential to NGA Human Resources Page 5 FUTURE ACTIONS  NGA will continue to demonstrate our commitment to the UN Global Compact by continuing to implement and incorporate the ten principles throughout our organization.  NGA will focus attention on the same Key Performance Indicators as 2014/15 and continue to document improved progress for our Key Performance each year.
