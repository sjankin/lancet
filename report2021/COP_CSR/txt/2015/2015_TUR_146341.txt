Prevention of Laundering Proceeds of Crime and Financing of Terrorism T. Garanti Bankası A.Ş., its branches, affiliates, subsidiaries are committed to cooperating with law enforcement and regulatory agencies to fight against money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial offences. Money laundering can be referred to as activities to disguise or conceal the origin of funds generated through criminal activities. Generally money laundering process includes three stages:  Placement (introduction of proceeds of crime into financial system), 21  Layering (use of layers to distance these proceeds from their sources),  Integration (re-entry into financial system of laundered proceeds). Apparently financial institutions may be used at any point in money laundering process. Even unintentional involvement in any criminal activity may weaken the institution's public reputation.

The financial Intelligence Unit of the Republic of Turkey is Financial Crimes Investigation 3 Board . The Republic of Turkey is a member country of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and has enacted laws and regulations to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. Since it is accepted that an institution may not always detect whether a transaction is money laundering related, to ensure Garanti is not unwittingly used as an intermediary in money laundering process and other related criminal activities, and to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rulings in the countries in which it does business, an anti-money laundering program is implemented. This program includes;  Written policies and procedures,  Assigning a compliance officer responsible for implementing anti-money laundering (A-ML ) policies and procedures,  An audit and review function to test the robustness of policies and procedures,  Monitoring and auditing customer activities and transactions as per A-ML legislations and regulations,  Training of employees on A-ML. A-ML program is the responsibility of all of the employees.

Risk Management Activities Garanti Bank measures and monitors its risk exposure on consolidated and unconsolidated bases by using methods that comply with international standards, and in accordance with the applicable legislation. Advanced risk management software is utilized in measuring and reporting operational risk, trading risk, credit risk and regulatory capital. The Bank’s risk management strategy, policies and implementation procedures are reviewed within the frame of the Bank’s needs and the efforts carried out under the riskbased best practice guidelines issued by the BRSA. During the process, the Basel Steering Committee, which is set up to ensure the Bank’s alignment with Basel guidelines and to monitor efforts undertaken to achieve compliance, actively continues to ensure internal coordination. Risk management handles the preparation of the report on determining the Bank’s risk appetite and internal capital adequacy assessment process by coordinating the concerned parties. In addition, stress test reports are submitted to the BRSA, which address how the potential negative effects on macroeconomic data in Turkey might alter the Bank’s threeyear budget plan and results within the frame of certain scenarios, as well as their impact upon key ratios including the capital adequacy ratio. 8.6.1. Market Risk Market risk is measured in accordance with applicable regulations, Garanti Bank’s policies and procedures, employing internationally accepted methodologies that are aligned with the Bank’s structure, and they are evaluated within a continuously improving structure. Market risk is managed by measuring and limiting risk in accordance with international standards, allocating sufficient capital and minimizing risk through hedging transactions. Market risk is defined as the risk Garanti Bank faces due to fluctuations in market prices in relation to the positions it maintains on or off its balance sheet for trading purposes, and is calculated daily using the VaR model. Value-at-Risk is a measure of the maximum expected loss in the market value of a portfolio of a certain maturity as a result of market price fluctuations, at a certain confidence interval and a certain probability. VaR is calculated using historical simulation method and one-year historical data at 99% confidence interval. Regular backtesting is conducted to measure the reliability of the VaR model. The model is subjected to validation on an annual basis. VaR limits are determined in accordance with the capital allocation approved by the Board of Directors and dynamically updated depending on changes in the Bank’s shareholders’ equity. These limits are monitored and reported daily by the Risk Management Department. VaR stood at TL 47 million by the end of 2014 and its average value for 2014 was TL 44 27 million. There was no significant change in VaR when compared to 2013. While the expanded trading portfolio played a part in the rise in the VaR trend observed in September, VaR dropped down to the level of he annual average as a result of the changed balance of FX position and derivatives portfolio. VaR does not constitute an important risk for the Bank in view of the amount of Garanti Bank’s shareholders’ equity. In order to identify the risks that might arise from major market volatilities, regular stress tests and scenario analyses are conducted using the VaR model. 8.6.2. Interest Rate Risk Resulting From The Banking Book Duration/gap and sensitivity analyses reports are prepared to determine Garanti Bank’s exposure to interest rate risk arising from maturity mismatches in its balance sheet. The Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) and the Asset-Liability Management Department use the duration/gap report for managing balance sheet interest rate risk and for liquidity management. To manage basis, funding and country credit spread risks, long-term funding sources such as bond issuance, syndication and securitization have been provided, in addition to using instruments such as interest rate swaps and credit default swaps (CDS). Approval of the Assets and Liabilities Committee is required for hedging transactions that are related to Garanti Bank’s balance sheet. The interest rate risk resulting from the banking book is measured on an unconsolidated basis, using the standard shock method; the regulatory limit is observed, and the same are reported to the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) on a monthly basis. 8.6.3. Liquidity Risk Within the frame of the risk management policies approved by the Board of Directors, the Asset-Liability Management Department (ALMD), Liquidity Risk Management Committee (LRMC), and Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) manage liquidity risk in order to take appropriate and timely measures in case of a liquidity squeeze arising from market conditions or Garanti Bank’s balance sheet structure. As part of the contingency funding plan, Garanti Bank monitors liquidity risk within the context of early warning signals, stress levels defined according to possible liquidity risk scenario and severity of the risk, the cash need that will arise in possible scenarios, and action to be taken at each stress level in a corporate framework. Core-deposit and average lifetime analyses are performed for deposits, which are an important balance sheet item in terms of liquidity management. Liquidity risk is monitored on the basis of internal benchmark limits and care is paid to ensure compliance with the regulatory liquidity ratio requirements. Highly liquid assets and alternative funding sources are evaluated by cash flow projections in order to meet liquidity requirements at stress conditions. Concentrations in funding sources are tracked. Day-today liquidity management is performed by the Asset-Liability Management Department. 8.6.4. Credit Risk Credit risk management is a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring credit risk, and covers all credit portfolios. The internal risk rating model, which was developed for corporate and commercial loans 28 portfolio, has been used in the loan granting process since 2003, and was incorporated into the relevant lending policies and procedures. This model was developed using statistical methods on historical data, in order to rate customers using objective criteria. The internal risk rating model calculates the default probability for each client. Under the Circular on Internal Rating Reporting issued by the Banks Association of Turkey (in Turkish: TBB), ratings assigned to each client, risk classes of rated clients, and rating scales of rated clients are reported to the TBB Risk Unit. Collection performances of non-performing loans in any portfolio are analyzed, and loss given default ratios are calculated in view of the time value of the money and costs incurred for making the collections, on the basis of segments in the case of commercial loans and of products and segments in the case of retail loans. Limit utilization ratios are examined for corporate, commercial and small enterprises portfolios prior to default, and conversion rates are calculated on the basis of each portfolio. These ratios are used to calculate expected lossbased provisions and internal capital requirement. Moreover, under the IAS 39 concerning provision calculation, the impaired portfolio across the Bank is identified and a collective provision calculation is performed. Concentrations are monitored across the portfolio with respect to internal risk ratings, sectors, regions, groups and clients. Risk adjusted return-based limits are determined on the basis of products for retail portfolios, and of sectors for corporate portfolios across the Bank. Models are used for the evaluation of specialized lendings according to supervisory slotting criteria and renewal studies are performing on models for construction loans and holdings. In the allocation processes of general-purpose, auto, mortgage, commercial mortgage, home equity, overdraft loans and commercial credit cards and credit card portfolio, which are evaluated under retail and SME lending processes, a union score is utilized, which is a combination of application, behavior and bureau scores. Within the context of treasury operations, necessary netting agreements are made and counterparty credit risks are monitored accordingly. Work is underway for software implementations that will allow the use of advanced measuring methods. Qualitative and model design validation is carried out for rating models that are primarily used for capital calculation. Work is carried out for achieving compliance with the communiqués, regulations and guidelines the BRSA issued in relation to credit risk. 8.6.5. Operational Risk All operational risks at Garanti Bank are managed under the supervision of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, within the scope of risk identification, assessment, monitoring and control/mitigation. The Audit Committee oversees and evaluates the results of the operational risk monitoring activities of the Internal Audit Department and the Internal Control Unit. Garanti Bank carries out the necessary work in line with local and international regulations (Basel II) to measure operational risk in accordance with its scale, the internal control systems in place, and databases. At Garanti Bank, measuring and managing operational risks are monitored primarily in the frame of the risk matrix, which is created by grouping existing and potential operational risks at Garanti Bank, the business lines, causeeffect types and Basel II event types that those risks belong to. The audit status, 29 impact and probability of each risk are evaluated within this matrix with a view to controlling the risks. The risk matrix is monitored, updated and used in their reviews by the Internal Control Unit and the Internal Audit Department. Garanti Bank’s operational risk loss data are collected and evaluated in an internal loss database centrally and systematically and in compliance with Basel II standards. Work is carried out for achieving compliance with the best practices guidelines the BRSA issued in relation to operational risk management. 8.6.6. Reputational Risk The Bank avoids all kinds of transactions and activities that would cause reputational risk in the eyes of legal authorities, customers and other market actors. The Bank pays utmost attention to be beneficial to the society, the natural environment and humanity. Trainings are held with the aim of raising awareness about reputational risk throughout the Bank and encouraging all employees to fulfill their duties and responsibilities. In order to ensure efficient management of reputational risk across the Bank, it is aimed to preserve and improve the Bank’s reputation before the customers, and to minimize the Bank’s impact upon the environment. Efforts carried out to this end include monitoring the media, the press and social media platforms with respect to the Bank’s reputation and managing potential impacts; ensuring sustainable awareness of compliance with laws and corporate standards, and development of processes that guarantee management of IT/ information security and IT-related risks. 8.6.7. Other Risks The Bank manages country and transfer risk, strategic risk, concentration and residual risks in alignment with the strategies, policies and implementation procedures devised. 9. ENVIRONMENT Garanti Bank is committed to continuously and significantly increase the value that it creates for its customers, its shareholders, its employees, the community and the environment. In this context, Garanti Bank’s Environment Policy is based on the following principles:  Monitor and comply strictly with all environmental legislation. Monitor and analyze carefully both the national and international sustainability programs; go beyond the mere fulfillment of the obligations under the programs joined and raise to the highest level in terms of the value added regarding sustainability;  Respect the environment, embrace and spread environmental responsiveness;  Enable and promote the efficient usage of all resources;  Keep under control the direct environmental impact caused by in-house operations;  Evaluate the loans extended within the context of the “Environmental and Social Loan Policies,” keep under control the indirect environmental impacts caused by loans;  Develop eco-friendly products and services; 30  Bequeath a sustainable world to future generations by constantly improving the environmental performance;  Contribute to the awareness and development of all stakeholders by encouraging multi-channel communication. 9.1. Management of the Environmental Impact of In-House Operations In 2014, Garanti increased the number of points of service under the ISO14001 certified Environmental Management System to 605, translating into 70% coverage of its employees. The Environmental Management System that Garanti is intent on expanding across all of its service points encompasses the indirect environmental and social impact resulting from the Bank’s suppliers and loans, in addition to environmental impact arising from facility operations. Garanti received limited assurance for GHG emissions for the first time in the fifth submission of its GHG emissions and climate change strategy to the CDP. In addition, it was named “CDP 2014 Turkey Climate Disclosure Leader” by getting the highest score among the 42 companies evaluated in the CDP’s “Turkey Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index”. Garanti qualified for the Green Office Diploma from WWF Turkey upon successful completion of the initial year of the WWF Green Office Programme for its Head Office building. In recognition of all these initiatives, Garanti was given the “Best Bank for Sustainability” award by ÇEDBİK, the Turkish Green Building Council. 9.2. Management of the Environmental Impact of Lending Operations 9.2.1. Environmental and Social Loan Policies Garanti Bank’s Environmental and Social Loan Policies Garanti Bank deals with the environmental and social impacts of activities for which it has provided financing, under a separate topic called “indirect impact”. The Bank initially set up the Environmental and Social Loan Policies (ESLP) in order to minimize the indirect impacts of loans granted by the Bank and put them into practice in 2011, following approval by the Bank’s Board of Directors. Environmental and Social Loan Policies constitute the environmental and social principles governing the extension of loans at Garanti Bank. Within the framework of these policies, the Bank runs the “Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Process” (ESIAP) that was designed within two years with the support of an independent consulting firm, as well as the “Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Model” (ESIAM) which is a part of the ESIAP. Loan requests received by Garanti Bank are first subjected to the ESLP; projects which do not comply with the policies are rejected. The ESLP, which was launched in 2011 and is applied on all loans without a threshold, is based on the following principles:  Garanti Bank pays regard to maximizing the environmental and social benefits in financing projects considering their environmental and social impacts. 31  Garanti Bank supports the protection and management of natural biodiversity. It takes into consideration the measures which will protect biodiversity and the natural habitat in the financing of projects.  Garanti Bank supports efforts to increase energy efficiency and the transition to a low carbon economy.  Garanti Bank subjects new projects with an investment value of more than US$ 20 million to the ESIAM which was developed by the Bank. With this model, projects are categorized and graded according to their characteristics, size, sensitivity, location and the possible social and environmental impacts. The Bank’s decisions are based on the risk rating calculated in accordance with the model.  The following financings are not subject to the ESIAM: o Acquisition and privatization loans, o Construction loans (excluding mass housing projects), o Projects for which the Bank provides consultancy services, o Shortor long-term loans, that do not include the realization of any project, o Loans provided to a project that is already operational (provided that those projects do not create an additional impact), and o Refinancing loans for ongoing projects (provided that those projects do not create an additional impact).  Following the application of the ESIAM, Garanti Bank may request from the project owners that an Environmental and Social Monitoring Plan (ESMP) is prepared, applied and regular reports are submitted for projects, which have higher risk ratings. The Bank expects the ESMP to be prepared in detail and with content that fits the project’s scale and risk level, as well as the Bank’s evaluation system.  It is imperative that the results of the assessment of environmental and social impacts are shared with the Credit Committee. The limit for total investment amount, policies and the assessment process may be revised or updated, if deemed necessary by the Sustainability Committee.  Garanti Bank does not finance activities that are banned or restricted by national legislation and/or international agreements to which Turkey is a party. The Bank also does not finance the activities, projects or companies listed below, without carrying out any environmental and social impact assessment and applying any limits. o Companies involved in the production of weapons of mass destruction and landmines, o Individuals or companies found to employ child labor, or who violate human rights, o Individuals or companies that deal with the production and trade of asbestos fibers or radioactive substances (excluding healthcare equipment, quality control devices and 32 situations in which use of radioactive substances is extremely limited or insignificant, or in situations where there is sufficient protection), o Fishing activities which are deemed to constitute overfishing, o Forestry activities which cannot be sustainably managed, o Individuals or companies involved in the production, warehousing, transport and trade of hazardous chemicals (petroleum and petrochemical products) in large quantities according to their industrial scale, o Activities carried out in wetlands defined as RAMSAR (Convention on Wetlands of International Importance) areas, o Individuals or companies involved with products and/or activities that fall under the scope of CITES18, o Activities that threaten the cultural heritage qualifications of sites classified as UNESCO World Cultural Heritage.  Garanti Bank pays regard to ensuring that the projects it finances satisfy the social and environmental standards required by legislation and the Bank’s policies, that impact assessment is undertaken by the project owner(s), if necessary, that prescribed measures are taken by the project owner(s) and that project owners have effective internal audit systems. When necessary, the Bank suggests extra measures to mitigate negative effects and requests the project owner(s) to take the necessary measures. Garanti Bank aims to contribute to the awareness of society, by providing information on ESLP to its stakeholders, especially its shareholders, employees and customers. 9.2.2. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Process During the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Process (ESIAP), projects that comply with ESLP principles are first evaluated for their compliance with “Sectoral Principles,” which are individually defined for each sector. Projects with a total investment value of more than US$ 20 million which comply with these principles are classified into various categories (A, B, C) depending on the extent of their environmental impact and then held subject to the ESIAM. Through the ESIAP, Garanti Bank aims to:  Determine and evaluate all environmental and social impacts of projects in a systematic way;  Ensure that projects supported by the Bank are sustainable from an environmental and social perspective;  Ensure that each stage of financed projects, as well as all processes and policies pursued by the Bank, fully comply with national legislation and regulations;  Ensure that all projects subject to the environmental and social impact assessment are evaluated and financed through the methods defined in the ESIAP; 33  Ensure that project owners take the necessary measures to reduce the identified impacts to an acceptable level;  Effectively monitor the ESMP prepared by customers (project owners) in order to help project owners monitor and improve their compliance with the Bank’s environmental and social policies during the Bank’s loan supply process;  Ensure that the project owners have sufficient capacity and an adequate workforce to fulfill the Bank’s environmental and social requirements during construction and operation; and  Evaluate the public reaction related to any negative impacts that may arise during construction and operation of projects. Garanti Bank is committed to constantly improving this new assessment process, which began to be tested in 2011, through dedicated observation of national and international legislation and developments. With the implementation of the ESIAP, which was set up in accordance with international practices, the Bank has achieved significant progress towards compliance with the Equator Principles, which are internationally recognized by the financial sector. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Process 34 9.2.3. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Model Under the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Model (ESIAM), there are question sets that are prepared specific to each sector. Depending on the sector applicable to each project, these questions are answered by the Project and Acquisition Finance Department or the Corporate and Commercial Loans Department. The ESIAM comprises of three stages: 9.2.3.1. Category Selection The project is assigned to the most appropriate of the three categories mentioned below: Category A  Projects defined in the ANNEX-I of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulation (projects that are subject to the EIA),  Projects that are carried out in or around sensitive areas defined in the ANNEX-V of the EIA Regulation,  Projects where there is strong public or NGO opposition Category B  Projects defined in ANNEX-II of the EIA Regulation (projects that are subject to the selectionelimination criteria and that require project introduction files)  Projects attracting either strong interest or opposition from the general public or NGOs  Projects which are exempt from the EIA Category C  Projects included in the ANNEX-I or ANNEX-II of the EIA Regulation  Projects where there is no adverse interest in, or opposition from, the general public or NGOs 9.2.3.2. Determination of a Project’s Risk Rating Different questionnaires that are separately designed for each sector listed below are used in order to determine the risk rating of any project:  Cement, Glass, Ceramics Sector  Foodstuff, Beverage, Feed and Agricultural Products Sector  Geothermal Power Plants  Hydroelectric Power Plant Projects  Metallurgy/Machine/Petrochemicals/Chemicals Industry  Mining Industry  Nuclear Power Plants  Paper-Cellulose Sector  Petroleum and Natural Gas Industry 35  Solar Power Plants  Textiles and Leather Sector  Thermal Power Plant Projects  Tourism/Healthcare/Mass Housing/Mall Sector  Transport/Infrastructure Sector  Waste Utilization and Disposal Sector  Wind Farms The ultimate risk rating of the Project is determined following an evaluation of question-based risk ratings through an algorithm which was prepared with the support of the consulting firm based on scientific facts. Principle Areas of Focus R1 High Risk R2 Medium Risk R3 Low Risk R4 Very Low Risk 9.2.3.3. Determination of the Risk Group Based on the Category and Risk Rating Projects are classified according to their risk rating and category, by using a risk matrix created by the Bank itself, and finally their risk classes are identified based on this evaluation. Garanti Bank demands specific actions to be taken according to the risk class determined by the application of the ESIAM. If the final risk group is 1, the Bank asks an independent consultant firm to prepare a comprehensive report regarding the project’s environmental and social impacts and also to prepare, apply and regularly report an ESMP. If the risk group is 2, the Bank requests that the project owner(s) prepare, apply and regularly report an ESMP. The Bank expects the ESMP to be prepared in detail and with content appropriate to the project’s scale and risk level, as well as the Bank’s evaluation system. If the risk group is 3, actions are dependent on decısıon of the credit committee. If a project fails to meet the environmental and social criteria within the scope of ESIAM, the Bank may reject the project or ask the debtor to take additional measures, monitor identified impacts and report these impacts in detail on a regular basis. For instance, in 2012 when the system was tested, Garanti Bank asked, during the loan assessment of various thermal power plant projects, for a revision of the air quality modeling and requested that cooling water should be obtained from seawater through desalinization. 36 Likewise, the Bank requested the construction of fish passages and archaeological evaluation reports from some hydroelectric power plant projects and ornithological impact and monitoring reports from a number of wind farm projects. In many of the projects, the ESMP was prepared and applied. Risk Matrix 10. GENDER-SPECIFIC COP SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS In 2014, Garanti Bank signed Women’s Empowerment Principles, which were developed in 2010 by a collaboration between the UN Global Compact and UN Women. These Principles, which Garanti is the first bank in Turkey to adopt, are grouped in 7 key headings and provide guidance on how to empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community. Furthermore, Garanti supports HeforShe initiative that emphasizes on men’s support for women rights and gender equality. The following sections explain Garanti Bank’s activities under each Gender-Specific COP Self Assessment Question. 10.1. Policies and practices related to supporting women’s empowerment and advancing gender equality in the workplace including reference to sex-disaggregated data: 10.1.1. Equality of opportunity and diversity Garanti views equality of opportunity and diversity as a fundamental value and a driving force of its corporate culture. In line with this purpose, Garanti encourages its employees to think differently and improve their personal and professional competencies while supporting diversity in the workplace. One of the clearest indicators of successful diversity at Garanti is the comparatively higher number of female employees.  Percentage of women employees: 57%  Women in upper management positions: 28%  Women in middle and upper management positions: 40% As a result of the importance it gives to gender equality and the empowerment of women, Garanti Bank has been one of the first companies in Turkey to implement the Equal Opportunities Model (FEM) and was recognized in 2012 with the awarding of its certificate. Equal Opportunities Model (FEM) is a certification program initiated by Women Entrepreneurs Association of Turkey (KAGİDER) with the support of the World Bank, aiming to provide equal opportunities in business life by identifying inequalities in areas such as recruitment procedures, internal training programs, and career planning 37 and development processes, and subsequently presenting companies with egalitarian practices as a solution. As explained in section 6, Garanti Bank employees are obliged to conduct their relationships with each other in a way that will not disrupt the work climate and will not be perceived as harassment, discrimination or mistreatment in or out of the work place within the framework of Garanti Bank’s Ethical Principles. 10.1.2. Compensation and rewards Compensation and rewards are the other building blocks of Garanti’s HR policies. In line with its target of being the employer of choice, the Bank applies a competitive, market-sensitive salary system, which aims to improve employees quality of life. At Garanti Bank, the compensation system is essentially based on performance and totally gender-neutral. In addition to individual performance, the Bank keeps a close view of general macroeconomic circumstances, the current inflation rate in Turkey and trends in the sector in order to apply a proper and fair policy on salaries of its employees. In implementing its compensation policy, the Bank takes into account the values set forth by this policy as approved by the Board of Directors. Every employee, including senior managers, meticulously upholds these values in all salary-related practices.

Child Care As part of child-care program, employees who are nursing are granted flexible time for nursing until the infant is 1 year old and can take 2 hours off every day in this first year.

Good Work Life Relationship (“IYI”) program In addition to special trainings and measures to foster employees’ health and well-being, Garanti Bank has launched the Good Work Life Relationship (“IYI”) program. IYI was set up in 2012 as a result of an intensive Employer Value Proposition program to enhance employee satisfaction and ensure a richer working experience. The program is responsible for events such as motivational meetings, Garanti Women’s Club, i.e. a networking and sharing platform for female employees, hobby clubs and services such as LEAP, Green Bus and Sade Mail, a program to manage e mail density. In 2015, Garanti Bank has organized a gathering called “Pembe Suare”, which aimed to inform female employees about the gender-equality initiatives undertaken by Garanti Bank. In this meeting, Garanti Bank has also placed a wall panel, on which the employees were asked to leave their handprints, in order to raise their awareness about violence against women. This panel, which was filled with female employees’ handprints, was exhibited in headquarters of Garanti Bank in the following weeks, in a bid to draw the attention of male employees to the same topic. These activities were followed by an email sent to the entire staff by senior management in order to explain Garanti Bank’s current activities and future plans about women’s empowerment and to ask the male employees to demonstrate their support to HeforShe initiative. Garanti Bank’s employee assistance program, i.e. LEAP, provides a hotline available to all employees and their family members. Experts in various fields including medical, legal, psychological and financial provide support to callers 24/7. As part of the assistance program, callers may be referred to psychologists and counsellors for 6 sit-down sessions free of charge. Additionally, the initiatives which aim to improve the employees’ health and safety are explained in the following link: http://www.garanti.com.tr/en/our_company/sustainability/sustainability_approach/focusing_on_human_res ources.page 10.2.

Apart from extending funds to women entrepreneurs, the Bank also supports activities encouraging entrepreneurship and educational projects. The Women Entrepreneurs Executive School training program, which was launched in 2012 in collaboration with Boğaziçi University Lifelong Learning Center, continued in the cities of Adana, Eskişehir, Diyarbakır and Kayseri in 2014. Under the program, 370 women entrepreneurs in these four cities successfully completed the program and earned Certificates.

In 2014, meetings were held in five cities across Turkey with the participation of almost 1,100 women.

Policies and practices related to supporting women’s empowerment and advancing gender equality in the community: Garanti’s efforts to empower women extend beyond HR practices and the women entrepreneurs program. Dubbed the Pixies of the Court, the Turkish National Women’s Basketball Team has been enjoying our unbroken support since 2005. The team made us proud by claiming the 4th spot in the FIBA World Championship for Women hosted by Turkey, in which event our Bank was the presenting partner. Garanti Bank has also sponsored the Garanti Wheelchair Basketball 1st National Women’s Championship that took place in Gaziantep from 25 to 27 June 2014. Having been the scene to the contention of four teams of women athletes, the tournament was organized for the first time in Turkey and drew great attention. Furthermore, in order to support women in all segments of the society, the Bank has established a Women Working Group in 2014 consisting of various departments including the representatives from Sustainability Team, Product Development and Innovation, SME Banking, Social Media, Corporate Brand Management and Marketing Communications, etc. This Working Group has conducted several focus group studies as well as desk research in order to better understand the needs of women in Turkey to empower them.

The Woman Steering Committee’s goal is to socially and economically empower women from all segments of the society through various initiatives. 11. 2015 GOALS & FORECASTS Garanti constantly updates and keeps current the systems, policies and procedures it has built in order embed the environmental and social factors and corporate governance principles into its operations.
