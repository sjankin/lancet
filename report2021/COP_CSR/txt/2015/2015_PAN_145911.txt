Part of this training includes the 10,000 Panamanians who operate and manage the construction of a new facility with two lakes, channels waterway. and scale model locks with the physical characteristics of the Canal to train pilots; the charter of a Post-Panamax vessel for several months; and the initial purchase of specialized high-precision instrumentation equipment using global positioning system technology to use in the expanded Canal and the existing Canal, in response to the recommendations made by Panama Canal pilots. The Canal continues to innovate and look for ways to add value to the route. As a first major diversification project, we wish to highlight the beginning of a concession process for the design, construction and operation of a container port in Corozal, with specifications to accommodate Post-Panamax vessels that will transit the new expanded Canal and even larger vessels that could take advantage of the connectivity that Panama offers. We also began studies of other business projects and logistics facilities that will complement our offer and generate more revenue for the country. And most importantly, these activities will allow the Panama Canal route to remain highly competitive, with greater connectivity and a favorite of our customers. Looking ahead, we feel optimistic about many more future challenges, opportunities and achievements in order to continue operating, maintaining and modernizing this important global transportation route, in an overall safe, competitive, profitable and reliable manner. On behalf of the more than 10,000 Panamanians who have the privilege of working at the Panama Canal, we reaffirm the values that guide us in our daily actions, as well as our commitment to continue striving to create new and increased profits for our country´s development.

Advisory Board The Advisory Board is the consultative body which assists the Board of Directors and senior management of the Panama Canal Authority regarding the needs, requirements and improvement of international public service provided by the Canal, under the Constitution of the Republic, the Organic Law and its regulations. It is a forum composed of leaders from the international community who contribute with their views and experiences to the design and improvement of the plans developed by the Administration for the better future of the Canal. It is composed of 17 distinguished personalities from the maritime and business world who meet at least once a year, convened by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors met in Panama from August 12 to 14, 2014. The agenda consisted of a tour of the construction sites of the new locks and PAC 4 to witness first hand the progress of the project; in addition to briefings on Canal operational developments and its new projects. During its deliberations, the Advisory Board applauded the efforts of the ACP in operations and advancement on the Third Set of Locks Project and analyzed new projects to be undertaken by ACP, and the possible construction of a canal through Nicaragua. Also, on January 15 to 16, 2014, three Advisory Board members travelled to Panama to conduct an inspection of the works.

The Panama Canal´s Historic and Current Role • The maritime flow of cargo and passengers in turn he Panama Canal plays a key role in global generates further revenues thanks to related activities trade flows as an exports facilitator. Since such as shipping agencies, vessel-refueling services, its opening in 1914, over 1 million vessels and cruise ships. Furthermore, many companies have transited the waterway, totaling over choose to be based in Panama because of the 9,000 million long tons.

In fact, the export banking center and legal services). All of these are of logistics-related services have been a mainstay of increasingly interlinked. For instance, the Free Zone the Panamanian economy for over a century, and its conducts much of its banking locally; the Canal, importance has only grown in recent years. Furthermore, ports and the international airport complement these services add value to Canal users. Since Panama´s each other. independence, the country has adopted several policies which capitalize on its privileged location, Based on several economic impact studies, the namely: 1) the lack of a central monetary authority and aforementioned activities account for approximately 22 the circulation of the United States Dollar; 2) banking percent of the national production, including more than secrecy laws; 3) the founding of the Colon Free Zone; 40 percent of the exports, 28 percent of fiscal revenues 4) the establishment of an international banking center; and 25 percent of the labor force. Activities directly or 5) and the Canal Expansion Program, approved by a indirectly related to the logistics cluster generate some national referendum. 200,000 jobs. The cluster is therefore one of Panama´s main economic and employment drivers.

Panama´s economy is therefore highly dependent on the export of services. Over the last 13 years, total exports have averaged almost 68 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), including the re-exportation of goods from the Colon Free Zone. This factor is crucial for the creation of jobs, as well as fiscal revenues to address poverty and provide better opportunities for all. In fact, Panama´s economic growth has historically been correlated with exports. For instance, during the 1960s, exports grew an average 13 percent annually while the economy grew 8 percent. From 1990 to 2000, exports grew an average 6.6 percent while the economy grew 6.7 percent, and in the last decade exports averaged 10.8 percent while the economy expanded 9.2 percent per annum. Similarly, the Canal supports the export sectors globally, by directly promoting world trade and economic development within these countries. Approximately 2.3 percent of maritime world commerce transits the Panama Canal.

It will create greater economies of scale in maritime transport, as it will allow the transit of ships with beams of up to 49 meters and 15.2 meters in draft through the new locks. The expansion project will be a driver for other sectors indirectly linked to Canal traffic, further gaining from the many competitive advantages Panama has to offer. This cross-sector synergy has a multiplier effect and increases the country’s overall competitiveness, and that of other countries which can use Panama as a hub. Canal Traffic he Panama Canal PC/UMS (Panama Canal Universal Measurement System) net tonnage for fiscal year 2014 was 326.8 million tons, a 1.9 percent increase from the previous year tonnage. Toll revenues amounted to B/.1,910.2 million, a 3.3 percent increase from the previous fiscal year. In contrast, transits decreased 1.3 percent, from 13,660 in fiscal year 2013 to 13,481 in fiscal year 2014. Fiscal year 2014 was characterized by relative improvements in the different economies that hinted at high expectations for recovery and growth at the end of 2013, but eventually turned into a mixed slowdown for the rest of the fiscal year. At the end of 2013, relative improvements were noticeable in the United States, the Eurozone and China. However, things changed after a cold front affected consumption in the United States, and limited productivity expansion coupled with market volatility and impacted the Eurozone. In addition, a decrease in exports prompted an unexpected decline in the growth rate in China. At the beginning of 2014, an unexpected cold spell slowed down consumption and reduced production in the United States. The Federal Reserve indicated that during this period the economy contracted by 6.1 percent as a result of a slowdown in real estate and retail sales. Yet, improvements in consumption since March prompted a 6.7 percent economic rebound which mitigated the impact of that contraction. An increase in consumption boosted local production and created employment opportunities. These improvements have reduced the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent in September 2014. 128 CANAL DE PANAMÁ Annual Report 2014 Connetivity 100 Years Uniting The World Annual Report 2014 CANAL DE PANAMÁ Since October 2013, the Eurozone economy showed In the geopolitical arena, 2014 was also a significant year. mixed macroeconomic development.

Due to 111 fewer transits than in fiscal year 2013, the amount of TEUs and PC/UMS tonnage decreased 22.1 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively. Bananas, the main transported in reefer vessels through the Panama Canal, accounted for 69.4 percent of the total long tons in this market segment. During fiscal year 2014, reefer vessel operators maintained with scant success, their strategy to carry TEUs above deck in order to compete against full container vessels; the latter continue to attract more refrigerated container cargo to liner services.

Revenues from this segment accounted for 47.8 percent of the overall Canal toll revenues for fiscal year 2014. The number of liner services through the Panama Canal route experienced significant variations during fiscal year 2014. This year the Panama Canal faced the departure of two previously existing services, and the introduction of only one service. Fiscal year 2014 closed with 29 active services in the Panama Canal route. Annual Report 2014 CANAL DE PANAMÁ 131 The reduction in the ballast transits was due to a decrease in gasoline imports from Europe1 to the West Coast of the United States. Additionally, higher freight rates in Panamax vessels used to transport diesel in the arbitrage between the United States and the Northeast Coast of Europe, contributed to the decline of laden and ballast transits of vessels via the Panama Canal 2. Cargo transported in tanker vesselsshowed a 5.8 percent increase compared to the previous fiscal year, with a 3.2 percent increase in the transits of laden vessels with a beam of 100 feet or more.

The total cargo transported during fiscal year 2014, registered a 3.0 percent increase compared to the previous fiscal year, mainly driven by the Ecuadorian oil exports, bound to North American refineries in the Gulf of Mexico and the increase in exports of liquefied oil gas (LPG) from the United States to the West Coast of Central and South America. This increase in cargo volume was reflected in the transits of vessels with a beam range of over 100 feet, which increased 5.2 percent compared to fiscal year 2013. With regards to tanker vessels, transits dropped 13.8 percent, 12.5 percent in PC/UMS tons and 5.6 percent in toll revenues when compared with the previous fiscal year.

By the end of the 1970s, pure car and truck carriers (PCTC) were introduced to transport high and heavy equipment such as trucks, buses, construction machinery, and agricultural equipment. By 1985, 844 vehicle carriers (PCC and PCTC) transited the Panama Canal with an average PC/UMS of thirty-three thousand tons. Almost thirty years later, during fiscal year 2014, the vehicle carriers / RoRo market segment recorded a total of 815 transits.

Toll revenues during 2014 accounted for $191.1 million, a 6.5 percent growth compared to fiscal year 2013. This growth in Vehicle Carriers and the RoRo Segment revenues was mainly a result of an increase in traffic. The vehicle carriers / RoRo market segment has evolved Cargo tonnage totaled 4.6 million long tons, a 4.6 percent considerably during the one hundred years of the Panama increase compared to fiscal year 2013 in which 4.4 million long Canal. From the inauguration of the Panama Canal in 1914, tons were transported via the Panama Canal. The increase and all the way to 1950, automobiles were not a commodity transported by sea. However, in the early 1950s the seaborne trade of automobiles started to emerge. Back then vehicles were loaded and unloaded one by one using cranes by the lifton/lift-off (LO/LO) system at an approximate rate of 15 cars per hour. These vehicles were transported by conventional liners that carried mainly general commodities, that is, general cargo vessels, and it is estimated that as early as 1955 some vehicles were transported through the Panama Canal. General cargo vessels amounted to 6,654 transits in that year. In the mid-1960s, as automobile transportation between Europe and the United States increased, the demand for car shippers for high quality service increased as well. This led to the design and construction of pure car carriers (PCC), which used the rollAnnual Report 2014 CANAL DE PANAMÁ 135 to exchange rate ﬂuctuations and seek the most proﬁtable combination of production sites to sales destinations. In the near future the Panama Canal will face changing trade patterns as auto manufacturers relocate production closer to end markets. It is expected that as numerous new factories in Mexico start production, shipping volume of finished vehicles from Japan to North America will decline gradually. On the other hand, exports from new manufacturing bases in the United States and Mexico to neighboring countries are expected to continue to increase. Therefore, the trend toward local production for local consumption is not only a challenge for the Panama Canal, but also an opportunity to capture increasingly diverse trade flows. in cargo volume through the Canal was driven by exports to Passenger Vessels Segment the United States from Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The main trade route for the Panama Since the transit of the first passenger ship, the M/S Alliance, Canal, Japan – East Coast of the United States, recorded 1.0 on June 8, 1914, the Panama Canal has been involved in a million long tons, a 9.8 percent increase compared to the constantly evolving cruise industry. It is considered that the previous fiscal year.

In via the Canal, a 0.4 million long ton increase in comparison to the United States, during the Prohibition era, the Cunard Line last year. This increase in volume is a direct result of the local ships, Mauretania and Berengaria, offered the popular known production for local consumption strategy, which has led to an “cruises to nowhere”. These cruises allowed United States increase in coastal maritime transport within the regional bloc citizens to circumvent the ban outside US territorial waters (1920 of the Americas. Lastly, the trade route South Korea to the East -1933). Coast of the United States recorded 0.3 million long tons, a 22.0 percent increase from fiscal year 2013. Seaborne movements of finished vehicles are in the middle of a global paradigm shift, with further expansion in export trade from the United States, Mexico and Southeast Asia. In the past, the main routes for seaborne transport of automobiles were from Japan/South Korea to the East Coast of the United States, and from Europe to the West Coast of the United States in linear services (i.e. following a regular schedule). Today, however, more countries are producing and consuming automobiles, creating a rich trade web. Export countries now include Thailand, Mexico, China, and South Africa, among others. Auto manufacturers not only seek to increase local production for local consumption, but increasingly to produce the same model in several countries to have the ﬂexibility to respond 136 CANAL DE PANAMÁ Annual Report 2014 During World War II (1939 – 1945), most ships were used the or 5.4 percent compared to the 2012-2013 season.

This was only possible thanks to the will of thousands of actors who inspired each of the pages in the annals of the waterway. The hope of immigrants seeking new lands, the struggle for work in defiance of nature, the desire to make history or perhaps the desire for prosperity, among other factors, lured many foreigners to come to Panama and work in the construction of one of the most impressive works in the world and one of the marvels of modern engineering. The Panama Canal’s success is to witness the effort and tenacity of workers from different places. Between 1904 and 1913, a period of backbreaking work, approximately 56,307 people worked in the construction of the Panama Canal, 11,873 Europeans, 31.071 from the West Indies, and 11,000 from the United States. Conquering nature to open the route through the Isthmus to achieve the dream of uniting the two oceans was not an easy task. During the U.S. construction period, 5,609 workers were reported dead to diseases and accidents. In the French period, according to a report by Dr. William Gorgas US Navy (Surgeon General at the time), 22,000 workers died during the construction of the Canal. The main causes of death were endemic malaria and yellow fever.

Annual Report 2014 CANAL DE PANAMÁ 177 Financial Sustainability Historical Background On August 14, the Panama Canal opened its gates to the world, with the transit of steamship Ancon. This event was overshadowed by the outbreak of World War I on August 4, 1914. It was not until December 4, 1915, when in San Francisco, California, a big international fair was held to commemorate the monumental effort that represented the construction of this great feat of engineering. Since its opening in 1914, the trade route across the Isthmus grew in importance, revitalizing Panama’s vocation as a country of transit. The Panama Canal connects the world, shortening distances, time and transportation costs between production and consumption centers. Today, the Panama Canal is a synonym of connectivity, thanks to the 144 maritime routes that converge here and make calls at 1,700 ports in more than 160 countries. For a century, the Panama Canal has offered its services to the international maritime industry, promoting progress, development and growth of Panama. The different conventions and treaties signed throughout its Republican history, placed the Canal as a leading center of these negotiations, each of which resulted in greater economic benefits for Panama. These treaties include the following: • Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty of 1903: The United States Government agrees to pay to the Republic of Panama the sum of ten million dollars (US$10,000,000) in gold coin of the United States after the exchange of the ratifications of the agreement, in addition to an annuity for the life of the Convention of two hundred fifty thousand dollars (US$250,000) in gold coins of the United States. • Treaty of Mutual Understanding and Cooperation of 1936: It included an increase in the amount of four hundred and thirty thousand US dollars (US$430,000) annuity that the United States Government gave the Government of Panama.
