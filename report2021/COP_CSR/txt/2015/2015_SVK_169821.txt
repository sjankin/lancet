2014 Corporate Responsibility Report Bank of VÚB has been engaged in supporting Slovak contemporary art for a long time. In cooperation with the VÚB Foundation it organizes an art competition to support talents The Painting – VÚB Foundation Award to Young Artists for Painting. The works enrolled in the competition are evaluated by an international jury and winners are awarded with prize money. Traditionally the contest takes place along with a representative exhibition, which shows the collection of works of competition finalists and thus helps to promote contemporary fine arts. On the cover Erik Šille (*1978, Rožňava) Where are you going Europe? (2006) Acrylics on canvas, 120 x 205 cm Collection of VÚB Foundation Erik Šille is a multiple finalist of The Painting competition organized by VÚB Foundation. In 2006 and 2009 he was awarded the third and the first prize for his pictures. The author ranks among highly visible figures of fine arts. In addition to his peculiar and elaborated iconography, which uses an appeal and image of animated world, his strength can also be seen in his sense of colour rare in Slovak painting. He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts and Design where he was a pupil of the studio of Professor Ivan Csudai.

This is confirmed by a series of prestigious awards, trust of our clients and employee satisfaction. A review of our financial performance for the past twelve months is traditionally outlined in the financial annual report. Its integral part forms also the corporate responsibility report providing an account of our effort to contribute to sustainable development and to enhancing the quality of people’s lives. All our achievements are reminding us of responsibility we hold towards Slovakia. People Are Most Important Our success is the result of our clients’ trust and diligent work of our employees. Their feedback is therefore invaluable to us. The level of client satisfaction is regularly examined in our survey Listening 100 %, in which our clients evaluated us in the first half of 2014 as a bank with services and products they are most satisfied with among the main competitive banks. The survey aimed especially at women showed that their share in the managerial positions in VUB is high and for the past 3 years increased to 60 %. Following the European trend, we are supportive of creating a modern work place fitting the contemporary needs of women and their families. On top of that, one of our main priorities has been employee engagement, whether man or woman, who are at the core of any company´s progress and growth. Only the engaged employee who feels to be a valuable asset for the company, the one who has space for self-fulfilment and career growth is interested in values and vision shared with the company he/she works for. Looking for Solutions for Easier and Mobile Life Our goal and inherent interest is to keep up with ongoing changes resulting from technological developments inducing changes in people´s daily reality and transforming their interaction not only with each other but also with service providers like banks. To reflect on all these changes adequately, VUB Bank introduced and improved both its products and services to serve people´s daily needs best by exploiting multiple digital channels. Improvements in Internet and Mobile Banking facilitating and speeding up the loan application process, online access to products and credit cards with the ultimate goal to go paperless and last but not least more secure, contactless and instant mobile payments on multiple devices are our main accomplishments ensuing from these changes. 4 Awards Move Us Forward Defending success is many times harder than achieving it. In a fierce competition within the banking sector, each achievement commits us to move the “bar“ even higher. We are proud that VUB Bank repeatedly gained the title The Best Bank in Slovakia awarded by the magazines Global Finance and EMEA Finance, as well as the award The Bank with the Best Private Banking Services by the Euromoney magazine. Moreover, we were awarded as The Safest Bank in Slovakia based on evaluation by the rating agencies. And last but not least, we again became the most successful bank in the Golden Coin competition, whereas we also highly appreciate our triumph in the HERMES Communicator of the Year competition for the best communication with clients. Sharing Our Success We are committed to share our accomplishments with those in need. We focus our attention to disadvantaged groups in the population, preservation of cultural heritage or support of young art and high quality education. In 2014, VUB Foundation donated more than EUR 540 thousand to projects of both international and national importance. Some of them, such as the competition for support of young fine artists The Painting, will soon celebrate its first decade of existence. Investments into young talents, education and charity form indispensable part of our strategy of standing up to our social responsibility.

The whole content is split into two main parts. The first part contains the Profile and Governance chapter describing VUB Group’s profile, identity, governance system, mission, values and the Our Responsibility chapter is focused on corporate responsibility management and implementation of its principles. The second part of the report consists of chapters dedicated to individual stakeholder categories, i.e. those entities that are significantly impacted by VUB Bank’s activity and towards which we feel the greatest responsibility. These are clients, employees, shareholders, suppliers and community. In a separate chapter, we also deal with our impact on the environment. When identifying these categories, we took into consideration the corporate responsibility strategy of our parent bank Intesa Sanpaolo, which used the methodology under the AA1000 principles (in particular the AA1000 SES standard) issued by the London-based Accountability Institute. The report documents the results which the Bank achieved with respect to the objectives set out within its business plan. All data had been collected and processed by the members of the VUB corporate responsibility working group and the Corporate Social Responsibility Staff Unit. The report documents exclusively the activities of VUB Bank, whereas the activities of its subsidiaries are not included. The only partial exception is the area of our responsibility towards the community, where the information and data related to the activities of VUB Foundation overlap. This procedure was chosen in case of activities that VUB Bank and its foundation performed and financed jointly. Annex to the report is an overview processed under the GRI guidelines containing the publishing of profile, management approach for all indicator categories and the list of performance indicators. Compliance with Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines The content was compiled under the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the third edition of the Global Reporting Initiative Edition. Reported is the profile, management approach and 38 indicators. The annex contains a transparent table listing the reported indicators and management approach for each indicator category. Compliance with the GRI guidelines was verified by the external verifier the Pontis Foundation, which is an organizational stakeholder of GRI in the Slovak Republic.

VUB Bank is a public joint-stock company operating in the Slovak and Czech Republics. A break-through for our activities was the year 2001, when a significant Italian banking group IntesaBci (nowadays Intesa Sanpaolo) acquired a majority stake in VUB Bank. VUB Bank is currently the second largest bank in Slovakia. It administers deposits amounting to EUR 7.7 billion and loans worth EUR 7.8 billion. The Bank’s portfolio holds currently more than 1.2 million clients. VUB has been one of the most profitable banks in Slovakia in recent years. Shareholder structure is contained in the Shareholders chapter V. 10 Profile and Governance VUB GROUP PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES Banking Leasing Factoring Consumer Asset Pension Finance Management Saving ABOUT INTESA SANPAOLO GROUP The Italian banking group Intesa Sanpaolo, based in Turin and Milan, is the majority shareholder of VUB Bank with a stake of 97.02 % in the Bank’s share capital. It was established in January 2007 by a merger of two significant Italian banks, Banca Intesa and Sanpaolo IMI. The Group has a leading position in Italy and it is one of the leading banks providing financial products and services to households and also companies across Europe. Intesa Sanpaolo has a strategic business representation in the region of Central and Eastern Europe and in the area of the Mediterranean Sea. Through its subsidiary banks, it operates in the following countries: Serbia, Croatia, Slovakia, Egypt, Hungary, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russian Federation and Romania V. Presence of Intesa Sanpaolo in the Region 11 Profile and Governance FINANCIAL INDICATORS In 2014, the Slovak economy was faring well. According to many financial indicators, it was even its best performance for the last five years. The GDP growth went up from less than a percent in the last year to nearly two and a half percent. An even more significant factor is that the core of the growth shifted from international demand to the domestic one, which reversed the development in a long-term weakened labour market. The number of jobs recorded a decent year-on-year growth and for the first time in four years, the unemployment rate fell below 13%. Nominal wages in the economy increased by four and a half percent, which given the absence of inflation represented a considerable growth of the real purchasing power of households. Owing to an improving labour market, confidence of households was increasing and their demand for consumer goods and housing as well as their demand for loans. In addition, this was supported also by a significant decrease of interest rates. In overall, the growth of the volume of loans to households accelerated from less than 10% in 2013 to 12% in 2014. On the other side of the banking books, on the deposit side, the drop of interest rates accelerated the transfer of savings from traditional term deposits to alternative savings or investment products, including the collective investment products. The growing income of households in 2014 brought also a growth in the volume of household deposits in banks, by nearly 4%. Yet, this was only due to the funds deposited in current accounts, which recorded a double-digit growth. The volume of term deposits decreased. The domestic economy’s boost in 2014 included also corporate investments leading to a stabilization of the corporate loans portfolio, which was on decline before. The situation improved mainly in the sector of large state enterprises that used the banks to finance their acquisition and restructuring plans. Nevertheless, the banks were prepared to finance also the investment plans of the small and medium enterprises. Against this macroeconomic background, VUB Bank was doing relatively well. We managed to considerably accelerate the growth of volume of loans to households by more than two digits against the previous year and to maintain our overall share in the loan market. In the deposit market, we focused mainly on the value added for the client and thus supported rather the increase of volumes in the funds administered by VUB AM or the pension management company VUB Generali, which further improved their position in the market. Also in the area of financial performance, VUB fared relatively well. The growth of loans contributed to an increase of operating income vis-à-vis last year by nearly 3%. In the area of costs, we remained efficient and retained the cost-to-income ratio at the level of around 43%, which is a relatively moderate level for a universal bank like VUB with its extensive branch network. As to the area of risk management, emphasis needs to be laid on performance that VUB achieved within the comprehensive assessment of banks performed by the European Central Bank. VUB not only reached the best performance among the Slovak banks, but the Bank’s performance was even better than the performance of several traditionally much stronger banking groups within the entire Eurozone. Assessment by the European Central Bank confirmed that VUB was justly considered an excellent banking house with a great emphasis on risk management and thus also with the highest possible responsibility towards its clients, shareholders and other stakeholders. 12 Profile and Governance MARKET SHARES as at 31/12/2014 as at 31/12/2013 as at 31/12/2012 Total assets 17.6% 18.6 % 18.6 % Customer deposits 16.8% 17.6 % 17.8 % Loans to customers 18.4% 18.3 % 19.1 % Mortgage loans 41.6% 44.8 % 46.4 % Branch network 18.7% 19.4 % 19.9 % Payment cards n/a 27.3 % 28.8 % ATMs n/a 22.1 % 22.6 % EFT POS terminals n/a 22.2 % 23.1 % The complete financial performance is published in VUB’s 2014 Annual Report V.

Support Units Control Units Support Units Business Units 17 Profile and Governance ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNANCE Similarly to its parent company Intesa Sanpaolo, also VUB Bank applies a dual administration and control model, within which the control activities and strategic management are separated from the management of business activities performed by the Bank’s Management Board. Ownership and management are thus clearly defined and the Supervisory Board functions as a filter between the shareholders and the Management Board. The Bank’s management disposes of a full execution power, whereas the Supervisory Board performs the control function. This model provides for transparency and reduces the risk of a conflict of interests. BANK’S BODIES Bodies of VÚB, a.s. are the following: General Meeting, Supervisory Board, Management Board. GENERAL MEETING General Meetings are the Bank’s top decision-making body representing all shareholders and their decisions approved pursuant to applicable legal regulations and Bank’s Articles of Association are binding for all shareholders. The General Meeting consists of all attending shareholders. Members of the Supervisory and Management Boards regularly attend General Meetings facilitating their smooth course and simultaneously answering the questions and inquiries presented by shareholders. The Management Board is obliged to convene a regular General Meeting within the period of three months from the compilation of regular financial statements and its verification by an auditor. Should the interests of VÚB, a.s. require so and in cases stipulated by legal regulations an extraordinary General Meeting may be convened. SUPERVISORY BOARD Supervisory Board is the top control body of the Bank. It supervises the Management Board and performance of the Bank’s business activities. Save for members of Supervisory Board elected by the employees of VÚB, a.s., a member of the Supervisory Board may not be an employee of VÚB, a.s.. The Supervisory Board inspects and submits conclusions and/or recommendations to the General Meeting regarding mainly the following: fulfilment of tasks assigned to the Management Board by the General Meeting; compliance of VÚB, a.s.’s activities with the Articles of Association, and with legal regulations; and business and financial activities of VÚB, a.s., accounting, documentation, accounts, condition of property, payables and receivables of VÚB, a.s. The Supervisory Board has a minimum of three members and a maximum of seven members, out of whom one is the Chairman and at least one is a Vice Chairman. Members of the Supervisory Board are elected and removed by a decision of the General Meeting. Their term of office is three years. SUPERVISORY BOARD MEMBERS IN 2014: Ezio Salvai Chairman of Supervisory Board (since March 25, 2014) György Surányi Chairman of Supervisory Board (until March 25, 2014) Ignacio Jaquotot Vice Chairman of Supervisory Board Massimo Malagoli Supervisory Board member Paolo Sarcinelli Supervisory Board member Christian Schaack Supervisory Board member Andrej Straka Supervisory Board member – employee representative Ján Gallo Supervisory Board member – employee representative (since January 22, 2014) 18 Profile and Governance SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES Pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Banking Act No. 483/2001 Coll. in applicable version and the Accounting Act No. 431/2002 Coll. in applicable version and to the relevant provisions of the VUB Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board established the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. AUDIT COMMITTEE As of December 31, 2014, the Audit Committee consisted of five members including its Chairman. Three members were appointed by the General Meeting (one was appointed on April 3, 2012, another one on April 9, 2013 and the third one on March 25, 2014). Two members of the Audit Committee (appointed by Supervisory Board on 11 November 2013 and on March 25, 2014) are also members of the Supervisory Board. The issues discussed at its meetings are mainly related to: preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and observation of the special regulations; efﬁciency of internal control and risk management system in the Bank; compliance with regulatory requirements; audit of the individual ﬁnancial statements and audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Furthermore, the Audit Committee examines and monitors the independency of the auditor, especially services provided by the auditor according to a special regulation, recommends the appointment of an auditor for carrying out the audit of the Bank, and sets a date for an auditor to submit a statutory declaration about its independency. During 2014, the Audit Committee was inviting also the Bank’s external auditor to attend its meetings. The control function in VUB is performed by the Internal Audit and Control Department, the authorities and duties of which are deﬁned by the Supervisory Board, excluding those deﬁned by law. The Head of the Internal Audit and Control Department may be appointed to/withdrawn from the position upon the recommendation and prior consent issued by the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board also deﬁnes the remuneration and compensation scheme for this position.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee was founded in VUB in July 2012. It has 3 members, all of whom are members of the Supervisory Board. The committee meets at least once a year. Its main roles are to independently assess the compensation principles of the selected positions (according to the Banking Act) and their impact on the management of risk, own funds and liquidity; prepare decisions concerning the compensation of the selected positions including decisions affecting the risks and the management of risks in the Bank, which are to be made by the VUB Management Board; take into account long-term interests of shareholders, investors and other interested parties of the Bank in preparing these decisions and oversee the remuneration of selected positions.

It is managed by the corporate responsibility manager, who is simultaneously a member of the international coordination group for corporate responsibility of the parent company Intesa Sanpaolo. The unit’s task is to provide support, guidance and where necessary also coordinate the corporate responsibility activities through designated representatives from each bank division. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GROUP A bank-wide corporate responsibility group has been continuously working in the interest of implementing corporate responsibility principles into all aspects of the Bank’s activities. Representatives for each bank division were nominated to this group by the Management Board. The group is responsible for:  implementation of corporate responsibility principles into the division’s activities,  management and monitoring of all corporate responsibility aspects in their divisions,  supply of qualitative and quantitative data for the purposes of compiling the annual corporate responsibility report,  quarterly supply of qualitative and quantitative data for the parent company. Managerial decisions in the area of corporate responsibility are in the competence of the Chief Executive Officer, whereas all activities are regularly reported to the Bank’s Management Board on a quarterly basis. Codes and policies concerning corporate responsibility are always approved by the Management Board, which is responsible for performance in the financial, social and environmental areas. 26 Our Responsibility CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGY Satisfied Satisfied clients employees Our aim Satisfied Satisfied shareholders public Subsidiary banks implement into their activities corporate responsibility values, policies and principles identical with the ones of their parent bank Intesa Sanpaolo. The model that the parent bank applies is based on the premise that equally as the bank itself also all employees are owners of responsibility in their day-to-day activities. Important is a complex approach to sustainability and addressing the needs of Bank’s individual stakeholders, whether it is company owners, employees or clients. The result is implementation of unified corporate responsibility policies and principles. EDUCATION OF EMPLOYEES In 2014, we trained all employees of VUB on the values of Bank, corporate culture and corporate responsibility. This activity entitled CSR Drops was prepared and covered by the parent bank Intesa Sanpaolo. The employees were informed of corporate responsibility principles in the Bank’s business activities and in form of short videos they got familiarized with inspirational activities of the entire international network of subsidiary banks. Successful examples of corporate responsibility in every-day activities of the Bank were presented by the employees who were actively engaged in them. The corporate responsibility managers participated also in the initial international workshop. Dialogue with Stakeholders VUB Bank runs several programs aimed at dialogue and communication with our stakeholders influenced by our business activity. We focus mainly on dialogue with our key stakeholders in these forms:  customer satisfaction surveys,  solving of client inquiries,  employee surveys and polls,  discussion between employees and Bank’s management,  communication with the community. The greatest attention is paid to the category of clients, mainly through several types of client satisfaction surveys. The survey is built on the basis of a recognized international indicator European Customer Satisfaction Index. Client inquiries are examined by the Customer Care Department, which consistently accepts and analyzes all inquiries, their justification and causes providing a feedback to other sub-departments in form of proposals for improvement in processes, products and prevention of similar potential wrongdoings in the future. For more details refer to the Clients V chapter. 27 Our Responsibility Attentive listening and dialogue are important also in relation to employees. Their satisfaction is periodically examined in form of employee surveys and by promoting Bank’s values and principles anchored in the Code of Ethics. In 2014, a regular survey identifying employee satisfaction was performed in the whole Intesa Sanpaolo Group. During the whole year, we are carrying out also internal polls on various topics. We also implemented the measures that ensued from a survey focused especially on female employees and their satisfaction with harmonization of their work and private lives. The employees have a chance to pose questions directly to the Chief Executive Officer by means of an Intranet form. For more details refer to the Employees V chapter. In order to learn about the needs of communities the Corporate Responsibility Staff Unit organizes meetings with the representatives of communities, the third sector, education system and other entities. All forms of dialogue and communication with stakeholders we engage in are specified in individual chapters of this report. The stakeholder dialogue results in measures and commitments that the Bank implements into its business and action plans. All these measures help us deliver the Bank’s mission, improve our services and products, as well as manage our relations with the Bank’s stakeholders in order to achieve an evenly balanced relation satisfying for both parties. ADVOCATING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLES VUB Bank engages also in advocating corporate responsibility principles and raising awareness among entrepreneurs and the wide public alike. Since 2004, it has been a member of an informal association called the Business Leaders Forum (BLF) joining leaders in enforcement of corporate responsibility principles in Slovakia. In 2014, BLF concentrated on the topic of responsible supplier chain and ecological efficiency. Already for the third time, VUB Bank was a partner of the international conference which is annually held in Bratislava entitled Central European CSR Summit and Corporate Responsibility Week. Business Ethics and Management of Sensitive Aspects We are a bank that committed itself to corporate responsibility and our clients, shareholders, employees and suppliers expect us to be ethical in conducting our business. This is the very reason why VUB decided to implement ethics into its business taking specific steps and within various important measures it introduced also a Code of Ethics. It is a set of principles, which have a strategic meaning for us and regulate the behaviour of our employees. Each employee, without any exception, is required to get familiarized with it, while its observance is continuously monitored and its breach penalized. This Code of Ethics is followed up by a corporate anti-corruption program with specific system and organizational measures, including an internal audit control system. Considering the great responsibility that we as a bank bear towards our depositors, shareholders and naturally towards our clients, we must comply with a variety of legal regulations. Their observance is supervised by regulators. But we take it even further. We follow also such rules that are not imposed on us by any law or required by any authority, but which we consider commonplace as they give our business an ethical dimension. Throughout 2014, VUB Bank was a not party to any significant proceeding. ETHICAL CODES No lying. We repeatedly state these words, which reflect the essence of all ethical codes VUB Bank acceded to. The effort to bring clear and true information is a reflection of one of our basic values in practice, being the transparency.  Consumer Protection Code of Ethics  European Agreement on a Voluntary Code of Conduct on Pre-Contractual Information for Home Loans  The European Code of Conduct on Home Loans (ESIS)  Ethical Code of Advertising Practice Versions of all ethical codes are published on the Internet site V. 28 Our Responsibility INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ETHICAL STANDARDS VUB Bank has continued in a targeted building of its Corporate Governance and in cooperation with its parent company Intesa Sanpaolo has been setting up its own internal corporate responsibility rules significantly beyond the basic scope required by the Slovak legislation. Currently applicable internal and external regulations:  VUB Code of Ethics,  Internal Group Code of Conduct,  Environmental Policy,  UN Global Compact,  Equator Principles,  Non-Armament Policy,  Gift Acceptance Policy,  Query Resolution Policy (so-called Whistle Blower Policy)  Policy for Management of Relations with Political Parties and Politically Engaged Parties, Clients Operating in Armament Industry and Risk Industries, Clients from Risk Countries and Transactions with Risk Countries in VUB Group. VUB Code of Ethics The VUB Code of Ethics derives from the Code of Ethics of Intesa Sanpaolo. The Code is one of the pillars of the corporate culture. It represents a framework of ethical and moral values, observance of which is the basic prerequisite for a successful growth and permanently sustainable development. It contains principles of conduct in relation to all stakeholders which raise the level of standards that each individual within the company must adhere to in order to have the trust of all parties involved. As a management tool and a part of a wider vision of the Group’s social and environmental responsibility, the Code of Ethics attributes the highest importance to all stakeholder relations. Electronic version of the document is published on V. In 2014, there were four internal breaches of the Code of Ethics by the employees. They pertained mainly to improper conduct with the clients in crisis situations. The employees were imposed sanctions. The Group Internal Code of Conduct The Code sets the basic principles of conduct by the company’s representatives, employees and external agents, who are obliged to execute their functions responsibly, honestly, fairly and professionally, while promoting the Bank and Group’s interests as well as taking into consideration the interests of clients and shareholders. Therefore, execution of decision-making authorities and each business activity must reflect all values and principles contained in the Code. The parent company and all Group’s companies promote by means of suitable internal control system and adequate trainings and information systems – respecting of applicable laws and regulations as well as compliance with general principles of conduct specified in the Code on all executive and operational levels and in every geographical context, where Intesa Sanpaolo performs its activities with the aim of protecting property, integrity and reputation of each company and the entire group. Environmental Policy Environmental Policy represents a written commitment to environmental protection, which sets a mission and objectives in the area of environmental management. The policy defines VUB Group’s approach to prevention, management and where possible also reduction of direct and indirect environmental impacts it generates as a result of its business activity. As a responsible company, VUB committed to manage the impacts of its business activity and reduce the impacts of its activities on the environment in cooperation with its stakeholders. We do not belong among significant direct polluters of the environment, but we preferentially strive to minimize potential negative impact on the environment to the lowest level possible. Global Compact (UN Global Treaty) VUB is a signatory of Global Compact V, a strategic initiative of the United Nations aimed at corporate responsibility. Worldwide, it was joined by over 5,000 companies from more than 100 countries. VUB committed to support the ten basic principles concerning human rights, labour conditions, environment and anti-corruption with its activities. These principles fully correspond with VUB’s values. Equator Principles Intesa Sanpaolo committed to observe the so-called Equator Principles V. It consists of a set of international rules for project financing designed by a group of international banks based on the policies of the International Finance Corporation. The principles are based on environmental and social standards of the World Bank and applied in project financing worth more than USD 10 million. The principles assist financial institutions in selecting projects with the aim of reducing social and environmental risks in project financing. They oblige the financing applicants 29 Our Responsibility to prepare a compulsory report on environmental impacts. In 2014, VUB Bank provided financing to one project of a small water power plant, which was meeting the Equator Principles criteria. Non-Armament Policy In accordance with values and principles of the Code of Ethics, this policy of Intesa Sanpaolo Group defines a ban on and transactions related to import and export of arms and armament systems. The Group members can assist clients in transactions concerning the existing intergovernmental agreements or other transactions for national armies, police or other armed forces of the state, which are considered compatible with the spirit of an “non armed bank“ based on an authorization by the competent unit of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. Gift Acceptance Policy This internal policy deriving from the Code of Ethics of VUB Bank governs principles and limitations to behaviour of Bank’s representatives and employees in accepting unsolicited gifts. It also sets the limits and rules of behaviour in gift acceptance. Policy for Management of Relations with Political Parties and Politically Engaged Parties, Clients Operating in Armament Industry and Risk Industries The policy stipulates mainly:  management of relations with political parties and politically engaged parties in the interest of preserving impartiality and independence Aiming to prevent potential reputation risk related to political parties and politically engaged parties, VUB Group is obliged to act impartially and independently. This means that companies, which are a part of VUB Group will approach the starting of business relations with political parties and politically engaged parties with utmost prudence.  management of relations with clients operating in the armament industry In connection with preservation of values and principles outlined in the Code of Ethics, the main goal of this policy is to prevent that VUB and its subsidiaries participate in the financing of activities and transactions concerning manufacturing of arms equipment as well as trading of this equipment for military purposes.  management of relations with clients operating in risky business fields (industry risk) Within VUB Group, clients and potential clients operating in the below industries / business fields are considered as risky:  exchange offices;  pawnbroker’s shops;  bars, night clubs, casinos;  gambling rooms with more than 3 gambling machines;  security agencies;  sex shops and pornography distributors;  debt collecting agency;  broker companies;  betting offices.  management of relations with clients and transactions from/to risk countries (country risk) Pursuant to the requirements of the binding regulation and Intesa Sanpaolo regulations, clients and potential clients from selected countries are considered risky, as well as all types of transactions and payments from and to these countries. 30 Our Responsibility CONFIDENTIAL DATA PROCESSING We respect client privacy and protect it. Pursuant to the law, we handle our clients’ data with utmost care and principally with their awareness and consent. On page V we post and continuously update the list of third parties that were provided data of our clients:  List of VUB’s mediators in the area of personal data processing and parties provided personal data constituting a bank secret,  List of third parties and recipients provided and made available personal data of clients and data constituting a bank secret. INVESTOR PROTECTION (MIFID) VUB keeps providing the highest possible level of protection not only to its retail clients, but also to clients included in the highest category of professional clients. VUB adopted and has been constantly enhancing several measures aimed at investor protection and solving of investors’ complaints. This legal regulation is embedded in the directive on financial markets, the so-called “MiFID” (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), implemented in the Securities Act. Our clients have access to documents V that will help them to better understand the financial instruments and provision of investment services. CLIENT PROTECTION IN PAYMENT SERVICES PROVISION VUB Bank continues in application of effective measures aimed at a better awareness of clients in provision of payment services in connection with implementation of the new “PSD“ (Payment Services Directive) directive in Slovakia by means of the Payment Services Act. Simultaneously, the Bank keeps enhancing the knowledge of its employees through internal training activities as to guarantee the highest possible comfort in practical use of the payment services by its clients. CLIENT PROTECTION IN FINANCIAL MEDIATION VUB Bank brought its activity into compliance with the requirements of the Act No. 186/2009 Coll. on Financial Mediation and Financial Advisory and on the Amendment and Supplementation of Certain Acts as amended, as to provide clients with the protection required by law. In the interest of securing a higher protection of client rights, in financial mediation VUB Bank is trying to approach each client as a non-professional client. The basic information on financial mediation, products subject to it and on affiliated and subordinated financial agents, with whom VUB Bank cooperates, is published on our Internet pages V. CLIENT PROTECTION IN CONSUMER LENDING VUB Bank provides consumer loans in accordance with the Act No. 129/2010 Coll. on Consumer Loans and Other Loans for Consumers and on the Amendment and Supplementation of Certain Acts as amended. CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY VUB Bank commits to avoid a conflict between private interests of its employees and the interests of the Bank. The employees are liable to take all required measures in order to avoid a conflict of interest. In case a conflict of interest occurs, employees shall solve such a conflict to the benefit of the Bank. The employees may never misuse their connection with the Bank to promote their personal interests or harm the Bank’s reputation by their actions nor can they misuse their position or confidential information to prefer a job applicant or a person aiming to start a business relation with the Bank. The Bank evaluates the measures and procedures implemented to prevent, minimize and solve a potential conflict of interest on a regular basis. VUB introduced measures for minimization of occurrence of an external conflict of interests in economic activities of employees and in transactions between the Bank and an employee or a person related to an employee. The employees should consult their working activities outside their main employment or involvement in business activities with their superior. The Bank has no objections against employees getting involved in activities outside their work as volunteers or otherwise provided that the activity does not obstruct performance of their regular work for the Bank or is not in conflict with internal rules of the Bank and the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. VUB also applies and adheres to special measures designed to prevent conflicts of interests in the area of investment services. Their main aim is to prevent conflicts of interests or cope with inevitable conflicts of interests as to prevent 31 Our Responsibility the risk of harming the clients’ interests. These measures are monitored and their efficiency is regularly evaluated. In relation with occurrence of a potential conflict of interest, VUB Bank declares that it will notify clients of the nature and source of the conflict prior to provision of an investment service or prior to performing an activity and in case of their provision or execution it will always prefer the clients’ interests to its own ones. In case of a conflict of interests between the clients themselves it will ensure an equal and fair treatment of all clients. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND ANTI-TERRORISM In the anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist financing, we are progressing in line with the Slovak and also the European legislation ensuring protection of our clients as well as of the Bank itself. In the banking sector, we are a stakeholder of the Financial Investigation Unit (FIU), which operatively evaluates the clients’ behaviour signals we report and is under a permanent supervision of the regulatory authority of the National Bank of Slovakia. Our activity in the area of Bank’s protection against money laundering or terrorist financing is intensifying and we dedicate this area greater attention. We do not want to support these negative phenomena not even indirectly by enabling financial flows by means of our products, services or in any connection with the Bank. Therefore, we follow strictly set up internal rules to prevent money-laundering and terrorist financing in form of detection of unusual business transactions. For this purpose, the Bank developed and implemented its own program of antimoney laundering and anti-terrorist financing activities deriving from:  Slovak legislation,  European legislation,  international FATF recommendations, recommendations of The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and Wolfsberg Principles, US Patriot Act,  group rules of Intesa Sanpaolo in the area of anti-money laundering as well as against risky entities and countries. We apply Customer Due Diligence pursuant to the valid legislation and take into consideration the risk profile of individual clients. Within its organizational structure, the Bank defined a specialized unit charged with implementation, execution and coordination of activities related to protection of the Bank against its misuse for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing. The unit reports directly to the Deputy CEO and is responsible also for detection of unusual business transactions and cooperation with the respective regulatory authorities. It also ensures monitoring of all financial transactions as required by law and the international legislation. The unit’s activities include also evaluation of international payment transactions in real time constituting first-level prevention of connection between the bank sector and a sanctioned or risky person and/or entity. AWARENESS The Bank created a specialized unit dedicated to disclosure of frauds and corruption, which is a part of the Risk Management Division. It closely cooperates primarily with the Internal Audit and Control Department and the Compliance Department. All bank employees are informed of internal ethical standards and the zero tolerance principle while having access to the basic information on the steps that are necessary to take in case of any corruption or fraud suspicion. Since the Bank has an eminent interest in disclosing corruption and frauds, it implemented the so-called Whistle Blower Policy enabling each bank employee to communicate his/her suspicion preserving his/her anonymity. The Bank does not conceal the detected corruption and fraud cases from its employees, but on the contrary it decided to inform and educate its managers in order to constantly improve their work and eliminate shortcomings and errors in this area in the future. Due to this reason, the managers are informed of some cases that occurred in the past. Within initial trainings, all new hires in the retail network are given a special presentation on fraud and corruption risks including typical signs of a risky behaviour. The main objective of this training activity is to increase prevention and/or minimize occurrence of these cases. DISCRIMINATION BAN On all levels and in relation to all its stakeholders, VUB Bank observes the non-discrimination principles, which are firmly anchored in our Code of Ethics and system of values. One of VUB’s values is that “We do not discriminate 32 Our Responsibility We commit that we shall exclude from our actions any discrimination and shall respect differences based on sex, age, race, faith, political opinion, participation in unions, language skills or impairment.“ For more information on its application refer to the Employees chapter V. CORRUPTION AND FRAUDULENT ACTIONS Clearly Defined Approach and Principles VUB Bank has been fulfilling and committed to fulfil high moral and ethical standards built on clearly declared principles. All bank employees have been informed of these principles by means of various forms (distributed brochures, internal campaign, posting on Intranet). The principles are as follows:  The Bank requires all its employees to act honestly, with integrity and protect sources and information in their work environment or for which they bear responsibility.  The Bank committed to ensure that fraud and corruption risk would be reduced to the lowest level possible.  These principles relate to all unusual cases involving employees as well as external consultants, suppliers, contractual stakeholders and/or any third party in a business relation with this organization.  All employees must take decisions individually in line with the Bank’s interests. They must not act with the aim of gaining financial or other material advantage for themselves, their family or close ones. Zero Tolerance VUB Bank clearly proclaims its absolute zero tolerance principle regarding corruption and frauds. All bank employees are informed about the following principles:  The Bank shall not accept any form of fraudulent or corrupt acting, therefore each case will be thoroughly examined and relevant measures drawn from it.  Each participation in a fraud or fraud attempt shall lead to dismissal and potential criminal charges.  Necessary investigation shall be performed irrespective of the relation of the given person to this organization, his/her work position or employment duration. Measures for Corruption and Fraud Reduction Internal Control System The Bank incorporated into its processes various control mechanisms in order to reduce the corruption and fraud risk to the minimum level possible. The Bank clearly sets the necessity of a control mechanism for each bank process, where corruption and fraud risk is imminent (e.g. verification of decisions, 4-eyes control, access rights management etc.). The internal control system consists of three levels: statutory, executive and control. Internal Audit The Bank established an internal audit and control unit, which is an independent supervising body (unit directly reporting to the Bank’s Supervisory Board and not to the Management Board). One of its main roles is to verify the functionality of internal control system, compliance with external and internal legislation including the Bank’s Code of Ethics, verification of internal control failures and internal fraud suspicions. In 2014, the Internal Audit and Control unit examined the internal control system in all corporate branches, in approximately half of the retail branches and it also carried out several specialized audits related to internal fraud and corruption risk. Verified were also all key processes in the Bank selected based on an annually prepared risk map. On the grounds of the risks identified within individual audits, the Bank immediately adopted corrective measures and set up a regular monitoring of such areas and if necessary notified the respective state bodies. 33 Clients Clients Clients are one of our most important stakeholders and therefore in the centre of our interest and our priority. It does not matter if the client is an individual or a large company; we treat every client equally responsibly and professionally. Our strategy in this area stands on three pillars:  development of retail banking,  development of SME segment,  enhancing the quality of services, improvement of processes, innovation of Bank’s products and distribution channels.

The fact that VUB Bank has a good approach towards clients and has been building long-term relations based on trust and client satisfaction is confirmed also by the many awards it won in 2014. Review of the 2014 awards can be found in the introductory chapter V.

Moreover, we offer also products aimed at contribution to sustainability of the environment. Our clients are:  Small and medium enterprises,  Large companies,  Towns and municipalities,  Farmers,  Administrators of flats and apartment buildings. 35 Clients MUNICIPALITIES VUB Bank has a position of a strong and reliable partner also in the segment of self-administrations. Combining special advisory and tailored products, we assist the self-administrations in executing their projects. To a great extent, we participate in co-financing of projects supported from EU funds aimed at developing the infrastructure of towns, municipalities and regions. FINANCIAL AND CAPITAL MARKETS We render services to a wide spectrum of clients, which are financial institutions and the business clientele including legal and natural entities. We support and have a close cooperation with the clients of retail and private banking and communicate with many partners in the interbank market on a daily basis.

CLOSER TO CLIENTS BRANCH NETWORK VUB Bank provides its products and services in Slovakia by means of the second largest network of retail branches. As at 31/12/2014 the clients had at their disposal:  196 retail branches,  11 mortgage centres,  32 corporate branches. Number of Branches 2014 2013 2012 Retail branches 196 200 203 Mortgage centres 11 11 11 Corporate branches 32 32 32 36 Clients All VUB Bank branches are available to clients 5 days a week. In each regional town, there is at least one retail branch operating 7 days a week and 10 hours a day. We had 19 of such sales points (retail branches) and 1 mortgage centre. We strive to make our branches easily available to people with physical disabilities. All newly opened sales points dispose of a barrier-free access and when reconstructing older sales points we always make sure they are barrierfree. Fifty percent of ATMs have hardware arrangements for communication with sight-impaired individuals. Number of Barrier-free Branches 2014 2013 2012 181 181 183 KONTAKT CENTRE The Kontakt Centre provides services to all clients, whether in Slovakia or abroad, for Slovak Republic citizens and also foreigners. It operates non-stop 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The operators ensure service and consultancy by telephone and also e-mail. They also carry out activities related to safety of clients’ funds, whether it is safe working with Internet Banking or payment cards safety. AUTOMATIC TELLER MACHINES By number of ATMs, VUB Bank ranks second within Slovakia. As at 31/12/2014, VUB Bank operated 572 ATMs. Number of ATMs 2014 2013 2012 572 566 560 In 2014, VUB Bank brought a new method of depositing money to account whether personal or corporate. In four major shopping centres, we installed special teller machines equipped with a smart depositing module that enables, besides dispensing cash, to also receive cash in euro. Our clients can thus make deposits at any time without being limited by opening hours of branches or waiting in queue. In addition to Internet and Mobile Banking, they can use yet another up-to-date channel. Moreover, we installed also a device for inserting of cash, which will take over the cash, count it and check the banknotes’ authenticity. Processing of cash and settlement of potential differences will be performed in the Processing Centre outside the branch. The benefit is that a client making a deposit via this device does not have to wait for processing and verification of the banknotes at the branch’s cash desk. An alternative for merchants is a device for inserting of cash in a safe single-use package. This device allows also insertion of a small number of coins. DIRECT BANKING In 2014, VUB Bank brought a new version of Internet and Mobile Banking. In addition to the classical online application, it is available for all types of mobile devices, whether it is a smartphone or a classical mobile telephone featuring an Internet browser regardless of the type of operating system. It provides the clients with a high user comfort, modern design, new functionalities and interesting novelties. It offers for example a graphic viewing of income and expenses on the accounts, a more detailed overview of investments in mutual funds or structured information on payment cards. We added a customizable home page and a more comfortable control. A novelty is the option to electronically, without visiting the branch, request also products: get a loan, mortgage, term deposit or a savings account or invest into mutual funds. We got inspired also by the suggestions of our clients, so the applications feature a modern design, are simpler and more transparent. They also offer new elements facilitating the control for colour blind and visually impaired clients. 37 Clients SECURITY VUB IS THE SAFEST BANK IN SLOVAKIA According to the Global Finance magazine, which annually publishes the ranking of the safest banks worldwide based on the long-term ratings by the agencies Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch and total assets of the individual banks, in 2014 VUB Bank was labelled the safest bank in Slovakia. The foreign experts appreciated our responsible approach to the banking business and our prudence in taking on risk. We are well equipped in terms of capital and belong to the banks with the lowest non-performing loans ratio in Slovakia. SECURITY AND PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION Protection of confidential data and privacy of our clients is commonplace for us. All information and documents about our clients, which are not publicly accessible, mainly the information on clients’ transactions with the Bank and on account balances, are subject to bank secret. BRANCH SECURITY All VUB Bank branches are, in compliance with the relevant regulations, equipped with a security camera system and other security equipment. The basic security rule at branches is that security and protection of our clients’ lives and health come always before the protection of the Bank’s property. PAYMENT CARD AND ATM SECURITY The trend to pay online by card is constantly moving forward and along with it also the threat of card misuse. Due to this reason, in 2014 we enabled our clients to set up their online limit by means of electronic banking services. Starting from 2014, the holders of MasterCard and VISA credit cards are able not only to block but also to set up limits for payments at merchants and repeatedly change it. A limit change is executed immediately and free of charge. This measure brings clients a higher level of safety minimizing the possibility of card misuse online. All a client needs to do is to set up a zero limit for online transactions and in case of need to temporarily increase it to the necessary level. Currently, all our payment cards are equipped with a chip. Another form of securing payment cards is insurance in the event of misuse, of a lost or stolen card. This insurance covers holders of payment cards for legal entities and it is provided automatically and without any fees. The insurance covers unauthorized transactions made during 24 hours prior to reporting the blockage of the lost or stolen card. For increased security, our ATMs have been installed an anti-skimming protection. DIALOGUE WITH CUSTOMERS We realize that not only figures, charts or volumes, but also the “client satisfaction” category is the indicator of and key to our success. It is rooted in quality service and our effort for continuous improvement on the basis of communication and feedback from clients. CUSTOMER CARE AND QUERY RESOLUTION VUB Bank has a separate department for client care and solution of client queries. It is in charge of increasing the client satisfaction and for this it directly uses the feedback from clients, who can turn to the Bank by means of all available channels:  in person at any of the Bank’s branches,  telephonically to the Kontakt Service (tel. 0850 123 000),  in writing to the Customer Care Department (Mlynské nivy 1, 829 90 Bratislava 25),  via the Internet form In 2014, the number of inquiries from clients decreased by approximately 5%. 38 Clients Number of Queries 2014 2013 2012 13,074 13,813 15,013 Feedback from our clients can be positive and also negative. Praise from clients always please us and therefore we have developed an initiative in the Bank to gather all praising reactions comments in one place. Such comments are forwarded also directly to the concerned employee, his/her superiors and we publish them on our corporate Intranet as positive examples and motivation. Not all client queries are positive. We record all complaints, requests and claims in the banking system and reply to them according to the valid legislation. Based on resolution and analysis of those less pleasing queries, the Bank changed many of its processes and internal settings. We are therefore very grateful for each feedback we obtain from our clients. Despite the age of modern technologies more than 50% of clients still prefer personal contact in branch. Input Channels for Receipt of Inquiries 2014* % 2013* % 2012 % Branch network (in person) 7,665 63.56 7,058 57.30 9,285 55.09 Kontakt Centre (by telephone) 3,862 32.03 4,694 38.10 4,729 37.39 Bank’s Head Office (in writing) 532 4.41 566 4.60 999 7.52 * excluding the requests The most frequent client queries concerned complaints related to payment card transactions. In view of the great number of card transactions performed on daily basis this fact is expected. Malfunctioning of devices is the second most common reason for complaints. The average period of query resolution is 11.3 days. The queries that clients addressed directly to the bank ombudsman of Slovak Republic recorded a decline in 2014. There were 10, whereas in 2013 there were 23 such cases. In 2014, we continued in successful activities from the past years. In September, across the entire Intesa Sanpaolo Group we celebrate The Clients Day. Through various activities we emphasize to our clients that they are important to us and we appreciate their trust they show us as a bank. Moreover, we asked them about supplementary services to our existing products that they would welcome or prefer. We found out that our clients appreciated various possibilities of loyalty programs. The results were forwarded to the competent units dedicated to product innovation. Within the Clients Day, the branch manager was traditionally welcoming the clients and they got small presents. LISTENING 100% We realize that a prerequisite for permanent success is the ability to correctly identify the needs of clients. Therefore also in 2014, we continued in our successful “Listening 100 %“ V program focused on enhancing the quality of our services, improving processes, product innovation and Bank’s distribution channels. Twice a year, we carry out a Client Satisfaction Survey, namely according to the internationally acclaimed calculation methodology The European Customer Satisfaction Index. The aim of the survey is to obtain from our clients feedback on the Bank, quality of sale, products and services as well as their overall satisfaction. It focuses especially at:  retail and SME clients,  corporate clients. 39 Clients European Customer Satisfaction Index 85.0 84.0 83.0 82.0 81.0 12 12 13 13 14 14 10 10 10 10 11 11 11 11 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 1 st 2 st 1 st 2 st 2 st 2 st 1 Q Q2 3 Q 4 Q Q 1 2 Q Q3 Q4 HY HY HY HY HY HY Within the Listening 100% project V, we run also a comparative survey of the level of satisfaction of clients with the services of banking houses in Slovakia, the Interbank Satisfaction Survey of Retail and SME Clients (Bank benchmarking, retail and SME customers). The information obtained in the survey is processed under the international standard The European Customer Satisfaction Index. Both surveys are performed in cooperation with an independent external international surveying agency. 100 % 1HY 2014 2HY 2014 90 % 79.6 80.4 79.1 79.5 78.3 79.1 80 % 78.0 76.7 76.6 76.5 70 % 60 % VÚB Competitive bank 1 Competitive bank 2 Competitive bank 3 Competitive bank 4 BRANCH EVALUATION Since 2006, we implemented a system of branch evaluation based on strict qualitative parameters. Within these criteria we do not monitor the volume of sold products, but the parameters concerning the quality of client service and quality of sale, consultancy and qualified client assistance. It helps us to identify problem areas of the individual branches. PROCESSES FOR CLIENT SERVICE IMPROVEMENT In 2014, we completed the project of centralization of activities at the Back Office, which brought an integration and improvement of the existing processes at corporate branches ensuring thus a higher comfort for clients in handling of their requests and a comprehensive and fast service. RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES VUB Bank dedicates attention to an ongoing development of products and their improvement. VÚB takes into consideration also the weak, vulnerable or otherwise disadvantaged groups. Among the products developed especially for those groups are for instance Senior konto (Senior Account), charity card Dobrý Anjel (Good Angel), discounts on loans and accounts for students or Flexi Mortgage for young people. In 2014, VÚB brought its clients the following responsible products and services: 40 Clients VIRTUAL DEBIT CARD The digitalization trend in Slovakia is progressing and we follow up on this trend by expanding our offer of top-notch and safe options for executing payments. At the end of 2014, we extended our product portfolio by a new payment card VISA Inspire Mobile Payments offering the clients an innovative, fast and comfortable method of payment for goods and services. This is a virtual debit payment card, which is a part of the Wave2Pay mobile application. Its holder is able to perform purchases of goods and services by means of a smart phone. VUB Bank was the first in Slovakia and the second in Europe to use the NFC technology with locating sensitive card data on a cloud for contactless payments. Payments by means of the mobile application are not linked to a specific mobile operator, so the client does not have to change his/her SIM card. In the Wave2Pay mobile application, the clients have an overview of executed transactions, access to account balance, overview of daily limit utilization as well as the daily number of transactions and geolocation of the performed transactions thanks to which the cardholder can see the location / address, where he/she performed the given transaction. CONTACTLESS TECHNOLOGIES In 2014, VUB Bank continued issuing cards supporting contactless technology, which increases the comfort and speed of payments. At the end of the year, the Bank had nearly 529,000 cards issued, which is up by 24 % against the last year. Year 2014 2013 2012 Number of Contactless Card 528,981 428,604 205,433 % of out total number of cards 41 33 15 POS PAYMENT TERMINALS In Slovakia and also abroad, each year the number of payment terminals supporting the contactless technology is growing. It allows the clients to pay for goods and services at merchants quickly and safely. In addition, after agreement with selected merchants, VUB enables to execute also additional services on its terminals such as invoice payment or recharging of prepaid SIM cards of mobile operators. During all of 2014, holders of payment cards in the network of VUB Bank’s payment terminals performed transactions with a turnover of EUR 1,133 mil., whereas the trend of shifting transactions from the previously popular ATMs precisely in favour of cashless payments executed via payment terminals or online continues, which in 2014 represented already 66% out of the total number of card transactions. POS / Coverage of Contactless Terminals by VUB Bank Year 2014 2013 % 42 26 PRODUCTS FOR STUDENTS FLEXI LOAN FOR STUDENTS This is one of the possibilities how students can finance their studies. According to a survey, a university student spends for his/her study EUR 2,000 – 4,400 per year depending on his/her financial situation, place of study and university type. The statistics of the Centre for Scientific and Technical Information of the Slovak Republic suggests that common monthly expenses of university students range from EUR 230 270. The study is usually financed by the family, but the university students also try to get scholarships and make some money through temporary works. Another option is taking on a loan from a bank. Based on this information and needs of students, VUB Bank prepared for students aged 15-24 a new product – a convenient loan. This is a loan up to EUR 5,000 with maturity of 6 years, while MBA students can get a loan up to EUR 25,000. Active students pay only 50 % of the up-front fee and get other benefits. For example for excellent study results, scientific activities or volunteering they can have their interest reduced by as much as 3 %. In 2014, students were granted loans in the total volume of EUR 1,105,300. START KONTO Besides a convenient loan, VUB Bank offers the young people (students and non-students alike) aged between 15 and 24 years a free of charge maintenance of Start Konto, to which the products and services are tailored 41 Clients to the needs of young people, for example the payment card VISA Classic or contactless card VISA Inspire, the card payments or withdrawals from VUB ATMs are not charged. A bonus is a free-of-charge insurance against a loss or theft of ID documents, keys, bag or wallet but also against a misuse of a mobile telephone SIM card. For a fast and safe payment the students can use a mobile application with a contactless payment sticker VISA Inspire Wave 2 Pay. A savings account called Start Generation is offered to the young aged 25 26 featuring a more favourable interest, free-of-charge services Flexi Saving and Personal Credit Line, no charges for card payments, ATM withdrawals and other convenient products and services. PRODUCTS FOR YOUNG FAMILIES FLEXI MORTGAGE FOR THE YOUNG The loan is a more favourable, subsidized mortgage for the young up to 35 years old, who need to invest into a purchase, construction, reconstruction or modernization of a real estate. The advantage of this product is a lower instalment and a possibility to get a higher loan amount. The title to the interest benefit valid for the first five years from the granting of the mortgage was for those whose gross average income was up to EUR 1,153. The amount of the benefit is 3% (2% subsidized by the state, 1% by the Bank). The subsidy to the commercial interest rate was possible to gain for the maximum amount of EUR 50,000 and simultaneously for the maximum amount corresponding to 70% of the real estate value. In case of a maximum 50-thousand mortgage with a 30-year maturity, thanks to the benefit a young person may save monthly even more than EUR 80, which in 5 years of the benefit duration represents the amount exceeding EUR 5,000. In addition to financial savings, the mortgage for the young allows to reduce instalments to a half or defer the repayment of principal during a period of two years at birth of a child. The advantage of a subsidized mortgage is also that any of its parts can be repaid during the first five years without any fees. In 2014, we granted almost 4,000 convenient mortgages for the young in the total volume of EUR 220 million. LOAN FOR NEWLY WEDS It is designed for young married couples below 35 years of age. The loan amount is up to EUR 10,000 with a maturity of 7 years. Its popularity is falling proportionately to the increase of applicants interested in Flexi Mortgage for the Young. Number of Granted Loans for Newly Weds Year 2014 2013 Number of Loans 12 30 Total Amount 83,300 227,200 PRODUCTS FOR SENIORS SENIOR KONTO It is a product for the beneficiaries of the pension benefit offering a convenient package of services to a current account, a free-of-charge payment card, a more favourable payment for account maintenance (only € 0.95 per month) and payments via payment card at merchants free of charge. In 2014, we recorded 9,260 active senior accounts. ACCOUNTS AND LOANS VUB Bank has been a long-term leader in housing loans. In 2014, it won the 1st place in the competition entitled Mortgage of the Year 2014 announced by Fincentrum & Trend and a Golden Coin for a popular product Flexi Mortgage. In 2014, we ran an online survey aimed at the interest of Slovaks in housing loans. The respondents 42 Clients aged 18 to 60 gave positive comments on their decision to take on a mortgage (nine out of ten) and a majority of Slovaks with a mortgage loan admit that it was an inevitable solution and the only option how to make the dream about their own housing come true. The Slovaks realize the importance of saving – nearly 60 % of the population is trying to save. However, only 15 % of Slovaks is able to do it regularly. A fifth of us claim that they are unable to save because of repaying loans and debts. SAVINGS LOAN (ŠETRIPÔŽIČKA) It is a convenient loan concentrated on saving, available as an all-purpose loan or as a refinancing loan. If regularly repaid, VUB sends to the client’s saving account 8 % of each monthly instalment of the Savings Loan. For example, in case of a seven thousand loan for eight years the client can get back even more than EUR 1,000. GREEN FLEXI MORTGAGE It supports low-energy sources, use of renewable energy or technological innovations supporting the green technologies in construction and reconstruction of real estates. VUB Bank is the first bank in Slovakia to provides clients with a direct support in investments into ecological projects in form of up to 100% discount on the up-front fee for loan granting. In 2014, we granted Green Flexi Mortgages in the total volume of EUR 92,000. ELECTRONIC EXPERT OPINION It saves time and also money. VUB Bank clients could get their Flexi Mortgage arranged faster and without an upfront fee if to the expert opinion they attached also its electronic form. This option was developed based on the initiative of our clients and in the interest of accelerating the approval process. SAVINGS ACCOUNT It is a non-term account in EUR enabling clients to save quickly and easily by putting aside the free funds at a more favourable interest rate compared with a classical current account. The savings account is a product that the clients can choose also within the account for the young entitled Start Generation. The account is kept without any fees for maintenance and payment transactions. PROFI LOANS FOR STARTING ENTREPRENEURS They have a simplified approval process and document submission. In 2014, VUB Bank granted Profi Loans in the total volume of EUR 109,358,302. PROFI MORTGAGE In 2014, this convenient business loan was extended by other loan purposes: refinancing and financing of movable assets. At the same time, 20 % of the amount of loan granted can be used without having to document the loan purpose. FLEXI LOAN FOR FARMERS Agricultural business is different from other types of businesses, mainly as for the seasonality, obtaining of payments for goods or support of various activities from the funds of the European Union. It requires an adjustment of terms and conditions and development of special tailored products. Flexi Loan for Farmers accommodates the farmers and serves to bridge the period between the need to finance operating costs to cover the increased finance needs. It can be used for example to buy equipment, technologies, buildings, seeds, protective aids or fertilizers. FLEXI LAND It is an investment loan for the purchase of agricultural land with an accelerated and easier application process. 43 Clients LOANS FOR ASSOCIATIONS OF APARTMENT AND APARTMENT HOUSES OWNERS Also in 2014, we focused on improving the quality of products supporting energetic efficiency. Significant changes in the product include prolongation of the maximum maturity period to 25 years, simplification of drawing terms and conditions and increased information comfort for the client e.g. by means of multi-alternative propositions. SIMPLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN COMMUNICATION We want our Bank’s cooperation with clients to be always simple, comfortable and beneficial. We are concerned about them being able to exercise their rights and knowing the Bank’s obligations towards them. As a signatory of Consumer Protection Code of Ethics we inform our clients on everything in the most open manner possible. We provide them with information on our products and services through:  employees,  sales points,  information flyers,  brochures and user handbooks,  web pages (vub V, flexihypoteka V, flexiucet V, flexibiznisucet V, startkonto V). In addition to current information about the Bank and its products and services, clients and the general public as well are made available also various interactive calculators, e.g. for calculating their maximum loan amount. FINANCIAL EDUCATION In order to raise the clients’ financial awareness, on our Internet site, we have a section dedicated to financial education V. It is available to clients and non-clients alike where they can:  get information on the financing options in various life situations,  explore the world of bank products and see that it is not so complex,  learn to manage their finances in a more efficient and time-saving fashion. For clarification and facilitation of work with Internet Banking, we prepared instructional videos for our clients (one to two-minute video instructions containing advice on how to proceed in individual operations). PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS In VUB, we honour our clients and therefore we adjust our range of products and services to their needs and specific requirements. We are trying to know our clients and differentiate our product portfolio so it would meet the requirements of our client base in the maximum extent possible. One of the forms of coming closer to our clients, communicating and cooperating with them is to conclude agreements with professional associations (chambers and associations). It is VUB Bank’s interest to foster possibly most intense cooperation with professional associations in terms of mutual communication, promotion of activities, marketing activities and utilization of bank products and services by their members. The cooperation is intended to make the Bank’s products and services as available to the members of professional associations as possible. For this reason, our website features a special section for professional associations V. Continuous progress, trustworthiness, reliability and honesty are the main values we follow in satisfying the needs of professional association members. Our partners include:  Association of Private Physicians,  Chamber of Slovak Republic Veterinaries,  Slovak Dentist Chamber,  Slovak Medical Chamber,  Slovak Sole Trader Chamber,  other chambers with special offers. 44 Employees Employees TARGET FULFILMENT FOR 2014 Target Fulfilment STATUS Collective Agreement 2014 2016  At the beginning of 2014, a new Collective Agreement was signed for the period 2014 2016. Fulfilment of obligations arising thereunder is each year evaluated and conditions are negotiated for the following period. Besides the annual evaluation, the Bank and the Trade Union Representatives hold meetings each month discussing topics such as: basic rights of employees, discrimination ban, wage forms and wage funds, training of employees, working hours and time-off, social fund, services provided to employees. Modification of Basic Working Hours  In the first half of 2014, there was a pilot of modification of the basic working hours at the workplaces with flexible working hours. The employees could finish work at 3:00 p.m. (shortening by an hour) any day of the week given they fulfilled the agreed conditions. The test went well and then the modification of the basic working hours was introduced also into common operations. We perceive it as one of the steps towards a better harmonization of work and private life of employees. Recruitment  In 2014, we hired approximately 500 new employees. In order to make the communication with applicants more attractive, we set up a new form of advertising and new communication standards. In majority of cases, the managerial positions in the retail business network were staffed by internal candidates whom we are preparing within the program “Managerial Bench“. The aim is identification, development and preparation of future managers from among the employees of small branches. Last year, we engaged 40 colleagues. The program will continue also in 2015. Retention and Motivational Program  In the interest of reducing turnover, we designed a retention and motivational program for the employees. Within the entire bank, we selected candidates in individual categories talents, key employees and successors. According to individual motivators, we prepared for them a special program aimed at remuneration, training and other benefits. Satisfaction Survey “Questions for Our Female Colleagues“  This is the title of the anonymous satisfaction survey aimed at all women working in VUB Bank. Opinions on work-life balance were voiced by 38 % colleagues, while some were also part of the focus groups in five towns. The discussions hosted women working at the Head Office and also in branches in various regions, managers and non-managers, with children and also childless, ladies of various age categories and family statuses. The survey sample thus comprehensibly represented the female employees of the Bank. Within the survey, we were asking them about their opinions on various topics: work – life balance, career development, reasons for a lower number of women in high managerial positions, personal experience with discrimination subjective perception of gender inequalities, specific position of some groups (mothers with minor children, women 50+) perception of adopted measures which ensued from the first survey in 2011. 46 Employees Target Fulfilment STATUS The survey was processed by the Institute for Public Affairs and its outcomes present a valuable feedback. We worked closely with the processed outcomes and based on them we introduced several measures in order to foster a better harmonization of life at work and in privacy, including for example: increase in the allowance for a children’s summer camp, a day off for accompanying a 1st grader to school, allowance for healthcare for long-term employees aged 50+ wellness voucher for long-term employees aged 55 years, new training strategy, which takes into consideration also long-term employees. In addition to these measures applicable for women and also men employed with the Bank, we carried out also changes in the area of improvement of processes in communication with internal and external applicants for vacancies and we likewise expanded our benefit system of employee discounts. Electronic Feedback  In 2014, we introduced a new form of feedback on the taken trainings aimed at: preparation prior to the training (do I know why I am going to take this training?), feedback on the quality of training and lecturer (overall satisfaction), sharing of information with colleagues (support of team learning), space for application of knowledge (use in practice). This is how we obtain data for evaluation of the quality of lecturers, which enables us to better plan the trainings for upcoming periods, we support implementation and sharing of the knowledge gained and we monitor an efficient utilization of the budget. Last but not least, by cancelling the paper questionnaires we are contributing to environmental protection. We Have a Defibrillator  Each of us can once find himself/herself in a situation when help, simple decision, courage and knowledge could mean a life saved. In 2014, we placed in the Bank’s premises a life-saving device – a so-called automatic external defibrillator. The stickers on the VUB Head Office building inform the employees, clients and passers-by that we are equipped with this simple and simultaneously immensely important device. We also trained several employees of the Bank who took a course lead by a doctor – a rescuer legend and obtained a defibrillator certificate confirming their capacity to use it when giving first aid. Work and Internship  Already for several years, VUB Bank has been helping students to prepare for real-life employment within the Internship and Work program. We believe that the best way to choose something is when you get the possibility to actually test what expects you in practice. Thanks to the work experience gained already during their study, the students can form their own ideas about the world of banking, define their direction after school or potentially get an interesting work position. In VUB, the students can engage in fulfilment of working tasks, have their own development plan, take trainings, be mentored by a manager, get feedback on their performance as well as consultancy in their personal development. Last but not least, they can apply for vacant positions. Until now, on average, as many as 70% of internship students continued in cooperation with VUB Bank. In 2014, we received applications from approximately 200 students; thereof 15 were engaged for several months in the units according to the individual areas. Several of them got a full-time employment with us after terminating their internship or we continue with them in the training program.

In total, 468 employees quit, thereof 133 men and 335 women. Besides external factors, we strived to reduce the turnover also by the following procedures: elaboration of an adaptation plan at joining of each employee, continuing in regular meetings with new hires within the trial and adaptation period, continuous motivational interviews with the employees following the adaptation period with the aim of obtaining their feedback, (simultaneously it is a source of findings about potential departures of new hires and solving of such undesired situations), improving quality of recruiting tools in key positions (assessment and development centre), in the coaching of managers we lay a bigger emphasis on their work with their inferior employees (mainly with the newly hired colleagues), implementation of a new mentoring concept, which lead to improvement of quality and acceleration of orientation of new hires for their future work, the new mentoring also shifted the churn rate of new employees within the period of 3 months after joining, preventive solving of personnel issues through HR relationship managers in regions and at the Head Office, having interviews at employment termination, finding out the reasons for departures and subsequent work with these reasons. RECRUITMENT In recruiting and hiring new employees, we follow the rules based on assessment of individual knowledge, skills and personal prerequisites relevant for the vacant position being staffed. We pay due care to adhering to the principles of impartiality and avoid protectionism, misuse or discrimination. Job applicants interested in working with us can refer to our Internet page in the “Career” V section, which provides an overview of the current vacancies. Using an electronic questionnaire, the job applicants can apply for the vacancies and send their curricula vitae. One of the most important sources in staffing vacant positions is the VUB employee base itself through internal recruitment. Open or newly created positions present an opportunity not only for external candidates, whose main contribution is the “fresh wind” they bring, i.e. new experience and practice, but also a chance for internal employees in their further career growth. Successful candidates go through a standard adaptation period, which will enable him/her to better manage the process of joining and learn the new job in the position. Last year, we continued in the „Find Your Colleague“ activity around Slovakia aimed at engaging our employees in searching for and recommending candidates for vacancies. In case of all proposed candidates, we were assessing how suitable they were for the given position. Only the best of the best made it through the standard recruitment process. After six months and subsequently also after the candidate spends a year in the position, the employee is paid out a motivation reward. To university students, we offer an opportunity to get employed within the “Internship and Work“ program. Recruitment in 2014 Total 468 Men 145 Women 323 50 Employees PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT In the Bank, we guarantee equal opportunities in professional development and growth, access to development tools and work positions. We provide all employees with a possibility of expressing their individuality and creativity at work, while supporting innovations. Professional development and growth of employees is covered by the Performance and Development Management System aimed at: creating conditions for individual development of employees and enabling the Bank’s development as a whole, strengthening the employees’ engagement in Bank’s development, ensure that all employees efficiently contribute to meeting goals, increasing transparency and fairness of compensation. We enable our employees to develop their careers, while growing within the company. The point of this development path is that everybody gets a targeted support in development of their competencies needed to succeed at their work. It always starts with an adaptation orientation, which is later on followed by trainings according to the type of position, knowledge and skills required to accomplish tasks. An important part of the Performance and Development Management System is the evaluation process. Last year, we continued with the GPS (Global Performance System) evaluation system, which is common for all subsidiaries of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. Its main task is to evaluate the employee’s targets for the past period and plan key tasks and targets supporting the Bank’s strategy for the upcoming period. Each year, all employees are evaluated by their direct superiors subject to their work position and classification. Within the whole process, an important role is played by the employee himself/herself, who declares his/her ambitions and ideas regarding his/her future career. The superior employee, based on employee’s performance, motivation and potential coordinates his/her further development and growth. Number of Promotions by Gender 2014 Total 40 Men 19 Women 21 Percentage of Promoted Employees 1.15% COMPENSATION The main principles of VUB Compensation Policy are transparency, fairness and motivational factor. The system is set up as to enable the Bank to be competitive in the labour market and at the same time attractive for its employees. Our task is to monitor and react to the wage and inflation development in Slovakia so that our real wages would correspond to these trends. The basic tool for setting up the compensation policy is the Catalogue of Working Positions defining the working positions in the Bank, job descriptions, “sizes“ of individual positions across the entire Bank are measured based on: complexity of work, impact on company’s performance, core-business and support, work with confidential information, initiative and performance monitoring, knowledge and experience, management and independence. 51 Employees The Compensation Policy is made up of a fixed and a variable component. The fixed component reflects the work position, its “size”, complexity and performance from a long-term perspective. The variable component corresponds to the employee’s performance and it is simultaneously a motivation tool designed to increase the personal involvement of employees in accomplishing the tasks set and to reward their performance and contribution to the Bank. Overall annual as well as individual results are evaluated by the Compensation Committee consisting of CEO, Deputy CEO for Support, Executive Director of Finance, Planning and Controlling Division, Executive Director of Human Resources Division. The Committee is also charged with approval of annual evaluation results, variable wage components and base wage adjustments. BENEFITS Irrespective of their job classification, the Bank provides all its employees with a wide range of benefits (i.e. financial and non-financial benefits). VUB has been fully financing the food allowance and providing financial aid to employees facing complex life situations. The retail network employees who are in daily contact with the clients are provided a clothing allowance. The biggest amount of funds spent on employee benefits represent the contributions to supplementary pension saving, while the ratio of contribution made by the employer and by the employee is 1:1. The employees can also use some banking products under more favourable conditions e.g. free-of-charge bank account maintenance, favourable interest rates on term accounts, consumer or mortgage loan at favourable interest rates or discount rates on insurance. The benefits include also a commuting allowance. Moreover, each year we focus on supporting the families of our employees, which is for example proven by the allowance at child’s birth, popular gifts at the occasion of the International Children’s Day or an allowance for a children’s summer camp. Also in 2014, we continued in the strategy of employees’ health care and work-life balance. We provide a contribution for preventive screenings, a paid leave day before wedding, for parents of first graders a leave on their child’s first school day, for fresh fathers a day off after the birth of their child. We inform our employees on the current offer of benefits primarily via Intranet and also many other communications channels. We engage employees in activities that are not necessarily directly related to their work duties or job descriptions. Thanks to the internal program My Company, we have the space to express our recognition to them and present various activities of our employees such as blood donation, advisory for secondary grammar school and university students or volunteering. The Bank accommodates its employees by means of several measures supporting a more efficient harmonization of their work and private lives. These measures include flexible working hours (optional start between 7.00 a.m. – 9.00 a.m. and end between 4.00 p.m. – 7.00 p.m.), four days off annually for intensified healthcare beyond the framework of the legal title to holiday. Single employees caring for a child up to the age of 15 (in case of disabled children up to the age of 26) and women from the fourth month of pregnancy are enabled to annually take additional two days off. Overview of employee benefits provided in 2014: 3rd pillar / supplementary pension insurance Food allowance from Social Fund Day off with wage compensation beyond Labour Code Commuting allowance Clothing allowance Working anniversary bonus Other benefits Social contributions Recruitment allowance Care for employees’ children Care for employees’ health. 52 Employees Funds Spent on Employee Benefits in 2014 (in EUR thous.)

Specific training requirements are addressed according to individual needs in collaboration with external training organizations in the Slovak Republic and abroad mainly in form of internships or participation in selected training activities. VUB Bank’s own training centre VUB Academy organizes technical courses and also corporate and personal development courses. The Academy prepares professional and skilled employees, supports continuous development of employees and their careers, motivates and stabilizes the employees. In the e-learning system AMOS the employees can view the catalogue of educational and training activities and take an initiative approach to their development and career growth. The e-courses and e-tests are available at any time and the users can repeat them several times. The application contains courses on current topics, trainings for individual working procedures, freely available tests up-to-date for the given position or product and many trainings. In 2014, we executed an average of 6.5 training days per employee of VUB in form of classroom training and 2.2 days in form of electronic training. Trainings by Category and Gender Average Hours Senior management employees 133 Men 125 Women 8 Middle and junior management employees 141 Men 64 Women 77 Administrative employees 118 Men 60 Women 58 Trainings by Type Classroom trainings (% of hours) 75% Remote trainings (% of hours) 25% Number of participants 3,694 Total hours of trainings provided (classroom and remote) 223,693 Training hours per employee 60.50 53 Employees Trainings by Content % Business 21% Operational 20% Lending 16% Finance 13% Special 10% IT 5% Languages 3% The Bank has been traditionally organizing a so-called Welcome day for new employees, which is held each month. Its aim is to give the new employees a basic overview of the Bank, information on the history of the Bank and the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, its market position, portfolio of products and services it provides, company structure but also on employee rights, obligations and benefits. Another activity we have to form our own professionals is the Mentoring Program within the retail business network. Employees in senior positions become mentors, who hand over their practical experience to junior colleagues, mostly to the newly hired employees or employees returning to work after maternity or parental leave. The aim is an easier adaptation to the working position. Within the ZAPNi (SWITCHon) program, we give our employees space to search for innovative solutions with the purpose of improving satisfaction of clients or employees themselves. In 2014, we received more than 100 suggestions for improvement, thereof 10 ideas have been already implemented in practice. Since the program’s launch in 2009, we have so far implemented 137 good ideas in practice. EMPLOYEE SURVEY In 2014, we performed a regular employee satisfaction survey, already the sixth in row. The anonymous survey sponsored by an external company identifies the climate and satisfaction among employees across the whole Intesa Sanpaolo Group. For VUB Group, the participation was 54% employees. In an electronic questionnaire, the employees could anonymously express their views on five areas. The survey outcomes showed that the overall satisfaction with work reached 84%. Within the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, this is a result better than in the average countries. From the employee survey and subsequent focus groups, we will propose areas of improvement, which will be implemented in 2015. DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES VUB committed not to discriminate, respect the principles of equal treatment, exclude from its actions any discrimination and respect differences based on gender, age, race, faith, political opinion, participation in unions, language skills, impairment, marital or family status, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property or other position. By signing the Collective Agreement, it also undertook to observe the discrimination ban in compliance with the Labour Code. The employees must not be harmed for exercising their rights ensuing from industrial relations. In 2014, no action was filed regarding a case of discrimination. The Bank provides everybody with equal opportunities for personal and professional growth giving each employee an equal opportunity to assert himself/herself. Differentiation of employees according to their work prerequisites and performance is however not considered discrimination. The majority of our employees are women – in 2014, there were 2,568 women working in the Bank out of a total of 3,493 employees. This disproportion in favour of women occurs mainly in the retail business network, where there is a prevalent proportion of women. One woman is represented on the Bank’s Management Board. The management positions are staffed by 60% of women. The number of disabled employees in the year increased to 37. The indicator in regard to protection of rights of aboriginal inhabitants is not relevant due to the geographic location of our business activities. 54 Employees OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PROTECTION The Bank considers its obligation to create a working environment and conditions pursuant to the Slovak technical standards and hygiene regulations. The topics of occupational safety and health protection are contained in internal regulations and Collective Agreement. The rights of all employees in this respect are represented also by the Trade Union representatives. In accordance with Article 20 of the Act of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No. 124/2006 Coll. on Occupational Safety and Health Protection, the main Occupational Safety Commission is nominated in the Bank. It consists of 7 members: 4 employee representatives (trade union members) and 3 employer representatives. Besides the main commission, nominated are also regional occupational safety commissions for each region, which carry out regular annual comprehensive inspections of occupational safety and health protection. The regional commission works at least in a four-member set up: employee representative, two employer representatives (regional facility management technician and branch manager), and occupational safety technician. Altogether, there are 260 occupational safety commission members, i.e. a percentage of the total workforce represented in formal joint occupational safety and health protection commissions falls in the category of up to 25% of the total employee count. Each new employee is obliged to participate in an orientation training pursuant to Act No. 124/2006 Coll. on Occupational Safety and Health Protection and on amendment and supplementation of some acts. Periodical trainings on occupational safety and health protection in accordance with the above-stated legislation and the Bank’s internal regulations are taken by all Bank employees every two years in electronic form. The Bank ensures also training for employee safety representatives (trade union members) and a first aid course. Activities in the area of occupational safety and health protection (annual comprehensive inspections, provision of personal work protective equipment, training, investigation of occupational injuries, measures for enhancement of work environment, updating of internal regulations) are semi-annually submitted at revision of the Collective Agreement. Training and consultancy concerning the employees is ensured by the occupational safety technicians from an external company. Within prevention and risk control, a Work Medical Service performs an inception audit at the opening of a new branch. Medical services, first aid trainings, workplace supervision and preventive medical examinations according to the type of work performed are ensured by a work medical service from an external company. The Bank ensures safe working conditions not detrimental to health and provides personal protective equipment in premises where cash is handled and in premises where works of technological nature are performed. In case an employee uses a company car, he/she is obliged to take a driving capacity examination every 2 years. Due to the nature of our business activity, there is a possibility that our employees could find themselves in situations endangering their lives, e.g. in case of a branch robbery. In these rare cases, they are provided professional psychological assistance and are entitled to 5 business days off for recovery. In 2014, we recorded 2 such cases. Despite the above-mentioned measures taken within the trainings on occupational safety and health protection, prevention and risk control, in 2014 we recorded 3 registered occupational injuries. We did not record any grave occupational injury or diseases related to the performance of profession. Occupational Health Protection Number of requests filed due to occupational disease 0 Number of registered injuries 3 Number of grave injuries 0 Death at workplace with final assessment 0 55 Employees FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING Freedom of association and collective bargaining are regulated by the Labour Code, Collective Bargaining Act and the Act on Freedom of Association. Collective Agreement governs individual and collective relations between the employer and employees, which are more convenient than the ones stipulated by the Labour Code or any other generally binding legal regulation. The Bank committed to preserve the trade union rights, namely the freedom of association of employees in trade unions and collective bargaining in accordance with the generally binding legal regulations. Collective Agreement is concluded for the period of 3 years between VUB and the Council of VUB Trade Union Representatives. It applies to all employees in an employment relation with the employer irrespective of their membership in the trade union. The provisions of the Collective Agreement supersede the Bank’s internal regulations in the scope of commitments concluded in the Collective Agreement. Trade Union Days Off Percentage representation of employees in the trade union 17.32% Number of days out of work due to trade union activities (overall days off provided by the trade union organizer) 496 Number of days out of work due to meetings 43 NOTIFICATION DUTY The Labour Code imposes on the employer a notification duty against employee representatives in connection with the economic and financial situation and the projected development of its activities. Notification is to be performed “in a comprehensible manner and at a suitable time“. Under the Labour Code, the employer is obliged to negotiate fundamental changes regarding, among the other, status, structure and projected development of employment with employee representatives in advance. Provision of further information including specific deadlines is agreed, under the wording of the Labour Code, in the Collective Agreement. INTERNAL COMMUNICATION AND DIALOGUE In the Bank, we understand that if we expect our employees to deliver the best possible performance, we must regularly inform them of what is happening, why and where the company is heading and what is the place of each of them in this fulfilment. At the same time, we are giving them the space to voice their own opinions and ideas engaging them also in the decision-making processes. Internal communication is based on seven values common for the whole Intesa Sanpaolo Group and it helps in delivering our vision and mission. The corporate Intranet is being built as the key and most efficient tool of internal communication, whereas employees themselves are drawn into creation of its content. Each piece of information on Intranet has its sponsor, and so employees know at any moment, whom they should turn to in case of need. In total there is about 5 % of all employees of VUB Group from various units taking care of the content. In 2014, we brought more than 170 current news reports on the happening in the VUB Group or in the international group Intesa Sanpaolo. We continued issuing our internal WORLD magazine. The magazine was distributed in the volume of 4,000 prints to all employees of VUB including the subsidiaries. Information on key events is regularly brought by the Chief Executive Officer via an electronic bimonthly CEO Newsletter and the topics from the human resources management and benefits are covered in the HR Newsletter issued four times a year. 56 Employees Understanding the message is the key element in setting up internal communication well. If the people are to understand what and how is happening in the company, a dialogue and two-way communication are a must. Employees have therefore always the possibility to ask the CEO questions by means of an Intranet form, comment on topics important for the Bank and the employee as such, e.g. on the system of benefits, form and content of Intranet and internal magazine. Evaluation and surveys of internal communication channels is carried out regularly on an annual basis. ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF EMPLOYEES INTO BANK’S LIFE We prepared our internal campaigns in order to motivate employees to active engagement and interactivity with each topic. Campaigns aimed at the inside of VUB are introduced on a monthly basis each time with a new topic, up to date for the given period. The face of the campaign is always an employee involved in the topic. Thus, he/she becomes the carrier of the information, which gets closer to the others. In 2014, within the internal campaigns we communicated several topics such as new benefits, ZAPNi (SwichOn) employee ideas program, VIAMO mobile application, employee care, environmental protection (possibility to report illegal dumps, etc.). In supporting the company’s brand perception, values and naturally also the business we make use of all internal communication channels including posters, Intranet, magazine or personal e-mails and computer screen savers. With the aim of supporting the team spirit and informal relations, a sports and nomination event named VUB CUP was held. The best employees from the event went on to represent VUB at international sports tournaments organized by our parent company. At year-end, we had the traditional Christmas meetings that were organized in Košice, Banská Bystrica and Bratislava so that all employees could attend. In order to support the delivery of business targets, motivation and competitiveness in 2014 we continued in the employee competition called the VUB Super League. 57 Shareholders Shareholders VUB SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE Information on Bank’s shareholders is published on a quarterly basis within 30 days from the end of the given quarter.

Instructions on shareholder rights under Article 180 Sect. 1 and Article 181 Sect. 1 of Act No. 513/1991 Coll. Commercial Code as amended and documents and data pursuant to Article 184a Sect. 1 and 2 of Commercial Code are published on Internet site of VUB Bank in the “For Shareholders” section at least thirty days prior to the General Meeting. VUB Bank accepts all its obligations resulting from the legislation with regard to the shareholders. The Bank observes provisions of the Commercial Code applicable to protection of shareholders’ rights, in particular provisions on timely supply of all relevant information about the company and provisions on convening and conducting its annual General Meetings. The Bank adheres to the principle of equal access to information for all shareholders pursuant to the Corporate Governance Code in Slovakia. 2014 SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION INITIATIVES Since 2007, VUB Bank has been applying the Italian Act No. 262, which was released in 2005. For the purpose of implementing the Act, a project entitled “project 262“ has been defined. Its aim is to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Italian Act No. 262 in VUB Bank, which was inspired by the American Sarbanes Oxley Act issued to ensure significant strengthening of investments protection. The measures deriving from the Act cover a wide area and are aimed at various activities, such as governance of joint-stock companies, rules for accounting audit, rules for financial instruments, conflict of interests, transparency and market regulations. This Act is a part of a legal scenario aimed at consistent enhancement of governance. The objective of Project 262 in VUB is to review the internal control system, identify its shortcomings and based on the results adjust it in order to eliminate the potential risk and ensure a true and fair representation of the financial situation. The Act No. 262 requires that individual companies identify processes, which influence the financial information, evaluate associated relevant risks and based on this propose adequate design of internal controls with the purpose of eliminating potential risks. The project’s basis lies in identifying and promptly responding to a potentially insufficient functioning of the internal control system. This will assure improvement in the quality of 62 Shareholders financial reporting also by means of business ethics, efficient internal audits and good corporate governance. The Act No. 262 assigned the responsibility for the contents of financial reports, accounting procedures applied, adequately set up control system and procedures and a true and fair view of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows to the Chief Executive Officer. Both the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer sign a representation confirming that adequate and efficient procedures of accounting and financial reporting have been applied. Benefit of the whole project is providing shareholders with security concerning a true and regulatory presentation of the capital, economic and financial position of the VUB Group and adequacy and efficiency of the internal control system and procedures. 63 Suppliers Suppliers STRATEGY Suppliers represent one group of VUB Bank’s stakeholders that are significantly influenced by our corporate responsibility and observance of the Code of Ethics ensuing therefrom. VUB Bank requires that its suppliers adhere to principles, which form a part of its business and which it perceives as a natural part of the Code of Ethics and its daily actions. VUB Bank realizes that the Bank’s good business performance is a benefit for all stakeholder groups and suppliers have an indispensable position among them. VUB is one of the largest Slovak companies and as such it also has a broad network of business partners its suppliers. By purchasing goods and services, it indirectly generates benefits for the whole society, namely in form of employment and business financial performance of its suppliers. An indispensable commitment of VUB Bank with respect to suppliers includes responsible practices in the environmental and social areas. TARGETS AND RULES Close cooperation with suppliers, open communication, joint set up of process efficiency, Responsible partnership including regular a timely payments / settlement of invoices, Transparent selection of suppliers, Selection of environment-friendly technologies, products and materials, Cost efficiency in the procurement process, Standardization of purchases, Obtain quality services and goods at a good price. If a company wants to confirm its declared corporate responsibility principles it must apply these activities also in its supply chain. It brings mutual benefits. Over the recent years, the position of procurement in VUB Bank changed from a nearly invisible “back-office“ for administration of orders and settlement of invoices to suppliers into an appreciated cost saver and relationship builder. Procurement represents acquisition and management of people, buildings, transport, materials, utilities, water, wastes. The increasing demands attribute also more significance to procurement as a strategic unit of the company, which contributes to a considerable extent to the fulfilment of its business targets. The priority of procurement remains however satisfying requirements of the other units of the company while ensuring economic efficiency of purchases. Whether it is the purchase of consumption material, office supplies, IT equipment, materials or services. APPLICATION OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY RULES WITH SUPPLIERS VUB Bank transfers the corporate responsibility principles further to its suppliers. Our effort is to collaborate with such suppliers that respect and honour our values. In this manner, we create an open and strong partnership across the entire supplier portfolio. We condition the cooperation with the effort of our future business partner to protect and improve the living conditions of its employees, local communities and various specific social groups. Already within the tender process we require from our suppliers to comply with the CSR principles via the document “Declaration on Compliance with Corporate Social Responsibility Principles”. This document became an integral part of the VUB – supplier relation and it forms one of the obligatory annexes of tenders. With the signature, the tender bidder – future business partner, confirms to VUB Bank that it conducts its business activities in line with the principles of ethics, transparency, good morals, good manners and observes the legal regulations of the Slovak Republic. The bidder further confirms that it refuses and penalizes any forms of corruption including blackmailing or bribery, supporting a fair competition. It declares that it is not involved in breaching human rights and it observes and respects international human rights in business. The bidder respects the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and it likewise respects the rights of employees ensuing from the collective agreement, while simultaneously respecting the international ban on forced and child labour in any form. 65 Suppliers In 2014, VUB Bank cooperated with 1,208 companies from various areas. The highest share was made up by suppliers of materials, services and real estate owners from around Slovakia, where the Bank has its branches and sales points. Commodity Type Number of Suppliers Suppliers / Commodity Ratio Technology 70 5.79% Material, marketing & services 388 32.12% Facilities 121 10.02% Real estate rentals 357 29.55% Energy (gas, water, heat..) 170 14.07% IT systems 102 8.44% TOTAL 1,208 100.00% Suppliers by Commodities. Information systems 8. 44 % 5.79 % Technology Media (gas, water, heat…) 14.07 % 32.12 % Material, marketing & services Rental of real estates 29.55 % 10.02 % Facilities Transparency and equal opportunities are the attributes applied not only in selection of suppliers but also in definition of internal supplier processes or relations. In our perception, these are the attributes of a responsible approach of VUB Bank to suppliers. Suppliers of VUB Bank are significantly influenced by observance of the Code of Ethics. In relation to suppliers, the Bank professes values such as fair play and transparency. In the interest of creating and building an open partnership across the whole supplier portfolio of VUB, it is the Bank’s effort to principally cooperate with those suppliers that honour and respect these values. Procurement in VUB Bank is open to a wide spectrum of suppliers. VUB Bank gives space and business opportunity to all that are not its business partners yet. For the existing partners, it simultaneously presents a challenge to continuously improve the quality of their products and services in order to be a valuable partner of VUB Bank also for the future period. For new suppliers, it means support in their ambition to become a business partner of VUB Bank. One of the basic prerequisites for succeeding in the competitive market is an efficient spending of funds for goods and services that VUB Bank needs for its activities. The total amount of such costs directly contributes to the business performance of the Bank thus impacts the Bank’s profit. VUB Bank therefore expects of its suppliers a flexible, proactive and forthcoming approach, accompanied by high efficiency. VUB Bank is interested in developing long-term business relations built on open prices with the aim of achieving supplier terms and conditions of utmost convenience and acceptable for both parties. 66 Suppliers GROUP PRINCIPLES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN Compliance with the principles of the Code of Ethics, mainly in terms of transparency and fairness in the supplier selection processes in accordance with the Group’s internal Code of Conduct. Compliance with the regulations on protection of confidential information and privacy, social and ecological sustainability, occupational safety, protection of industrial property and authorial rights. Separation of executive and control functions as to prevent a conflict of interests in procurement. Early reporting and governance / management of anomalies. Use of contractual provisions and control tools, which protect the group against risks connected with the responsibility between partner and client. All the processes are harmonized with the standards of the parent ISP. Observance of these rules is regularly inspected in the interest of observing transparency and equal opportunities. WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY VUB Bank has adopted a policy for solving anonymous complaints. It has created an e-mail box to which their business partners can write in case a supplier, within a procurement proceeding or during contract fulfilment, comes to suspect that any bank employee or any other related party of the Bank breached legal regulations or Bank’s internal regulations in connection with the contract or otherwise (e.g. misuses of information in business contacts, fraud, extortion, misappropriation, bribery). The supplier has the possibility to turn to VUB Bank via an e-mail to V and ask for investigation of a matter. PORTALE FORNITORI The method of purchasing goods and services in VUB Bank changed starting from 2014. There were changes in some internal processes and new ISP tools for running the procurement process have been implemented. For a more efficient communication with suppliers and execution of the procurement processes we started actively using the new supplier portal Portale Fornitori V. The portal serves for registration of suppliers and we use it for selecting suppliers (tenders). We organized a workshop with the topic of the new procurement method in VUB for our suppliers. ELECTRONIC AUCTIONS For selecting suppliers VUB Bank has been using electronic auctions via application Access Point V. Suppliers submit their price bids in electronic form at the same time and in one place. In this manner, VUB Bank transparently accelerates and makes the supplier selection process as well as a correct price negotiation more efficient. Electronic auction is a form of “open” negotiation, which in procurement of goods and services provides for equal opportunities and fair play in the process of supplier selection. LEGISLATION GOVERNING PROCUREMENT PROCESS IN THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC AND ITS IMPACTS ON VUB BANK’S ACTIVITIES Selection of suppliers in VUB Bank in the Slovak Republic is not subject to the Public Procurement Act. In 2014, VUB Bank was not imposed any fines for inobservance of any laws or regulations concerning procurement and purchase of products and services. Internally, VUB Bank has a sufficiently strong control mechanism, whether the internal control system on the levels of Procurement Department or Internal Audit Department. 67 Suppliers SHELTERED WORKSHOPS Pursuant to the Act on Employment Services, each employer in the Slovak Republic employing more than 20 employees is obliged to employ disabled citizens. Another option is using a supplementary solution by submitting orders or purchasing goods and services from a sheltered workshop employing disabled people, from a citizen with a grave disability or from an employer employing citizens with grave disabilities. In view of the above-stated legal obligations, VUB Bank gives a part of its orders to sheltered workshops also despite the fact that prices they offer are oftentimes higher and delivery deadlines longer than with common suppliers. For more information refer to the Community chapter. In 2014, VUB Bank made purchases of goods and services from sheltered workshops in the volume of € 47,000. More information in the chapter Community V. ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT VUB Bank is not a production firm or direct polluter, however it committed to reduce its negative impact on the environment to the lowest extent possible. In our company, we have been looking for optimum solutions beyond the legislative framework and one of the solutions is preference of ecological products. We prefer mainly those suppliers, who adopt measures for minimizing the negative impacts of their activities on the environment. MATERIALS VUB Bank manages the usage and consumption of office paper, consumption of toners for copying machines and printers, collection and liquidation of used packaging. In the area of facility management, it cooperates with ISO 14001 certified companies (this system helps the companies to successfully participate in domestic and also international tenders, but it also ensures growth of value, company’s economical operation as well as increased trust of customers). Purchase of office paper is limited to chlorine-free (TCF/ECF) and recycled papers. Bulk correspondence to the Bank’s clients is sent exclusively in recycled envelopes. In the area of facility management and maintenance, VUB Bank cooperates with companies with a systematic approach to environmental protection through their activities in all aspects of their businesses. In the area of redesign, reconstructions or other construction works VUB Bank collaborates with construction companies that include environmental care in its business strategy and also common operations. The same applies also to the suppliers of lighting and interior, the activities of which are, in addition to production and provision of services oriented on energy saving, waste minimization and minimization of environmental fees and sanctions for pollution of the environment. Since VUB Bank is not a production company and its activity does not result in products that would require purchase of input materials, the report does not deal with materials used or recycled input materials used in greater detail. For more information refer to the Environment chapter V. 68 Environment Environment STRATEGY VUB Bank is not a producing company or a direct polluter of the environment and therefore the environmental impacts of our business are not significant. Nevertheless, we perceive as an obligation of each of us to preserve the country and environment where we operate also for the future generations. We consider the activities aimed at environmental protection and sustainability a natural part of our operations and therefore we committed to reduce our negative impact on the environment to the minimum level possible. This is the reason we exert activities as a company internally and externally. We are looking for solutions beyond the scope of the legislation; we are interested in our environmental performance in relation to the inputs and outputs, while mapping the relevant environmental indicators and we are constantly in search of new ways in our environmental management approach, in which we manage to reach real results. The measures for reduction of direct (resulting from our activities) and indirect (generated by clients and suppliers) environmental impact are stipulated in VUB Group’s Environmental Policy. As a member of an international banking group, we adhere to the Equator Principles and UN Global Compact. We have firmly defined internal regulations and our decisions on investments and lending take into account both social and environmental risks. VUB Bank’s main activities in environmental protection in 2014 ensued from: 1. applicable Environmental Policy aimed at:  support of investment projects focused on energy saving and renewable sources,  saving measures for reduction of energy and consumer material consumption,  waste separation and measures for reduction of its production,  raising of employees’ environmental awareness,  global environmental security. 2. Environmental Sustainability Action Plan (2013 – 2016) with priorities for energy savings:  replacement of obsolete electrical appliances with new ones according to the highest technical environmental parameters,  complex introduction of LED technologies,  optimization of heating systems,  replacement of measuring and control systems and technologies. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY It is a fundamental document of VUB Bank and it forms the basis of our environmental conception. It sets the mission and objectives in environmental protection, permanently sustainable development and in the area of environmental management. It serves as the basis for management and also business strategy of the Bank. It defines the principles and guidelines concerning direct and indirect impacts on the environment in relation to all stakeholders, it addresses the use of sources (water, heat, energy, gas), emission, green procurement, mobility, integrated environmental and energetic management system etc. Last but not least, it allows the Bank to communicate its intentions and objectives to employees and other stakeholders. In 2014, in addition to our Environmental Policy we followed also other internal policies: 1. Organization of Events and Internal Training Courses. 2. Purchase and Use of Office Paper. 3. Integrated Environmental and Energy Management System. 70 Environment UN GLOBAL COMPACT to which it acceded in 2009. It includes also environmental protection principles, which we strive to observe in the maximum extent possible. EQUATOR PRINCIPLES We take a responsible approach to project financing and lending. Managing a great volume of funds, we significantly impact the flows of capital. Therefore, it is important for us that projects we decide to finance do not have a negative impact on the environment we live in. Voluntary compliance with the Equator Principles V as well as a strict implementation of the principles applied in all levels of our credit policy including expert trainings of relevant teams within the Bank confirm our commitment to the society. MANAGEMENT APPROACH Our effort is to encourage the employees – users of buildings to efficient solutions, naturally while observing the basic hygienic standards for creating optimum working conditions. Our environmental management involves: Facility Management and Procurement Departments, specialists and employees of the Internal Services Department, external suppliers of products and services, Risk Management Division (ensures control of project financing and lending), regular inspections and controls in branch and also headquarters buildings focused on reduction of energy consumption and identification of potential savings, internal regulations and notices, internal communication employee awareness. INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM It covers prevention, management and, where possible, also reduction of impacts of our activities, whether direct or indirect. Direct impacts are defined as areas, which may be negatively impacted by our activity or in which, on the contrary, we can directly influence protection of environment through our actions. These include, for example, use of sources, production of emissions, green procurement, mobility, integrated environmental and energy management system, management of hazardous substances and waste handling, waste reduction, energetic efficiency (e.g. electricity saving and use of lighting units, computers and office equipment), attention paid to environmental social impacts of our decisions. Our management system defines rules and processes related to implementation of our Environmental Policy. Since VUB Bank is not a direct polluter of the environment, our impact can be split into: Indirect:  we comply with international and national environmental protection protocols,  we support projects with a high environmental value (loans),  our lending system clearly incorporates standards concerning the environment and the Equator Principles. VUB Bank principally does not grant funds for financing of certain activities that could endanger the environment; Direct:  energy saving measures,  introduction and observation of internal regulations and notices, e.g.  economical usage of electricity in the offices,  air-conditioning (principles of its utilization),  cooling and heating (setting of interior temperatures in cold and hot periods),  regular collection and ecological liquidation of non-functional telephones, accessories and batteries; collection and liquidation of waste classified as hazardous (toners, fluorescent lamps),  video conferences instead of business trips; 71 Environment  obligatory turning off of computers outside working hours, during weekends and holidays.

The reason is the new legislation which eventually caused an increase of the paper documentation. Compared against 2013, in 2014 we recorded an increased consumption of non-certified paper due to increased consumption of some types of envelopes (delivery envelopes, valuable and bubble padded envelopes, spatial cardboard envelopes). ENERGIES VUB Bank is constantly striving to reduce the consumption of energies and this trend could be kept also in 2014. Similarly to previous year, also in 2014 we were putting emphasis on purchasing highly efficient cooling and heating equipment for an efficient and economical heating and cooling of our premises and on selection of possibly the most economical lighting units for our premises. We replaced all refrigerators for new efficient and energetically more saving models. For its operation, VUB Bank needs two primary sources of energy – electricity and gas. In 2014, electricity consumption dropped again and this drop is the result of an ongoing effort to lead employees towards an efficient utilization of sources, purchases of highly efficient equipment and last but not least continuous supervision of used technology and its regulation. Direct Energy Consumption Year Electricity Gas total kWh m3 kWh kWh 2014 14,644,944 8,340,974 22,985,918 2013 15,757,832 1,096,513 10,307,222 26,065,054 2012 16,099,182 1,099,915 10,339,203 26,438,385 Notes: 1) 1 m3 = 9.4 kWh 2) the data were obtained from counter statuses of our contractual supplier 73 Environment In 2014, we again managed to reduce our heat consumption. Heat is procured from various bigger and smaller heat energy producers; therefore it is not possible to state the primary energy source. Secondary Energy Purchased (heat energy in the form of heat) Year 2014 2013 2012 in kWh 5,068,619 6,014,616 6,574,929 Last year, we reduced our total energy consumption by 4,025,133 kWh. Such quantity of energy is annually consumed by 280 households or 14,000 PCs. Total Energy Consumption (heat + electricity + gas) Year 2014 2013 2012 in kWh 28,054,537 32,079,670 33,013,314 RENEWABLE SOURCES Electricity is supplied by the largest local suppliers (ZSE, VSE and SSE). These companies guarantee that a minimum of 15 % of the energy they supply is produced from renewable sources. In accordance with the relevant provisions of Act No. 656/2004, electricity suppliers in the Slovak Republic must inform their buyers on the share of individual types of primary energy sources in produced and supplied energy, including the supply of electricity produced in other EU member states and third states. In 2014, the share of primary sources for production of electricity supplied by our suppliers was as follows: Renewable (water, air, solar) 15 % Gas 13 % Coal 20 % Nuclear 52 % Gas is purchased from the local supplier Slovenský plynárenský priemysel. RECUPERATORS In 2014, we installed so-called recuperators on some air-conditioning equipments. A recuperator serves for a recovering heat. The incoming exterior air is partially heated by the heat of waste air, which we let out of the building. The ecology of this solution lies in the fact that we consumer less energy needed to heat the incoming air. EMISSIONS OF CO2 Not even in 2014 did VUB Bank monitor its production of emissions, since due to the Bank’s activities this data is negligible. Production of CO2 comes only from company cars, the number of which we continue to reduce. In addition, in the garage premises of the Bank’s Head Office and in front of several branches we have installed bicycle stands. The aim is to encourage our employees to use even this transport method to commute to work in case of favourable weather conditions. SAVING MEASURES Saving measures are actually VUB Bank’s investments into environmental protection and modernization of its operations. In 2014, we continued taking measures with impact on energies in the area of: heating (reconstruction of networks, hydraulic regulation and other related optimization processes), cooling (modernization of equipment with higher operating efficiency), reconstruction of lighting networks – replacement of current light sources with LED, thermal insulation and heat loss prevention reconstructions of facades, roofs, replacement of windows. Besides the above, we have been permanently supervising the correct set up of measurement and regulation systems, which control cooling and heating. We simultaneously explain the basic principles of economical operation to the users. 74 Environment Share of Energy Savings Year 2014 2013 2012 Energy Savings in kWh 4,025,133 1,675,800 1,645,000 Energy Savings in % 12.55 5.22 4.98 WATER All VUB Bank’s branches in the whole territory of the Slovak Republic are supplied water by local water companies. In 2014, our water consumption showed a slight increase. In 2014, our average daily water consumption was 132.9 m3, which is on average 38 litres a day per employee. Total Water Consumption Year 2014 2013 2012 in m 3 48,516 48,021 47,469 Average Daily Water Consumption Year 2014 2013 2012 Bankwide (in m ) 3 133 132 130 Per 1 Employee (in litres) 38 37 37 VUB Bank is not a production company, so our water consumption is not significant. We use water effectively and mostly for personal hygiene, watering and minimally for the operation of facilities (heating, cooling circuits, etc.). We do not take water directly from a water source, but from water companies or small local suppliers. We do not request our suppliers to provide us with the data about water sources and use of recycled water. Our activity does not significantly influence local water sources in any way. WASTES Waste management is aimed at removal or modification of wastes in ways acceptable for the environment. Education of employees plays an important role in minimizing wastes. The employees’ actions and approach to this issue become then a part of the every-day awareness and gradually an inevitable tool giving the company a possibility to fulfil its environmental obligations. Waste separation is the responsibility of all employees. Waste separation is managed through the process we have in place, which is binding for all employees. Its wording is available on the Intranet page and the employees have been informed of it in form of personal e-mails. In our objects in the whole territory of Slovakia, we separate paper waste only. In the VUB Bank’s Head Office building in Bratislava we separate waste into: paper (cardboard), plastic, metal, glass, mixed communal waste, hazardous waste. Hazardous Waste Containing Remnants of Hazardous Substances Year 2014 2013 2012 in kg 135 1,245 600 Total Volume of R22 Refrigerants Year 2014 2013 2012 in kg 2,100 2,122 3,340 75 Environment In 2014, we recorded a slightly increased production of several types of wastes. Since the end of 2014, a gradual replacement of all cooling equipment containing coolant R22 has been ongoing, with regard to the strategic importance of the room in which it is stored. We will thereby fulfil the statutory obligation and at the same time we anticipate, with regard to higher efficiency of the new equipment, a reduction of power consumption during the cooling season. In 2014, our production of certain waste types slightly increased.

EMPLOYEES In 2014, there were no changes compared to the previous years, i.e. the instructions and guidelines we had set up for the users of buildings (how to efficiently use the equipment and how to ensure an optimum microclimate in an object) did not require any updating. These documents are stored and available on VUB Intranet. Our employees are continuously being informed of them and at the same time they have the possibility to read again about our direction in the area of environmental protection at any time. Over the year, all employees are encouraged in form of awareness raising activities and internal notices to: save paper and consumer material, turn off their PCs outside working hours and on holidays, separate waste, use the energies economically (with a focus on cooling equipment in the summer period). 76 Environment In all interiors of the Head Office building, we posted promotional information stickers which should alert and raise awareness about saving light and energies. CLIENTS VUB Bank has been successfully replacing paper account statements with electronic ones. Not only because an electronic statement is more modern and easily available in one place and at any time, but it is rather also a demonstration of our responsibility towards the environment. Currently all VUB Bank clients from the residential segment with access to Internet Banking are able to view their electronic statements to their current and term accounts, as well as to payment cards, loans and mutual funds. These clients are sent a paper statement only once a year in form of a so-called summary annual statement. Other clients are constantly being motivated to use the electronic communication and the electronic account statement. SUPPLIERS We strive to influence our environmental footprint also by the procedures we apply when selecting our suppliers. We prefer suppliers that take into account the environment using recycled materials, saving the energies and reducing their negative environmental footprint. We require our suppliers to provide us with a declaration that they are taking preventive measures in relation to environmental issues and strive to reduce the negative impact of their business on the environment. Signing the declaration, the supplier declares to VUB Bank that it will take steps leading to a greater responsibility towards the environment, support development and expand technologies saving the environment or search for new and efficient environment-friendly solutions. Also as a result of these, in 2014 there was no contamination of the environment involving the responsibility of VUB. In the area of facility management and maintenance, reconstruction and remodelling, VUB Bank cooperates with companies that systematically address environmental protection with their activities in all aspects of their business. The same applies also to the supplier of cleaning services, supplier of services connected with protective work aids, health and occupational safety and civil protection, as well as to suppliers of the interior, lighting or exterior signage (light logos on buildings and ATMs). Besides production and provision of services, their activities should be aimed at energy savings, minimization of waste and minimization of environmental fees and sanctions for pollution of the environment. Our significant suppliers, similarly to VUB Bank, have incorporated all the environmental standards in their activities and profess a responsible approach to the environment. MATERIALS The aspects influencing the environment include consumption of office paper, consumption of toners for copying machines and printers, collection and liquidation of used packaging and also cooperation in the area of facility management with ISO 14001 certified companies. Purchase of office paper is limited to chlorine free paper (TCF/ECF) and recycled paper. We buy office paper principally from certified producers and with paper origin labelling. Our internal policy sets the principles used for purchase of paper with the aim of: reducing the consumption of non-certified paper as much as possible, using ecological certified paper, using 100% recycled paper in the greatest extent possible, preferring the purchase of paper from certified producers with origin labelling FSC or potentially CSA or PECF, purchasing and using the ECF (Elemental Chlorine Free) or TCF (Totally Chlorine Free) type paper of bleached paper. In all cases when it is impossible to use the classical recycled paper, acceptable is an equivalent in form of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), or CSA (Canadian Standard Association), PECF (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes), SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) or ATFS (American Tree Farm System). By preferring the purchase of FSC raw materials, we contribute to improvement of forest management around the world. We are preventing destruction of forests as well as illegal tree harvesting worldwide. We do not even disregard the issue of bleaching the used wood mass, and we therefore purchase and use, as much as possible, the ECT paper type (Elemental Chlorine Free – meaning that in its production they used chlorine gas, but no chlorine derivatives such as chlorine dioxide) or TCF (Totally Chlorine Free). 77 Environment For all postal consignments addressed to our clients, we use ecological envelopes made of purely natural materials labelled with the certified Green Energy logo. On envelopes, in which we send account statements to clients we put the message of VUB as a company saving the environment – the Green Letters logo. ENERGIES We have introduced various energy saving measures: internal regulations (e.g. economical use of electricity in offices, principles for using air-conditioning, cooling and heating – set up of interior temperatures in cold and hot periods), obligatory turning off of computers in off-hours and during the weekends and holidays, video conferences instead of business trips; using of bicycles. BIODIVERSITY None of VUB Bank’s activities affects the biodiversity. We do not perform any activity that would directly disrupt the environment, and therefore indicators related to biodiversity are not relevant for us. VUB does not own any facility, neither does it dispose of any leased premises that would interfere with or be directly located in a protected territory. For 2014, we do not record any contamination of environment in the surroundings of our facilities. Since we are not a production company, we did not cause any considerable water pollution. We do not own facilities, from which sewage would be discarded into the environment and pose a threat to the biodiversity of water reservoirs. Water is drained off in a standard way to the sewerage system and then processed in waste treatment plants. We contribute to protection of the environment also by keeping accounts and providing loans and borrowings to companies and non-governmental organizations having as their core business ecological activities. ENVIRONMENT AND LENDING POLICY Sustainability of the environment is one of the basic pillars of our corporate responsibility strategy. We not only want to cooperate with partners, who deal with environmental protection and sustainability, but we ourselves want to participate in sustainable development. Within our lending policy, we finance only companies complying with the legal regulations concerning the environment. We support companies meeting the requirements for environmental protection stipulated by the legislation of the Slovak Republics or the European Union. Loans within corporate financing are granted also to clients from sectors, where environmental risks can be expected, however we examine them in detail. From the green-energy oriented perspective, we offer products contributing to sustainability of the environment. We confirmed our effort to bring to the market new or innovated products and services also in 2014, while paying increased attention to the areas of: agriculture, self-administrations, renewable sources, energy efficiency. The projects financed contribute to environmental protection – reducing the CO2 production and thereby improving the environment, protecting people’s health and also natural resources, contributing to reduction of air pollution and reducing energy consumption. 78 Environment ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCTS support and convenient rates on loans for investment projects aimed at energy savings and renewable sources, support of “green energy” projects in case of Slovak companies, loans aimed at energy savings and production of energy from alternative energy sources (water power plants, biogas stations, equipment for biomass combustion and photovoltaic power plants), investment loans for support of infrastructure’s energetic efficiency and renewable energy sources of municipalities in Slovakia, loans for associations of apartment owners and owners of residential buildings in the effort of supporting projects aimed at reaching energetic efficiency, green mortgage – supports low-energy sources, use of renewable energy or innovation supporting green technologies in constructing and reconstructing real estates, convenient rate on loans for projects intended to reduce CO2 emissions and produce bio products, convenient loans and borrowings to businesses and non-governmental organizations with their line of business in ecological activities. EQUATOR PRINCIPLES Pursuant to the Equator Principles, in 2014 VUB Bank granted one loan to a small water plant within the power plant within project financing. GREEN ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS VUB Bank provided loans to 28 projects in the area of renewable sources and energy efficiency in total amount of EUR 18,336,616. In these projects, we used the funds from the European Investment Bank and from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. INVESTMENT LOANS FROM EBRD FUNDS FOR SUPPORTING DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGETIC EFFICIENCY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND RENEWABLE SOURCES OF TOWNS AND MUNICIPALITIES IN SLOVAKIA (MUNSEFF PROGRAM) VUB Bank provides loans from the EBRD funds based on the credit line Supporting Development of Energetic Efficiency of Municipalities (MUNSEFF – Municipal Sustainable Energy Financing Facility). The MUNSEFF program is aimed at supporting energetic efficiency of the infrastructure of towns and municipalities in Slovakia, energetic efficiency of buildings owned by the municipalities and residential housing, as well as projects in the area of renewable energy sources. In 2014, we provided loans in the total investment amount of EUR 8,336,616 mil..

The Bank does not provide funds for financing of some activities from the environmental point of view including: trading in wildlife and products made of it, release of genetically modified organisms into the natural environment, production, distribution and use of prohibited pesticides, herbicides, chemical or agrochemical substances, fishing by means of floating nets, radioactive substances including radioactive waste. If a client consciously engages in areas risky from the environmental point of view, the Bank requires a due diligence aimed at client’s environmental risk management. Below, we specify examples of risky activities and business areas from the perspective of the environment: storage of hazardous waste, its modification and liquidation, production or trading in freon-containing equipment and appliances, production or trading in electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), production or trading in products containing asbestos, foreign trade in waste or waste products. ORGANIZATION OF CORPORATE EVENTS AND INTERNAL TRAINING COURSES The policy addresses the issues of paper consumption, use of office appliances, transport, accommodation and catering. With the aim of reducing paper consumption, we for example stopped using invitations and studying materials in printed form (we send them only electronically). In case the printing of documents is inevitable we use recycled or certified paper and print in the duplex mode. We use recycled and recyclable materials and the events are principally held in energetically saving buildings and in locations easily reachable by public transport (limitation of travels by cars in order to reduce the production of CO2). In accommodation and catering we give preference to supplier companies with an ecological approach. 80 Environment This is how we managed in 2014: 2014 Fulfilment ratio Invitation and documentation ONLY electronically 95 % Duplex printing 100 % Use of ecological certified paper 100 % Use of recycled paper 20 % Selection of suppliers according to environmental criteria 40 % Selection of venue according to reachability by public transport and mass transport 60 % Selection of accommodation by environmental criteria 60 % Use of products, technology and promotional gifts made of recycled materials 30 % Selection and use of local suppliers and products 90 % Catering – water in jugs instead of plastic bottles 80 % Catering – selection of supplier according to environmental criteria 50 % COMMUNITY Through VUB Foundation, we donated funds to several ecological projects and events organized by non-governmental organizations. Ekotopfilm – international film festival on permanently sustainable development connected with ecological education of children and youth, which is the oldest and biggest international festival on sustainable development. VUB has been supporting it already since 2006. Clean Waters Project (Čisté vody) – cleaning of Tatra mountain lakes in the national park. Sponsorship contributions to small ecological projects of local administration. Grants for primary grammar schools within the employee grant program. VUB IS A GREEN BANK On the occasion of Earth Day, VUB Bank issued information about its ecological activities. In addition, the employees were motivated to environmental activities via an internal campaign entitled Earth Day According to VUB: three things you can do for the environment also from your office. ILLEGAL WASTE DUMPS On the occasion of the World Environment Day, VUB Bank announced a motivational program for its employees bearing a headline Can’t you stand looking at it anymore? So take a picture of it! The aim was to alert about illegal dumps and as a result a liquidation of 3 selected dumps in the regions of western, central and eastern Slovakia. VUB employees care about the environment since they enrolled 60 illegal dumps in their surroundings or in the nature they revealed and took pictures of. Out of these, we selected four dumps for removal. The first to be solved was Bratislava, where it has been confirmed that even a small dump can present a great problem. The capital was followed by removing dumps in Kmeťovo, Oravský Biely Potok nad Zemplínska Šírava. GETTING TO VUB ON A BIKE VUB Bank participated in the Bike2Work competition organized by the Cyklokoalícia civic association supporting the development of urban cycling. The aim was to motivate people to use a bicycle rather than a car. The conditions for engagement in this project was to commute to work in May on two wheels. The VUB employees joined their forces and created three teams, out of which two placed in the top rankings in the national evaluation out of a total of 75 teams from around Slovakia. 81 Community Community In 2014, VUB Bank continued in helping the community, where our clients, employees and other partners live. VUB Bank supports projects in identical fields, which are targeted also by VUB Foundation in order to achieve a synergic effect. These are the areas of education, culture and charity. Already for the eighth year, we have been supporting the Good Angel humanitarian system via charity payment cards. Their number increased to 36,000. In the area of university education support, we continued with the grant scheme bringing foreign guest professors to the Slovak universities. We likewise continued in supporting the development of economic science by means of the Economicus competition. VUB managers hold lectures at economic colleges and universities. We provide know-how to start-up female entrepreneurs within the EMMA Business Academy. The Bank purchases the products and services from sheltered workshops, which employ disadvantaged people. In the field of philanthropy, via the VUB Foundation, we continued in our long-term initiatives aimed at preservation of cultural heritage and support of fine arts. In 2014, we contributed to the renewal of several historic monuments and organized two exhibitions of young contemporary art in the painting and photography media. FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL AID Overview of Sponsor Funds Donated Year 2014 2013 2012 Total amount of donations in € 238 thous. 234 thous. 295 thous. Number of IT Equipment Units Donated Year 2014 2013 2012 units 72 32 76 OTHER TYPES OF AID Cooperation with Non-Profit Sector At the end of 2014, Slovakia counted over 159,000 “good angels“, thereof 36 thousand were VUB clients by means of a unique charity payment card V. VUB Bank has been issuing the card for the Good Angel. One percent of the payments performed goes to the account of the non-profitable organization helping oncological patients and families with gravely sick children. This percentage is not donated by the cardholder, but by VUB Bank on his/her behalf. More than 6,400 families received donations through this system. Year 2014 2013 2012 2011 Number of Good Angel cards issued 36,797 31,832 27,559 22,724 VUB’s contribution in euro (1% of 315,981 256,080 205,836 163,165 payments performed by clients’ cards) Cooperation with Sheltered Workshops VUB Bank aimfully supports the functioning of sheltered workshops by purchasing their products and services. In 2014, we purchased from them goods and services in the total amount of EUR 47,000. In December, the VUB Head Office building hosted the traditional Christmas Fair, to which the employees could bring also their children. Together, they could enjoy the holiday atmosphere and the products sold there by 8 sheltered workshops from around Slovakia – Dom Svitania (The House of Dawn), Krídla (Wings), Z dobrých rúk (From Good Hands), Inklúzia (Inclusion), Prvosienka (Primrose), Manna catering, Majolika and Tulipán (Tulip). 83 Community Cooperation with Schools and Support of Education One of VUB Bank’s priorities is education in the main area of our business – economy and finance. Our projects offer talented students a possibility to put forward their original ideas and demonstrate their talent. Their goal is to improve the quality of research and university education in the field of finance and develop the economic science and research. VUB Bank has had a long-term cooperation with secondary schools and universities of mainly economic, mathematic and IT specialization. In the interest of making education in the finance, economy and banking fields more attractive we perform: consultation activities in elaboration of a thesis or annual school project, possibility of an expert and thesis internship for secondary school and university students, technical topical lectures at secondary schools and universities, international student competition. Activities for students are designed as to provide an overview of the functioning of individual divisions of the Bank and the students can test their skills and knowledge from their studies in practical tasks. One of such activities is also the “Internship and Work” (“Stážuj a pracuj“) V program intended for students of final years of universities. The program presents to the students the Bank’s functioning and enables them to try to work in the Bank during several months. By gaining real-life work experience, the students will get an idea about banking already during the study and will better choose the direction to head after school. During the internship, they are engaged in concrete work tasks, have their own development plan, participate in trainings, work under the supervision of a mentor and get feedback on their performance. The most skilled ones will get the possibility to apply for work positions with VUB Bank or remain in a temporary work relation. Award for the Best Student Project in Customer Satisfaction In 2014, we continued the international competition of projects V for students of economic universities which was held simultaneously in 8 countries in cooperation with the parent bank Intesa Sanpaolo. Its aim is to get an independent, critical view of students on the Bank’s activities and proposals for measures leading to improvement of customer satisfaction. The competition develops the students’ potential for creative, nontraditional ideas how to do common things differently. The task of students was to elaborate a project in the area of client satisfaction. The students were preparing for the competition at a workshop, where they received a lot of information and ground documents for their projects. Talented university students worked on their projects assisted by their tutors – our colleagues, from whom they gained invaluable experience. Thanks to the competition, the students had the opportunity to connect their academic study with practice, work on real-life cases from the practice. Solving such cases, they could test their skills and capabilities in applying their knowledge and ideas in practice. Out of 38 enrolled teams, 6 fought their way through to the finals of the competition’s national round. The jury appreciated the high level of student papers and simultaneously highlighted the excellent presentation and argumentation abilities of the finalists. Defending one’s opinions, proposals, ideas in the English language in front of the Bank’s management was a demanding task. The winners received a financial prize, an internship in VUB and participation in the superfinals in Milan. Practice for Students – Future Journalists Transition from university into practice is usually complicated for every graduate. Also the beginning economic journalists know about this, since at the start of their career they lack mainly experience with real-life journalism. Tackling of these obstacles was the target of the project of VUB Bank and the editorial office of The Slovak Spectator weekly. The Focus on Business and Economy project helps mediating to the economic journalism students of the University of Economy in Bratislava theoretical knowledge and practical experience with the media. The students are lead to adopting ethical principles and solving real situations that an economic journalist usually encounters. Participants in the project were not only long-term journalists and academics from Slovakia and abroad but also experts from VUB. The Bank organized for the students a real-life press conference and they could discuss with VUB’s macroeconomist on the work of an analyst and his tasks in the media communication. The project outputs in form of articles by students were published in a special insert of the Slovak Spectator weekly. 84 Community Education for Start-Up Female Entrepreneurs In 2014, VUB Bank together with the monthly Emma organized already the 6th annual training project Emma Biznis Academy. The project is dedicated to women who want to start a business and they already know in what area and they only need the starting impulse and the initial know-how. Lecturers were external experts, managers from VUB, female entrepreneurs and also successful graduates of previous years of the academy. Three days of lectures helped the participants to uncover their potential for business, realize their strengths via personal diagnostics, gain valuable advice, how to communicate towards the customer. Lecturers revealed tricks how to correctly create a business plan and the marketing experts from the Bank also gave their advice how to best do the advertising. In the final workshop, the attendees in the teams created business plans and jointly with the lecturers fine-tuned them to be viable. Engaging Employees in Community Life In the effort of engaging VUB employees in the activities beneficial for the community and supporting their volunteering, also in 2014 VUB Foundation continued in its existing employee programs V. They are very much popular with our employees who can get financial support within the employee program for projects in the area of charity, education and leisure activities for children and youth. The condition for obtaining the grant is the employee’s active participation in the project’s execution in form of volunteering. Employees submit the projects in cooperation with non-governmental organizations, schools or local self-administration. This is a way to support the ideas and projects that employees consider meaningful and useful: together they are solving a certain problem in the community, support community activities or a civic association, in which the employees are engaged. In 2014, our employees submitted altogether 136 projects and received the support of EUR 19,904 for 20 organizations. In the evaluation committees, besides the experts from the given areas, represented are also the Bank’s employees. Support of Employee Projects Year 2014 2013 2012 Number of projects enrolled 136 271 344 Number of projects supported 20 29 34 Grants provided in euro 19,904 63,476 115,852 Volunteering Already for the second year, our employees can use one of the new benefits for volunteering activities – half a day of volunteering with wage compensation. Our employees engaged in the new volunteering activity in the Slniečko Centre (Sun Centre) in order to help the abused women and children. They were doing various works such as making a fireplace in the garden, moving furniture, scrubbing children’s climbing park and its painting, painting rooms and assembling furniture. The centre and its tenants appreciated the help very much. Each year, the volunteers from VUB change the air-conditioned premises of their offices for fresh air in the magical environment of Calvary in Banská Štiavnica. Also in 2014, the VUB employees got involved in the reconstruction within two volunteering works. For one day they tried manual work in the renovation of this precious historic monument – they cleaned the banks off of the wood, mowed the meadows, made moulds and adjusted the paths. It has already become a tradition that each year the employees donate blood during a mobile blood collection “VUB Blood Drop“ in cooperation with the National Transfusion Service. In 2014, 145 donors participated in three collections having donated 63 litres of the life-saving liquid. Just like in previous years, we also ran an internal campaign for the employees with the topic of donating 2 % of the income tax of individuals and individual donations. Many employees have activated the Good Angel charity payment card. The employees engage in the activities beneficial for the community and work as volunteers also owing to the VUB Foundation employee program, in which they can obtain finance for execution of community projects. External Defibrillator A novelty that employees, clients and people passing by will notice are the stickers at the entrance of the VUB Head Office in Mlynské Nivy in Bratislava. It has a big red heart with a lightning in the middle reading “We have a defibrillator“. This simple device saves lives and in many developed countries it is a part of each bigger building. A defibrillator is used in case of grave heart rhythm disorders, which can be restored by means of an electric discharge and many times prevent the worst-case scenarios. VUB Bank was teaching its employees 85 Community this simple act of managing this important device. The first aid training with a defibrillator was given by the Slovak rescue legend, the Chairman of Red Cross, docent of emergency medicine MUDr. Viliam Dobiáš. Each participant got a great gift into his/her hands that he/she can once use to save a life. 2014 VUB FOUNDATION ACTIVITIES VUB Foundation is an independent legal entity, however, it executes some of its activities and projects in close managerial and financial cooperation with VUB Bank and therefore we publish them also in this report. All activities of VUB Foundation in 2014 are comprehensibly presented in its annual report on the web page V. VUB Foundation has carried out its activities in the field of philanthropy since 2003. It is financed by assignment of income tax from VUB Bank (EUR 579,119 in 2014) and by financial donations from its parent company VUB (EUR 200,000 in 2014). VUB Bank provides its foundation with personnel, material and administrative support. In 2014, the Foundation contributed to several community projects with the amount of EUR 547 thous., whereof the majority of funds went to the support of art and cultural heritage (51%) and to the area of charity (33%). The area of education received 16% of the funds. Overview of Grants Provided Year 2014 2013 2012 Support provided in EUR 547 thous. 633 thous. 640 thous. Number of projects supported 70 77 100 For Education Foundation Program The grant program of VUB Foundation International Guest Professor V enables universities of economic specialisation to invite guest experts from abroad for a semester. Besides the pedagogical engagement of significant international experts at our universities, the program brings knowledge about the forms of scientific work at foreign universities, motivates students of economy, doctoral graduates and pedagogues to actively engage in the economic science. The students get a chance to get familiar with the procedures used at other universities abroad and learn in a way never experienced until now. In 2014, foreign professors were hosting at the University of Economy in Bratislava and at the Technical University in Košice. During one semester, professor Nikos Georgantzis from the University of Reding and professor Patrick Musso from the University of Nice were giving their lectures. The Foundation supports also development of economic science rewarding each year quality scientific work in the field of economy within the Economicus competition. For Art Foundation Program The activities of VUB Foundation focused on cultural heritage and fine arts derive from the tradition of enhancing the country’s artistic and historical heritage, which is characteristic also of the Italian owner of VUB Bank, the banking group Intesa Sanpaolo. Preservation of Cultural Heritage In identifying and selecting the monuments in need for help, we cooperate with local partners and experts. Besides reconstructions, our objective is also to raise awareness about the treasures of our country and at the same time of our national heritage’s vulnerability. In 2014, VUB Foundation contributed to preservation of cultural heritage with the amount of EUR 160 thousand, which was dedicated to reconstruction of objects in different corners of Slovakia. VUB Foundation engages also the general public in the decision-making on monuments to be supported. Last year, precious stained-glass windows in 9 towns in various regions of Slovakia were competing for people’s votes in an Internet voting. They were damaged and in a dire need for restoration. Based on the results of voting, VUB Foundation supported the reconstruction of the stained-glass window in Spišská Kapitula, which was the winner of the voting. VUB Foundation has been supporting the reconstruction of Banská Štiavnica Calvary already for six years. It is one of the most precious monuments we have in Slovakia. This UNESCO protected national monument Calvary in Banská Štiavnica has been in a dilapidated condition for a long period of time and in 2007 it was put on the list of 100 most threatened monuments in the world. Over the period of 10 years (2008-2017), VUB Foundation 86 Community annually provides the Fund with a contribution of EUR 66,400. In 2014, the reconstruction works continued in the Upper Church and in the Ecce Homo Chapel as well as the restoration of frescoes. Support of Contemporary Fine Arts Inspired by the example of its parent bank, VUB engages itself also as a supporter of art. In cooperation with the Foundation, each year it organizes two competitions for talents in the painting and photography media. The works enrolled in the competitions are assessed by international expert juries and the winners get prize money. Both competitions are accompanied by exhibitions presenting to the public the best artworks selected by an expert jury. In 2014, VUB organized already its ninth year of the competition entitled Painting VUB Foundation’s Award to Young Artists for an Artwork, which featured 72 enrolled artists. Artworks by the competition finalists were showcased at an exhibition in Nedbalka Gallery from 14/11 to 18/12/2014. Besides direct financial support of artists, the competition also helps promoting the contemporary fine arts. The talents from the Painting competition are presented in a virtual gallery on page V. The aim of the competition Photo of the Year – VUB Foundation’s Award to Young Photographers is to support young artists under 35 years of age and promote artworks in the category of photography. Last year, we held the seventh annual competition, which culminated in an open-air exhibition at Hviezdoslavovo Square in Bratislava. The exhibition lasted four weeks presenting the competition finalists by means of more than 60 largesized photographs. The web page V presents photographs from the finals of previous years of the competition in a virtual gallery. For Hope Foundation Program The program focused on charity helps the disadvantaged groups to equal their chances in life.
