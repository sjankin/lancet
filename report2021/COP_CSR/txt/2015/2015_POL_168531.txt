We have also implemented a new, integrated risk management system. This is a particularly valuable investment in management systems, which significantly helps us, among others, to analyse current and future trends affecting directly the condition and expectations towards our industry. Strong, healthy competition, efficiency and cost optimization, energy and climate policy of Poland and Europe, growing energy needs and energy supply reliability are the key challenges that we confidently respond to.

[http://www.Enea.pl/pl/grupaEnea/o-grupie/spolki-grupy-Enea] A detailed description of the Enea Group as at 31 December 2014 may be found in the annual report http://ir.enea.pl/en/releases/3692?from_y=2015&from_m=1&from_d=1&to_y=2015&to_m=12&to_d=31 Foundations of modern business group Enea Code is the most important document in the Capital Group, which may be compared to constitution. Code is a legal instrument thanks to which we operate every day as one organism and we may take decisions quickly. The Capital Group is like a team. We need to choose wisely its members and their roles. That is why we have introduced changes in the structure of the Group. Simplifying the Group's structure and focusing on its core business, namely generation, distribution and energy trading is the most significant. 5 Development of a shared service centre, began with a foundation of Enea Centrum last year, was a milestone in this direction. It is a kind of administrator . The Centre provides services to, among others, human resources, finance and accounting, IT, logistics, legal services and Client service. Our goal: particular business areas like generation, distribution, trade and shared service centre are represented by individual companies. All share this same Enea logo (with the exception of Enea Operator due to the separation of an energy seller and distributor) and operate on the basis of the new brand strategy. The Group's operations are supported with IT systems. We have had an intense year of work on the implementation of specialized IT systems, such as SAP and Comprehensive Customer Service System (CCSS). Thanks to them, we increase our efficiency. Our business is complex and exposed to a number of risks, i.e. financial, market. That is why we have introduced an integrated risk management system. It covers such areas as: corporate, liquidity, currency, credit, commodity and interest rate risk.

Thanks to the efforts undertaken in 2014, we have joined the Polish Member Committee of the World Energy Council in January 2015.

So far, each of our companies alone was building relationships with suppliers. Purchasing issues are assigned to Enea Centrum, which is an ‘administrative centrum’ of our Group from January 2015. This will facilitate the purchasing process. We use services and products from hundreds of suppliers every day. Three groups that are described below are the most important for our daily activities related to the generation and trade of energy: Suppliers of key raw materials As producers of electricity we constantly cooperate with domestic and foreign coal producers. Lubelski Węgiel „Bogdanka” S.A., Katowicki Holding Węglowy S.A., Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa S.A. and PETROKOL Sp. z o. o. companies are our main Polish suppliers. CHP Białystok uses coal from Russia. We use biomass from Poland, Ukraine, Russia and Belarus to generate energy from biomass. Suppliers are obliged to follow practices consistent with the objectives of the Integrated Management System for Quality, Environment and Work Safety which is binding in Enea Wytwarzanie. Furthermore, a System of Due Caution influences principles of cooperation with biomass suppliers. Issues related with principles of cooperation with suppliers are also regulated by the Code of Ethics and Code of Values. Providers of transport services 20 Transport companies are also our key suppliers. Hard coal is delivered to the Power Station in Kozienice exclusively by rail. Moreover, supply of coal and biomass for CHP Bialystok also depends on the efficiency and logistical capabilities of the rail carrier. Suppliers of transmission and distribution segment From more than one thousand suppliers of products and services for transmission and distribution segment the most important categories include: suppliers of electrical materials used in the construction and operation of the distribution network, producers of transformers, cables and wires, accessories for the construction of the network suppliers of IT infrastructure and services related with the design of the power network providers of modernization services or construction of power grids software, vehicles, fuel and safety equipment providers 21 Clients Our Clients We serve several million customers. We sell energy to over 2 million households and more than 200 thousand business Customers. Our distribution company Enea Operator serves over 2.4 million customers. We have both individual as well as institutional Clients, such as companies, housing associations (MPEC Białystok), schools and local governments (eg. Enea Oświetlenie). Rules for taking care of Clients Customer satisfaction is the most important for us. We wish that Clients buy energy from us. Therefore, we introduce many changes in the organization itself, we develop and try to simplify contact with us. On the other hand, we must be guided by a number of regulations, guidelines and procedures to achieve a high level of service. We also join voluntary projects like ‘Best Practices of the Electricity Retailers’. Enea has joined these practices in 2014 as it passed the audit for compliance with the Code of Best Practice. A result of our care is not only a better service, but also lack of penalties resulting from non-compliance with laws and regulations.

We have adequate regulations that protect your personal information. As a result we haven’t had any complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy and loss of personal data in 2014. Examples of regulations: • ‘Security policy within processing of personal data in Enea SA’ • ‘Instruction of IT system management which processes personal data in Enea SA • Personal Data Security Policy Enea Centrum, • Manual for processing of personal data Enea Centrum, • Each contract signed with Enea Operator Customers contains provisions guaranteeing the protection of personal data. Service quality We introduce clear standards of Client service 23 Service standards define rules of contact with Clients, set goals of organizational changes and trainings of our employees. We identified them in many points of contact, such as call centre, Client service offices and while informing about, for example, heat outages. Organizational change in 2014 was a very important task for us. It involved transfer of Client service into one company Enea Centrum, which acts as a shared services centre. What thus gains our Customer? Thanks to this solution, we were able to develop a new model of business processes and thus provide better Customer service. We are proud that we changed as much as 20 business processes in such important areas like conclusion of agreements or direct Client service. We invest in the construction and development of communication channels We invest in the construction and development of new communication channels and Client service, such as e-CSC, e-Invoice, hotline and e-Commerce. We also implement a modern billing system and customer relationship management (CRM). In case of business Customers, we strive to build long-term relationships based on mutual trust, personal service and professional advice. We introduce new services and offer We introduced new products (i.e. energy with the price guarantee) and facilitated offer selection through a new website enea.pl. Development of the offer applies to the entire Enea team. Enea Logistyka decided to combine quality of products with expert advice for the Customer, as our sales managers are specialists with valuable experience in the industry. Thus, we don’t only sell energy efficient solutions, but also educate. Moreover, Enea Pomiary invested in Measurement Laboratory and expands its operations by a service of current transformer verification. We provide quality of products and high standards of service It is worth to remember that the Enea Group is not just services, but a very strong core of production, supply of electricity and heat in a reliable, safe and environmentally friendly way. To ensure high generation quality, we invest in new technologies and increase capacity. At the same time we take care to provide high quality of service standards. We carry out projects, about which you may read in Investments section. Moreover, Integrated Quality Management System has an important role in quality management. We have power lines of more than 133 610 km (including connections) and 36 877 transmission stations (as of 31.12.2014), which are located in the area of 58 213 km2. Power network covers six provinces: wielkopolskie, zachodniopomorskie, kujawsko – pomorskie, lubuskie and part of dolnośląskie and 24 pomorskie. Ensuring smooth running of such an extensive network requires from us expenditures on investments, network repairs and modernizations every year. Thanks to them, we have reduced time interruptions in the electricity supply. Table 2. Time rates of interruptions in the supply of electricity for years 2013 and 2014 index 2013 2014 unit Number of customers 2.438.037 2 460 758 [no] SAIDI for unplanned interruptions 353.5 219.43 [min] 25 SAIDI for unplanned interruptions including the catastrophic 415.33 223.49 [min] interruptions SAIDI for planned interruptions 127.39 106.09 [min] SAIFI for unplanned interruptions 4.18 3.21 SAIFI for unplanned interruptions including the catastrophic 4.21 3.21 interruptions SAIFI for planned interruptions 0.51 0.47 MAIFI 2.31 1.93 Results of our work – Customers evaluation We’ve conducted a customer satisfaction survey at the turn of 2014/2015 to know the results of our actions. The study included both individual and business Customers, totalling more than three and a half thousand people. The study has been completed by an independent research agency TNS Poland. The result, i.e. Customer satisfaction index CSI is 68.57. We plan to continue this research, to check whether we make adequate progress. We’ve also received an award of a Customer Friendly Company. This program required a study in which 900 Enea Customers took part. The index that we were awarded is 87 per cent. This high rate was second in the industry and resulted in granting us a certificate. Education We share knowledge Professionals work in Enea. We are experts in the field of energy. That is why we share our knowledge at conferences and industry meetings. Examples: 26 • Conference ‘Intelligent buildings management Digital Home’ organized by GLOBENERGIA, during which our experts had a lecture on ‘The photovoltaic system for own needs -from design to execution’. • Fair More Light in Kołobrzeg, where we educated representatives of local governments in the context of new energy solutions entering the market. Education with partners We know that in education we may achieve more by working together. Therefore, the program for the safety of children ‘ Safe Kindergarten Academy’ was implemented under joint preventive actions of Municipal Police Headquarters in Poznań, Polish Gas Company and Enea Operator. Enea Operator also took part in the project Eco-crative addressed to small and medium-sized businesses. Education through the media Our companies try to reach customers in every possible way: • Through press, for example PEC Oborniki published articles in the local press addressed to the inhabitants of Oborniki • Through a series of programs ‘Friends with energy’ in the Mercury Radio (Enea Operator) • Through leaflets, magazine, film footage, a TV program (i.e. MEC Piła) • Through trade shows (i.e. Enea Oświetlenie) • Through e-bhu.pl website or Facebook profile. Customers educational campaign ‘Find out who’. Enea also implemented a nationwide educational campaign directed to individual Customers, warning against dishonest energy sellers, who were deliberately misleading Customers. The action was aimed at making Consumers aware of their rights in this market and promote fair business rules. It is continued in 2015. Press advertisements and newspaper articles appeared in the prass in 2014 warning and teaching Customers on how to avoid signing an unfavourable contract, especially while changing energy supplier. The campaign was conducted in the local press. Energy Trading Association (TOE) was the organizer of the spring action and patronage was taken by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO). Education and information campaign was supported by the biggest players on the Polish electricity market: PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna, TAURON Polska Energia, Enea, Grupa Energa and RWE Polska. 27 Enea within individual actions completed another part of an educational campaign in October 2014. Enea Group published new warning ads and newspaper articles, in the local press covering Enea Group operations, which was supplemented by further identified and reported by the Customers examples of unfair practices. Also in the fourth quarter, Enea has carried out a direct educational campaign for residents of one of Poznań housing associations. Consultants from Enea explained to participants during festival organized by the building manager risks associated with the process of changing energy supplier and informed how to protect themselves against them. In the blocks belonging to the housing association posters and leaflets were distributed. 28 Employees We employ over 10 thousand people and we are one of the major employers in the Wielkopolska region. We revise structure of companies, which causes changes in employment. As an employer, we especially take care for the safety and health of employees. Our employees also benefit from a number of privileges and benefits. We provide development opportunities in strategic directions for the entire Enea Group. Workplace management Work rules in individual companies are governed by the Labour Code and internal documents. Cooperation with trade unions Trade unions operate in our companies. Therefore, collective agreements are binding in the Group. Table 3.

We have recorded two problematic situations in 2014. The first is sporadic protests by individual Customers in terms of technical vindication in metering and billing electricity. Enea Pomiary company responded professionally explaining a debt collection activities arising from liabilities for the use of electricity. Furthermore, we encountered difficulties when buying shares of MPEC from the Municipality of Bialystok. Principles of cooperation with communities We have clear rules, by which we are guided during social cooperation. Enea Foundation, which was founded in 2014, is responsible for this area and operates on the basis of the statute, organizational rules and rules for granting support. The main areas of Enea Foundation activities include: 47 Foundation is the only entity in the Group which grants support for social purposes rules of support are available on the Foundation's website. [https://www.enea.pl/pl/grupaEnea/odpowiedzialny-biznes/dzialalnosc-fundacji] The Foundation carries out own projects, as well as employee volunteering activities, which shall allow for coordination of the volunteer area in the entire Capital Group. 48 Tabela 14. Suma przyznanego wsprcia przez Fundację Enea w 2014 roku Fundacja Enea wydatkowała 416.235 Enea Capital Group also runs sponsoring projects, by being a sponsor of Polish sports (i.e. Polish Speedway Team, cycle of triathlon competitions Enea TriTour or basketball games) and by engaging in cultural projects (i.e. Enea is a patron of the Grand Theatre in Poznań and sponsor of the Perfect band jubilee tour). Enea sponsorship policy is pursued on a basis of strategy and rules. Employee volunteering We have 10 thousand employees it is a huge strength. We created an opportunity to our employees to engage in social activities in 2011. Result: 94 thousand beneficiaries benefited during 5800 hours from the activities of our volunteers. Example comes from the top, which is why a member of Enea Management Board engaged in the volunteering promotion by joining ‘Presidents – Volunteers’ Coalition. Coalition promotes the idea of volunteering. Four Presidents of the largest Enea companies led classroom lessons for children and young people in 2014. Competence volunteering Competence Volunteering is a type of volunteering, in which our employeesvolunteers use their professional knowledge and skills. Our employees took part in two multiannual programs in 2014. In terms of safe handling of electricity and provision of premedical rescue they trained 1024 people in 2014, including children and young people. Volunteers dedicated almost 60 hours on educational activities. • Electricity is not so terrible 49 ‘Electricity is not so terrible’ is a program prepared for the youngest, i.e. children aged 3 to 9. Our employees volunteers conduct classes in schools and make them more attractive by interesting experiences, i.e. they obtain electricity from a potato or a carbonated beverage. • First aid Both children and adults may benefit from our ‘First Aid’ program. Our volunteers – premedical rescuers teach how to react when you witness an unfortunate event i.e. fainting or heart attack. They communicate theoretical knowledge and practice practical skills, allowing to take fast rescue action in situations of a life and healththreatening situation. Demonstrations were conducted by means of professional rescue equipment. Action volunteering Action volunteering are projects and initiatives organized together with partners, supported by our employees. Get to know our volunteering actions organized in 2014. 50 Social investments Aside from supporting social initiatives and engaging employees, we’ve been operating for the benefit of local communities for years, by organizing competitions and participating in historical or educational campaigns. Get to know our initiatives. ‘In contact with electricity’ competition It is a competition to which we invited schools. Its aim was to promote knowledge of the safe use of electricity, as well as to promote green habits. The contestants' task was to document various forms of events related to environmental initiatives implemented by the school. Thus, we encouraged children and young people to practice the art of writing, photography and film. The winners were awarded with modern multimedia boards, and we prepared interactive meetings for them. Education on energy infrastructure 51 Enea Operator takes part in the initiative counteracting the devastation of energy infrastructure – ‘INVINCIBLES. Infrastructure protection’. The Company informs through the media about the effects and extent of the theft and devastation of energy infrastructure (cooperation with i.e. Radio Merkury, Radio ZET, TOK FM, Polskie Radio, telewizja WTK, TVP Poznań, TVP Szczecin, Głos Wielkopolski, Kurier Lubuski, CIRE, epoznan.pl, TV Asta, EXTRA Wałcz). We take patronage over technical schools Decrease of interest in technical and vocational education among youth as well as a need to rejuvenate technical employees inspired Enea Operator Management Board to create a program supporting the education and development of future electricians and power engineers. The first result of the cooperation were officially signed agreements with the Electrical School Complex No. 1 named after Henryk Zygalski in Poznań. Help for people in need Enea Logistyka organized a collection for the ill daughter of the company’s employee. Participation in events and local initiatives • Action ‘Pin a bow’! an annual initiative to celebrate the Wielkopolska Uprising and the promotion of knowledge about it. • Multimedia competition ‘Show history Wielkopolska Uprising 1918-1919’. Competition was organized for the students of Wielkopolska middle and high schools for the 96th anniversary of the outbreak of the Wielkopolska Uprising. • Organization of the industry trade show for local authorities by Enea Oświetlenie, during which key issues concerning lighting and other energy topics were discussed, and which also served the exchange of experiences between local authorities and the energy sector. • Cooperation with the Provincial Police Headquarters in Poznań and State Forests which consists of carrying out joint patrols aimed at preventive monitoring of the area for thieves and vandals spoiling life to power engineers and foresters. 52 Environment Generation and distribution of energy is associated with the interference and influence on the environment. Therefore, we conduct programs and initiatives related to monitoring and managing our impact on the environment, in our daily business activities. We follow many rules and regulations and undertake voluntary initiatives. Result: no fines were imposed on us for non-compliance with laws and regulations relating to environmental protection in 2014. Our environmental activities are focused on five areas 53 Good practice: Protection of white stork White storks likes to build nests directly on electric poles. To protect storks and at the same time prevent possible incidents, Enea Operator takes such actions like: • elevation of nests on special platforms, • on some MV and LV lines insulated cables are used, • use of insulated connectors, • use of insulated covers on the terminals of transformers (MV side and LV), • use of insulated bridges on MV and LV pillars. 105 nests were elevated on the platforms in 2014.

During the ongoing modernization we’ve decided to exchange the exhaust fan on the boiler No. 7. Before the modernization fan control was held by choking the exhaust at the inlet to the fan and the use of two rotational speeds of the drive motor. Installation of new exhaust fan saves energy consumed by the engine, which contributes to the reduction of own needs of block no. 7. 55 Emissions Table 16.

Installation allows to cool the hot combustion gases from the boiler below the dew point temperature and lead to condensation of steam contained in the exhaust. The heat released in the condensation of water is used for utility purposes, to heat return mains water. In this way, a certain amount of heat is produced without the contribution of additional fuel, which contributes to a reduction of coal consumption in coal-fired boilers, and therefore to reduction of CO2 emissions. Water and raw materials Main raw materials that are used in our daily activities include: biomass, coal, fuel oil and light fuel oil. Apart from the two last raw materials that are bought in Poland, the remaining ones are acquired both in the Polish and foreign markets. The largest purchases are made by Enea Wytwarzanie which has the largest generation units. Table 18.
