PLASTIC OMNIUM 2014 FINANCIAL REPORT Sustainable development Independent third-party report 3.5 — INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY REPORTON CONSOLIDATED SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL INFORMATION PUBLISHED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT OF PLASTIC OMNIUM This is a free translation into English of the original report issued in French, and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. This report should be read in conjunction with, and is construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. Financial year ended December 31, 2014 To the Shareholders, As independent third-party, members of Mazars’ network, statutory auditor’s of Plastic Omnium, whose accreditation was accepted by Cofrac under the number 3-1058, we hereby present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information provided in the management report prepared for the year ended December 31, 2014, (hereinafter referred to as “CSR Information”), pursuant to article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Responsibility of the company The Board of Directors of Plastic Omnium is responsible for preparing a management report including the CSR Information required under article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code, in accordance with the indicators reporting protocol and KPI definitions of the company (hereafter the “Reporting Criteria”) and available on request to the society headquarter. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the profession’s Code of Ethics and by the provisions of article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code. Furthermore, we have set up a quality control system that includes documented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with deontological rules, professional standards and applicable legal texts and regulations. Responsibility of the Independent Third-Party 63 Based on our work, our role is to: • attest that the required CSR Information is disclosed in the management report or, that an explanation has been provided if any information has been omitted, in accordance with the third paragraph of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation of completeness of the CSR Information); • provide limited assurance that, on the whole, the CSR Information is fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the adopted Reporting Criteria (Fairness report regarding CSR Information). Our work was carried out by a team of eight people between September 22, 2014 and February 25, 2015, during eight weeks. We conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France and the legal order dated May 13, 2013 determining the methodology according to which the independent third-party body conducts its mission(1) and, on the reasoned opinion, in accordance with ISAE 3000(2). I – Attestation of completeness of the CSR Information We got acquainted with the direction that the Group is taking, in terms of sustainability, with regard to the social and environmental, consequences of the company’s business and its societal commitments and, where appropriate, the actions or programs that stemmed from it. We compared the CSR Information presented in the management report to the list set forth in article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. In the event of omission of some consolidated information, we checked that explanations were provided in accordance with the third paragraph of the article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code. We checked that the CSR Information covers the consolidated scope, which includes the company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the companies that it controls within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), subject to the limits set forth in the methodological note presented in the management report (Part 3 “Sustainable Development”). Based on our work, and taking into account the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. (1) Decree of May 13, 2013 establishing the methodology according to which the independent third-party conducts its mission. (2) ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical information. PLASTIC OMNIUM 2014 FINANCIAL REPORT Sustainable development Independent third-party report II – Fairness report with respect to CSR Information Nature and scope of procedures We conducted the interviews that we deemed necessary with thirty persons responsible for the preparation of CSR Information from the departments in charge of the process of gathering information and, where appropriate, responsible of the internal control and risk management to: • assess the appropriateness of the Reporting Criteria in terms of relevance, completeness, neutrality, clarity and reliability, by taking into consideration, when relevant, the sector’s best practices; • verify the set-up within the Group of a process to collect, compile, process and check the CSR Information with regard to its completeness and consistency. We familiarized ourselves with the internal control and risk management procedures relating to the compilation of the CSR Information. We determined the nature and extent of tests and controls depending on the nature and importance of CSR Information in relation to the characteristics of the Company, the social and environmental issues of its operations, its strategic priorities in relation to sustainable develop­ment, and the industry best practices. Concerning the CSR information that we considered to be most significant(3): • at Group level (HR and HSE Directions), we consulted source documents and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions); we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative and verified, on the basis of sampling techniques, the calculations and consolidation of the information and we verified its consistency with the other information contained in the management report; • at the level of a representative sample of Business Units(4) selected based on their activity, their contribution to consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify the proper application of procedures and conducted substantive tests, using sampling basis, to verify the calculations performed and reconciled data with supporting evidence. The selected sites contribution to Group data equals to 15% of headcount and between 13% to 46% of the quantitative environmental information tested. Regarding the other CSR consolidated Information, we assessed its fairness and consistency based on our knowledge of the Group. Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations relating to, where necessary, the omission of certain information. 64 We deem that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have learned by exercising our professional judgment allow us to formulate a conclusion providing limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required more extensive work. Because of the use of sampling techniques, and because of other limits inherent to any information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR Information cannot be completely eliminated. Conclusion Based on our work, we did not identify any material misstatements that would lead us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, has not been fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
