New pool discoveries GK-28 # 9 and GK-42 # 3 in GK28 PML block in Kutch Shallow Water has a good potential to add a new basin to the list of producing basins in the country. Similarly, the new oil and gas pool discovery Gandhar # 686 in Gandhar Extension VI PML area has shown first occurrence of oil in sand GS-11 in the South Western part of Gandhar field. The discovery SB#300 (SBCG) in Kalol formation South East of main Sobhasan field is the first gas discovery in KS-IV Sub pay. ONGC Videsh acquired 10% participating interest (PI) in the Rovuma Area 1 offshore Block (Area1), Mozambique from Andarko Mozambique Area 1 Limitada (Andarko). ONGC Videsh along with Oil India Limited acquired the company ‘Beas Rovuma Energy Mozambique Limited (BREML) from Videocon Mauritius Energy Limited holding 10% participating interest (PI) in the Rovuma Area 1 offshore block. ONGC Videsh holds 60% shares in BREML. ONGC Videsh, through its affiliates acquired an additional 12% PI in Block BC-10, a deep water offshore block in Campos Basin, Brazil taking its PI in the block to 27%. A consortium of ONGC Videsh and Oil India was awarded two block SS-09 and SS-04 during the “Bangladesh Offshore Bidding Round 2012” during December 2012. ONGC was also awarded two onshore blocks namely PSC-B2 and EP-3 in October 2013 by Ministry of Energy, Myanmar in its “Myanmar Onshore Blocks Second Bidding Round 2013”. ONGC has made voluntary disclosures in respect 68 of Oil and Gas Reserves, conforming to SPE classification 1994 and US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB-69). ONGC has accreted 255.56 MMTOE of in-place volume of hydrocarbon in the domestic basins (operated by ONGC). As on March 31, 2014 the in-place reserves of ONGC as a group stands at 2,004.15 MMTOE which is 14% up from FY 2012-13 figure of 1,759.43 MMTOE. The ultimate reserves accretion by ONGC in domestic area during FY201314 has been 84.99 MMTOE which is the highest in last 23 years. Total reserve accretion in domestic basins including ONGC’s share in PSC JVs stands at 89.76 MMTOE. Likewise, for ONGC Videsh 2013-14 accretion stood at 212.59 MMTOE up from 14.16 MMTOE in 2012-13. The increase is primarily a result of our acquisition in Mozambique and increase in stakes in BC-10 (Brazil) ONGC remained the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in India. Notwithstanding a 7 per cent natural decline in matured basins across the globe, we maintained our production levels from domestic fields at 45.53 MMTOE. Calibrated capital and technology infusion for best-in-class reservoir management maintained production in 15 major fields, contributing 70 per cent of ONGC’s crude production. This positions ONGC in the league of the world’s best brownfield managers. Over 70 per cent of the major producing Indian fields of ONGC, like their global counterparts, are into their natural decline phase. ONGC has arrested the decline in these fields through significant success in technology-enabled Improved Oil Recovery (IOR) and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) projects.

Our actions in this regard are guided by energy footprint of country’s National Action Plan on Climate Change. ONGC is also well aware of the risks arising due to climate change and has a dedicated Carbon Management and Sustainability Group (CM&SG) at corporate office with a specific mandate to position ONGC as the leading organisation in sustainable development (SD) and to voluntarily take up carbon management as an activity to synergize all business activities with sustainable development particularly to address issues related to climate change risks and opportunities arising from carbon mitigation initiatives.

The ONGC Videsh GGFR partnership facilitates These emissions can reduced in a cost effective and supports the national efforts, in the country of manner by upgrading technologies or equipment, operation, to use currently flared gas by promoting and by improving operations. The Global Methane effective regulatory frameworks and tackling the Initiative (GMI) is an action-oriented initiative from constraints on gas utilization. USEPA to reduce global fugitive methane emissions to enhance economic growth, promote energy security, improve the environment, and reduce greenhouse gases emission. The Global Methane Initiative facilitates cooperative mitigation activities that result in bringing more gas to markets through the Identification, Quantification, and Reduction (IQR) path. Building upon regulatory confidence continues to be a big area of concern. Despite the failed Copenhagen summit of 2009, climate change, green initiatives, sustainability, environmental issues continue to remain a big area of concern and a big risk as well in fetching good enough investment to explore and operate. In some cases, these issues are putting the survival of the industry at stake. The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has rather turned out to be great game changer leading to enforcing tighter safety and environmental guidelines, which then requires huge investments and hence a pinch on profit margins. ONGC and ONGC Videsh understand and share community concerns about wasting energy resources and the potential impact of emissions from flaring. The availability of a flare or a vent is an essential safety element in oil and gas processing /production operations. This flaring also holds importance from an environment point of view as the emissions must meet the prescribed ground level ambient air quality standards. The Global Gas Flaring Reduction public-private 74 MRPL is considering the potential hydrocarbon is exploring sustainable options to utilize this pet value chain optimization avenues for sustainable coke for firing in utility boilers to produce steam development.

MRPL the boilers, for up gradation into various lighter molecules like Polypropylene, diesel etc. via delayed coking route. In-house feasibility study of the project with support from potential technology suppliers is being carried out. MRPL is also looking into option of recovering valuable ethylene from low value PFCC off gas and supplying into downstream petrochemical complexes. Also, the recovered ethylene can be used as a co-monomer along with propylene to produce hetero-polymers of polypropylene which have more market value than that of the homopolymer. The in-house viability study along with the potential increase in profitability estimations are being carried out with inputs from downstream petrochemical complexes and ethylene recovery technology suppliers. MRPL’s Phase-3 Refinery Complex Captive power plant facilities and some of the process heaters are designed to burn Natural Gas as fuel. The infrastructure to bring natural gas to Mangalore is being assessed by various gas suppliers. Subject to economics, utilization of natural gas will not only reduce SOx emissions but also open up the avenue of converting the low value internal fuel oil into high value hydrocarbons. In similar lines, MRPL is also exploring the feasibility of installing a new gas turbine considering Natural Gas / other Refinery streams as fuel in the Phase-1 and Phase-2 Refinery Complex. 75 Economic Performance On the path to a sustainable tomorrow Employee Benefits due to internal industrial action was reported as ‘NIL’ for the year 2013-14.

ONGC Energy Centre (OEC) has contemplated a pilot scale Geothermal project in Cambay Basin in Western India, with M/s. Talboom, Belgium( as technology partner). The subsurface heat modelling has estimated a high geothermal gradient. The initial result of the modelling have been encouraging and has estimated that a geothermal power plant of 2.1MWe capacity can be set up in Phase-I. OEC has started preliminary work to evaluate feasibility of geothermal power generation using a single well with a view to utilize abandoned / non-flowing high temperature wells. Longest Horizontal Well by ONGC Videsh Project Location In September 2013, the Sakhalin-1 Consortium announced new drilling achievements of the drilling program, now in its 10th year. In August 2003, drilling of the first extended reach well began from the onshore well site at Chayvo in northeast Sakhalin. Extended reach well drilling continued and in 2013, the drilling team completed two wells, which set two consecutive world records for measured depth. With these accomplishments, currently 8 of the 10 world’s longest wells belong to the Sakhalin-1 Consortium. The technology used for the wells enables drilling from an onshore-based well site to the oil and gas reservoirs located offshore. A well is usually started vertically and then steered gradually to a horizontal path to tap a subsoil formation containing hydrocarbons. 82 In April 2013, the Z-43 well broke the previous world record set at Sakhalin-1, reaching 12,450 meters (40,847 feet) of measured depth. The record was then broken in June by the Z-42 well, with a measured depth of 12,700 meters (41,667 feet) and a horizontal reach of 11,739 meters (38,514 feet). This well was completed in only 73 days, and maintained a high degree of precision by placing the bottom-hole location within 4 meters of the planned target. Refining Operations MRPL has been one of the most technologically advanced refining operations in the country. The company is looking into potential hydrocarbon value chain optimization avenues for creation of economic and environmental value. The pivotal emphasis is on recovering value from low value Hydrocarbons. The commissioning of Phase – III project has significantly boosted the organisation’s capacity. Objectives of the Phase – 3 project: Expansion of Capacity to 15 MMTPA – Up-gradation of residue to high value products – Value addition with production of petrochemical feed stocks Viz. Propylene. – To meet fuel demand confirming to BS III/IV grade After successful commissioning of the Delayed Coker Unit as a part of the Phase III expansion project, MRPL produces Pet Coke, a low value solid hydrocarbon, from the short residue stream. MRPL is exploring suitable options to utilize this pet coke for firing in utility boilers to produce steam for power generation along with capture of the associated pollutant the Sulphur molecule. This will not only help in production of cheaper power, 83 Technology and Innovation On the path to a sustainable tomorrow of polypropylene which has more value than that of homo-polymers. In-house feasibility study of the project with support from potential technology suppliers is being carried out. MRPL has also introduced Refinery Performance Improvement Programme (RPIP) through M/s Shell Global Solutions International B.V. under the auspices of Centre for High Technology (CHT), Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), Government of India. The RPIP is aimed at identifying opportunities for improvement by adopting best operating practices in the areas having a bearing on profit margin including optimizing operation, energy and utilities consumption, minimizing hydrocarbon loss and but also in reduction of SOx emission from the improving maintenance and inspection practices. refinery complex.

The Report includes disclosures of ONGC Group companies (the ‘Group’ i.e. comprising of ONGC Limited, ONGC Videsh Limited and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited) for the year 2013-14, against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2011 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Version 3.1 (GRI G3.1) and the principles of AccountAbility Principles Standard AA1000APS. The intended user of this assurance statement is the management of ONGC Group, and the management is responsible for all information disclosed in the Report as well as the processes for collecting, analysing and reporting that information. Our responsibility regarding this verification is to ONGC only, in accordance with the agreed scope of work. The assurance engagement is based on the assumption that the data and information provided to us is complete and true. DNV GL expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or entity would make based on this Assurance Statement. Scope, Boundary and Limitations of Assurance The summary of scope of work agreed upon with ONGC included the following:  Evaluation of the disclosed information in the Report, including the systems and the processes the Group has in place for adherence to the three Accountability Principles (Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness) as required for a Type 1, moderate level of assurance, in accordance with AA1000AS 2008.  Evaluation of the additional principles of Completeness and Neutrality, as set out in DNV GL’s Protocol for Verification of Sustainability Reporting (‘VeriSustain’ www.dnv.com/moreondnv/cr/; available on request) . The reporting boundary is as set out in the Report in the section ‘About this Report’ i.e. covering sustainability performance of entities of the ONGC Group of Companies and based on the maturity of sustainability data management systems; these entities include:  ONGC Limited, including domestic exploration and production operations, and processing plants including office buildings, institutes, centres of delivery and residential colonies;  ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), including its corporate office in New Delhi and global operations across Imperial Energy, San Cristobal Project, Petrocarabobo, Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company, Mansarovar Energy Colombia Limited and Block CPO-5; and,  The refinery unit of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) at Mangaluru, Karnataka. The assurance engagement was carried out at the ONGC office in New Delhi and did not involve any site visits. No external stakeholders were interviewed as part of this assurance engagement. We have not verified the accuracy and reliability of quantitative data and sustainability performance information stated in the Report. Verification Methodology Our assurance engagement was planned and carried out in December 2014 – February 2015 in accordance with AA1000AS (2008) i.e. Type 1, Moderate and using VeriSustain. As part of the verification, we have challenged the sustainability related statements/claims made in the Report and assessed the underlying systems and processes for adherence against the three AccountAbility Principles set out in AA1000 APS (2008) as referred under the ‘Scope, Boundary and Limitations of Assurance’ of this Statement. We have taken a risk-based approach, that is, we have concentrated our verification efforts on issues of high material relevance to the Group’s business and its stakeholders. In doing so, we have:  Conducted a review of the Group’s sustainability systems, processes and outputs, and other relevant information and documentation made available to us i.e. verified the sustainability-related statements and claims made in the Report and assessed the robustness of the data management system, information flow and controls;  Reviewed the documents of materiality assessment and stakeholder engagement processes adopted by the Group for the purpose of the sustainability reporting exercise;  Conducted interviews with the core team involved in preparing the Report and key decision-makers of the Group at ONGC’s office in New Delhi;  Performed sample-based reviews of the mechanisms for implementing the Group’s policies, as described in the report, and for determining material issues to be included in the Report. Conclusion In our opinion, based on the scope of this assurance engagement, the Report provides an appropriate representation of the Group’s sustainability related policies and management systems. The Report has fairly disclosed its sustainability performance on identified key material aspects from GRI G3.1 and the Oil and Gas Sector Supplement. We have evaluated the Report’s adherence to the following principles on a scale of ‘Good’, ‘Acceptable’ and ‘Needs Improvement’. Page 1 of 2 132 AA1000AS 2008 Principles Inclusivity: The Group has within its reporting boundary, established appropriate processes for stakeholder identification and engagement, and established mechanisms for capturing and responding to identified key concerns of stakeholder groups. The Report brings out key stakeholder concerns. In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Good’. Materiality: The Group has a process for identifying and prioritising significant material issues as part of its sustainability management and reporting; the process includes inputs from diverse stakeholders, industry peers and emerging local and global risks and opportunities in the oil and gas sector. The process may be further strengthened to determine emerging material issues having short, medium and long term impacts on the Group as a whole, and may be further expanded to all exploration and production sites to capture material issues in the sustainability context of its operations in all geo-locations. In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Acceptable’. Responsiveness: The Group is in the process of continual improvement of its systems for engaging in dialogue with its stakeholders, including responses to the analysis of activities dedicated to understanding how ONGC Group is perceived by its key stakeholders with respect to accountability and transparency in sustainability reporting. Within the reporting scope and boundary, the Report has fairly responded to identified major stakeholder concerns i.e. disclosed policies, processes and management systems. In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Acceptable’. Additional Parameters as per DNV GL’s VeriSustain Completeness: The reporting boundary is limited to the Group’s operations in India, Russia, Venezuela, Sudan and Colombia, as disclosed in the Report and referenced under Scope, Boundary and Limitations of Assurance. The Group is in the process of putting in place mechanisms for fully reporting the material core indicators which are partially reported, and has set timelines for full reporting. The level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Acceptable’. Neutrality: The Group has reported its sustainability aspects in terms of content and presentation a neutral tone; in our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‘Good’. Opportunities for Improvement The following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities for improvement reported to the management of ONGC and are not considered for drawing our conclusion on the Report; however, they are generally consistent with the management’s objectives:  The Group may further strengthen the process of materiality determination and arrive at material aspects, topics and performance indicators related to upstream and downstream operations of the group companies including subsidiaries and joint ventures.  The stakeholder engagement process may be further expanded/strengthened and inputs from key external stakeholders across the Group’s extended boundary of operations may be considered.  The boundary of reporting may be progressively expanded to cover all entities in the Group’s sphere of control and influence, and the short, medium and long term impacts of issues specific to these entities may be disclosed.  Systematic internal review and auditing of internal data management system may be implemented to ensure the reliability of reported sustainability performance data and to help in regular and timely disclosures of sustainability performance. DNV GL’s Competence and Independence We are a global provider of sustainability services, with qualified environmental and social assurance specialists working in over 100 countries. DNV GL states its independence and impartiality with regard to this assurance engagement. While we did conduct other third party audits work with ONGC and its subsidiaries in 2013-14, in our judgement this does not compromise the independence or impartiality of our assurance engagement or associated findings, conclusions and recommendations.

We maintain complete impartiality towards any people interviewed.
