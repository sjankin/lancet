Sustainability is a day-to-day commitment of all teams within the Group to run a more efficient and ethical business. The Group’s sustainability strategy, based on environmental best practices, social fairness and transparent governance, is designed to return reliable, quantifiable improvements in performance over the long term. 3 Since 2007, the Group has published an annual Corporate Sustainability Report which aims to provide a clear and objective picture of its goals and results. Since the 2010 reporting period, the corporate sustainability report has been integrated into the Annual Report to reflect the fact that sustainable practices are fully integrated into the Group’s everyday operations. In 2014, the Group continued the implementation of its long-term sustainability strategy and priorities, based on the conclusions of the materiality review carried out in 2012. Cooperation with stakeholders and local economic development has been elevated in the Group’s sustainability initiatives, which aim to sustain and create value for both its stakeholders and the Group. In 2014, Unibail-Rodamco has also pioneered by issuing successfully the 1st Green Bond for on a Real Estate Company in the Euro market, whose first annual reporting on the usage of the raised funds and on the compliance of the selected projects according to the disclosed ‘use of proceeds’ is included in this report. At the same time, the Group maintained its efforts in tackling environmental issues as illustrated by the increase in environmental certification for its entire portfolio and development projects. In 2014, 26 Shopping Centres and 6 Office buildings obtained BREEAM-In-Use certificates. By December 31,2014, 68% (in value) of the standing Retail properties awarded with an environmental certification for more than 1.97 million m2 GLA. 71% of certifications obtained reached an “Excellent” or “Outstanding” level, which is the highest certification profile for a portfolio in the retail Real Estate market. As significant achievement for 2014, following the change of control at mfi, the Group’s Environmental Management System was rolled out in the retail assets owned and managed by mfi, which are now included in the Group’s reporting scope. For further details on the 2014 progress, KPIs and the long term targets, please see pages 122-125. The environmental information and indicators disclosed in the following pages cover 88% of the total gross market value of the Group’s consolidated asset portfolio as of December 31, 2014 and 100% of the Group’s entities with employees for human resources information (excluding Comexposium). – 2014 Financial Report 59 3 Corporate Sustainability Strategy and organisation 3.1.

In a same country, every asset uses the same source of CO2 emission factors (supplier, national decree, or IEA) in order to avoid double counting of national renewable energy production. In the case of green electricity purchase, the supplier’s emission factor is systematically preferred. When the supplier can’t deliver a factor for green electricity provided under a guarantee of origin certificate, the value of zero is applied for the emission factor to this green electricity purchased. In 2014, the assets based in Austria, Netherlands, and Czech Republic use a zero emission factor to the share of green electricity puchase. 84 2014 Financial Report – Corporate Sustainability Environment kWh of green electricity 2014 Convention Shopping Centres Offices & Exhibition Central Scope Total Retail Austria Europe France Netherlands Nordics Spain Scope France Scope France Total Electricity consumption 2012 (kWh) 67/67 270,922,301 30,142,799 64,611,377 94,961,809 6,388,189 28,815,521 46,002,606 15/15 23,293,917 10/10 95,103,435 of which green electricity purchase 2012 (%) 17/67 27% 47% 36% 0% 100% 100% 0% 0/15 0% 0/10 0% Total Electricity consumption 2013 (kWh) 76/76 306,263,003 29,168,799 93,164,928 99,923,978 6,465,962 31,790,441 45,748,895 12/13 19,030,472 9/9 99,942,817 of which green electricity purchase 2013 (%) 23/76 33% 48% 54% 0% 100% 100% 0% 0/13 0% 0/9 0% Total Electricity consumption 2014 (kWh) 59/59 270,926,051 28,253,895 91,013,025 79,856,655 4,221,808 32,702,801 34,877,867 13/14 20,831,742 9/9 89,342,747 of which green electricity purchase 2014 (kWh) 23/59 114,565,076 28,253,895 49,386,572 0 4,221,808 32,702,801 0 0/14 0 0/9 0 of which green electricity purchase 2014 (%) 23/59 42% 100% 54% 0% 100% 100% 0% 0/14 0% 0/9 0% 3 MPI: Carbon intensity of use (gCO2e/visit/year for Shopping Centres, gCO2e/occupant/year for Ofﬁces, gCO2e/m2 DOP/year for Convention & Exhibition centres) [G4-EN18] Numerator: CO2 Emissions MPI related to energy consumption in absolute Energy Consumption MPI.

The new wording also provided for the non-eligibility via the new a) of the 6 of the Article 145, through a more general measure. However the Conseil constitutionnel has ruled the a) of the 6 of the Article 145 contrary to the Constitution in its decision n°2014-708 DC. As a consequence, the new applicable Article 145 does not provide for the non-eligibility of dividends issued from the ‘SIIC regime’ to the parent-subsidiary regime. It is expected that the situation will be rectified by the legislator. – 2014 Financial Report 233 5 Legal information Share capital – General Information Increases/decreases in Unibail-Rodamco‘s share capital during the past five years Number Total number Total share Premium resulting Date Movements in the share capital of shares issued of shares capital from transaction 01/03/2010 Exercise of options (2002-2005) 42,410 91,306,959 €456,534,795 €3,139,535.78 07/05/2010 Exercise of options (2002-2005) 98,719 91,405,678 €457,028,390 €7,596,364.73 24/06/2010 Exercise of options (2002-2005) 7,771 91,413,449 €457,067,245 €494,678.35 24/06/2010 Reimbursement of ORA 4 91,413,453 €457,067,265 €665.60 24/06/2010 Company Savings Plan 30,579 91,444,032 €457,220,160 €3,175,626.15 11/10/2010 Exercise of options (2002-2005) 270,344 91,714,376 €458,571,880 €19,977,434.14 11/10/2010 Reimbursement of ORA 1,907 91,716,283 €458,581,415 €337,618.75 31/12/2010 Exercise of options (2004-2006) 19,509 91,735,792 €458,678,960 €1,608,693.75 31/12/2010 Reimbursement of ORA 10,132 91,745,924 €458,729,620 €1,568,825.35 10/03/2011 Exercise of options (2004-2006) 16,331 91,762,255 €458,811,275 €1,210,623.54 10/05/2011 Exercise of options (2004-2006) 128,134 91,890,389 €459,451,945 €11,267,171.04 30/06/2011 Exercise of options (2004-2006) 5,990 91,896,379 €459,481,895 €725,635.70 30/06/2011 Reimbursement of ORA 2 91,896,381 €459,481,905 €297.83 30/06/2011 Company Savings Plan 28,766 91,925,147 €459,625,735 €3,350,951.34 18/10/2011 Exercise of options (2004-2007) 13,603 91,938,750 €459,693,750 €1,289,413.54 18/10/2011 Reimbursement of ORA 4 91,938,754 €459,693,770 €613.80 19/10/2011 Cancellation of shares (128,370) 91,810,384 €459,051,920 €(15,567,844.45) 25/11/2011 Exercise of options (2005-2007) 146 91,810,530 €459,052,650 €18,025.16 25/11/2011 Cancellation of shares (8,900) 91,801,630 €459,008,150 €(1,083,085.50) 31/12/2011 Exercise of options (2005-2007) 5,259 91,806,889 €459,034,445 €427,924.83 09/05/2012 Exercise of options (2005-2007) 112,092 91,918,981 €459,594,905 €12,118,325.55 29/06/2012 Exercise of options (2005-2007) 880 91,919,861 €459,599,305 €82,128.10 29/06/2012 Reimbursement of ORA 435 91,920,296 €459,601,480 €66,241.80 29/06/2012 Company Savings Plan 41,077 91,961,373 €459,806,865 €4,236,051.16 31/08/2012 Exercise of options (2005-2007) 254,181 92,215,554 €461,077,770 €32,532,522.48 01/10/2012 Exercise of options (2005-2007) 21,415 92,236,969 €461,184,845 €2,887,718.20 31/12/2012 Exercise of options (2005-2008) 642,004 92,878,973 €464,394,865 €74,332,174.72 31/12/2012 Reimbursement of ORNANE 2,013,007 94,891,980 €474,459,900 n/a 01/03/2013 Exercise of options (2006-2008) 105,465 94,997,445 €474,987,225 €10,720,322.94 31/03/2013 Exercise of options (2006-2009) 431,244 95,428,689 €477,143,445 €38,676,960.60 03/06/2013 Exercise of options (2006-2009) 582,712 96,011,401 €480,057,005 €54,102,667.78 03/06/2013 Reimbursement of ORA 21 96,011,422 €480,057,110 €3,190.92 03/06/2013 Dividend paid in shares 1,190,366 97,201,788 €486,008,940 €189,994,317.26 01/07/2013 Company Savings Plan 27,812 97,229,600 €486,148,000 €4,249,951.72 30/09/2013 Exercise of options (2006-2009) 10,451 97,240,051 €486,200,255 €1,018,780.52 31/12/2013 Exercise of options (2006-2009) 28,525 97,268,576 €486,342,880 €2,834,076.22 03/03/2014 Exercise of options (2007-2009) 17,733 97,286,309 €486,431,545 €1,708,947.30 31/03/2014 Exercise of options (2007-2010) 298,109 97,584,418 €487,922,090 €33,304,465.88 01/07/2014 Exercise of options (2007-2010) 416,441 98,000,859 €490,004,295 €47,417,417.39 01/07/2014 Company Savings Plan 30,779 98,031,638 €490,158,190 €4,830,560.79 30/09/2014 Exercise of options (2007-2010) 9,206 98,040,844 €490,204,220 €964,819.33 30/09/2014 Anticipated allocation of Performance Shares (2012) following a death 43 98,040,887 €490,204,435 €0.00 30/09/2014 Reimbursement of ORA 500 98,041,387 €490,206,935 €76,140.00 31/12/2014 Reimbursement of ORA 72 98,041,459 €490,207,295 €10,941.68 31/12/2014 Exercise of options (2007-2010) 16,888 98,058,347 €490,291,735 €1,737,148.66 Note: increases in the share capital associated with the exercise of options and reimbursements of ORA and ORNANE are taken into account by a statement of the Management Board. 234 2014 Financial Report – Legal information Share capital and voting rights 5.3.
