As a comprehensive biomass enterprise, the Nippon Paper Group practices sustainable forest management, while also making full use of and recycling the precious resources forests represent. Helping to fight global warming, protect biodiversity, and prevent resource depletion Three Cycles Contributing to Sustainable Development 1 Sustainable Forest Management CO2 sequestered in wood 204,000 hectares of company-owned forests worldwide —roughly equivalent to the entire area Harvesting and use of Tokyo Prefecture After harvesting, steps are taken to regenerate forests. Every effort is being made to ensure that forests under our stewardship thrive indefinitely. Preserving biodiversity Nippon Paper Industries has designated approximately 20% of its Japanese forest as “environmental forest areas.” Photosynthesis 1 Sustainable Forest In these areas, logging for commercial purposes is prohibited and forest Management Planting biodiversity and water resources are protected. These environmental forest areas include national park lands in Akan, Nikko, and other places as well. Environmental forest areas: 18,000 hectares About 20% of forests owned in Japan CO2 Nurturing 2 Carbon Neutrality (Preventing Global Warming CO2 absorption and sequestration 2 Carbon Neutrality through the Carbon Cycle) (Carbon Cycle) CO2 sequestered in company-owned forests worldwide: 34 million tons CO2 absorption from the growth of plants and trees Trees, the principal raw material used by the Nippon Paper Group, absorb and hold CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow. When wood resources are burned, this CO2 is released, so there is no net increase in atmospheric CO2. The ongoing effective use of wood resources from properly managed, sustainable forests constitutes a carbon-neutral cycle that adds no carbon to the atmosphere. 6 Nippon Paper Group Sustainability Report 2015 Making full use of and recycling trees as a biomass resource Cascade use of wood Cascade use of trees The Nippon Paper Group uses trees in a cascade of applications that contributes to Unprocessed wood greater resource usage efficiency by employing every bit of every tree.

This was a key point of the Fourth Medium-Term Business Plan and is addressed in more concrete terms in the Fifth Medium-Term Business Plan. The basic concept of this strategy is to apply the Group’s trove of knowledge in wood science and technologies, and its own biomass resources inside and outside Japan, to capitalize on opportunities in growth fields and develop new businesses into key contributors to the Group’s success. Accelerating the transformation of the Group’s business structure is to be achieved by concentrating on expanding investments in growth fields and reallocating management resources based on a reassessment of Group assets, while enhancing Yoshinao Kozuma the competitiveness of existing businesses to provide earnings to underpin these initiatives. Professor, Faculty of Economics, Sophia University Something I believe the Group deserves special credit for is the development of a clear Profile statement of its corporate mission in conjunction with its Fifth Medium-Term Business Plan. That After leaving the doctoral plan stresses the Group’s corporate mission – “… to contribute to better living and cultural progress program at the Sophia everywhere it does business” – which is to be achieved through a corporate vision, one element of University Graduate School of Economics, Professor which is to “Drive social sustainability through our business.” This is a clear statement of Kozuma became a research assistant at the Nagoya commitment to achieving business results that support a transition to a sustainable society. Institute of Technology and Pursuing a renewable energy business to help lower CO2 emissions, and elevating the 3R worked at the Limperg Instituut, Inter-University Reduce, Reuse, Recycle performance of products in its packaging business, are two ways in Institute for Accounting and which the Group proposes to achieve its objectives, and much is expected of their endeavors. The Auditing, in the Netherlands, as a guest researcher funded ability to clearly express the stance described above serves as a reminder of why Nippon Paper by the Dutch government. He became an associate Industries has been selected for inclusion in the Ethibel Investment Register and Euronext Vigeo professor at the University of World 120 index. Shizuoka School of Administration and Turning to environmental performance, attention focuses on progress in achieving the Group’s Informatics, and then took up his current position as Green Action Plan 2015. Included therein are quantitative targets to be achieved on various fronts professor in the Faculty of by fiscal 2015. Most of these have been achieved or are very close to being achieved. Two areas Economics at Sophia University. He has held where performance is falling behind and stronger measures are called for going forward are total successive positions as the hectares of afforested land outside of Japan and the percent of waste recycled in-house. chair or member of various CSRor environment-related In terms of social performance, the Group has gradually increased its female management advisory panels, study groups, and research participation percentage over the years. Still, however, one would like to see greater efforts here conferences for the Ministry and in the hiring of people with disabilities, an area in which the Group has nearly but not quite of the Environment; the Ministry of Economy, Trade achieved the legally mandated workforce participation rate. and Industry; the Ministry of As for the sustainability report itself, it is clear that several improvements in disclosure have been Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism; the Cabinet made. Materiality standards, for example, have been partially revised and the related indicators Office; and the Japanese Institute of Certified Public disclosed. Showing relevant indicators at the beginning of each report section covering a key issue Accountants. greatly facilitates understanding of the results of particular endeavors. The Group has also included a table providing nearly comprehensive coverage of employment data at the consolidated level. This information was previously available only online, and I see its addition to the printed report as a significant improvement. As well, credit should be given for the addition of data on dispatched workers as this change in the Group’s disclosure standard for workforce data brings it very close to the workforce reporting requirement in the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. Action in Response to Third-Party Comments In fiscal 2015, the Nippon Paper Group – in order to have all employees work toward a common purpose and objectives set forth in clear terms a social mission, a vision for achieving that mission, and values that must be upheld for mission achievement. Based on the mission we defined, we then formulated our Fifth Medium-Term Business Plan, for creating new value as a comprehensive biomass enterprise shaping the future with trees. In our Sustainability Report 2015, we have done our best to explain how our mission and Fifth Medium-Term Business Plan are tied to CSR activities and will contribute to the building of a sustainable society. As Dr. Kozuma recognizes, we have also taken steps – such as using text that is more clearly written and including indicators or illustrations for particularly important matters – to facilitate understanding of report contents. Furthermore, we have adopted a uniform reporting boundary wherever possible as a direct response to Dr. Kozuma’s comment regarding multiple reporting boundaries depending on data type in our Sustainability Report 2014. As for Dr. Kozuma’s input regarding our CSR activities, Shuhei Marukawa we will carry on with efforts to step up our performance. Looking to the future, we aim to continue Executive Vice President, pursuing business activities that emphasize coexistence with society and welcome candid Representative Director opinions and critiques regarding our performance. and General Manager of the CSR Division Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd.
