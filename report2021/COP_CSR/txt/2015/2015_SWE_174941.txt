Robert Mayr In 2014, the Group initiated an investment in a new data Product Safety and Sustainability Manager collection software (360report), which will form the basis for fulfilling the reporting requirements of the UN Global Compact, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and Sustainability reporting following Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in general. In the future this software will also serve as a benchmark and improvement tool at group level. The key responsibility for sustainability is transferred to each unit, placing decisions closer to where the most specific knowledge about possible improvements are.

Although our production plants and our main suppliers are operating in non-critical and well regulated countries, we are very careful and continuously observing the situation in our supply chain.

Elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour as well as the use of child labour is legislated in all countries where AR Packaging has employees. More detailed policies are implemented in each of our production plants. Labour practices Freedom of association AR Packaging is committed to providing fair compensation We respect the freedom of association and the right for and working conditions for all its employees. Working hours collective bargaining within our group. A workers’ council is are set according to the domestic laws in force or industrial implemented in each production plant.

This will secure that labour agreements will be applied. AR Packaging also does not support differences between salaries and remuneration of women and men in our organization. Benefits Benefits provided to full-time employees are differing within Parental leave our group, depending on plant benefits such as healthcare Parental leave is supported within our group. Five females and disability and invalidity or life insurance that are offered. four males returned in 2014 to their production plants and were integrated into work again.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 / SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 14 USED RAW MATERIALS (UN GC principle 7/8) AR Packaging promotes sustainability across all aspects of the business, with a particular focus on sound procurement and conversion practices, thus ensuring responsible management of forests and other natural resources. In principle, all materials used by the company are recyclable and majority is reused as material and a smaller part as source of energy. AR Packaging actively works with customers to decrease material usage with smart designed alternative constructions and to increase the amount of renewable materials in the packaging.

Used amount of these raw materials are often product related or needed to fulfil requirements and are therefore in close correlation with the design of the specific products for our customers. AR Packaging work continuously with optimisations of our processes and offer our customers possibilities to reduce specific raw materials, where the main focus and often main possibilities are on the board and paper material but also on transport packaging.
