My first mission focused on European CPR1 certification. SPIE entrusted me with this project and, together with my colleagues, we obtained this certification at three sites in June 2014. This project, like those that have followed, accurately reflects the spirit of initiative and responsibility that you find at SPIE. This traineeship has also been a valuable opportunity to develop a relationship network and get a clear idea of each unit’s operations through its multidisciplinary approach. Looking back on the past year confirms how much I enjoy working at SPIE. My colleagues taught me a lot and I stay in contact with them. The cross-functional Watch the organisation allows you to react quickly and encourages you to take initiative. The work interview environment gives you freedom to work independently, which also means taking responsibility. In addition, working in a truly multi-technical company gives you access to a variety of large-scale projects. SPIE Nederland doesn’t just maintain facilities or infrastructure; it designs and builds them from start to finish, managing their entire lifecycle. Today, most groups make similar demands in terms of performance. But they don’t all have the attitude that I’ve just described, this growth dynamic and openness that you find with a learning organisation. Another thing that’s important to emphasise is SPIE’s close cooperation with its customers, its role as a long-term partner. Such an approach, which is applied at all levels of the organisation, changes the ways things are done, and means that the risks and gains are truly shared. 1. Construction Product Regulation. 61 OUR EMPLOYEES’ ENERGY 62 Inspired by... /SPIE / 2014 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT What we experience Inspired by INÈS DE OLIVEIRA BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT MANAGER SOUTH KOREA SPIE Oil & Gas Services OPENNESS + OPPORTUNITY Being a part of SPIE does not mean following a well-trodden path. It means fulfilling your aspirations, even if it’s sometimes difficult and represents a real personal and professional challenge. Whatever your choice, you have all the resources and support that a company that believes in you can provide. When I look at the different career paths, I realise that everything is possible. Our Group is a breeding ground for opportunities thanks to its great diversity of skills sets and international scope. As for me personally, I was first put in charge of recruiting and training local technicians abroad for major oil and gas companies. After returning to Paris, I held a position in career and skills management. The logical progression would have been to move up through the ranks of HR. But in fact, in 2011, I decided to take a different direction and leave for Angola. Rather than a staff position, I needed to be closer to operations; I wanted to see what I could actually contribute to the company on a more commercial level. SPIE supported my decision with all the necessary resources for three years of what was a remarkable experience. I am now taking on a new challenge in South Korea with a position oriented towards the country’s commercial development. Once again, SPIE helped me to move out of my comfort zone and push my limits. That’s why I no longer consider certain jobs to be beyond me: I mean, why not become Country Manager some day? That would enable me to fully focus on improving and developing a subsidiary. Moreover, it’s not that common for a woman to hold such a position. As I see it, a good manager is someone who capitalises on his or her employees’ skills, provides them with the means to work efficiently and strives day in, day out to give meaning to their actions. 63 OUR EMPLOYEES’ ENERGY COMPANY AGILITY, A s SPIE’s workforce approaches 40,000, one of the greatest HR management challenges is adapting to THE KEY TO the fast-paced changes of an increasingly demanding environment, amidst growing interactions at all levels SUCCESSFUL of the company.

ATTRACTIVENESS, THE SIGN OF AN AMBITIOUS STRATEGY As one of the most attractive companies in its industry, SPIE has won the title of Top Employer in Belgium for seven of the last nine SPIE voted Top Employer years. In 2014 the Group conducted its international campaign in Belgium – So’SPIE to attract applicants who want to share a different mindset, Read the press release marked by authenticity and the desire to continue to grow over one’s entire working life. In this same spirit, a number of initiatives were launched: for example, students were brought from the Netherlands to discover Paris and SPIE, after having worked on a case study during their train ride. On a broader level, the Group continued to develop its school-business partnerships, such as with ESTP, one of France’s most important engineering schools for our areas of expertise. CAREER DEVELOPMENT IN AN INTERNATIONAL COMPANY SPIE’s internationalisation continued in 2014, for example through 120 NATIONALITIES the Group’s support of France’s international volunteer programme (VIE), which is aimed at young graduates and young people pursuing work/study programmes.

Among the examples of growing synergies between European subsidiaries is the assistance provided by SPIE Nederland’s teams in the integration of UK company Electricity Network Solutions (ENS), which similarly works in the fields of construction and maintenance of overhead power lines.

Aimed at promoting the diversity of employee backgrounds, the “So’SPIE” recruitment campaign was a resounding success among young Europeans, particularly in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. 65 OUR EMPLOYEES’ ENERGY 66 Inspired by... /SPIE / 2014 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT What we protect Inspired by HERVÉ MILLIOT SITE MANAGER AT CATTENOM FRANCE SPIE Nucléaire SAFETY AND SECURITY Protecting on-site teams and the local community is our number one priority. To meet our high safety standards we have a Prevention Plan, as in many other industrial sectors, that takes into account the operations of all the parties in a given area, for example a power plant, the containment wall of a reactor or a machine room. We complement this plan with an Analysis of nuclear safety and security, radiation and environmental risk (ADR SSRE) adapted to each type of service intervention. This approach is based on our fundamental corporate values: providing safety induction courses for employees, ensuring the use of personal protective equipment, and integrating the Risk Analysis and Prevention Plan at each stage of the operational cycle. Work supervisors thus monitor service interventions Watch the through strict control procedures. For work at a height, certain employees interview undergo specific accreditation training. When the least risk is detected, all work stops and the construction site is immediately secured. Inspection and monitoring measures are also implemented, including regular visits from higher-level supervisors, joint safety inspections with the customer, and weekly safety meetings which serve to strongly anchor our rules in worksite practices. However, human behaviour-related risk always exists. It is therefore important to constantly remind ourselves of best practices, strive to adopt a safety culture and make sure it is fully integrated into the organisation of our work. 67 OUR EMPLOYEES’ ENERGY SAFETY, S afety is SPIE’s top priority, a sign of its professionalism and an integral part of the Group’s identity. SPIE has OUR NUMBER ONE developed a concerted policy around safety in terms of resources, procedures and management and has made becomRESPONSIBILITY ing accident-free, particularly in relation to major risks, its number one goal. AN ONGOING RE-EXAMINATION OF OUR OPERATIONS SPIE applies the highest safety standards to its operations (OHSAS 18001, VCA, MASE, etc.). Going beyond basic regulatory compliance, the Group encourages innovation and the sharing of best practices. Among the examples for 2014 are the creation of a working group on safety practices and the development of the “Secur’Alerte” application for online validation of individual protection equipment, Units with health both for Total Raffinage Chimie. The Group also cooperates with specialised organand safety management isations such as the Institute for a Culture of Industrial Safety (ICSI) in order to fully integrate human and organisational factors.

However, employee training and awareness-building are just as important, particularly to improve preparation phases and to combat the dangers associated with routine processes. With the assembly of power lines for example, specific training facilities enable employees to acquire the right reactions while working at height. Procedures such as Safety Talks, preventive inspection tours and “Last Minute Risk Analyses” (LMRAs) also help to improve behaviour. On a broader level, management’s strong involvement drives this ambition throughout the organisation. In 2014, the implementation of the “Safety First” plan in Germany after the acquisition of Hochtief Service Solutions led to a 36% reduction in accidents. A GLOBAL CHALLENGE FOR THE ENTIRE COMPANY Protecting employees also extends to questions of health and quality of work life. Lost-time injury rate Freephone lines are available to offer psychological support in understanding stress (LTIR) situations. In high-risk countries, SPIE teams also look out for their own safety by relying on specialised organisations. In 2014, preventive actions were taken for example in Africa following the outbreak of the Ebola virus and in Saudi Arabia in response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). On a broader level, this challenge concerns the entire decision-making chain, with everyone at their own level called upon to deal with these situations through their way of being, acting and organising themselves.

The fact that each of us feels fully responsible and committed, independently of the strict adherence to the rules of our profession, does not mean that we neglect them, but rather the contrary. For us this is only an introductory stage in the exercise of our professions, which cannot be conceived without total integrity and loyalty to all our stakeholders. No commercial or other type of opportunity can prevail over our core principles, or call into question a corporate decision. Ethics is not only a question of Watch the personal morality, but also of SPIE’s reputation in its markets. This is why we interview have welcomed into our company an independent manager, the Ethics Compliance Officer, who is responsible for enforcing a “zero tolerance” policy with regard to any wrongdoing. The goal of this governing body, supported by both the management team and local management, is to identify any situation that could lead to non-ethical behaviour. In practice, a sustainable partnership with a customer demands healthy commercial relations − quality of service, responsiveness to customer needs and ethical standards cannot be disassociated. Similarly within the company, ethical policies are necessary. Today for example, the development of social networks and group platforms entails new challenges, so as not to divulge confidential company information. All of this requires exact and regularly updated directives. 71 OUR EMPLOYEES’ ENERGY 72 Inspired by... /SPIE / 2014 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT What we support Inspired by ERWIN DE BOCK DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT BELGIUM SPIE Belgium LOCAL PRESENCE + EFFICIENCY Supporting environmental protection is critical pour SPIE. Our local presence enables us to diminish our carbon footprint, with offices close to our operations. We also focus our efforts on everything related to the materials that we buy, a crucial factor in drastically reducing our impact. It is particularly through our businesses that we act on the environment, by reducing energy consumption and improving the quality of our living environment. Through these actions our company provides real value added, which is much appreciated by our customers in all the markets where we operate. By protecting the world we live in, we are also sharing a certain mindset with our customers. In your home for example, you are used to turning out the light when Watch the you leave a room. This behavioural question is an essential aspect of a building: interview technical installations remain important but we must go further by creating a better managed and more highly automated environment focused on people’s comfort. In the past, we operated within a more conventional system defined by mechanical parts, tubes and traditional maintenance operations. Today, we have a proactive approach, where efficiency and prevention impact the site’s entire functioning. This approach is not only applicable to buildings. I’m thinking of smart cities, and various facilities and vehicles that run on electricity. Current urban development shows a good balance between all the points that I have just mentioned and make for greater efficiency overall. SPIE must maintain a leading position and continue to develop in this direction, which will only become increasingly important in the future. 73 OUR EMPLOYEES’ ENERGY WORKING I n its pursuit of corporate responsibility, SPIE is committed to constantly improving its approaches to social TOGETHER TO progress, environmental issues and economic development.

In the area of business ethics, the Group has thus implemented a “zero tolerance” approach which relies on employee awareness and calls on them to exercise exemplary conduct. In the fight against discrimination, SPIE has broadened its actions with, for example, a new SPIE Disability Awareness Month, intended to sensitise employees to the challenges of disabilities in the workplace. Another example is the Diversity Award that went to SPIE Sud-Ouest for its recruitment of work/study employees from diverse backgrounds. Yet another example are the initiatives to increase the share of women in the company’s professions, working with associations such as “Elles bougent” in France’s Lorraine region.

In 2014, a commemorative walk on the Normandy beaches brought together British employees in period uniforms. As for charity activities, each subsidiary defines its own actions: in Germany for example six NGOs received financial support.
