When I visit worksites in the organization, I am able to gather feedback about the decisions we have made centrally, and I see a company culture built around strong commitment and accountability. SUSTAINABLE URBAN PLANNING For us, sustainability is about long-term value creation and being accountable financially, socially and environmentally. The basis for our work is JM’s Sustainability Policy and JM’s Employee Code of Conduct. During the year we have directed resources to increasing knowledge about the Group’s ethical guidelines as well as equality and diversity plan in all management groups in Sweden. The ambition is for JM’s sustainability work to be transparent for investors and other stakeholders. We have identified a number of aspects that are associated with significant possibilities and risks from a sustainability perspective, and from these have chosen those that we believe to have clear improvement potential. The aspects we will prioritize in our work are described on pages 35–49. We have chosen to report our sustainability work based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 (Core). JM supports the UN Global Compact and its ten principles by taking a clear position on issues related to human rights, labor law, environment and anti-corruption. GOOD CONDITIONS Given the large population increases in JM’s markets, a continued urbanization trend and in particular considerable interest in our products, I believe that we are facing favorable conditions for our business in 2015 as well.

We aim to understand how driving forces such as urbanization and demographics influence customers, and which requirements and needs are important to both current and future customers. CUSTOMER NEEDS BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND MACRO 5 OUR CUSTOMERS’ SURROUNDINGS INFLUENCE THEIR NEEDS JM is to be the customer’s first choice when buying a new home on our markets. We focus on the customer’s needs. Doing so gives JM one of its most important competitive advantages. In order to assume a leading position, we must be quick to recognize and understand how people live and work. From a slightly longer term perspective, the most important societal changes include urbanization, the aging population and a firmer focus on the environment and sustainability. TRENDS THAT INFLUENCE DEMAND: • Demographic changes, an aging population and a large generation of young people entering the housing market • Urbanization is a strong trend. People are seeking freedom of choice and diversity • Urban areas and commuting distances are growing, which makes new housing markets attractive • New technology generates new opportunities and makes old solutions obsolete • Financial development; continued growth of real disposable income, and the population is more inclined to put a larger portion of income into housing • Shift in values; more prominent individualism, but also accountability for the common environment • The real thing and genuine craftsmanship • The growing green city and the environment.

At the same time, we also want to take responsibility for our children’s future environment. More information about our environmental initiatives is presented on pages 33–44. WELL-INSULATED WINDOWS Windows are often a major source of heat loss in a building. As a result, all of the windows in our new homes have extra heat insulation with a Uw value of 0.9 W/sqmK. ALLERGIES Research has shown that there may be a correlation between problems with allergy in children and PVC. JM’s residential units have PVC-free walls and flooring. The landscaping surrounding JM’s homes avoids the use of plants and trees that are toxic or unsuitable for people with allergies. JM avoids “dusty shelves” in the kitchen by installing cabinets that go up to the ceiling. ENERGY-EFFICIENT APPLIANCES Major appliances can account for a large proportion of a household’s electricity consumption, which is why JM equips our housing with energy-efficient appliances. All of our housing that is being planned will be equipped with induction cooktops, which can offer energy savings of up to 20 percent compared to a traditional cooktop. GOOD ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION ENVIRONMENT We minimize exposure to electrical and magnetic fields. We always use a five-wire system, which limits the magnetic fields throughout the building, and we avoid locating distribution boxes close to the bedroom. GOOD SOUND ENVIRONMENT Many people perceive loud sounds and noise as one of the biggest problems in a residential environment. Our residential units are quieter than what Swedish building regulations require. Our extra thick walls and floor structure provide very good insulation between apartments. Our exterior doors are required to have a good sound transmission class, and we avoid mail slots in doors by placing mailboxes in the entry to the stairwells and newspaper delivery boxes by the apartment doors. POSSIBILITY TO IMPACT ENERGY CONSUMPTION Since all of our residential units are constructed according to JM’s concept for low-energy houses, residents can achieve low household operating costs and help lower overall energy consumption. In addition, hot water usage is measured individually in each apartment, which helps residents understand that using hot water sparingly will also result in a lower cost. SOUND MATERIALS Wood, rock and tile. We use natural materials to the greatest extent possible. We have been developing an environmental product database since 1996 where we check relevant products. Doing so enables us to build housing that is healthy and helps us avoid using hazardous substances.

In 2014, just over 200 potential suppliers underwent a 74 sustainability assessment. 73 JM’s program for audits of suppliers’ sustainability work entails that roughly 20 suppliers are selected each year to be evaluated 72 via a written questionnaire.

Estimated number of potential shares for the A sensitivity analysis of the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have convertible debenture and warrant program 346,242 537,970 to exceed about 23 percent (21) before the need for impairment would be present. Weighted average of the number of shares In all cases, the sensitivity analysis above shows a surplus (i.e. that the recoverable during the year, diluted 76,888,597 78,983,735 amount is higher than the carrying amount). None of the hypothetical cases above should lead to impairment of goodwill for the Norwegian business. Outstanding number of shares and instruments with potential dilutive effects At the end of 2014 JM had 75,471,471 outstanding shares (77,550,383). JM holds a total NOTE 11 MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT of 1,610,554 buy-back shares (2,263,299). At the beginning of September 2014, the Annual General Meeting resolution on the reduction in the share capital by 2,873,057 shares that the company held was taken into effect. 2014 2013 Instruments that may have a potentially dilutive effect include JM’s four convertible Accumulated cost programs (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014) and JM’s three warrant programs (2011, 2012 On January 1 70 80 and 2013).

Goodwill will be tested for impairment according to IAS 36. JM does this at least annually, or more often if there is any indication of a need for impairment. AS Projektfinans merged with JM Norge AS in 2003 and Öie AS merged with JM Norge AS in 2013. These operations are considered fully integrated in JM Norge AS. The JM Norway Group is therefore the lowest cash-generating unit. On December 31, 2014, the carrying amount of the JM Norway Group was assessed. The recoverable amount was found to exceed the carrying amount. Therefore no impairment loss for goodwill was necessary. The recoverable amount was determined by calculating the value in use of the cash-generating unit. Value in use for goodwill attributable to the JM Norway Group was calculated based on discounted cash flows. Cash flow for the first two years, after 2014, is based on the strategic plan adopted by the management. Cash flow beyond the strategic two-year period is extrapolated based on the following assumptions: • Estimated operating profit or loss based on the previous year’s results and expectations of future market developments • Growth rate of 2 percent (2) in order to extrapolate cash flow beyond the strategic period. The growth rate is a conservative assumption of the operation’s long-term growth, not exceeding growth for the industry as a whole • Discount rate before tax is 10 percent (11), which is based on the JM Group’s average cost of capital before tax, while taking operation-specific data into account.

The exposure is hedged in its entirety. The JM Group is exposed to different types of financial risks which may influence Because of extremely limited transaction volumes in foreign currency, the Group profit, cash flow and equity. These risks mainly comprise: has not engaged in hedging activities for these volumes. • Interest risks for borrowing and cash and cash equivalents • Financing and liquidity risks pertaining to the Group’s capital requirements Credit risk • Currency risks pertaining to profit and net investments in foreign subsidiaries Credit risk associated with financial operations • Credit risks attributable to financial and commercial activities. Credit risk exposure in the form of counterparty risk arises with investment of cash and cash equivalents and during derivative trading. In order to limit credit risks the Group JM’s Board of Directors has adopted a policy for how to handle and control these has prepared a counterparty list that sets a maximum exposure in relation to each risks within the Group.
