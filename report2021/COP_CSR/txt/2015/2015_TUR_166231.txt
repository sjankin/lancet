BILIM PHARMACEUTICALS INTERIM REPORT ON UNGC COP REPORT 17.08.2015 To our stakeholders: We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the UN Global Compact is the annual preparation and posting of a Communication on Progress (COP) that comprises of a CEO statement of continued support for the UN Global Compact, a description of practical actions with regard to the main issue areas of the UN Global Compact, and a measurement of outcomes or expected outcomes. We, as Bilim Pharmaceuticals, have signed the Global Compact on the 15th of April 2010 and we are the board member of UNGC Network Turkey since 2013. Along with our strong roots to sustainability, we have published four Corporate Responsibility Reports (CRReport'09, CRReport'10, CRReport'11, CRReport'12) on yearly basis. www.bilimilac.com In 2014, we have made changes on our strategic plan and sustainability processes. As a result of this we are going to publish 2013 & 2014 reports together on biennial basis for this year. We work on our next report (CRReport'13&14) and we have used the GRI methodology (G4) in line with GC COP. In the report, we transparently will share information concerning our performance, economic added value, people-oriented values and ecological sensitivity, as well as related targets like Human Rights, Anti-Corruption etc. Due to our new strategy we need an extension to deal with the process. We are planning to submit our report by the end of 2015. We want to align our internal reporting cycle with the COP deadline which may be adjusted to March 2016. Thanks four your understanding. Sincerely yours, Ms Kiraz Ã–cal Human Resources Specialist Bilim Pharmaceuticals
