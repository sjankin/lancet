Statement of the Board of Directors Statement of the Board of Directors regarding the annual report We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with approved accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the Group and the parent company’s consolidated assets, liabilities, financial position and results of operations. We also confirm that the Report of the Board of Directors provides a true and fair view of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the parent company together with a description of the key risks and uncertainties that the company is facing. March 26 2015 Auditor's report AUDITOR’S REPORT Report on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Posten Norge AS, comprising the financial statements for the Parent Company and the Group. The financial statements of the Parent Company and the Group comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014, the income statements, comprehensive income, cash flow statements and changes in equity for the year then ended as well as a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. The Board of Directors' and Group President and Chief Executive Officer's responsibility for the financial statements The Board of Directors and Group President and Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors and Group President and Chief Executive Officer determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements for the Parent Company and the Group. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements of Posten Norge AS have been prepared in accordance with laws and regulations and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Parent Company and the Group as at 31 December 2014 and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinion on the Board of Directors’ report and on the statements on corporate governance and corporate social responsibility Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Directors’ report and in the statements on corporate governance and corporate social responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption and the proposal for the allocation of the result is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations. Opinion on registration and documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, «Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information», it is our opinion that the Board of Directors and Group President and Chief Executive Officer have fulfilled their duty to ensure that the Company's accounting information is properly recorded and documented as required by law and generally accepted bookkeeping practice in Norway. Oslo, 26 March 2015 ERNST & YOUNG AS Eirik Tandrevold State Authorised Public Accountant (Norway) (This translation from Norwegian has been made for information purposes only.) Notes Accounting principles Posten Norge AS was established as a company on 01.12.1996 and is now a limited company with the Norwegian Government (represented by the Ministry of Transport) as the only shareholder. Posten Norge's address is Biskop Gunnerus gt. 14, 0001 Oslo. The consolidated financial statements and financial statements of Posten Norge AS have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), which have been determined by the International Accounting Standards Board and approved by the EU. The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for available-forsale financial assets and financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss that have been measured at fair value. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in chapter 3. The financial statements are presented in NOK, rounded to the nearest million, except when otherwise stated. As a result of rounding adjustments, the figures in one or more rows or columns included in the financial statements and notes may not add up to the total of that row or column. 1. Changes in accounting principles and disclosures and adjustment of prior period misstatement The accounting policies applied are consistent with previous years. In addition the Group implemented the following relevant, new and revised accounting standards and interpretations published by the IASB and approved by EU, with effective date 1 January 2014. 1.1 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements replaced the parts regarding consolidated financial statements in IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements and SIC-12 Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 identifies the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The Group has assessed which entities are to be consolidated under IFRS 10. The amendment has no significant impact on the Group financial statements. 1.2 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaced IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly Controlled Entities Non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers. There are two types of joint arrangements: joint operations and joint ventures. A joint operator accounts for its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Proportional consolidation of joint arrangements is no longer permitted. The amendment has no significant impact on the Group financial statements, see note 10. 1.3 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in Other Entities includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities and replaced the disclosure requirements previously set by IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements, IAS 28 Investments in Accociates and Joint Ventures and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures. The standard also introduced a number of new disclosure requirements. The amendments do not affect the financial position or profit or loss of the Group, but requires more extensive disclosures. 1.4 IAS 32 Financial Instruments – Presentation Amendments to IAS 32 Financial instruments Presentation clarifies that the right of set-off must not be contingent on a future event. It must also be legally enforceable for all counterparties in the normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy. The amendment also considers settlement mechanisms. The amendment has no significant impact on the Group financial statements. 1.5 IAS 36 Impairment of assets Amendments to IAS 36 Impairment of assets removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. The amendment has no significant impact on the Group financial statements. 1.6 IAS 39 Financial Instruments – Recognition and measurement Amendments to IAS 39 Financial instruments – Recognition and measurement on the novation of derivatives and the continuation of hedge accounting considers legislative changes to ‘over-thecounter’ derivatives and the establishment of central counterparties. Under IAS 39 novation of derivatives to central counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified criteria. The amendment has no significant impact on the Group financial statements. 1.7 Adjustment of prior period missatements A prior period misstatement is corrected by retrospective restatement. The annual review of the Group’s pension plans and related pension liabilities resulted in a change to the 2013 calculations. This affects the 2013 balance sheet of both the parent company and the Group by MNOK 43 (reduced liability). In addition, a misstatement in the parent company’s salaries and personnel expenses has necessitated an adjustment to the line “Payroll expenses” in 2013 of MNOK 42 (increased expenses). 2. Approved standards that are not yet effective or lacked approval by the EU The following standards and statements that are relevant to Norway Post have been issued but have yet to take effect or lack approval by the EU for the financial year 2014. 2.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 retains, but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) and fair value through profit and loss. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income (OCI) not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required, but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact. 2.2 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts and related interpretations. The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 15’s full impact. 2.3 IFRIC 21 Levies IFRIC 21 Levies sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions. The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognised. The interpretation does not significantly change time of recognition of levies for the Group. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. 3. Accounting estimates The preparation of the Group’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Sources of estimation uncertainty and assumptions concerning the future that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below: 3.1 Impairment of assets Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Calculations of recoverable amount require the use of estimates. There is uncertainty related to assumptions and parameters in connection with the estimation of future cash flows when evaluating write-down amounts and the choice of discount rate when calculating the present value of the cash flows. These estimates are most relevant when assessing goodwill and other intangible assets. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 8. 3.2 Defined benefit plans (pension benefits) There is also uncertainty related to the estimation of pension obligations, and uncertainty especially related to defined benefit plans for Posten Norge AS and Norwegian subsidiaries. The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net expenses (income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. Additional information is disclosed in note 3. 3.3 Provisions In determining the fair value of provisions for restructuring expenses and other provisions, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected settlement value and settlement date. Additional information is disclosed in note 15. 3.4 Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Additional information is disclosed in note 7. 4. Foreign currency translation 4.1 Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ( the functional currency ). The Group’s presentation currency is Norwegian kroner, which is also the parent company’s functional currency. 4.2 Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. On the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate applicable on the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement and translation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. 4.3 Group companies For consolidation purposes, balance sheet figures for subsidiaries that use a different functional currency than the Group’s presentation currency are translated at the rate applicable on the balance-sheet date and subsidiaries’ income statements are translated at the average exchange rate for each month. Resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and specified separately in equity (see note 14). If a foreign subsidiary is sold, the accumulated translation differences related to the subsidiary are recognised in the income statement. 5. Consolidation principles The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company, Posten Norge AS, and the companies over which Posten Norge AS has a control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting principles for similar transactions and other events provided the circumstances are otherwise the same. Items in the income statement and balance sheet have been classified according to uniform definitions. All significant intercompany transactions and balances, including internal profits and unrealised gains and losses, have been eliminated. 5.1. Consolidation principles: Subsidiaries Companies in which the Group has control (subsidiaries) are fully consolidated line by line in the consolidated financial statements. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred is measured to fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is classified as goodwill in the balance sheet. Should negative goodwill arise from the transfer of operations, the identification and measurement of identifiable assets and liabilities is reassessed. Any negative goodwill that arises following this reassessment is recognised in the income statement immediately. When agreements for additional consideration (contingent consideration) are entered into when companies are acquired, the amount of additional consideration is measured at fair value and included in the acquisition costs at the time of acquisition. The change in value of the additional consideration is only recognised as goodwill if the change is within a 12 month window and is a result of new or changed facts and circumstances that existed at the time of acquisition. Other changes in value of the additional consideration are recognised in the income statement. Adjustments are assessed at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date or alternatively at the rate when determined if this differ from the balance sheet date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquire on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The proportion of equity related to non-controlling interests is shown in a separate line in the Group’s equity. The proportion of net income after taxes and total comprehensive income from non-controlling interests is shown in the income statement. Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. In the event of loss of control and thus the deconsolidation of the subsidiary, gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Any retained investment is measured at fair value at the time of the transaction. 5.2. Consolidation principles: Associates and joint-ventures Associated company is defined as a company in which the Group has a significant influence. A significant influence normally exists when the Group owns 20 to 50 % of the voting capital. A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is adjusted to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s share of the result is classified as an operating item. 5.3. Held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale when they have been designated for sale, are expected to be sold within a period of twelve months and an active sales process has begun. If the Group has committed to a plan for sale which entails the loss of control over a subsidiary, all assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are classified as held for sale regardless of whether or not the company will maintain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary following the sale. Assets which meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Such assets are no longer amortised. Assets which meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale are presented separately in the balance sheet and the results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income. 6. Segment reporting Reporting segments are aggregated from underlying operating segments on the basis of an assessment of the risks and yields relating to the types of products or services, production processes, customer groups, distribution channels and statutory or other requirements, as well as management reporting. The division of reporting segments has been prepared in accordance with areas whose operating results are reviewed regularly by Norway Post's board so that the board can make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. The Group defines the Norway Post Board as the chief operating decision maker. The segments’ accounting principles are the same as those used to prepare and present the consolidated financial statements. 7. Revenues Revenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities, as described below. Sales revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received net of value added tax and discounts. In all segments revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised on the date when the products or services are delivered to the customer, and when significant risks have been transferred to the customer. 7.1. Revenues: Mail Segment The segment's revenues are generated from the sale of letter products, postage stamps, banking services, product sales and dialogue services. The sale of stamps is considered advance payment for the sale of postal services, and recognised when the service delivery occurs Franking machines (pre-paid franking) are recognised on the basis of the customer's postage consumption Other postage sales are billed and recognised when letter products are delivered Fees for banking services are recognised on the basis of performed banking services International mail within ordinary terminal charge agreements is recognised based on the calculation of volumes and current prices, and adjusted the following year when final prices are received from the International Post Cooperation Dialogue services, including precise target groups, addresses, outsourcing services within sales, customer service and customer-oriented marketing, are recognised at the time the service is delivered and significant risks are transferred to the customer Sales of goods are recognised when the goods are delivered and significant risks are transferred to the customer According to Norway Post's license, additional expenses incurred as a result of the licensing requirements are covered by exclusive rights and/or profits and/or government purchases of commercially unprofitable services. Government payments for unprofitable operations are recognised when the allocated funds are received, limited to an amount equal to this year's estimated additional expenses regarding licensing requirements net of income from exclusive rights/profits. 7.2. Revenues: Logistics Segment The segment's revenues are generated by transportation and warehouse services: Transport services cover courier and express services and the transportation of letters, packages, goods and temperaturecontrolled deliveries and are recognised at the time the service is delivered and significant risks are transferred to the customer Warehouse services cover storage, handling and picking-up services in addition to the unloading of vehicles, sealing of pallets, installation/repair of equipment and construction of sales pallets, and are recognised at the time the service is delivered and significant risks are transferred to the customer. 8. Pensions The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. The net pension expenses for the defined benefit pension plans comprise the pension contributions during the period, including future salary increases and the interest expense on the estimated pension liability, less the contributions from employees and estimated yield on the pension assets. The premium for the defined contribution pension plans is recognised as expenses when incurred. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. When pension assets exceed pension liabilities, prepaid pensions are classified as a long-term asset in the balance sheet if it is likely that the excess value can be utilised or repaid. The recognition of pension funds is limited to the present value of all financial benefits that materialise in terms of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. The net pension expenses are classified as payroll expenses in the income statement except for the interest element, which is classified as financial income/financial expenses. Past-service costs resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment are recognised immediately in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) in the period they occur, and will not be recycled through profit and loss in future periods. Effects of settlement of a former pension plan when changing to a new pension plan is presented on a separate line in the income statement. If the transitions are due to an amendment to the law the effect is measured at the time of the adoption of the amended law. 9. Tax expense Tax expense comprises tax payable for the period and changes in deferred tax liabilities/assets. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Taxes payable are calculated on the basis of taxable income. The net deferred tax liability/asset is computed on the basis of temporary differences between carrying amount and tax values og assets and liabilities and tax losses carried forward at the end of the financial year, with the exception of: deferred tax liabilities arising from initial recognition of tax non-depreciable goodwill temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when Group management itself decides when the temporary differences will be reversed, and it is probable that this will not take place in the foreseeable future. Taxable and deductible temporary differences that are reversed or can be reversed are offset against each other. Taxes are not offset across national borders. A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is probable that the company will have sufficient taxable profits to utilise the tax asset. Deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets that can be capitalised are recognised at their nominal value and netted in the balance sheet. If previous year’s tax return is announced changed by the authorities, the expenses will be recognised in this year’s taxes. 10. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recognised in the balance sheet at their acquisition cost net of accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The acquisition cost of fixed assets includes costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or installation of the items. For larger investments involving a long manufacturing period, interest is capitalised as a part of the acquisition cost. The acquisition cost of fixed assets is separated when the fixed asset consists of components that have different useful economic lives. Costs relating to normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expenses when incurred. Costs relating to replacements and renewals which significantly increase the useful economic life of the fixed assets are recognised in the balance sheet. Land is not depreciated. Tangible fixed assets are depreciated linearly to allocate their costs to their residual values over their estimated useful economic life. Depreciation starts from the date when the tangible fixed asset is available for its intended use. The assets residual values, if any, depreciation method and useful lives are reviewed at least annually. 11. Intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised in the balance sheet if probable future economic benefits can be proven and attributed to the asset and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are recognised in the balance sheet at their acquisition cost net of any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Acquisition costs also include salary expenses if the recognition criteria are met. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but assessed for impairment annually. Refer to the more detailed description under “Impairments”. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised ilinearly over their estimated useful economic life. Amortisation starts from the date when the intangible asset is available for its intended use. Intangible assets not yet available for use are also tested for impairment. 11.1. Intangible assets: Development costs The Group’s development costs mainly relate to the development of IT systems intended for internal use. Development costs are recognised in the balance sheet if all of the following criteria are met: the product or process is clearly defined and cost elements can be identified and measured reliably the product’s technical solution has been demonstrated the product or process will be sold or used in the business the asset will generate future economic benefits adequate technical, financial and other resources are available for completing the project Once all the criteria are met, the expenses relating to development work will be recognised in the balance sheet. Otherwise, the costs will be expensed as incurred. 11.2. Intangible assets: Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value at the date of an acquisition. For investments in associates and joint ventures goodwill is included in the acquisition cost of the investment. 12. Shares in subsidiaries and associates Posten Norge AS’s annual financial statements apply the cost method to shares in subsidiaries and associates. 13. Financial instruments Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the settlement date, normally to the transaction price. Financial assets are categorised as fair value through profit or loss, available for sale or loans/receivables. Financial liabilities are categorised as fair value through profit or loss or other liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities that are held with the intention of profiting on short-term fluctuations in price (held for trading purposes) or which are recognised according to the fair value option are classified as fair value through profit or loss All other financial assets, except from loans and receivables originally issued by the company subsequently measured at amortised cost, are classified as available for sale All other financial liabilities are classified as other liabilities and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of financial investments classified as available for sale are recognised in other comprehensive income until the investment is derecognised. The accumulated gain or loss on the financial instrument that was previously recognised in other comprehensive income will then be reversed and the gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of financial instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss (held for trading purposes or fair value option) are recognised and presented as financial income/expenses. Financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the instrument's contractual terms. Financial instruments are derecognised when the contractual rights or obligations have been fulfilled, cancelled, expired or transferred. Financial instruments are classified as non-current assets or liabilities when their expected realisation date is more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Other financial instruments are classified as current assets or liabilities. 13.1. Financial instruments: Hedging Before a hedging transaction is carried out, an assessment is made as to whether the derivative is to be used to a) hedge the fair value of an asset or liability, b) hedge future cash flows associated with an asset, liability or a future transaction, or c) hedge a net investment in a foreign entity. The Group’s criteria for classifying a derivative as a hedging instrument are as follows: (1) the hedge is expected to be very effective in that it offsets changes in the fair value of or cash flows from an identified asset or liability, and hedge effectiveness is expected to be within a range of 80125%, (2) the effectiveness of the hedge can be measured reliably, (3) there is adequate documentation at the time when the hedge is entered into showing that the hedge is highly effective, (4) for cash flow hedges, the future transaction must be very likely, (5) the hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and has been determined to be highly effective during the reporting periods for which the hedge was designated. The hedge is no longer recognised when: (a) the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or (b) the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting as described above 13.1.1. Hedging: Fair value Derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. Changes in fair value of the hedged item are similarly recognised in the income statement. 13.1.2. Hedging: Cash flows The effective portion of changes in fair value of a hedging instrument in a qualifying cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the hedge instrument is recognised directly in the income statement. If the hedged cash flow results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and recognised with the asset or liability. Gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are, for other cash flow hedges, reclassified to the income statement in the same period as the cash flow that comprises the hedged item is recognised. When a hedging instrument ceases to be highly effective, hedge accounting is prospectively discontinued. In this case, the accumulated gain or loss on a hedging instrument in equity will not be reversed until the hedged transaction actually occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, previously accumulated gains or losses on the hedging instrument in equity will be reversed and recognised in the income statement. 13.1.3. Hedging: Net investment in a foreign entity Posten Norge AS uses currency futures to hedge its net investments in foreign entities. Changes in currency futures that are designated as hedging instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income together with translation differences related to the investment until any sale of the investment, following which the accumulated translation differences are recognised in the income statement. The ineffective portion of the hedge instrument is recognised directly in the income statement. 13.2. Financial instruments: Derivatives that are not hedging instruments Derivatives that are not classified as hedging instruments are classified as held for trading purposes and assessed at fair value. Changes in fair value of such derivatives are recognised in the income statement. A derivative that is embedded into other contracts will be separated from the original contract and recognised as a derivative if the following conditions are met: The underlying economic reality and risk of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic reality and risk of the original contract A separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative The combined instrument (main contract and embedded derivative) is not measured at fair value with changes in value recognised in the income statement. 13.3. Impairments: Financial instruments The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Impairment losses of a financial asset or a group of financial assets are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a loss event ), and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows that can be reliably estimated. Impairment losses of financial assets carried at amortised cost are recognised in the income statement. A reversal of a prior impairment loss is recognised if the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised. However, the reversal is only recognised to the extent that it does not exceed amortised cost that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised. For financial assets classified as available for sale, accumulated gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the income statement for the period when there is objective information of impairment. A reversal of a prior impairment loss is recognised when there is new objective information related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. The reversal of a prior impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income for investments classified as available for sale, and is recognised in the income statement for other financial assets. 14. Impairments An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a valuation unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less sales costs and value in use, where value in use is the present value of estimated cash flows relating to future use. If cash flows relating to an individual asset are independent of cash flows relating to other assets, the individual asset comprises a valuation unit. If not, a valuation unit is identified at a higher level and called a cash-generating unit. A cash-generating unit shall be consistently applied over time. The Group calculates future cash flows based on estimated results (forecasts and long-term plans) over a period of three years, adjusted for depreciation, investments and changes in working capital. The extrapolation period contains an extrapolation of the cash flows after the forecast period, using a constant growth rate. The present value of future cash flows is calculated using weighted average cost of capital and is a pre-tax rate. With the exception of goodwill, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are reversed if there is information that an impairment loss no longer exist or has decreased. However, an impairment loss is not reversed to the extent the reversal exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised. 14.1. Impairments: Goodwill and other assets with indefinite useful life Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful life and intangible assets in development are subject to an impairment test annually, irrespective of whether or not there are any indications of impairment. 14.2. Impairments: Other assets with finite useful lives Assessment of impairment losses of other assets with finite useful lives is considered when there are indications that an impairment loss may have occurred. 15. Inventories Inventories are recognised at the lower of cost and net sales price. The net sales price is determined as the market price in the case of normal operations less the costs of sale, marketing and distribution. Cost price is determined using the FIFO method. Obsolescent inventories are written down to their estimated sales values. 16. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provisions for impairment. Should there be any objective evidence of impairment, the difference between the recognised value and the present value of future cash flows is recorded as a loss. 17. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and bank deposits. Cash and cash equivalents are short-term liquid investments that can be converted into a known amount in cash within three months and which are subject to insignificant risk. 18. Equity In accordance with IAS 1 Norway Post has chosen to present other comprehensive income and changes in equity as separate statements, and in note 14. 18.1. Equity: Translation differences Translation differences arise in connection with currency differences when foreign entities’ accounts are being consolidated. Currency differences relating to monetary items (debts or receivables where settlements are neither planned nor likely to occur within a short period of time) which in reality are part of a company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary are treated as translation differences. Should a foreign subsidiary be sold, the accumulated translation difference related to the subsidiary is reversed and recognised in the income statement in the same period as the gain or loss of the sale is recognised. 18.2. Equity: Hedging reserves Hedging reserves includes the total net change in fair value of the hedging instrument in cash-flow hedges until the hedged cash flow occur or is no longer expected to occur. 18.3. Equity: Costs relating to equity transactions Transaction costs related to an equity transaction are recognised directly in equity net of taxes. Other transaction costs are recognised in the income statement. 19. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable (more probable than not) that there will be a financial settlement as a result of the liability and the amount can be measured reliably. Provisions are reviewed on each balance sheet date and their level reflects the best estimate of the liability. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the liability is recognised at present value of future cash flows. 19.1. Provisions: Restructuring Restructuring expenses are costs incurred by the company based on a decision that entails a significant change in the company's defined business areas, either in terms of the scope of the activities, or in how the company is operated. Provisions set aside for restructuring are expensed when the programme is decided on and announced and the costs are identifiable, quantifiable and not covered by corresponding revenues. The restructuring expenses include costs relating to both personnel measures and vacated premises. 19.2. Provisions: Onerous contracts Expenses related to onerous contracts concern contracts where the costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received over the contract period. 20. Leasing Leases are classified as either operational leases or financial leases, based on a review of the substance of each individual lease. A financial lease is an agreement which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of the underlying asset to the Group. The Group presents financial leases in the financial statements as assets and liabilities, equal to the cost price of the asset or, if lower, the present value of cash flows due in the lease. When calculating the present value of the lease, the interest rate implicit in the lease is used when this can be determined. Alternatively, the company's incremental borrowing rate is used. The asset is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. Monthly lease payments are divided into an interest element and a repayment element. In the case of operational leases, lease payments are classified as an operating expense and recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease. 21. Loans Loans are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. The loans are then recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortised cost is the amount the financial obligation is measured to at initial recognition, less repayments (for example principal payment, interest and service charges), including effective interest. 22. Contingent liabilities and assets Contingent liabilities include: possible liabilities resulting from past events whose existence depends on future events liabilities that have not been recognised because it is not probable that they will result in payments liabilities that cannot be measured with sufficient reliability Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the annual financial statements unless they have been acquired in a business acquisition. Significant contingent liabilities are disclosed, unless the possibility of the liability resulting in payments is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised in the annual financial statements, but disclosed if an inflow of economic benefits is probable. 23. Events occurring after the balance sheet date New information of the company’s positions on the balance sheet date is taken into account in the annual financial statements. Events taking place after the balance sheet date that do not affect the company’s position on the balance sheet date but which will affect the company’s position in the future, are disclosed if significant. 24. Cash flow statement Cash flow statement has been prepared on the basis of the indirect method. Cash and cash equivalents consist of liquid assets, including liquid assets linked to the sales network. Note 1 Segments The division of reporting segments has been prepared in accordance with areas whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Posten Norge AS board so that the board can decide which resources will be allocated to the segment and assess its earnings. Revenues, assets and investments are also reported on a geographical basis, split between Norway and abroad depending on where the revenue is generated/localised. Internal revenues are turnover between segments in the Group. Transactions with other segments are based on normal commercial terms and conditions as if the segments were independent parties. Deferred tax asset is not included in allocated assets, and deferred tax and interestbearing liabilities are not included in allocated liabilities. The reporting segments contain the following: Mail: letter products, banking services and dialogue services. The segment consists of the Mail Division including its subsidiaries Bring Citymail, Bring Mail and Bring Dialog. Logistics: bulk and part load, parcels, warehousing, thermo and express. The segment corresponds to the parent company’s Logistics Norway and Logistics Norden divisions and the subsidiaries operating in these areas: Bring Cargo, Bring Linehaul, Bring Warehousing, Bring Frigo, Bring Express, Bring Parcels, Bring Cargo International and Bring Supply Services. Other: Group administration and overheads that are defined as owner-related expenses and eliminations are allocated to segment Other. It was in 2014 conducted a new review of the Group's common expenses and allocation to the segments. This has led to changes in the presentation of segment results. The figures for 2012 and 2013 have been restated accordingly. Restating meant reduced operating expenses in the segment Mail (MNOK 50 in 2013, MNOK 159 in 2012) and segment Logistics (MNOK 28 in 2013, MNOK 105 in 2012) and a corresponding increase in operating expenses in the segment Other (MNOK 78 in 2013, MNOK 264 in 2012).

Bonus programmes Posten Norge AS has a bonus programme for the CEO and Group management. The scheme has two parts, one element based on the consolidated Group results and one on individual results. A bonus of up to 25% of salary can be achieved. The final decision regarding a bonus is determined by the board (the CEO for Group management). Bonuses are only paid to persons who are in their positions as at 31 December. In addition, Posten Norge AS has bonus programmes for divisional management, regional management, other key personnel and sales staff. Bonus payments are based on defined Group and individual targets. Specific upper limits for bonus payments are defined in the different schemes. The majority of the Group’s subsidiaries have bonus programmes for executives connected to achieving results and/or individual criteria. In certain companies, sales personnel, and other key personnel also have bonus-based pay, while others pay a productivity bonus to all employees. Pension schemes Senior management has the same pension schemes as other employees of the company with the following exceptions. Senior managers who entered the Group management before 31.12.2006 have a defined benefit pension scheme of 66%, where retirement age is 65 for the CEO and 64 years for other executives. This scheme was closed at 31.12.2006. New members of the Group management after 31.12.2006 have a defined contribution scheme with annual contributions limited to 25 % of the salary that exceeds the pensionable income exceeding 12G in Norway and 20 IBB in Sweden (IBB= income basis amount ). Severance For the CEO there is an agreement to reduce severance pay against other income after 3 months. For members of the Group management who have a severance agreement there is an agreement of reduction against other income. Statement on salaries and other remuneration to senior executives in Posten Norge AS (Adopted by the Board 26.02.2015 ) This statement is based on Guidelines for the employment conditions of managers in state enterprises and companies (established by the Stoltenberg Government 31.03.2011) and is prepared by the Board in accordance with the Articles of Association § 8, last paragraph. ref. The Act § 6-16a. Refer to Guidelines for remuneration to senior executives in corporations and SOEs (established by Industry and Fisheries Ministry with effect from 02/13/2015). Based on these, the records during 2015 to assess the company arrangements for remuneration to senior executives. Any changes will be seen next year remuneration declaration. The declaration will be reviewed in Norway Post's annual general meeting. The declaration applies until either the board repeals it or adopts a new declaration. The declaration applies to the CEO and executive vice presidents reporting to the CEO (Group management). This group is known as senior management . Declaration has two main parts. Part I deals with executive remuneration policy that has been followed in the preceding financial year ref. Public Limited Companies Act § 6-16 a, first, third and fourth paragraphs. Part II contains guidelines for determining management salaries for the upcoming fiscal year ref. Public Limited Companies Act § 6-16 a, second paragraph. Guidelines in Part II applies fully when new contracts in the coming financial year, and shall otherwise be applied followed as far as possible within the framework of the agreements concluded earlier. Part I The fees in 2014 have been in accordance with Statement of salaries and other remuneration to senior executives in Posten Norge AS, adopted on 13 February 2014 (last year's statement). Some agreements concluded before 31.3.2011 differs from last year's statement about severance pay, and agreements with senior employees who were employed in the Group before 31.3.2011 differs from last year's statement about retirement. For a complete overview of the premiums in 2014, see note 2 and 3 of the financial statements for 2014. The Board has in 2014 not set any long-term incentive scheme for senior management, as last year's declaration allows. It is concluded one agreement on severance pay, and one of employment with a new Executive Director in 2014. These agreements are consistent with last year's statement. The agreements will have no significance for the company or the shareholder. Part II 1. The main principles for executive remuneration policy The total remuneration, which in the following is referred to as executive pay in Norway Post, is to be competitive but not leading compared with similar companies. The Board shall have an overview of the total value of the compensation for each executive. 2. Elements of executive pay 2.1 Base salary The main element of executive pay will be the fixed salary. The objective of Norway Post is to have competitive salaries without being a salary leader for the same type of positions. To support the ongoing reviews of wages, market information about executive compensation shall be collected annually from a recognized international company with satisfactory statistics from Norway. 2.2 Variable pay Individual agreements on variable pay can be entered into with senior management based on performance, with an economic framework of up to six months wages. A system of variable pay (bonus) must be transparent and clearly understandable. The individual goals are set for one year and should always be described and based on objective, definable and measurable criteria that the manager can actually affect. The basis for calculating the bonus should consist of both common Group goals and individual goals for each manager. The objectives should be linked to the results achieved within the following main categories: finance / financial goals, HSE (Health, Safety and Environment), the environment, customers, strategy, and the individual's professional responsibility. Category accounting / financial targets are calculated after achievement of established budget, and can be both a common Group goals and individual goals for each manager. Bonus target should always include at least one HSE targets. The corporate goals of between 60 and 100% of the bonus potential, while the individual targets of between 0 and 40% of the bonus potential.

Net pension expenses for defined benefit plans include the net pension benefits for the period, including future wage growth and interest expenses on the calculated obligation, less contributions from employees and the expected return on pension assets. For defined contribution plans, premium expensed are recognised as incurred. On 01.01.2011 the parent company and most of its subsidiaries transferred to a new AFP plan (Joint plan for AFP in the private sector). The new AFP plan is a multiple company plan which is considered a defined benefit plan. However, there is currently insufficient information to measure the pension obligation in a reliable manner so the plan is treated as a defined contribution plan for accounting purposes. Employees who remain members of the Norwegian Public Service Fund have kept their rights in accordance with the AFP plan in the public sector. Posten Norge AS's defined benefit obligations are in accordance with the law on defined pension plans, and the pension funds in the plans are managed by life insurance companies. Posten Norge AS’s defined benefit pension plan was closed 31.12.2005, with the exception of plans for senior executives which were closed 31.12.2006. In 2014, changes were made to the financial assumptions in accordance with recommendations from the Norwegian Accounting Standards Board (NRS). In their Guidance for determining assumptions for pension calculations for defined benefit plans (January 2015), whereby the discount rate has been set at 2.3% compared with 4.0% in 2013. Posten Norge AS uses covered bonds (OMF) as its basis for the discount rate. A reduction in the discount rate of 1 percentage point is estimated to give an average increase in the pension liability of approximately 15%. In Posten Norge AS, the effect of this year's reduction in the discount rate was largely offset by the changes in assumptions for retirement age and probability of taking early retirement. A new mortality rate table (K2013) has been used when estimating the liability as of 31.12.2013. For Posten Norge AS the change in the table increased the actuarial loss that was recognised in other comprehensive income in by MNOK 50, which constituted 76% of net actuarial loss in 2013. For the Group there was an estimated decrease in equity of MNOK 54 as a result of using the changed mortality rate table. The parent company and some subsidiaries have defined pension plans, agreed upon with the employee organisations in connection with the transition to a new pension plan to replace the Norwegian Public Service Fund plan. Except for adjustments for country-specific macroeconomic conditions, the subsidiaries have mainly used the same long-term financial assumptions as the parent company. The Group's pension assets mainly relate to Bring Cargo's defined benefit pension plans. The retirement age for Norwegian employees in general is 67 years. The Group has a defined contribution pension plan for the majority of employees in Norway, Sweden and Denmark where the premiums are expensed as they occur. In the parent company contribution rates for 2012, 2013 and first half-year 2014 were 5.0% for salaries between 1 6 G (National Insurance basic amount) and 8% for salaries between 6 12 G. From 01.07.2014 the contribution rates changed to 5% for salaries between 0 to 7,1 G and 13% for salaries in the range 7 12 G. Employees contribute to the pension scheme though salary deductions. A private disability pension has been introduced which provides benefits equal to 66% of the employee's pay without paid-up policy accrual. Posten Norge AS also has obligations connected to employees with salaries above 12 G. Pension obligations connected to salaries above 12 G and early retirement pensions are financed by the company's operations. The defined contribution pension plans in Sweden and Denmark have variable contribution rates based on different calculation bases and rate ranges. For example in Sweden the calculation basis for some employees is a so-called income basis amount (IBB) which was SEK 56 900 in 2014. Contributions were calculated with a low and high rate of 4.5% and 30% respectively for earnings lower or higher than 7.5 times IBB. Some companies in the Group's Swedish operations have pension plans which, according to IAS 19, do not qualify for recognition in the balance sheet. In accordance with Swedish rules the pension liabilities are covered through a capital insurance policy. In the company accounts the amount was registered as a liability with an equivalent receivable against the capital insurance company. In the consolidated financial statements, these amounts are netted, so that the criteria stipulated in IAS 19 are met. A secured occupational pension programme in a Norwegian company was set off against pension assets in accordance with IAS 19. This year’s review of the pension plans and related estimated obligations has resulted in a change in the calculated pension obligations for 2013. This affected the 2013 balance sheets of both the Group and the parent company by MNOK 43 (reduced obligation). Note 4 Other operating expenses Posten Norge AS Group 2012 2013 2014 2014 2013 2012 938 936 880 Cost of premises 1 165 1 247 1 222 293 295 264 Other rental expenses 372 399 410 93 95 92 Tools, fixtures, operating materials 124 130 126 68 70 72 Repair and maintenance of equipment 112 102 96 41 41 37 Accounting and payroll services 46 48 46 659 717 753 IT services 828 843 760 230 196 193 Other external services 382 361 395 40 36 36 Telephoneand postage expenses 176 92 89 77 81 79 Travel expenses 177 169 158 135 111 103 Marketing 123 134 157 22 37 34 Insurance, guarantee and compensation expenses 85 86 58 121 74 102 Other expenses 317 229 195 2 717 2 689 2 645 Totalt operating expenses 3 907 3 840 3 712 The reduction in costs of premises in the parent company from 2013 to 2014, are mainly due to lower costs as a result of the closure of post offices. The decrease in rental expenses over the same period mainly due to reduced rental costs for cars. Acquisitions of companies in 2014, and a restructuring of operations in Bring Citymail Sweden AB in 2014, has contributed to changes in the cost structure of the Group. This applies to the decline in cost of premises and increase in telephoneand postage expenses and other expenses from 2013 to 2014. From 2012 to 2013 the costs of premises increased due the acquisition of Bring Cargo Inrikes AB. The increase in IT services over the same period was mainly related to costs for IT development and for establishing a new model of governance for IT in the Group. Note 5 Other income and expenses Other income and expenses include restructuring expenses, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets and other material income and expenses that are non-recurring.

The program also includes a new route register which, together with the common address register, will provide more automated and detailed route planning. The total solution gives the Group an improved basis for managing and planning staffing levels and the distribution of mail and advertising in an efficient manner. In addition MNOK 31 related to a data warehouse for management of master data, master structures and transactions. A production system to support the tracking and tracing of parcels was recognised in the balance sheet and amounted to MNOK 25. As part of Norway Post's adaptation of services to new user needs a digital postal system, Digipost, has been developed which has about 500.000 users. The system is capitalised at MNOK 30 as of year-end. For intangible assets that have a finite useful economic life, the amortisation period for the Group was 3-10 years in 2014 (3-10 years in 2013 and 2012), depending on the useful economic life of each individual component based on an individual assessment. Intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are not amortised but are assessed for impairment annually. The amortisation for the year is presented in the income statement in the line for depreciation and amortisation. Projects in progress Projects in progress as of 31.12.2014 amounted to MNOK 228. Approximately MNOK 124 was related to a project for a IT platform for the Group. A development platform and new common client software for use in online terminals (PDA) was recognised in the balance sheet and amounted to MNOK 48. The Group has also recognised several projects for web related solutions for efficient handling and tracing of parcels and goods for home-delivery. Impairment of IT-development, trademarks etc. and projects in progress Impairment is presented in the income statement in the line for write-downs. There are ongoing assessments of whether there are indications of impairments of intangible assets with finite useful economic lives, and if such indications exist the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For intangible assets under development the values are tested annually, and if there are indications of impairment during the year, they are tested when these indications occurs. No impairment was recognised in 2014 for IT-development, trademarks etc. nor projects in progress (MNOK 123 in 2013 and MNOK 85 in 2012). Impairment recognised in 2013 and 2012 were mainly related to a system for the planning and managing of transport activities which will be replaced by other transportation systems in the future. Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units based on an assessment of cash flows related to the business or business group (operating segment) to which the goodwill pertains. If the cash flows are independent of cash flows related to other entities, the individual entity comprise the valuation unit, and if not, goodwill is allocated to a valuation unit at a higher level. Goodwill in the Group is summarised below.

Impairment of goodwill Impairment is presented on a separate line in the income statement as write-downs. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests. If there are any indications of impairment during the year, goodwill is tested when these indications occurs. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a valuation unit including goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less sales costs and value in use, where value in use is the present value of estimated cash flows relating to future use. The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The Group calculates future cash flows based on estimated results (forecasts and long-term plans) over a period of three years, adjusted for depreciation, investments and changes in working capital. Forecasts and long-term plans for group entities are based on the latest available general economic indicators and specific market expectations. Local management assess these expectations against strategic goals, historicaland other factors and deliver their forecasts to Group management. Group management then determines the final forecasts for group entities and the group as a whole. The mail segment is characterised by a decline in volume of letters, some increased price pressure and efficiency in production and distribution. Significant cost elements are wages and external service and operating expenses that are affected by price negotiations and inflation. In the Logistics segment profit margins are characterised by price pressure and globalisation. Significant cost elements are external service costs that are affected by price negotiations and inflation. The Group is sensitive to fluctuations in economic cycles in Norway and Nordic countries, especially related to the Logistics segment. This is reflected in the growth rates of the group entities. The extrapolation period contains a mechanical extrapolation of cash flows after the forecast period, using a constant growth rate. The growth rate per segment is stated in the table below. Growth rates equal to or lower than inflation in the country in which operations take place. The present value of future cash flows is calculated using weighted average cost of capital and is a pre-tax rate. The Group's required rate of return per segment is assessed each year for significant changes in factors that affect the requirement. The Group operates mainly in the Norwegian and Swedish markets with cash flows in Norwegian and Swedish Kroner. The required rate of return per segment is stated in the table below.

An impairment loss of MSEK 160 was recognised against goodwill related to Bring Cargo International following decline in volumes and loss of profitable customers. Goodwill related to Bring Cargo Inrikes of MSEK 93 was written down, mainly as a consequence of loss of customers, a weak price development, less profitable product mix and increased operating expenses. An impairment loss of MEUR 1 was also recognised against goodwill related to Bring Express Finland due to challenges regarding profitability during the past years. No additional impairment losses have been identified and recognised for other goodwill items as of 31.12.2014. Sensitivity in assumptions The sensitivity of key assumptions used in forecasts and management estimates has been analysed. Additional sensitivity analyses have been performed for those cash generating units where the difference between the carrying amount and value in use is low. Hence, key assumptions such as growth rate, required rate of return and margins have been analysed for Bring Frigo Sverige and Bring Cargo International.

This involves the construction of new production building for packages, procurement of equipment for packages and goods, as well as a new building and production facilities for Bring Frigo AS with related equipment. In addition a rebuilding of Postens Godssenter will be done, that will lead to an interconnection with the new packageand goods terminal at Alnabru. Total investment including land is estimated to MNOK 1 740. A contract has been signed with Vedal AS for the construction of the terminals at Alnabru. In total, the contract amounts to MNOK 722.

The Group had no significant credit risk relating to one individual contracting party, or to several contracting parties that could be regarded as one group due to similarities in credit risk. The Group has guidelines to ensure that sales are only made to customers that have not had any significant payment issues and that outstanding amounts do not exceed stipulated credit limits. There are no indications that customer receivables not yet due, or already provided for on the balance sheet date, cannot be collected.

In the categories property and other measures, there were no provisions in 2014 (property MNOK 15 in 2013, MNOK 85 in 2012, other measures MNOK 20 in 2012). Restructuring expenses in 2014 were primarily related to adjustments in the distribution services. In addition to Posten Norge AS, the Group provisions in 2014 totalled to MNOK 16, of which MNOK 9 for personnel related measures (MNOK 10 in 2013 and MNOK 5 in 2012), MNOK 4 in property (MNOK 4 in 2013), and MNOK 3 other measures (no provisions in 2013, and MNOK 1 in 2012). The accruals as of 31.12. were specified as follows: Posten Norge AS Group 2012 2013 2014 2014 2013 2012 241 179 100 Personnel related 109 185 244 95 64 17 Property 19 66 95 16 8 Other measures 1 16 352 251 117 Total restructuring 128 252 355 It is expected that payments of MNOK 78 will be done in 2015 and MNOK 50 in later years. The provision is discounted. Severance pay Severance pay is payable to employees of the Norwegian state who have been made redundant, and is payable for the period until they obtain new employment. For employees of Posten Norge AS the scheme applies to redundancies made up to and including 31.12.2004. In 2014, the amount disbursed was MNOK 9 and provisions totalled MNOK 19 as of 31.12.2014. The disbursements will take place up to the next 7 years and depends on to what extent those receiving severance pay obtain new permanent or temporary jobs. There is therefore some uncertainty regarding the size of the provision, which has been determined on the basis of experience of such payments from 2003-2014. The provision is discounted. Pensions Pensions are described in further detail in note 3. Other Other provisions in the Group as of 31.12.2014, related mainly to onerous contracts due to market regulation of rental prices of premises in Bring Frigo AB.

At the same time Posten Norge AS also had tree loan agreements with floating interest. These were two private placement loan agreements and a loan in Den Nordiske Investeringsbanken (renegotiated from fixed to floating interest in March 2014) amounting to MNOK 1 141 in total, with an effective interest rate of 2.7% and maturities from 2016 2023. In 2014 Posten Norge AS increased certificate loans with MNOK 550. As of 31.12.2014 certificate loans amounted to MNOK 1 500. Certificate loans are classified as current liabilities as the loans usually have three months duration and are revolved depending on the need for financing. The value of the long-term private placement loans and associated interest/currency swaps is the estimated market value of the instruments. Posten Norge AS has an obligation to pay a fixed interest rate in JPY on the loans and, through the swaps, receives a fixed interest rate in JPY and pays a floating interest rate (3 months NIBOR) in NOK. The market values are calculated by the fixed cash flows in JPY being discounted by the current JPY interest-rate level and converted into NOK at the current exchange rate (JPY/NOK). Posten Norge AS utilises the fair value option when recording these loans as the use of fair value of both debt and swap removes an inconsistency between the measurement of debt and swaps to insure the debt.

Until the milestones are reached, accruals are recognised for incurred not invoiced expenses. For the parent company debt to group companies included shareholder funding for Swedish subsidiaries. In Posten Norge AS other liabilities increased due to contracts that were reclassified from interest bearing to interest-free debt. In the Group however, other liabilities were reduced in 2014 due to settlement of a large purchase contract by Posten Eiendom Alnabru Utvikling AS from 2013.

Fair value through profit or loss financial obligations Posten Norge AS has made use of the opportunity to utilise the “fair value option” (FVO) in IAS 39 for some loans with associated derivatives. Posten Norge AS had three loans classified as fair value through profit or loss according to the fair value option as of 31.12.2014. In 2004 Posten Norge AS entered into a long-term loan agreement with a Japanese life insurance company for JPY 5.0 billion. In 2008 and 2013 Posten Norge AS entered into new loan agreements for JPY 3.0 billion and JPY 5,0 billion respectively. The value of these loans in NOK at the time of entering the agreements were MNOK 330, MNOK 148 and MNOK 299 respectively. These loans have fixed interest rates, thus their value in NOK depends on exchange rate developments and changes to the Japanese and Norwegian long-term interest rate levels. At the same time these loan agreements were entered into, combined currency and interest-rate swap agreements were also entered into which, combined with the loans, effectively provided loans in NOK with the interest rates set every third month. Posten Norge AS has also entered into an interest rate swap related to the loan for JPY 3,0 billion, which reclassfies the loan to a fixed interest rate loan. The interest rate swap has the same due date as the loan, but for accounting purposes it is not classified as a hedge transaction. Upon entering into the loan agreement for JPY 5.0 billion in 2013, Posten Norge AS also entered into a combined currency and interest-rate swap agreement with a corresponding CSA (Credit Support Annex) agreement. This agreement defines how two swap counterparties shall react when the value of a swap changes in favour of one of the parties during the swap period. A deposit is to be paid or received between the counterparties in order to reduce the credit risk in the event of large differences in the swap value. Each month the value of the swap is measured and if the value in one party's favor is greater than MEUR 2 the excess amount is paid into the counterparty's account. The minimum amount for this payment is defined as MEUR 0,5. A CSA ageement minimizes the risk of large values accumulating in one party's favor during the course of the swap period and can therefore be seen as an agreement for collateral. As of 31.12.2014, the loans from the Japanese life insurance companies were recognised at a total value of MNOK 851 (MNOK 790 as of 31.12.2013 and MNOK 982 as of 31.12.2012) and the interest-rate and currency swap agreements were recognised at MNOK 75 (MNOK 13 as of 31.12.2013 and MNOK 104 as of 31.12.2012). One loan entered into with a Japanese life insurance company in 2003 for JPY 6.4 billion was repaid in 2013. Changes in interest rates or exchange rates that lead to changes in the value of the JPY loans measured in NOK are counteracted by changes in the value of the combined currency and interest rate swaps. Norway Post's credit risk is considered virtually unchanged during the year. The credit risk for the swap counterparty and the credit loan counterparty is considered approximately equal. 2.

See point 4 below. 3) Forward exchange contracts for hedging expenses and revenues in euro. 4) Forward exchange contracts for hedging loans given to foreign subsidiaries Cash flow hedges Interest-rate hedges– non-current loans The Group had 31.12.2014 one loan in Nordiske Investeringsbanken (Nordic Investment Bank) of MNOK 600 on which the interest is determined every six months. In order to ensure fixed interestrate conditions, interest-rate swaps for corresponding amounts were entered into so that the Group paid a fixed net interest rate on the hedged loan. The interest rate swap was due in March 2014, while the loan will be repaid with MNOK 100 each year until 2020. From March 2014 the loan reverted to a floating interest rate loan. In 2014 MNOK 3 was taken through the income statement (MNOK 19 in 2013 and MNOK 13 in 2012). Currency hedges – euro revenues Posten Norge AS had revenues of approximately MEUR 33 for distributing post from abroad in 2014 (MEUR 34 in 2013 and MEUR 32 in 2012) and expects revenues of approximately MEUR 30 in 2015. Some of the exchange-rate risk is hedged by selling forward exchange contracts in euro. The change in value of forward exchange contracts that are effective hedging instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cash flows in the form of earned euro revenues are charged to the income statement each month. As of 31.12.2014 Posten Norge AS had forward exchange contracts for euro revenues in 2015 totalling MEUR 30 and for euro revenues in 2016 totalling MEUR 10, with a value of MNOK -23 and MNOK -7 respectively. In 2014 MNOK 17 was transfered from equity to operating revenues as a decrease in income (MNOK 13 in 2013 and MNOK 0 as a reduction in income in 2012) due to realised euro revenues. Currency hedging air freight In 2013 Posten Norge AS had costs of 21 million US dollars and MEUR 2 in connection with air freight of mail. A part of the currency risk was hedged by selling US dollar and euro forwards. The hedging was stopped in its entirety in August 2013. In 2013, approximately MNOK 2 (MNOK 2 in 2012) was recognised in the income statement as Cost of goods and services. Bond Loans Posten Norge AS refinanced bond loans in 2011 equivalent to MNOK 1 500 with a smaller loan equivalent to MNOK 500 with floating conditions and a maturity in 2016. Posten Norge AS entered into an interest rate swap from floating to fixed rate so that the entire loan was on fixed terms. Changes in the value of the interest rate swap will be recognized in the balance sheet until maturity of the loan in 2016. As at 31.12.2014 the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps was MNOK -13 (MNOK -17 as at 31.12.2013 and MNOK -23 as at 31.12.2012). 3. Hedges of investments in foreign entities Posten Norge AS has used forward exchange contracts in Swedish kroner (SEK) to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries. Posten Norge AS has entered into a total of MSEK 1 927 in revolving forward exchange contracts in 2014 (MSEK 1 927 in 2013 and MSEK 1 527 in 2012). The changes in the value of the contracts are offset in the Group against the translation differences from the investments recognised in equity until the investments are sold. Should the hedges be ineffective, the change in value is recognised in the income statement. 4. Hedges of loans to foreign subsidiaries Posten Norge AS has used forward exchange contracts in Swedish kroner (SEK) to hedge loans given to foreign subsidiaries. Posten Norge AS has entered into a total of MSEK 518 and MEUR 10 in revolving forward exchange contracts in 2014 (0 in 2013 and 0 in 2012). Changes in the value of the forward exchange contracts are recognized in the income statement and will have the oposite effect of the currency differences in connection with the loans. 5.

Note 19 Financial risk Risk management in Norway Post In general the basis of Norway Post's financial risk management is that the individual manager in the Group must have sufficient knowledge about all substantial financial risk within the manager's area of responsibility. Through defined processes, the handling of financial risks shall be reported in order to ensure that the responsibilities the Board of Directors and Management have in accordance with existing legislation and principles for good corporate governance are fulfilled. Every year a risk analysis assessment is completed to evaluate the Group's total risk. The analysis highlights corporate areas of risk and the measures that have been implemented in order to manage and control these risks. Accountability: All managers are responsible within their area of responsibility and shall have complete insight and understanding of the risk picture at all times. Risk reporting: The risk reporting in the Group shall ensure that all managers have necessary information about the level of risk and risk development. The Board receives an annual risk analysis assessment in the second quarter as well as an update on corrective measures and status in the fourth quarter. The Board deals with the administration's assessment of total risk in the areas of strategic risk, financial risk, operational risk and corporate reputation risk. Utilisation of risk information: Risk assessments are included in all business processes and monitoring of activities. Authorizations: Authorizations are in place for funding and investment frameworks. The general authorization framework is decided by the Board and may be delegated within the organisation. Any further delegation shall be approved and monitored by an immediate superior. Use of financial derivatives Financial derivatives are agreements used to determine financial values through interest terms, currency exchange rates, and values of equity instruments for specific periods. Derivatives include swaps and fixed-price agreements (forward contracts). Posten Norge AS utilises financial derivatives to handle market risks that arise due to the Group's regular operations, for example to hedge carrying amounts of foreign subsidiaries and loans to foreign subsidiaries in foreign currencies. The Group's counterparties and issuers have low credit risk. The following derivatives are utilised by the Group for hedging purposes: Futures: An agreement to exchange foreign currencies in the future at a pre-determined rate. Posten Norge AS primarily uses currency futures to hedge revenues and expenses in in foreign currencies and to hedge investments and loans to foreign subsidiaries in foreign currencies. Swaps: Transactions where two parties exchange cash flows for an agreed amount over an agreed period. The most important forms of swaps utilised by Norway Post are: Interest-rate swaps exchange of cash flows for an agreed period where one party in the swap pays fixed interest and the other floating interest. Currency swaps an agreement between two parties to exchange one currency with another, with an agreement to exchange these back again at a future point in time at an agreed rate. The exchange rate is determined from the current spot rate and the interest rate difference between the two respective currency's countries. Combined interest-rate and currency swaps the parties exchange both currency and interest rate terms Categories of risk For risk management purposes Norway Post identifies the following forms of risk: Strategic risk is the risk of loss due to changes in external factors such as the economic situation or government regulations. Financial risk includes: Credit risk: Risk of loss caused by a counterparty/customer who fails to fulfil its payment obligations to the Group. Credit risk concerns all financial assets from the counterparty/customer, mainly interest-bearing securities, but also responsibilities pursuant to other issued credits, guaranties, leasing, approved credits not utilised, as well as counterparty risk from derivatives and currency contracts. Financial market risk: Occurs due to the Group's open positions in currency and interest-rate instruments, and the risk is related to variations in profit or loss due to changes in market prices or exchange rates. Liquidity risk: The risk that the Group is unable to fulfill its financial obligations. Operational risk: The risk of loss caused by process or system weaknesses or errors, errors committed by employees, or external events. Corporate reputation risk: The risk of reduction in revenues or access to capital due to falling confidence and reputation in the market, with respect to customers, counterparties, owners or authorities. Risk management is a specialist area in the Group that is continuously developing, and measurement methods and tools are constantly being improved. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by not fulfilling its obligations. Responsibility pursuant to other issued credits, guarantees, interest-bearing securities, approved credits not drawn and counterparty risk occurring through derivatives and currency contracts also carries credit risk. Contracting parties in a derivative trade is normally a bank, and therefore the credit risk relating to derivatives is considered low. The Group chooses counterparts with low credit risk. The Group's most important business partners all have an Arating or better. Credit risk associated with financial assets: The Group has no significant credit risk relating to one individual contracting party, or several contracting parties that can be regarded as one group due to similarities in credit risk. The Group has guidelines to ensure that sales are only made to customers that have not had any significant payment issues and that outstanding amounts do not exceed stipulated credit limits. Since the Group has no financial assets outside the balance sheet, the maximum risk exposure is represented by the balance sheet value of the financial assets, including derivatives, in the balance sheet. The Group regards its maximum risk exposure to be the balance sheet value of its accounts receivable and other current assets. See note 12 for more detailed specifications of interest-free short-term receivables. The Group does not guarantee third-party debt.

The risk is related to variations in profit or loss due to changes in market prices or exchange rates. Norway Post's objective is to secure the risk connencted to both cash flows and the balance sheet (as a consequence of exchange rates and interest rate changes). Currency: The market risk is limited by reducing the effects of the exchange rate in revenues and in the balance sheet through the use of forward contracts. Foreign currency balances in bank accounts are minimized at the subsidiary level and are actively managed by the Group level in order to avoid large positive/negative balances. Internal foreign currency transactions are used extensively between subsidiaries and the Group in order to reduce large bank balances in foreign currencies.

Norway Post enters into forward contracts to eliminate translation differences in the accounts as much as possible. This is done by entering into forward contracts equal to the net carrying amount of the investments, which revolve until there is a decision either to sell the acquired company, or to follow another strategy related to risk elimination. Norway Post utilises hedge accounting for the majority of hedges of future transactions, either cash flow hedging or value hedging. For example, Norway Post is a net importer of mail to Norway, which results in receivables against foreign postal operators in euro and US dollar. In addition, Norway Post has costs in euro and US dollar on air freight.

Fluctuations in hedging of investments in foreign subsidiaries will be accounted for in other comprehensive income in the Group. Fluctuations in the value of hedges for loans to foreign subsidiares will be accounted for in the income statement. Interest rate: Norway Post's interest rate risk is mainly related to the Group's debt portfolio. This type of risk is managed at group level. The Group's goal is that the interest expenses shall follow the general development in the money market. Fixed interest rate loans and fixed rate agreements can be entered into to a certain degree when there is risk for abnormally high money market interest rates or to reduce the Group's exposure to changes in the interes rates, and financial advantages can be expected from the fixed interest rate terms. As of 31.12.2014, 18% of the Group's interest bearing liabilities had an interest term of more than one year. As of 31.12.2014 Posten Norge AS had MNOK 648 in fixed interest rate loans. The sensitivity of changes in the interest rate (+/1%) related to the net interest bearing debt (floating interest rate only) as of 31.12.2014 was MNOK 8 where net interest bearing debt with a floating interest rate was MNOK 810. Interest rate risk arises when there is an imbalance between interest bearing debt and interest bearing liquid assets, and where the average weighted time to maturity for assets and debt is unequal.

Under the agreement, Posten Norge AS receives the percentage change in the Norwegian consumer price index over the coupon period (annually) as well as a fixed spread of the inflation index, in return for paying three months' NIBOR each quarter. The agreement has a duration of 10 years. In 2009 MNOK 300 of the principal was cancelled through an agreement with the counterparty. In addition, agreements were entered into for the remaining MNOK 700 for the issue of real interest rate bonds providing cash flows approximately equal to the original agreement. Liquidity reserves: To ensure the Group's financial freedom, there are defined goals for liquidity reserves. The liquidity reserve, consisting of market placements and unused credits with deducted certificate loans, shall be a minimum of 15% of the Group's operating revenues for the last 12 months.

This is achieved by concentrating all available liquidity in the Group's corporate account system, and by having a conservative administrative profile with significant emphasis on liquid placements. The Group has centralised overall responsibility for liquidity management and measures that promote effective utilisation of the company´s capital. The Group has negotiated the terms for deposits in major banks with AA ratings, so they are competative against money market funds. All subsidiaries should be affiliated to the Group's corporated account system so that they benefit from the negotiated terms. The Group manages the capital structure and the objective is to have the financial strength to withstand commercial changes. The Group has long term credit facilities which constitute a significant capital buffer against unexpected financial needs. The credit facilities have been entered into with a bank syndicate where all participants have an Arating or better, which also limits counterparty risk. In addition, the Group has diversified its sources of capital and currently has bonds, credit facilities, private placement with international lenders as well as bilateral agreements with Nordic financial institutions with satisfying maturities. Subsidiaries are not permitted to raise external financing, but receive funding from the Group through long-term loans or overdraft facilities and short-term credit facilities within the corporate account system. The Group measures capital utilisation by using the liability ratio, which is net interest-bearing debt divided by equity. Net interest-bearing debt consist of interest-bearing current and non-current liabilities less liquid assets in the forms of cash, bank balances, and current placements. In addition, net interest-bearing debt divided by EBITDA is used to measure whether operating earnings are sufficient to service the Group's external debt. The goal is that net interestbearing debt shall not exceed 3.5 times EBITDA. There were no changes to the Group's goals, principles or processes related to capital management during 2012, 2013 or 2014.

The company's biggest loan facility contains a clause stipulating that investments shall not increase the Group's net interest-bearing debt to more than 3.5 x EBITDA, where EBITDA is measured for a period of the last 12 months on the balance sheet day of each quarter. As at 31.12.2014 (see table above) this was 0.8 of EBITDA (0.8 as at 31.12.2013 and 0.6 as at 31.12.2012). Three loan agreements also include a covenant for a minimum of 20% equity. In addition one loan agreement has a covenant of minimum 25% equity. As of 31.12.2014 the equity ratio was 37.9% (38.8% as of 31.12.2013 and 37.5% as of 31.12.2012). In addition the following covenants apply to the majority of loan agreements: • Change of control covenant: 51% Government ownership. • Negative pledge. • Cross default, a default in one agreement leads to all agreements being deemed default. Breaching the terms of covenants results in a demand to repay all interest-bearing debt or potentially the renegotiation of loan agreements. There are no clauses on the annual regulation of the levels of debt covenants in the loan agreements. The level of the financial key figures in the covenants is followed up closely and reported to management on a regular basis. In 2013 the credit facility with Handelsbanken was replaced with a new credit facility with DNB of MNOK 750. The Group is still disciplined in the use of capital with only a few relatively small acquisitions which together with good results has led to a significant financial capacity to implement strategic investments. Note 20 Fair value measurement Measurements at fair value The following methods and assumptions are used in calculating fair values of financial assets and liabilities: • Fair value of financial assets classified as available for sale are determined by the stock market price on the balance-sheet day, if they are listed. For unlisted assets the fair value is evaluated as not being significantly different from the historical cost. • Fair value of forward currency contracts are determined by utilising the forward rate at the balance sheet date. Fair value of currency swaps are determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows. For all derivatives, fair value is confirmed by the financial institution that the company has agreements with. • The following of the company's financial instruments have a fair value approximately equal to carrying amounts: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, other current receivables, other non-current interest-bearing receivables, overdraft facilities, parts of non-current liabilities, accounts payables and other current liabilities. • Carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents and overdraft facilities are approximately equal to fair value as these instruments have short maturity. Carrying amount of accounts receivables and accounts payables are approximately equal to fair value since they are entered into at market conditions. • Fair value of non-current liabilities is calculated using listed market prices, or interest rate terms for liabilities with equal maturity period and credit risk. • For financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost, fair value is approximately equal to amortised cost when calculated as the present value of estimated discounted cash flows using an interest rate from equivalent debt and assets on the balance sheet date. • Fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments is carried as other current receivables/liabilities, or other non-current receivables/liabilities depending on the maturity date of the corresponding hedged object. Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy to define fair value per valuation method: Level 1: Listed prices (non-adjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Other input than listed prices included on level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (such as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). Level 3: Input for the asset or liability that is not based on observable market data (non-observable input). As of 31.2.2014 the Group had the following financial assets and liabilities with the following fair values: Description Fair value measurement per level Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2014 2013 2012 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Liquid assets 2 073 2 073 1 791 2 089 Derivatives measured at fair value Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 84 84 Financial assets measured at amortised cost: Interest bearing non-current receivables 7 7 7 2 Other non-current receivables 21 21 45 25 Interest-free current receivables 3 216 842 4 058 3 657 3 459 Interest-bearing current receivables 144 31 175 224 292 Total assets 2 073 3 444 902 6 418 5 723 5 868 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Loans 851 851 789 772 Derivatives measured at fair value Cash flow hedge/net investment in foreign subsidiaries 134 134 107 50 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 63 63 15 133 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost: Interest-bearing non-current liabilities 1 000 53 1 053 1 152 919 Interest-bearing current liabilities 1 601 26 1 626 1 222 1 339 Interest-free current liabilities 2 657 2 349 5 006 4 831 4 878 Total liabilities 6 306 2 427 8 733 8 115 8 092 No financial assets have been reclassified in such a way that the valuation method has been changed from amortised cost to actual cost, or vice versa. There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements in 2014, and no recording of financial assets in or out of level 3.

Note 23 Changes to the Group structure The following changes of the Group's structure have taken place since 31. December 2013: Subsidiaries and joint ventures founded in 2014 Bring Citymail Sweden AB founded in December 2013 the company Bring Citymail Eken AB. The founded company was in January 2014 sold to Bring Citymail Stockholm KB, a company in which Bring Citymail Sweden AB has an ownership of 50%. The background for this transaction was that Norway Post and the Swedish newspapers Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter collaborated to provide postal and newspaper distribution services in Stockholm. The partnership strengthens the Group's position in one of the most densely populated and rapidly growing regions in the Nordic countries. The goal is to take advantage of the economies of scale and the capacity of the distribution network by including more services. Acquisition of companies 2014 In January 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the shares in West Cargo Vårgårda AB and thereby strengthening its position in the Swedish logistics market. This acquisition is part of the Group's strategy to grow in the Nordic countries and to meet the increase in demand for logistics services in the Nordic region. West Cargo Vårgårda has 110 employees and approximately 100 vehicles and holds a strong position in the freight-transport sector in the Västra Götaland region. The company had an annual turnover of approximately MSEK 320 in 2013. The Group acquired in June 2014 100% of the shares in Kirkestuen Transport AS. The company is a solid transport company, with transport-terminals at Rudshøgda and Otta. The company will strengthen the position of the Group in Hedemark and Oppland.

The increase of sales to subsidiaries from 2013 to 2014 was mainly due to sales of services to Bring Parcels AB and Bring Cargo AS. The reduction of purchases with related parties was mainly a result of decline in purchases from EVRY group.

REGULATORY FACTORS Posten Norge AS licence In accordance with §4 of the Postal Act the Ministry of Transport and Communication has granted Posten Norge AS a 4 year licence running from 01.01.2013. The licence gives Posten Norge AS the exclusive right to manage domestic sealed and addressed letter mail less than 50 grams and international mail priced up to 2,5 times the basic price for domestic priority mail. At the same time the licence also entails that Posten Norge AS must carry out social obligations. The Ministry of Transport and Communication can change the licence during the licence period. The social obligations cover: Available product requirements (statutory postal services and basic banking services in the rural postal service) Requirement for the availability of statutory postal services Delivery time requirements Requirement for cost-based prices and geographically uniform postage charges within the monopoly In point 4.2 of the licence it is assumed that Posten Norge AS 's extra costs related to the social obligations are covered by the monopoly profits from the monopoly services and government procurements granted through the state budget. The annual grant of funds in advance for government procurements is adjusted the following year based on a recalculation of requirements in connection with Posten`s product accounts for the licence to the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority. This arrangement shall prevent over or undercompensation. After adjustments, government procurements were MNOK 351 for 2013 and MNOK 302 for 2012. MNOK 270 was allocated in the state budget and paid out for 2014. In the state budget for 2015 MNOK 418 is allocated for government procurements. The increase is based on an expectation of decline in mail volums. In addition, the allocation assumes that changes related to the Government's proposal to a new postal law will not be in place in time to have an effect of governments procurements for 2015. The licence stipulates that Posten Norge AS must document that there are no illegal cross subsidies between the monopoly services and the services that are subject to competition. This documentation is to be submitted to the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority in the annual product accounts. The auditor conducts audits in accordance with the licence. The product accounts for 2014 will be presented at the latest three months after the financial statements for 2014 have been approved. EU's Postal Directive EU's Postal Directive includes the stipulation of certain minimum requirements for mandatory postal services, principles on cost-based prices and government compensation for extra costs related to mandatory postal services. Further more, EU's Third Postal Directive liberalises national postal markets. The Solberg Government notified in 2013 that they will implement the directive in Norway. In October 2014, the Ministry of Transport and Communications sent a draft of the new Postal Services Act for public consultation. Among other things, the draft proposes the discontinuation of Norway Post’s sole right to distribute letters below 50 grams and the discontinuation of ordinary postal delivery on Saturdays, and proposes a minimum regulatory framework for digital postal services. The Government’s final proposal for the Postal Services Act will be considered by Parliament in spring 2015 at the earliest. Government ownership The Ministry's requirement for return on equity from Norway Post is set to 9% after tax. The dividend policy entails an expected dividend of 50% of the Group's consolidated net profit after tax, taking into account an acceptable level of the parent company's distributable equity. Banking and payment services The statutory banking service requirement for services through Posten Norge AS's distribution network was changed in 2012 to limit it to the rural postal service, cf. Prop. 100 L (2011-2012). Norway Post's extra costs relating to the services are compensated through the government procurements scheme. Norway Post has chosen to continue offering banking services in other parts of its service network, which are not covered by the statutory banking service (post offices and Post in Shops). The current contract for the distribution of banking services through Norway Post's sales network runs until 31.12.2019. Based on a competition for banking and payment services in the rural postal service, a new agreement was entered into with DNB with effect from 01.01.2014 and with the same expiration date as the rest of the contract . DISPUTES In 2010 ESA decided to impose a fine of MEUR 12.9 in connection with previous exclusivity clauses in contracts for Post in Shops from 2000 to 2006. Posten Norge AS contested ESA's decision and brought the case to the EFTA-court. The Court did not agree with Posten Norge AS, but reduced the fine to MEUR 11.1. The German logistics company Schenker has filed a claim for compensation up to MNOK 460 against Posten Norge AS that was stopped by the Oslo District Court in anticipation of other litigation. Posten Norge AS is of the opinion that there is no basis for the claim. No disputes that involve any significant risk exposure to the Group have been identified in subsidiaries.
