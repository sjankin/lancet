For Nokia Group, Pricewaterhouse­ Coopers Oy has not performed any assurance procedures on Networks’ (formerly Nokia Solutions and Networks) amounts. CO2 emissions in base year 2006 have originally been assured by Ecofys Germany GmbH, and for that part PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has relied on their assurance work. • Water usage in facilities and recycling (also Nokia Group). For Nokia Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has not performed any assurance procedures on Networks’ (formerly Nokia Solutions and Networks) amounts. • Green electrical energy portion of total electricity consumption (also Nokia Group). For Nokia Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has not performed any assurance procedures on Networks’ (formerly Nokia Solutions and Networks) amounts. • VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) emissions from factories. • Waste amounts and treatment. • RoHS and REACH compliance of products. • Charger no-load power consumption (average sold p.a.). • Air travel emissions. 119 1 ABOUT THIS REPORT HR: The reporting boundary is Devices & Services 2 A MESSAGE FROM RISTO SIILASMAA • Employees in production. 3 ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES IN 2013 4 ABOUT NOKIA • Total training cost and Training cost/employee. 5 IDENTIFYING KEY SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 6 OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY: • Women in senior management.

Management’s responsibility The Management of Nokia Corporation is responsible for preparing the Selected sustainability information in accordance with the reporting criteria as set out in the Company’s documented standards and GHG Protocol (hereinafter the “Reporting criteria”). Practitioner’s responsibility Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Selected sustainability information based on our work performed. Our assurance report has been prepared in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to Nokia Corporation for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions that we have reached. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”. This Standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Selected sustainability 120 1 ABOUT THIS REPORT information has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria. 2 A MESSAGE FROM RISTO SIILASMAA 3 ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES IN 2013 4 ABOUT NOKIA In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable 5 IDENTIFYING KEY SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 6 OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY: assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement.

The procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement, 9 UNLEASHING THE POTENTIAL OF TECHNOLOGY FOR GOOD including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Selected sustainability information. Our work 10 MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN TOGETHER consisted of, amongst others, the following procedures: 11 INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE 12 GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE 13 NOKIA KEY DATA • Interviewing relevant management of the Company. • Interviewing employees responsible for collecting and reporting the Selected sustainability information. • Testing the accuracy and completeness of the Selected sustainability information from original documents and systems on a sample basis. • Testing the consolidation of the Selected sustainability information and performing recalculations on a sample basis. Conclusion Based on our work described in this report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that Nokia Corporation’s Selected sustainability information has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria. When reading our assurance report, the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of sustainability information should be taken into consideration.
