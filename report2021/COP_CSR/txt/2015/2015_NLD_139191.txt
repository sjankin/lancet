United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress Covering Calendar Year 2014 8th April 2015 To our Stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that once again this year AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. ( AMG ) reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and AntiCorruption. Our Code of Business Conduct and Policy on Human Rights, both of which are available on our website, set out our commitments to act ethically and uphold the ten UNGC principles in all of our business activities. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication, primarily the AMG website www.amg-nv.com. Sincerely yours, Dr. Heinz C. Schimmelbusch Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 20150408 Communication on Progress 1 HUMAN RIGHTS  Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group explicitly supports the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although always an integral part of AMG, our formal commitment in this area started in 2009 with the publication of our Code of Business Conduct. This was augmented in 2011 by the publication of our Policy on Human Rights. Both of these documents can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the AMG website, and the Human Rights Policy is shown below: 20150408 Communication on Progress 2 A review of this policy in 2014 determined it to still be adequate to articulate AMG’s commitments. The commitments made in these publications are monitored by a network of Compliance Officers under the oversight of a Chief Compliance Officer and a Compliance team. The Compliance team meets regularly to review Compliance and Ethical issues and is supported by an independent external consultant. This consultant has assisted in the development of policies, procedures and training programs. In 2014 there was a full Compliance meeting held in Amsterdam which included the Compliance team and all local Compliance Officers. The meeting included sharing best practices and Compliance Officer training. The Compliance team is also continually supported by senior management across the subsidiary companies. This team has developed Compliance training for AMG staff at all levels in the organization. This training has been tailored to the individual and includes face to face training for shop floor employees and on line training for office and executive staff. In 2014 there were no reported incidents of breaches of the AMG Code of Business Conduct related to human rights abuses.  Principle 2 Make sure businesses are not complicit in human rights abuses The aim of the presence of an AMG business unit in a community is to strengthen and be part of the community, fostering sound relationships and avoiding conflicts. We respect the dignity and rights of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate and others who might be affected by our operations and actively involving ourselves and supporting those communities. AMG also contributes through philanthropic donations to support local community needs including to schools, colleges and hospitals. AMG sustains an expanding network of Code of Business Conduct Compliance Officers based in the countries and major sites where AMG companies are operating to locally identify any potential human rights abuses. In instances where this needs to be done independently and confidentially, a Whistle Blowing policy is in force allowing any employee to come forward and report issues. The Whistleblowing policy can be accessed through the Governance section of the AMG website. The Chief Compliance Officer and their team carefully review any and all Whistleblower complaints. AMG also has a Supplier Conduct Charter, shown below, which is part of a process to ensure the standards relating to Human Rights which AMG holds itself to, are expanded to our suppliers as well. In particular, this policy states that: “AMG’s suppliers should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure they are not complicit in human rights abuses.” 20150408 Communication on Progress 3 LABOR  Principle 3 Businesses should uphold freedom of association & effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees to join, or choose not to join, legally authorized association or organizations. AMG continues to use the Global Reporting Initiative 20150408 Communication on Progress 4 (GRI) indicator LA4 (Percentage of Employees Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements) to monitor this principle. In our 2014 Annual Report we state: “AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees and their rights to join, or to choose not to join, unions. Across the Company, 1,825 AMG employees (63%) were covered by collective bargaining agreements. 75% of AMG Processing and 63% of AMG Mining employees are covered by such arrangements. AMG Engineering, which includes a higher proportion of professional salaried staff, has 45% of its employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. There were no strikes or lockouts reported at any of AMG’s facilities in 2014.” Additionally, we utilize indicator HR5 (Operations identified in which the right to exercise freedom of association or collective bargaining may be at significant risk, and actions taken to support these rights). In the 2014 Annual Report we state: “Each AMG site is assessed during site visits and internal audits to identify if there is the possibility of freedom of association or collective bargaining being put at risk because of political or business factors. In 2014, it was found that no sites were at risk, with the exception of China, where the formation of unions remains restricted.” Further, with the development and implementation of our Supplier Conduct Charter we begin to hold our suppliers to the same standard stating: “AMG’s suppliers should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor”  Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor All AMG employees work for the company as a result of need or want. Nobody is forced to work for AMG and we prohibit the use of any forced labor, including slavery, servitude, or prison labor. This is reflected in the widespread presence of unionized labor across AMG. Currently most of the locations and environments AMG facilities are present in are stable and advanced democracies, assisting in ensuring human rights abuses of this type are not occurring. Again, our Supplier Conduct Charter adopted in 2014 introduces our commitment to this principal to our suppliers stating: “AMG’s suppliers should support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor.”  Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labor As stated in our Human Rights Policy, AMG does not employ children and strongly rejects the use of child labor, and expects our suppliers to do the same through the requirements of our Supplier Conduct Charter. AMG does actively support the creation of educational programs for young people including apprenticeships combined with formal education, particularly in the areas of science and engineering. In our annual report we utilize the Global Reporting Initiative indicator HR6 “Operations identified as having significant risk for incidents of child labor, and measure taken to contribute to the elimination of child labor”. In its most recent annual report AMG reported that it has reviewed 33 of its operating sites across the world to ensure that they are not at risk for employing child labor or exposing young workers to hazards. It was found that 20150408 Communication on Progress 5 no sites posed a risk at this time. AMG is at the root of the supply chain for several of its products and is proud to be able to supply metals such as Tantalum and Tin, commodities historically fraught with human rights abuses, from mining operations with strong ethical practices and not utilizing child labor. In particular our Tantalum supply chain in Brazil is certified as Conflict Free by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC).  Principle 6 Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation AMG’s Code of Business Conduct states that the Company views as unacceptable any form of harassment or unfair or unlawful discrimination based on race, age, gender, color, sexual orientation, disability or national origin, whether by employees, temporary employees, managers, customers, vendors or AMG companies’ visitors. At year-end 2014, AMG Processing had a workforce of 1,183, AMG Engineering had 877 employees, and AMG Mining had 858 employees. Including corporate staff (39), the total AMG workforce was 2,918. Geographically, these were located in Asia (332), Europe (1,614), North America (546) and South America (426). A further 268 directly supervised contract workers were employed at AMG sites. AMG assesses the diversity of its workforce in terms of gender and age. The multinational, and therefore multicultural, nature of the business means that ethnic diversity is significant, but because of the difficulty in defining minority employees in such an environment, the Company does not collect data on this aspect. Of the total employees, 17% are female; 18% are under 30 years of age, 53% are between 30 and 50, and 28% are over 50. The Management Board is 66% male and 33% female. The Supervisory Board is 78% male and 22% female. One Supervisory Board member is aged 30-50 while eight are over 50. The composition of the management board has been unchanged and remains at 33% female and the supervisory board moved from 13% to 22% female. However, AMG is continuing to work to improve the diversity of its Boards. On page 27 of our 2014 Annual Report we note: “Gender Diversity: The Supervisory Board recognizes the importance of a diverse composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board in terms of gender. The Supervisory Board is pleased that in 2014, Mrs. Donatella Ceccarelli has joined the Supervisory Board as the second female member, next to Mrs. Ute Wolf who was appointed in 2013. New Dutch legislation, which became effective on January 1, 2013, requires the Company to pursue a policy of having at least 30% of the seats on the Supervisory Board and the Management Board be held by men and at least 30% of the seats be held by women. It is with particular regret that the Supervisory Board had to accept the resignation of Ms. Wolf when her term ends in May 2015. The company will, with increased focus, continue to take this allocation of seats into account in connection with the following actions: (1) the appointment or nomination for the appointment of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board and (2) drafting the criteria for the size and 20150408 Communication on Progress 6 composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board. At this moment, the Company does comply with article 2:166 Dutch Civil Code with regards to the composition of the Management Board, and does not fully comply with this article regarding the composition of the Supervisory Board, where currently only 22% of the Supervisory Board seats are held by women, which will fall to 11% after May 2015. The Supervisory Board will continue to look for suitable female candidates for the Supervisory Board.” ENVIRONMENT  Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges All AMG facilities have a strong awareness and knowledge of their environmental impact and the company utilizes the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 guidelines to measure and report environmental impacts in a number of areas including raw material use, energy consumption, greenhouse gas generation, water use and discharge and waste generation and disposal. Collection of this data is vital to help sites focus on improving efficiencies – including reducing energy use and concurrent greenhouse gas emissions, but also reducing solid and liquid wastes and reducing water consumption. These environmental impacts are reported annually to our stakeholders in the Company annual report. Many of AMG’s activities focus on technologies to address fossil fuel efficiencies and reduce greenhouse gas generation, where we believe a precautionary approach is vital given the potential adverse effects. Many of the technologies that AMG produces, which we refer to as “enabling technologies” contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation and buildings sectors. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Twelve of the larger AMG manufacturing facilities now have ISO 14001 environmental management system certification in place. Formalized management systems are seen as a key tool to maintaining focus on environmental responsibility. Additionally AMG has invested in projects including hydroelectric generation, solar generation and heat recovery systems. It is also promoting energy management initiatives to improve efficiencies, with several larger energy users, including the largest, holding ISO 50001 energy management certification. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies 20150408 Communication on Progress 7 AMG has considered carefully what constitutes a “Green Company” and its CEO has coauthored a paper on this which is available on the AMG website and also reproduced at the end of this report, and a further published paper on the subject in the Stern Stewart Institute Periodical #10 (June 2014). AMG’s businesses continue to focus on environmentally friendly technologies. In 2014 AMG expanded investment in the production of titanium aluminides used in the aerospace industry. Investments in the plant in Cambridge, Ohio that produces the steel strengthening alloy ferrovanadium from byproducts of the oil refining and power generation industries, eliminating landfill, has resulted in significant capacity increase. This technology reduces energy in the manufacturing process and by strengthening steel, significantly reduces the tonnages required in end user applications. AMG is also actively supporting the automotive industry as it moves to more fuel efficient turbo charged, low displacement engines, through heat treatment of fast moving, high temperature parts such as turbo chargers and piston heads. Similar applications have been seen in next generation aviation jet engines which contribute to the fuel efficiency of next generation aircraft and where AMG’s ceramic coating technologies further enable fuel efficiency savings. AMG continues to believe that nuclear power is required as part of the short and medium term solution to anthropogenic CO2 emissions and continue to supply products and engineering expertise to support this sector. ANTI CORRUPTION  Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. In 2009 AMG introduced (and published) its Code of Business Conduct to all of its staff which sets out guiding principles in its ethics and business conduct as adopted and approved by the Company’s Management Board and Supervisory Board. The Code of Business Conduct discusses in detail the ethical conduct and business practices which AMG expects from all employees, covering area’s like conflicts of interest, anti-bribery, insider dealing, policies on corporate entertainment and acceptance of gifts, and the integrity of our record keeping and reporting. AMG also has a stand-alone policy on Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption. This is available under the Corporate Governance section of the AMG-NV website. Specific training programs for staff, using web based training, and via face to face training, took place in 2014. AMG further promotes these values throughout the Company with multi lingual posters prominently displayed at operational sites to raise awareness of the Code of Business Conduct and various ethically based programs. 20150408 Communication on Progress 8 20150408 Communication on Progress 9 ATTACHMENT 1 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SECTION FROM THE 2013 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS 20150408 Communication on Progress 10 Sustainable Development SITE NAME1 LOCATION COUNTRY DIVISION AMG HEADQUARTERS AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS AMG CORPORATE AMG USA HEADQUARTERS PENNSYLVANIA USA AMG CORPORATE ALD IMP BERLIN GERMANY AMG ENGINEERING ALD USA 3 CONNECTICUT USA AMG ENGINEERING ALD FRANCE GRENOBLE FRANCE AMG ENGINEERING ALD UK 3 GUILDFORD UK AMG ENGINEERING ALD VACUUM TECHNOLOGIES2 HANAU GERMANY AMG ENGINEERING ALD VACUHEAT 2 LIMBACH GERMANY AMG ENGINEERING ALD TT USA 2 MICHIGAN USA AMG ENGINEERING ALD DYNATECH MUMBAI INDIA AMG ENGINEERING ALD TT MEXICO 2 RAMOS ARIZPE MEXICO AMG ENGINEERING ALD JAPAN 3 SHINJUKU-KU JAPAN AMG ENGINEERING ALD SINGAPORE 3 SINGAPORE SINGAPORE AMG ENGINEERING ALD C&K SUZHO CHINA AMG ENGINEERING AMG INTELLIFAST GMBH SPEYER GERMANY AMG ENGINEERING AMG ANTIMONY CHAUNY FRANCE AMG MINING BOGALA GRAPHITE LANKA COLOMBO SRI LANKA AMG MINING AMG MINING 2 KROPFMUHL GERMANY AMG MINING AMG ANTIMONY LUCETTE FRANCE AMG MINING AMG MINERACAO 2 NAZARENO BRAZIL AMG MINING AMG SILICON2 POCKING GERMANY AMG MINING AMG GRAPHITE QINGDAO CHINA AMG MINING AMG GRAPHITE TYN TYN CZECH REPUBLIC AMG MINING AMG ALPOCO ANGLESEY UK AMG PROCESSING AMG TITANIUM ALLOYS AND COATINGS2 BRAND ERBISDORF GERMANY AMG PROCESSING AMG ALUMINUM 3 JIAXING CHINA AMG PROCESSING AMG ALUMINUM KENTUCKY USA AMG PROCESSING AMG ALPOCO MINWORTH UK AMG PROCESSING AMG TITANIUM ALLOYS AND COATINGS2 NÜRNBERG GERMANY AMG PROCESSING AMG VANADIUM2 OHIO USA AMG PROCESSING AMG SUPERALLOYS AND AMG ALUMINUM2 ROTHERHAM UK AMG PROCESSING AMG ALUMINUM WASHINGTON USA AMG PROCESSING AMG BRAZIL 2 SAO JOAO DEL REI BRAZIL AMG PROCESSING 1 The chart indicates which facilities were included in the scope of the sustainable development data.

Lost time injury was defined using local regulations. 2 Incident severity is defined as the number of scheduled work days lost as a result of disabling injuries per thousand worker hours of exposure. In some locations calendar days are counted by local regulators and this data is used here if scheduled work days are unavailable. 40 AMG – THE CRITICAL MATERIALS COMPANY Across all the reporting sites, AMG employees received AMG Engineering provides predominantly furnace an average of 17 hours of training time in 2014 technology and engineering services, including furnace (approximately 1% of total hours worked). assembly operations and heat treatment services. The segment utilizes limited amounts of resources in Human Rights and Ethics these activities, mainly complex component parts for GRI INDICATORS HR 3, HR 5, HR 6 AND SO 3 furnaces, which are routinely measured in units rather than by mass. Therefore, unlike the chemicals and alloys AMG remains fully committed to the protection of business units, only limited data is available on resource internationally proclaimed human rights and works to mass. In 2014, AMG Engineering reported using 2,930 mt make sure it is not complicit in human rights abuses. of resources, all of which were classified as primary.

This paper, co-authored by Dr. Heinz C. Schimmelbusch AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V.’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Management Board, Dr. David J White, AMG Vice President Health, Safety and Environmental Affairs, and Mr. Jonathan A. Costello, AMG Vice President Corporate Development & Communications, explains how AMG approaches sustainability. We speak of green technologies, green strategies, green companies, green IPO’s, green political policies, and lately “green bonds”. There are innumerable perceptions and meanings of “green” and no workable definition. We will offer a framework not only how to define “green” but also how to measure “greenness” of a company, a necessary step on the road to green ratings which then would assist investors with an interest or commitment to this movement. The proposed framework is the result of our involvement in “green” technologies at AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group, N.V., Amsterdam. A cautionary remark: The calculations in this brief are subject to further work and refining. By the very nature of their broad scope they will inevitably require approximations and estimations. However, we believe they are sufficiently accurate for the conclusions we have arrived at. When AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. (“AMG”, EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) was created, the guiding principles were (1) that material science in general, and advanced metallurgy in particular, holds the key for technological solutions which respond to the trends towards a sustainable society; (2) that AMG would assemble a portfolio of productive assets in “critical” materials which are “critical” because of the demand shifts resulting from those trends; and (3) that AMG would focus on technological What is a Green Company? 1 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. innovations that combine financial with environmental attractiveness. We have consistently reiterated these principles. The methodology of measuring financial attractiveness is well established. But how do we measure environmental attractiveness? In other words, how do we actually define the loosely and often carelessly used term “green”? Early on we decided to measure our environmental impact using CO2 emissions, and more particularly how does AMG contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions. The reasons for this focus were that (1) there is a mounting body of evidence pointing toward anthropogenic CO2 emissions as the root cause of global warming; (2) even if this is not the case, fossil fuels must be finite and we must preserve them in order to have a sustainable society; and (3) if there is lack of final scientific proof of the impact of anthropogenic CO2 on temperatures and sea levels it is probably prudent to pay for a large insurance coverage. In this exercise we end up with two different categories of CO2 reduction. One category includes process technology innovations that make possible a more efficient and less carbon intensive production of metals and alloys in comparison to traditional processes. In this case we are talking about energy savings and resulting CO2 reduction DURING manufacturing and we refer to those innovations as “mitigating” technologies as they “mitigate” emission risks (environmental viewpoint) and risks of being a high cost producer (financial viewpoint). The second category consists of the development of new offerings of products enabling our customers to reduce CO2 when USING these products in their operations compared to the use of traditional products. This second category we internally refer to as “enabling” technology innovations as they enable CO2 savings by our customers. Again, there is an environmental dimension (to arrest and reverse the global trend of increasing CO2 emissions) and a financial dimension (as the products in question tend to be highly competitive, and at least at the beginning of the lifecycle to command premium pricing). A SHORT HISTORY OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES What is a Green Company? 2 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. Governmental policies for the protection of the environment developed in several waves which sometimes overlapped. The first wave was the targeting of industrial emissions; waste gas and waste water, industrial residues and soil contamination. This can be summarized as “end-of-the-pipe” regulations. As regard to clean air, emissions of sulfur oxides, of nitrogen oxides and of dust particles were to be captured with sophisticated filter systems. Incidentally, by the time the Deutsche Bundestag, in 1971, for the first time debated clean air strategies, Lurgi, a German engineering firm, had already sold over 5000 filter systems around the world, starting before World War I. Air quality improvement was followed by wastewater purification processes and the avoidance of soil contamination. The next wave was to complement “end-of-the-pipe” systems with better “pipes”; in other words better process technologies, recognizing that a more efficient process reduces what comes out at the end of the “pipe”. That is when CO2 reduction entered the scene of environmental policy in the context of the rapidly emerging climate change debate and the Kyoto agreement. Energy saving in all its forms was taking center stage far beyond industrial processes and including residential and commercial buildings and transportation. In the beginning this wave of energy saving has been driven largely by economics quickly taken over by regulations and incentive programs. A third industrial movement, with large scale environmental benefits as a byproduct, has been “recycling”, driven both by regulations (in the case for restrictions making land-fills more expensive) and by economics (raw material prices). “Cradle-to-Grave” was replaced by “Cradle-to-Cradle”, industrial residues turning into raw materials replacing primary sources. The term “urban mining” was coined. Over time this grew into a recycling boom, becoming very visible in the 70’s and 80’s. One very good example for this partial industrial revolution is the rapid growth of the so-called “mini-mills” revolutionizing the steel industry by replacing iron ore as a feed stock by steel scrap. This movement then had a derivative, the recycling of zinc contained in the filter-dust of those mills into a material competing with primary zinc What is a Green Company? 3 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. concentrates. Recycling processes now cover a wide array of industries and are associated with massive CO2 reductions compared with traditional processes based on primary resources only. Primary production continues, as inevitably it must to meet the demands of an increasing and more affluent population, but recycling is vital to a number of material supply chains including the large volume metals such as steel, aluminum and copper, and also niche metals including tantalum and tungsten , but also some non-metal commodities including paper, glass, and some plastics. All these developments, partly environmentally motivated, but with concurrent financial benefits, cannot escape the fundamental law of diminishing returns. In addition, these measures have limited scale-ability. The same amount of money will buy fewer improvements than when it was spent last time. If you have installed a filter system, a water purification plant, an energy saving engine, a manufacturing scrap re-use circuit, you make a big step. From then on it is optimization, incremental improvements, “inch” by “inch”, so to speak. And the recycling movement ultimately is, in its growth potential, confined to the framework of general economic growth, it cannot – in the longer term – outgrow GDP. Then, as the next wave, came the renewable energy movement, government subsidies for wind and solar, “bio” branded feedstock for energy production, motivated by CO2 reduction strategies and commitments in the aftermath of the Kyoto Protocol. As mentioned, CO2 reduction also stood behind the elaborate efforts to regulate the CO2 emissions of the global transportation sector through elaborate miles-per-gallons targets and penalties, from California to the EU. We will come back to that later. And presently we are in the “distributed energy” wave. Fuel Cell technology makes it possible to convert natural gas into electricity at the point of use through a low emission chemical process. Battery technology is behind the emergence of electric cars which do reduce CO2 emissions in densely populated areas, but only by shifting the emission point to the stack of the regional power plants that are necessary to generate the electricity required. What is a Green Company? 4 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. WHAT THEN IS GREEN? All definitions put forward on this question so far have been fluid, highly qualitative, subject to interpretation, and partly ideological. UNEP have stated: “There is no internationally agreed definition of green economy and at least eight separate definitions were identified in recent publications. For example, UNEP has defined the green economy as one that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. It is low carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive, and has pointed to another definition, that of the Green Economy Coalition (a group of NGO’s, trade union groups and others doing grass roots work on a green economy), defining green economy as ‘a resilient economy that provides a better quality of life for all within the ecological limits of the planet”. The International Chamber of Commerce says “The business community believes that the term “green economy” is embedded in the broader sustainable development concept. The “green” economy is described as an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in mutually reinforceable fashion while supporting progress on social development. Business and industry has a crucial role in delivering the economically viable products, processes, technologies, services, and solutions required for the transition to a Green Economy”. Bank of America says about its recently issued “green bond”: “The funds will be used specifically to finance renewable energy projects such as wind, solar and geothermal energy. Funds will also be used to finance energy efficiency projects that reduce energy consumption per unit of output and include projects such as lighting retrofits, district heating, co-generation, and building insulation in residential, commercial and public properties.” The Bond was issued within an initiative “to help address climate change, reduce demands on natural resources and advance lower carbon economic solutions.” What is a Green Company? 5 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION While all these environmental policy waves were going on the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere crept up year by year in a slightly accelerating mode and is presently crossing 400 ppm. The basic mechanics of that growth in CO2 levels can be expressed in terms of the KAYA equation, named after a Japanese scientist: 2 ∗ ∗ ∗ whereby P stands for Population, GWP for Gross World Product, E for Energy Consumption, F for CO2 emissions from Fuel combustion and industrial processes. Looking at this identity it is easy to see that if population and affluence, expressed by per capita output are rising, the CO2 level can only be kept constant if energy intensity (here as E/GWP) and Carbon intensity of energy production (here as F/E) are sufficiently falling. If, for example, the growth of renewable energy sources is not enough to compensate for falling nuclear energy production in the post Fukushima world, we are left with trying to lower energy intensity. Major advances in technology are necessary for that. In fact the World appears to becoming more, not less, dependent on carbon emitting energy generation. The resurgence of gas, particularly in the USA with the advent of hydraulic fracturing, has led a renaissance in gas powered energy generation. In terms of CO2 this is not a bad thing every kilogram of methane gas burnt generates approximately 2.75 kilograms of CO2 and generates 14kWh. In contrast every kilogram of coal burnt generates 3.4 kilograms of CO2 and produces 11 kWh giving natural gas about 63% of the CO2 intensity of coal on a per kWh basis. Despite a fundamental change, World CO2 emissions continue to rise. The technological challenges in the energy generation space are self-evident – they require political will as well as available technologies. While there is a clear environmental motivation, the economic motivation is perhaps less clear. Oil and gas companies are in the business of selling oil and gas; power generators in the business of generating power and What is a Green Company? 6 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. more not less builds profits for these businesses, which are so vital to our economies. If advances in energy generation are not available, not sufficient, without political will power, or without financial attractiveness, advances in energy utilization and efficiency can be made by organizations, independent of government regulations, have financial attractiveness in increasing efficiencies and may be sufficient to at least stem global CO2 emission trends. AMG, from its outset, was declaring it a priority to direct its technology resources based on material science to provide technology solutions in that space. MITIGATING TECHNOLOGIES As mentioned in the introductory remarks, at AMG we refer to technologies which are designed to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions DURING the industrial manufacturing phase (remember the “better pipe”) as mitigating technologies. These technologies are supposed to mitigate emission risks associated with high energy use in industrial production. They also tend to be highly competitive as conventional technologies over time are almost surely subject to creative destruction. An example which demonstrates technological leaps in the AMG portfolio is the ferro-vanadium production of AMG Vanadium in Cambridge, Ohio, USA. The conventional technology to produce ferro-vanadium in Cambridge was based on converting raw materials from primary mining in South Africa. We have changed that through a transformational technology innovation and today we are producing ferrovanadium by extracting vanadium from spent catalysts which are a byproduct of oil refineries and from other residues. In doing so we have reduced the CO2 emissions from 28 kg per pound of ferro-vanadium produced to 14 kg per pound or 58,000 tons of CO2 per annum. We believe, by the way, that we are now the lowest cost producer of ferro-vanadium in the world, which can be researched from public materials. We suggest that the environmental attractiveness and financial attractiveness of this mitigating technology are not unrelated. What is a Green Company? 7 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. Mitigating technologies are, by their nature, limited and bounded. The ultimate aim of any company in considering CO2 emissions is to have “zero carbon emissions”, (and zero waste and so on). This aim is pursued by introducing mitigating technologies to make processes as energy efficient as possible, but the fundamental laws of physics remind us that to do work requires energy – there are few, if any, industrial processes that can be conceived that do not consume energy. Thus to approach zero carbon emissions, a company must either install its own low carbon generating capacity (typically solar, wind or hydro) or rely on factors outside its control to get low carbon energy. Within AMG, we see both situations – in Brazil AMG has its own installed hydro generation capacity, satisfying the needs of our local operations, and exporting some power to the grid. In the United States, we operate two similar alloy production facilities, one in the Pacific Northwest, supplied with hydropower, and one in the Midwest supplied with coal-generated power. By historical accident of location (prior to climate warming concerns) these similar plants have very different emissions profiles. The ease of mitigating technology savings are, by their bounded nature, means that they are relatively easy to measure. Mitigating technologies often have a simple, if arbitrary, baseline position and the ‘ownership’ of the savings is clear. This is perhaps why they have long been the focus of governments and green investment opportunities. ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES As the first case for an enabling technology innovation at AMG one could list AMG Engineering’s proprietary and highly innovative “Modultherm” heat treatment technology for the surface preparation of next generation engine parts. Comparing to conventional heat treatment processes our enhanced technology for heat treating 6 speed transmissions enables, by the way of higher torques and lower weight, CO2 savings of 14g/km per transmission adding up to about 400.000 tons per year when applied to our volume of 1.5 million transmissions per year (2011). Incidentally, the Modultherm technology also has a “mitigating” component as it uses gas for quenching instead of oil. What is a Green Company? 8 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. Even more dramatic is the case of AMG Engineering’s application of this enhanced heat treatment process to the hardening of diesel fuel injector parts enabling them to operate under higher pressures (2250 bar vs. 150 bar) and they are utilized in new fuel efficient diesel engines. Applied to our volume (10 million units per year equivalent to 2.5 million four cylinder engines) this translates to CO2 savings of about 900.000 tons per year. Another case for vehicle efficiency is the “light weighting” through the use of aluminum vehicle panels vs. steel panels. These military grade aluminum alloys utilize AMG Aluminum’s enabling grain refining alloys. Applied to the new 2015 Ford-150, these weight reductions enable fuel efficiency to improve by an estimated 20% and correspondingly CO2 savings of about 685.000 tons per year across Ford’s annual production volume for this model. Let us switch to aerospace. AMG Processing’s titanium alloys enables airframe weight reductions (compared to the conventional use of steel) leading to rather dramatic weight reductions: According to several public sources, the Airbus A320 aircraft generates CO2 per passenger per km of 97.5g against 75g from the more efficient Boeing 787-800. In 2011, 2.8 billion passengers travelled by air, with corresponding emissions of about 676 million tons of CO2. The use of titanium alloys in airframes (applying here a conservative estimate of our market share) is enabling a CO2 reduction of about 5.000.000 tons per year. AMG’s titanium alloys typically contain high purity vanadium, a raw material that is sourced from vanadium containing residues. In regard to aerospace, the final example is AMG Engineering’s proprietary technology of thermal barrier coatings for turbine blades. This technology enables aerospace turbines to operate at higher temperatures and thus more efficiently. The thermal barrier coating facilitates operation of the turbine at temperatures above the melting point of the construction alloy. Applied to AMG’s very high market share, this enables CO2 savings of about 800.000 tons per year. What is a Green Company? 9 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. These five examples all relate to transportation, which accounts for approximately 28% of all energy used by society. An even bigger area is in buildings where approximately 41% of energy is utilized for heating, cooling and lighting. AMG also has a pivotal role in energy saving in buildings using state-of-the-art insulation materials. Graphite enhanced expanded polystyrene insulation increases the thermal coefficient of insulation materials resulting in estimated CO2 savings of about 6.000 kg per standard family home per year. In 2013, AMG Mining supplied enough graphite to produce insulation for approximately 160.000 homes, enabling about 930.000 metric tons of CO2 savings per year. This, by the way, is a perfect example of how materials, in this case natural graphite, turn into “critical materials” by the way of societal demand shifts. Unlike mitigating technologies, enabling technologies are not bounded. The fact that they go into highly scalable (often consumer product) applications means that the CO2 savings they produce are quickly multiplied. In theory a company can not only become “zero carbon”, but go beyond into a carbon negative position. The challenge with enabling technologies comes in the measurement of the savings. Because the products are utilized by customers, producers cannot be sure of the savings. Further the model is different and more complex from that for mitigating technologies, under which it is clear who ‘owns’ the CO2 emission savings. In the case of enabling technologies there are often many organizations involved in providing consumers with a new lower carbon alternative, while it is the same consumer who will actually realize the saving (the airline passenger, the car driver or the home owner). We believe that, while both important, given the vast difference in scale of savings between mitigating and enabling technologies, that enabling technologies must now become the focus of green capital as the most effective return on investment in CO2 emission terms. Much greater strides may be made in global CO2 emission reductions from enabling thousands, millions or billions of others to make efficiencies in emissions, than even by making significant savings at one, two or a handful of locations. What is a Green Company? 10 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. MITIGATING VERSUS ENABLING As an order of magnitude, AMG adding up those processes and products saves or enables to save about 8.5 million tons of annual CO2 emissions, of which only 58.000 tons or 6 % come from mitigating technologies (“end-of-the-pipe” in a wider sense {is this not “in pipe” as it is a technology change}). The biggest market for enabling technologies here seems to be aerospace, followed by automotive and then buildings. Some enabling technologies are being driven by regulation or targets. Most notably in the automotive sector, in the USA the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have set ever tightening standards for vehicle emissions. In 2009 their ruling set the following targets: mpg 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Passenger Cars 31.2 32.8 34 34.8 35.7 Light Trucks 25 26.4 27.8 28.2 28.6 Longer term proposed standards, set out in a 2010 ruling, take these to 40.3 41.0 mpg in 2021 and 48.7-49.7 mpg in 2025. In the European Union (“EU”) the targets are more stringent and nearer term 42 mpg in 2021 and 51 mpg 2021. Financially viable enabling technologies are clearly needed and needed quickly, to achieve the ambitious goals. The regulatory approach in aviation is different. The EU introduced its contentious EU Emissions trading System at the beginning of 2012. This system gives tradable CO2 emissions credits to operators for their flights. While still operable for flights inside the EU, the Union was forced to suspend it for international flights pending a global agreement which the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has agreed to implement by 2020. This will again be a market based mechanism. Early goals in the USA, set by the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) focused on a 12 % reduction in fuel burn by 2011 versus a 2000 baseline. By 2010 the industry had achieved 15.25 % reductions. The current Administration What is a Green Company? 11 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. goal is to achieve carbon neutral aviation industry growth by 2020. To reach this the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) project is targeting a 50% reduction in fuel burn for every subsonic flight mission (passenger and cargo) by 2020 (from a 2005 baseline) through a mix of technological and operational advances. Fuel taxes have gone to fund research initiatives include ‘NextGen’ engine technology, which feature AMG enabling technologies such as turbine blade coating technologies. CUMULATIVE EFFECTS Mitigating technologies are not scalable, we have said that, and more important, do not produce cumulative effects. The CO2 savings as a result of our ferrovanadium innovation are about 58.000 tons per year each year during the lifetime of the recycling plant. That is different with enabling technologies for more efficient cars, planes or buildings. The units installed in year one create the calculated savings in year one and repeat that in year two, three and so on. These savings then are cumulative with the savings of the units installed in year two and so on continuing over the lifetime of the vehicle models, aircraft or buildings. The growth stops only when the models are taken out of production or when the buildings stop to use the insulation material referred to earlier. This cumulative feature is very powerful. Consider the Ford F150 case. We have calculated the CO2 savings of 685.000 tons per year estimating an annual sale of 520.000 vehicles per year. Whether these are new additions to the overall global vehicle fleet, or they replace older less efficient models which are removed from the fleet, the net savings are the same. Those savings continue to be realized year on year over the life of the vehicle, and further savings come for each new more fuel efficient vehicle sold. Because of the cumulative effect that totals up in ten years to a cumulative CO2 saving of about 37.6 million tons, not of 5.2 million tons which would happen in the case of mitigating technology applications. HOW TO DEFINE A “GREEN” COMPANY What is a Green Company? 12 AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. The AMG definition of “green” reduces activities to their net CO2 savings profile. The next step is to quantify the company’s green profile. AMG proposes this can be done by plotting qualifying sales (QS), sales which are associated with enabling technologies leading to global CO2 emissions reductions (i.e. sales associated with TCO2R below), as a percentage of total sales (TS) against the net CO2 reduction multiplier – defined as total CO2 reduction enabled (TCO2R)/ total CO2 emissions (TCO2E). Where: QS – Qualifying Sales TS – Total Sales CO2R – CO2 Reduction Enabled CO2E CO2 Emissions The next challenge is how to set a minimum threshold on both scales where “green” companies come to reside. This has to be debated, an exercise which promises to be lively. Once defined, the green space would attract companies, especially if investors accept our framework for redefining “green” or a variation of it. In that case capital allocations would be incentivized to go “green” especially if the global investor community would declare a preference to finance “green” capital spending as defined.
