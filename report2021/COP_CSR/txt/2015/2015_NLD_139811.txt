To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a micro fair value hedge for fixed rate plain vanilla funding and corresponding hedging transactions. Cash flow hedges NIBC has classified a large part of its corporate loans as loans and receivable at amortised cost. Therefore, The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap rates for variability in the cash flows of the floating rate corporate loans is accounted for in future periods, when the periods longer than one year) for the currency in question. coupons are recorded in the income statement on an amortised cost basis. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the floating cash flows of its floating corporate loans. These swaps are reported at fair value through The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these profit or loss. This accounting mismatch creates volatility in the income statement of NIBC. Therefore NIBC relationships at 31 December 2014 was EUR 45 million debit (2013: EUR 48 million debit). The gains on the applies hedge accounting on these positions. Hedge accounting is applied to all swaps that are used to hedge hedging instruments were EUR 21 million (2013: loss of EUR 42 million). The losses on the hedged items the cash flow risk of the floating corporate loans by defining a macro cash flow hedge relationship with the attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 20 million (2013: gain of EUR 41 million). Differences between the floating corporate loans. results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by hedge ineffectiveness. The variability in interest cash flows arising on floating rate corporate loans is hedged on a portfolio basis with Portfolio fair value hedge of loans interest rate swaps that receive fixed and pay floating (generally one, three and six months floating rates). According to NIBC’s hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its corporate loan The highly probable cash flows being hedged relate both to the highly probable cash flows on outstanding activities above certain limits as set by ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair corporate loans and to the future reinvestment of these cash flows. NIBC does not hedge the variability of value interest rate risk arising from these fixed rate loans. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has future cash flows of corporate loans arising from changes in credit spreads. 136 Annual Report 2014 NIBC Bank N.V. 137 Notes to Consolidated financial statements New hedging relationships were started in 2014.

These incorporate NIBC’s interpretation of valuation assumptions (qualitative) that a market participant would consider when valuing the instruments. Debt investments level 2 For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2014, NIBC applied market-observable prices (including Financial assets available-for-sale broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-observable data. NIBC has determined fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and continuity of valuations. Equity investments (unlisted) level 3 The fair value of investments in equity funds is determined based on the net asset value reported by the Residential mortgages (own book and securitised) level 3 managers of these funds. These net asset values are analysed for reasonableness, so as to ascertain that the NIBC determines the fair value of residential mortgages (both those NIBC holds on its own book and reported net asset value has been appropriately derived using proper fair value principles as part of a robust those NIBC has securitised) by using a valuation model developed by NIBC. To calculate the fair value, NIBC process. To approximate the fair value at the reporting date, the net asset value is adjusted, where appropriate, discounts expected cash flows (after expected prepayments) to present value using inter-bank zero-coupon for factors such as, subsequent capital contributions and fund distributions, movements in exchange rate and rates, adjusted for a spread that principally takes into account the credit spread risk of the mortgages and subsequent changes in the fair value of the underlying investee companies, where these are known to NIBC. uncertainty relating to prepayment estimates. The fair value of equity investments is established by applying capitalisation multiples to maintainable earnings. The RMBS spread is determined by collecting RMBS spreads from publicly issued Dutch RMBS-transactions. Maintainable earnings are estimated based on the normalised last twelve months’ Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, The discount spread is derived by adding related RMBS costs to the RMBS spread. Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA). Capitalisation multiples are derived from the enterprise value and the normalised last twelve months EBITDA at the acquisition date.

Equity investments (including investments in associates) level 3 For the valuation method, reference is made to the section on equity investments (unlisted) at available-for-sale. The resulting enterprise value is adjusted for net debt, non-controlling interests, illiquidity and management incentive plans to arrive at the fair value of the equity. Derivatives financial assets and liabilities (held for trading and used for hedging) level 2 Derivative products valued using a valuation technique with market-observable inputs are mainly interest Debt investments level 2 rate swaps, currency swaps, credit default swaps and foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2014, NIBC used market-observable prices (including valuation techniques include swap models using present value calculations. The models incorporate various broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-verifiable data. NIBC has determined inputs including foreign exchange rates, credit spread levels and interest rate curves. Credit derivative valuation the fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and continuity of valuations. models also require input as to the estimated probability of default and recovery value. Debt investments level 3 For the level 3 debt investments, NIBC uses valuation models that apply discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates both observable and unobservable data. Observable inputs include interest rates and collateral values; unobservable inputs include assumptions regarding credit spreads and market liquidity discounts. 158 Annual Report 2014 NIBC Bank N.V. 159 Notes to Consolidated financial statements Transfers between levels 1 and 2 Level 3 fair value measurements In 2014 and 2013 there were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2.

A default is indicated by using a 9 or 10 rating in NIBC’s internal rating scale. A default is considered to have occurred with respect to a particular obligor when either or both of the two following events have taken place: i) the bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the banking group in full, without recourse by the bank to actions such as realising security (if held); ii) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the banking group. 186 Annual Report 2014 NIBC Bank N.V. 187 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 55-4 Drawn and undrawn corporate loan exposure per CCR rating 55-5 Drawn and undrawn non-defaulted corporate loan exposure per LGD rating 2014 Drawn 2014 Undrawn 2013 Drawn 2013 Undrawn 2014 Drawn 2014 Undrawn 2013 Drawn 2013 Undrawn 1-3 (AAA / AA/A) A-1+(2,5%) 2014 4 (BBB) A-2+(7,5%) 2014 2014 5 (BB) B-1(12,5%) 2014 2014 2014 6 (B) B-2(18%) 2014 2014 7 (CCC) B-3(25%) 2014 2014 8 (CC / C) C-1 (33%) 2014 2014 9-10 (D) 2014 C-2 (42,5%) NR D (55%) IN % 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 E (70%) F (90%) Collateral and LGD NIBC’s internal LGD scale consists of 7 grades (A-F) and 10 notches, each of which represents a different NR degree of recovery prospects and loss expectations.

The calculation of PD, LGD and EAD is performed by an internally-developed CRR/CRD IV AIRB model. An indicator for potential losses, taking into account indexation of house prices and seasoning, is achieved by calculating the Loan-to-Indexed-Market-Value (LTIMV). The indexation is made by using the CBS/Kadaster The PD estimates are dependent on a variety of factors, of which the key factors are debt-to-income and index, which is based on market observables. The Kadaster (national property register) is a public government loan-to-value ratios. Minor factors that play a role in the PD estimates are several other mortgage loan register of real estate and their vested rights (e.g. ownership and mortgages). This register contains transaction characteristics, borrower characteristics and payment performance information. The PD scale is based on data as well as CBS (Statistics Netherlands) data, which are used to construct a pricing index. Graphs 55-22 a continuous scale ranging from 0-100%. and 55-23 show a breakdown of the LTIMV for the total Dutch Residential Mortgage portfolio at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013.

In consequence, the visible interest rate risk in the Corporate Treasury book, and hence in the Banking cross-currency spread risk and interest rate spread risk between positions in swaps and bond futures are also book, increased significantly. NIBC decided not to hedge all this interest rate risk at once, but applied a policy taken into account in the VaR. The increase in VaR in 2014 compared to 2013 does not represent an increased to hedge this interest rate risk gradually. At year-end 2014, nearly all the interest rate risk in the on-demand risk appetite but is rather coincidental as the management of the Trading desk identified more opportunities in savings had been hedged. The current interest rate sensitivity in the banking book is almost entirely related to 2014. the sensitivity of the AC mortgage book, due in part to a different hedging strategy and in part to the mortgages in the pipeline, which are already hedged. Interest rate risk in the Mismatch book NIBC concentrates the strategic interest rate risk position of NIBC in the Mismatch book. This book Tables 56-3 and 56-4 illustrate in EUR the interest rate sensitivity for EUR, USD and GBP in the Trading, exclusively contains swap positions with which a view on future interest rate developments is taken. In 2013 Mismatch and Banking books at year-end 2013 and 2014. For other currencies, the interest rate risk is minimal. NIBC opened a new mismatch position in GBP. Subsequently, new EUR and USD mismatch positions were opened in 2014, while the GBP mismatch has been enlarged. 210 Annual Report 2014 NIBC Bank N.V. 211 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 56-3 Interest rate statistics, 31 December 2014 Assumptions BPV One of the stress scenarios, the market-wide stress test, assumes a world-wide liquidity shortage in which IN EUR THOUSANDS Trading Mismatch Banking Total no new market funding can be attracted by NIBC.

Maintaining a sound liquidity and funding profile is one of NIBC’s most important risk management objectives. NIBC analyses its funding profile by mapping all assets and liabilities into time buckets that correspond to their maturities. Based on projections prepared by the business units and reviewed by Risk Management, and the current asset and liability maturity profiles, several liquidity stress tests are prepared and presented once every two weeks to the ALCO, in order to create continuous monitoring of the liquidity position. 212 Annual Report 2014 NIBC Bank N.V. 213 Notes to consolidated financial statements 57-1 Liquidity maturity calendar, 31 December 2014 57-2 Liquidity maturity calendar, 31 December 2013 Due Due Due between Due Due between Due Payable within three and between Payable within three and between Not on three twelve one and Due after Not on three twelve one and Due after IN EUR MILLIONS dated demand months months five years five years Total IN EUR MILLIONS dated demand months months five years five years Total LIABILITIES (UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITIES (UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS) CASH FLOWS) FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT AMORTISED COST AMORTISED COST Due to other banks 27 655 2 248 227 1,159 Due to other banks 8 272 110 394 233 1,017 Deposits from customers 4,667 1,161 1,354 2,345 655 10,182 Deposits from customers 4,857 584 829 1,823 546 8,639 Own debt securities in issue 5 28 1,411 620 2,064 Own debt securities in issue 1 1,730 766 611 3,108 Debt securities in issue related to 18 20 24 3,286 3,348 Debt securities in issue related to 5 16 3,504 3,525 securitised mortgages securitised mortgages FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS (INCLUDING TRADING) LOSS (INCLUDING TRADING) Own debt securities in issue 30 30 Own debt securities in issue 5 29 34 Debt securities in issue structured 7 40 139 608 794 Debt securities in issue structured 4 43 246 572 865 OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Other liabilities 161 161 Other liabilities 137 137 Current tax Current tax 8 8 Deferred tax Deferred tax Employee benefits 4 4 Employee benefits 16 16 SUBORDINATED LIABILITIES SUBORDINATED LIABILITIES Amortised cost 3 64 67 Amortised cost 1 56 57 Fair value through profit or loss 17 359 376 Fair value through profit or loss 20 18 329 367 TOTAL LIABILITIES TOTAL LIABILITIES 4,694 1,846 1,605 4,187 5,853 18,185 4,865 886 2,862 3,264 5,896 17,773 (excluding derivatives) (excluding derivatives) Estimated contractual interest cash flows 60 158 653 2,104 2,975 Estimated contractual interest cash flows 32 319 878 2,769 3,998 TOTAL LIABILITIES TOTAL LIABILITIES (excluding derivatives, including (excluding derivatives, including 4,694 1,906 1,763 4,840 7,957 21,160 4,865 918 3,181 4,142 8,665 21,771 estimated contractual interest estimated contractual interest rate cash flows) rate cash flows) TOTAL ASSETS RELEVANT FOR TOTAL ASSETS RELEVANT FOR MANAGING LIQUIDITY RISK AT MANAGING LIQUIDITY RISK AT 2,028 1,122 407 970 4,230 11,490 20,247 1,619 1,570 688 1,070 3,967 10,557 19,471 FAIR VALUE (excluding derivatives FAIR VALUE (excluding derivatives and interest cash flows) and interest cash flows) 214 Annual Report 2014 NIBC Bank N.V. 215 Notes to consolidated financial statements Liquidity maturity calendar derivatives Liquidity maturity calendar off-balance sheet The following tables present the derivative financial instruments that will be settled on a net basis into The following table shows the contractual maturity of NIBC’s contingent liabilities and commitments. relevant maturity classes based on the contractual maturity date at 31 December 2014 and 2013.

If the business various approaches, each with a different level of sophistication in risk management, ranging from ‘standardised’ model of an activity is trading, distribution or investing for a limited period, a market risk approach based upon to ‘advanced’. VaR and scaled to a one-year horizon is used to calculate the EC usage. A business model based on ‘buy-to-hold’ or investing to maturity leads to a credit risk approach being applied, based upon estimations of For credit risk, NIBC adopted the AIRB approach as further specified in CRR/CRDIV for its corporate, retail PD and LGD. Add-ons for operational risk and country risk are also calculated. Furthermore, NIBC allocates and institutional exposure classes. NIBC started using the AIRB approach at 1 January 2008. A small residue of EC for business risk, reputation risk and model risk on a group-wide level. exposures is measured on the standardised approach. The EC approach differs from the CRR/CRDIV approach in which only the trading books are assigned a For market risk, NIBC adopted an internal model VaR approach. market risk approach. In the CRR/CRDIV framework, activities that are not trading but have a business model based on distribution or investment for a limited period are often assigned a credit risk approach, following For measuring operational risk, NIBC adopted the standardised approach, which is based on prescribed CRR/CRDIV regulations or regulatory industry practice, whereas in the EC framework NIBC applies a market business-line activities. risk approach similar to that of the trading activities. Risks and EC are monitored accordingly.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the managing board is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the managing board should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the managing board either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The managing board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process. Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high but not absolute level of assurance which makes it possible that we did not detect all frauds or errors. A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes Appendix to our auditor’s report on the financial statements public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the 2014 of NIBC Bank N.V. matter is in the public interest. In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves. The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Our audit consisted, among others of: • Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control. • Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. • Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the managing board. • Concluding on the appropriateness of ’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the Page 9 of 10 Page 10 of 10 260 Annual Report 2014 NIBC Bank N.V. 261 OTHER INFORMATION Profit appropriation Contact information Our website, www.nibc.com, offers a wide range of information about NIBC, financial information, corporate information, corporate calendar, press releases and sustainability information.
