Our Human Resources department has revised our company’s policies and procedures which are consistent with Canadian best practices. To ensure that we are constantly improving on our commitments to the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, HyperActive is continuously reviewing and revising our internal and external policies. We are committed to respecting the values, the fundamental human rights, and the dignity of each individual as we celebrate the diversity of our employees. It is imperative that our employees are treated fairly and equitably. We hold high standards of health and safety for our employees. HyperActive ensures that employment decisions, including hiring, promotion, compensation, and tenure are founded on equal treatment and fairness, and are not influenced by, or based in any way upon race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, age, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, and any other classification protected by law. HyperActive recognizes the importance of not-for-profit organizations. In the upcoming year, our company will look into supporting some of these organizations. We encourage our employees to contribute to charities. Whether it would be volunteering as a company, or as an individual effort, we believe that taking part in our communities is an important value to embrace.

The Human Resources Department has also developed policies related to harassment-free workplace and equal opportunity employment. We have developed an entire corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics that addresses human rights issues, responsibilities, and expectations for our employees as they relates to human rights. As a growing business, we recognize the value of dedicating assets toward development of strong corporate policies, procedures, and values in this area, and we are proud of the work we have accomplished in this fiscal year to support the Human Rights principles.

Our written policies clearly state employee rights and responsibilities, as well as fair employment practices regarding non-discrimination and compensation. Employees who have a concern involving potential discrimination or harassment are encouraged to speak with our Human Resources department. Any and all complaints of discriminatory behaviour will be investigated promptly, in a fair and discreet manner to ensure confidentiality to the fullest extent possible. Our values and support for the Global Compact Labour principles apply to every employee. As well, this requires our business partners, suppliers, third party employees who include contractors or anyone else representing or acting on behalf of HyperActive to abide by this policy in connection with their work with us. Given that HyperActive is a fairly new business, the risks associated with labour rights are limited due to the low turn-over rate of our company. We have not done a large amount of hiring; therefore, our exposure to potential labour violations are still minimal. Forced labour and child labour are strictly prohibited in every area where we work. Our goals in regards to furthering our commitment to Labour Rights and the associated UNGC principles include further formalizing of our training programs for both new and existing employees. IMPLEMENTATION Our Human Resources department’s “Open Door Policy” regarding labour rights, violations, questions or concerns of our employees has been implemented to ensure that all trepidations regarding this matter receive the proper attention needed. HyperActive provides training and discussions for employees on Canada’s Labour Rights. Our policies and procedures supporting Labour Rights are constantly being monitored for changes and updates.

We understand the impact we have on our environment and recognize that natural resources are finite. We, as a company, collectively strive to create a positive impact in our environment. To reduce our carbon footprint, we’ve taken the following steps when possible:  We recycle all our recyclable waste. (bottles, shredded paper, cardboard, etc.)  We conserve electricity, heat and water where feasible. (turning off the heat/air conditioning when the office is closed for the night)  We work remotely as often as we can without sacrificing productivity and partnership. (Conducting conference calls and online meetings with out of town clients when it is not necessary to travel for an in-person meeting)  We participate in the Canon/Epson Cartridge Collection Program  We only use paper that is 100% recycled and FSC approved  Use a tap water filtration system rather than bottled water  We provide reusable dishes and cutlery instead of paper plates and plastic cutlery  We use biodegradable soap and cleaning supplies that come from recycled products Our environmental written policy includes all of the above, as well as the purchasing of recycled and post-consumer products from sustainable vendors and suppliers. All employees are well educated and understand this policy as we actively seek new ways to reduce our carbon footprint. For the upcoming year, we will continue to make every effort to abide by our Environmental Policy. We will carry on to set an example as an environmentally conscious company, and will encourage our employees to be similarly minded. HyperActive commits to reducing our paper use and aims to lessen the overall environmental impact of our paper consumption.

ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS HyperActive performs business in different parts of the world in which, given the different cultures in each of the countries we operate, our employees have and will continue to encounter varying interpretations of business protocol. Because a gesture could be considered typical etiquette in one country and bribery in another, HyperActive is proactive in training our employees to follow the most conservative definitions of extortion and bribery. We provide our employees with ample training to prepare them for any instance of corruption they may encounter, and implement precautions to ensure that not only Canadian laws are followed, but laws in countries we operate in are also adhered to. HyperActive has a zero tolerance policy for corruption, bribery and extortion which is clearly stated in our corporate code of conduct. This policy has been enacted and communicated to all staff. HyperActive supports the Anti-Corruption and the Global Development Agenda which is an appeal by the private sector urging governments to promote efficient and effective anti-corruption measures and to implement robust policies that will foster good governance. In the coming year, HyperActive will aim to implement and enforce the UNGC’s Global Development Agenda into our own policies. IMPLEMENTATION HyperActive has a Human Resources “Open Door Policy” regarding anti-corruption; violations, questions or concerns of our employees are dealt with swiftly. Our Human Resources Department and executives provide company-wide protocols to assist employees in handling any incidents of corruption in the workforce. HyperActive’s executives are conducting a review of anti-corruption training and goals for the next year. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES HyperActive executives provide company-wide information about how each member of the organization deals with incidents and violations of anti-corruption principles. We continue to make progress in the area of anti-corruption, by remaining current on governmental and provincial regulations, as well as reviewing internal policies and comparing them against domestic and global industry standards.
