With this communication, we express our intent to advance those principles within our sphere of influence. We are committed to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. The South African Post Office will make a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on progress (COP) that describes our company’s effort to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress within one year of joining the Global Compact, and annually thereafter according to the Global Compact policy. Sincerely yours …………………………………….. Mr. Twiggs Xiphu Group Executive South African Post Office SOC Limited Registration No 1991/005477/06 FSP No. 43462 · 1
