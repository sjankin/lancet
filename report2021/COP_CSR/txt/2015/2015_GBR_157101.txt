United Nations Global Compact Statement of Support July 2015 Royal Mail Group is committed to making a positive contribution to the communities that we serve. We connect millions of customers, businesses, organisations and communities, including those in the most remote rural areas. Our vision is to be recognised as the best delivery company in the UK and across Europe. We believe that this holds the key to building sustainable value for our shareholders, and we know it cannot be achieved without a responsible focus on our relationships with our customers, our people, our communities, our suppliers and our environment. We aim to be a leader in responsible business. Royal Mail Group has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2005 and we continue to support its principles. We employ robust governance and management processes to drive our corporate responsibility performance. We commit to a high standard of external disclosure of our performance and use the Global Reporting Initiative Index to achieve this. Finally, we commit to measuring our performance against peers using leading global corporate responsibility and sustainability benchmarks. Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report meets our United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress requirements. Moya Greene Chief Executive Officer, Royal Mail Group
