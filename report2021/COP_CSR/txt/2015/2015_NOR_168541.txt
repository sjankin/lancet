UN GlobalCompact Communication on progress Petroleum Geo Services ASA September 2015 Statement of continued support September 7't,201-5 To our stakeholders, I am pleased to confirm that PGS reaffirms its support to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. ln this annual Communication on Progress, we refer to our Corporate Responsibilitv report 2014. We have aligned our CR (Corporate Responsibility) reporting process with the annual financial reporting structure, which means that this CR report is summarizing activities and key figures from the year 20t4. We would also like to add the CR information of the PGS website (http://www.pss.com/Aboutus/Corporate-Responsibilitv/Letter-from-CEO/) as part of the COP reporting, as this information provides an overview of how PGS defines CR work, and what topics we include under our CR umbrella. The CR report 20L4 and the CR web pases will together form this year's COP report, as they supplement each other. We commit to share this information with stakeholders through our primary communication channels, and this is done as part of the overall annual reporting communication.
