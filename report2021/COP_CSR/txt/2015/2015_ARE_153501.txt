Established in 2004, with Headquarter offices in Dubai, Washington DC and Nairobi serving clients across 25 countries in Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East CTG’s supports humanitarian aid and development agencies, governments and commercial organisations working within challenging austere environments and emerging markets. CTG supports clients with innovative solutions focused on a range of specialised human resources activities and field operational management in countries experiencing or emerging from natural disasters, or acute social and economic crisis worldwide. 2 STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT CTG Global has written a statement of continued support to our stakeholders. See Annex A. 3 HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 3.1 Assessment Policy and Goals CTG is committed to protecting and respecting human rights of our employees, the people we work with and the communities in which we work. CTG fully supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and declares all its articles in our Compliance and Ethics Sustainability Programme. 3.2 Implementation Our Compliance and Ethics Sustainability Programme encompasses our framework for conducting business with integrity, including but not limited to ensuring that all staff, suppliers and partners work in accordance with the highest ethical standards and treat employees and contractors fairly and with dignity. We engage with our staff to make sure that they are aware of the standards expectations and commitments in relation to our responsibility to respect human rights in our own operations. To ensure that all staff have been trained, understand and agree to comply with our Compliance and Ethics Sustainability Programme each staff signs a declaration attesting to such. CTG has run workshops in our field offices and HQ. CTG’s Good Governance Committee is accountable for overseeing the compliance performance across CTG. The Good Governance Committee’s objective is to promote operational excellence throughout the entire organisation. CTG Global Communication on Progress 2014-2015 3 Staff are provided with contact information and processes to follow in the event of a grievance. CTG has a non-retaliation policy against whistle blowers and has a confidential and impartial Good Governance Hotline with a dedicated email address. This information is detailed in CTG's staff handbook which also clearly defines CTG's fair disciplinary process. Due diligence is conducted on all suppliers, subcontractors and corporate clients to ensure their ethical standards are in line with CTG's and the UNGC's guiding principles. 3.3 Measures and Outcomes The Good Governance Committee meets quarterly to review, monitor and maintain an internal control framework and Human Rights policies. In formulating CTG’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for UN Contracts and our Compliance and Ethics Sustainability Programme we consulted World Monitors Inc. (WMI).WMI provides expertise to multinational companies seeking to align their business practices with international human rights and environmental standards and include the UNGC amongst the many companies it has provided advise on corporate social responsibility and human rights issues to. In December 2014 CTG signed the Business for Peace (B4P) Statement of Support confirming our adherence to the UNGC's Human Rights principles. As a signatory we advance B4P’s HR principles in our field of operations. As an example, the nature of CTG’s work in a country such as Gaza, supports advancement of reinstating Human Rights practices back into a local community. 4 LABOR PRINCIPLES Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory Labor; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child Labor; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 4.1 Assessment Policy and Goals CTG, as a substantial employer of international and national staff across the globe strives to exceed Labor laws in all areas of operation and we ensure all staff salaries are equal to or above the national minimum wage. CTG offers equal employment opportunities and encourages staff to promote and practice tolerance, understanding and respect for all, without distinction as to race, gender, religion, colour, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, age, physical disability or political conviction. Diversity and a harmonious working environment is key to ensuring successful implementation of the many humanitarian projects with which we are involved. All staff are encouraged to foster a climate of impartiality, fairness and objectivity and to work towards the creation of a work environment that is sensitive to the needs of all. We ensure that our recruitment processes are ethical and transparent. Staff are trained and adhere to our recruitment policy towards fair and ethical Labor standards, including the abolishment of child Labor and the discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. CTG upholds the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining for all staff. CTG Global Communication on Progress 2014-2015 4 All staff are required to adhere to our Health and Duty of Care policy and Safety/Security standard operating procedures. 4.2 Implementation In 2014 CTG carried out an in depth, periodic review of its recruitment and personnel management policies to ensure that they continue to be compliant with the UNGC Labor principles and other UN guidelines including but not limited to Standards of conduct required of UN civil servants, except where such standards may be inconsistent with the staff members’ status. Additionally, CTG staff shall comply fully with the UN Secretary-General’s Bulletin of 9 October 2003 entitled “Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse” (ST/SGB/2003/13) and the Secretary-General’s Bulletin of 18 June 2002 entitled Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission (ST/SGB/2002/9). Furthermore, the UNOPS Policy on prevention of harassment, sexual harassment, and abuse of authority will apply to CTG staff. All of our recruitment practices are aligned to the following five key principles with an emphasis on competition, objectivity, diversity, transparency and accountability: • Recruiting excellence Commitment to hire people objectively with the highest relevant technical and behavioural competencies • Sourcing talent for today and tomorrow Bearing in mind both the short and long term needs of our clients and being accountable for our recruitment selections • Getting the right people in the right place at the right time Ensure proactive and timely candidate recruitment utilising a competitive blended sourcing approach • Encouraging and valuing diversity From sourcing to hiring, appreciating differences • Recruiting ethically Ensuring clear transparent and fair recruitment processes In all countries where CTG operates we actively promote the nationalisation of positions wherever possible and offer training to staff to aid progression. CTG strives to exceed local national standards with regards to sick and annual leave. Suppliers and corporate clients are informed of CTG’s zero tolerance policy in respect to any breach of our code of conduct, or ethical standards including breaches related to child Labor practices, human trafficking, debt bondage, serfdom, child slavery, use of children in armed services and child prostitution. Any staff who feels aggrieved has the right to contact the Good Governance Committee without fear of retaliation. Dependent on the grievance a formal or informal investigation will be initiated and actions will be taken according to our established procedure. Our grievance process adopts a right to appeal. CTG Global Communication on Progress 2014-2015 5 4.3 Measures and Outcomes • Because of the fair and ethical Labor practices that CTG adopts CTG has a multinational work force consisting of over 30% female through all levels of management covering a wide range of ethnic diversity.

Staff adherence with our Environmental policy is mandatory. CTG Global Communication on Progress 2014-2015 6 5.2 Implementation CTG are committed to reducing our corporate environmental footprint and these are some of the ways in which we do that: CTG has implemented a fuel initiative incentive program which presents a modest financial reward to drivers with the lowest fuel consumption per duty station on a monthly basis. CTG use environmentally friendly suppliers where possible, for example we use local 100% ‘green’ Print Central printers for our marketing materials who are Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Empowering Sustainable and Ethical Supply Chains (Sedex) certified. CTG aims to be a paperless office where possible by encouraging staff to only print only when necessary. We encourage and use paperless invoicing where possible. The brand of paper we use to print is from Khan-na (the farmer’s unused land between rice paddies) where fast growing trees are farmed, this reduces the logging of natural rainforests. Back to back and black and white printing/photocopying is a default setting and recycling of waste paper facilities are provided. CTG encourage all corporate mail receivers not to print unless necessary and save the environment using a strapline in our email signatures. CTG use DEWA for HQ office utility suppliers and advertise their tips to conserve electricity and water in the office environment http://www.dewa.gov.ae/community/conservation/conservedefault.aspx . We also encourage switching off of equipment when not in use to conserve energy. To limit our carbon footprint CTG’s preferred business airline travel is with Emirates who believe in the ‘emitter pays principle’ and as the aircraft operator are responsible for minimizing emissions and do so in a variety of ways http://www.emirates.com/ae/english/environment/environment.aspx CTG refrain from travel where possible and use video conferencing to meet with staff and clients in different offices. 5.3 Measures and Outcomes The fuel initiative has successfully reduced our client’s monthly fuel expenditure by 8%. This initiative has also enabled our project staff to identify employees with poor performance and take disciplinary measures accordingly. CTG are always open to new and emerging eco efficient technologies, suppliers and methods to reduce our impact on the environment. Staff have visual reminders to reduce, reuse and recycle in the office environment. Each office has a ‘Green Champion’ to implement the Company’s Environmental policy and to encourage and motivate staff to adhere to it.
