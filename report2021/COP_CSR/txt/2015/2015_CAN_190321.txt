2014 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Agrium 2014 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Statement of Continued Support Agrium became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact in April 2008. This global network is an ideal avenue for sharing and learning about best practices, and for continuing to engage in open dialogue with our stakeholders. Our participation in the United Nations Global Compact clearly demonstrates to our employees, communities, suppliers, customers, and to the public, our deep commitment to continually improving our human rights, labour, environmental, and anti-corruption performance. We remain committed to the ten principles of the Global Compact and to the organization itself. The following table includes descriptions of Agrium’s commitment, systems, activities and outcomes that address the ten Global Compact principles. Chuck Magro President and CEO Agrium 2014 Communication on Progress Actions and Outcomes Commitment Actions and Outcomes and Systems As part of Agrium’s participation in the United Nations Global Compact, we have made the following human rights commitments: Human Rights Principles • We will not take part in human rights abuse, and will not engage or be complicit in any activity that solicits or encourages human rights abuse. Principle 1: • In providing for the protection of company personnel and assets by public or private security forces, we will promote respect for, and protection of, human rights. Businesses should support and respect the Policies and Codes of Conduct protection of internationally Although Agrium operates mostly in countries where there are numerous regulations addressing human proclaimed human rights. rights issues and there is low risk of human rights abuses, we take our role to “respect, protect and remedy” human rights seriously. Agrium's policies and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code) outline our Principle 2: employees' rights and obligations for building a respectful and discrimination-free workplace. Our Code is our means of management oversight for ensuring ethical behavior. Among other issues, it addresses: conflict Businesses should ensure of interest, fair dealings, gifts, legal compliance, and confidentiality. Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) that they are not policy also addresses human rights. complicit in human rights abuses. Agrium believes we can even further support human rights and sustainable development by working with our suppliers. In 2014, Agrium finalized a Supplier Code of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Conduct. The See Appendix 1 below: Code sets out requirements in terms of human rights and other CSR issues, and states clearly that suppliers “must not tolerate child, exploitative, forced or compulsory labour, or corporal punishment.” Additionally, • “Disclosure on suppliers are encouraged to: allocate appropriate resources to achieve compliance with this Code, offer Management related employee training, develop related management systems, including procedures and assessments and Approach: Employee communicate the requirements of this Code through their supply chain among others. Practices” • “Disclosure on As part of the Supplier Code processes, Agrium has a due diligence program developed to evaluate potential Management suppliers for the issues outlined in its Supplier Code of Conduct. This process is conducted internally and, Approach: Society” where appropriate, externally. Because Agrium does not have operations in countries where risks of slavery, human trafficking, forced, compulsory or child labour in a commercial setting are high, Agrium uses a riskbased approach developed by an external provider and internal experts to identify those suppliers that Agrium 2014 Communication on Progress Page 1 Commitment Actions and Outcomes and Systems warrant more detailed reviews. Agrium is interested in operating in developing nations, not only to expand our markets, but also to help provide the essential building blocks for economic development. We believe that the ability to produce safe and abundant food is fundamental to reducing poverty, advancing education and stabilizing economies. In deciding if we should enter a specific developing nation, we conduct an assessment that looks at risks related to corruption, economic sanctions, land disputes, or a poor record on human and indigenous rights, among other considerations. Once we decide to enter a country, we also make commitments to apply our companywide policies (often exceeding national regulations), source supplies and employees locally as much as possible, and invest in the communities where we operate. Training All employees, including management, are trained on Agrium’s Code of Conduct and strategic risks on an annual basis. The standard Code of Conduct training for Agrium includes certifications of past and future compliance with the Code. Refresher training in these areas is mandatory for all Agrium employees in modules that highlight different aspects of our Code each year. In our sustainability report, we annually disclose the number of employees that received training related to the Code, anti-corruption and competition law each year (see Principle 10). For those employees working in high risk supply chain management roles, employees are educated about risks identified through our supply chain due diligence that may include human rights abuses including slavery, child labour or any other risk discovered. Compliance Hotline Agrium maintains an employee Compliance Hotline to respond to human rights and ethics related concerns. Accessible throughout the world in 11 languages, the Hotline is available for reporting any violations or suspected violations of our Code, other Agrium policies, or any other illegal or unethical behavior. Agrium has a non-retaliation policy designed to enable employees to raise good faith issues in a safe environment without fear of retaliation. The Hotline also promises anonymity where legally permissible. Agrium employees are encouraged to report to their supervisors, any member of senior management, or to the anonymous Hotline, any violations of our company’s Code. All calls to the Hotline or to the Legal Compliance Department are taken seriously. High risk matters are managed and handled by the Legal Compliance Department. Lower risk matters are handled by relevant departments (e.g., EHS&S and HR). For those matters that are substantiated, discipline is determined on a Agrium 2014 Communication on Progress Page 2 Commitment Actions and Outcomes and Systems case-by-case basis, but can include punishment up to and including termination. Our Legal Compliance department reports quarterly on investigations to the Audit Committee of the Board. As reported in our 2014 Sustainability Performance Update, during 2014, our Legal Compliance department received a total of 36 calls, either through our Hotline or directly. All calls were investigated and appropriate action taken. We appreciate how employees are supporting the compliance program’s purpose and mission. The overall increase in calls from previous years is likely due to an increase in awareness and a change to the program in which we started including calls to the Compliance Department even if they were not made through the Hotline. The increase in calls related to equal opportunity is likely due to emphasis on this topic during our annual signing of the Code of Ethics training. For more details see the table below.

Our goal is inclusion on many levels: social (e.g., race, age, gender), values (e.g., personality, attitudes, culture), See Appendix 1 below: and information (e.g., knowledge, education, global experience). • “Disclosure on To support workplace diversity, Agrium formed the Agrium Women’s Leadership Group (AWLG) in 2004. The Management AWLG was established to provide mentoring, networking and development opportunities for women within Approach: Employee Agrium as a means to support efforts to attract and retain female employees at Agrium. The AWLG embraces Practices” a broad, inclusive vision to “Recognize, Develop and Enable Women’s Potential at Agrium”. The AWLG is open to any employee of the company and not only provides programs, mentoring and networking opportunities for women, it also helps participants define career paths, encourages flexible and creative solutions to business challenges. The AWLG inspires managers and leaders to demonstrate and support workplace diversity and equity. Agrium also works to attract and retain younger workers through training, mentorship, and career management programs. Key programs targeted towards inspiring young people include our internships and summer student programs, the Engineer-in-Training program, Marketers-in-Training, and a six-month agronomy program in partnership with Purdue University. For those in the trades, Agrium manages apprenticeship programs for instrumentation technicians, millwrights, steamfitters/pipefitters, heavy duty mechanics, industrial mechanics, and welders. Additionally, Agrium’s Young Professionals Network (YPN), for employees up to age 35, focuses on networking, business knowledge and community involvement to help Agrium's younger employees communicate and collaborate across different business units. 2012 was a baseline year for Agrium in determining our current diversity strength. In order to better understand diversity in business units and across the company, we are monitoring and tracking the diverse populations on the basis of turnover, internal moves, and hiring practices. In 2014, Agrium set a target that women comprise at least 15% of the entry level executives and executive officer roles of the Corporation, and similarly 15% of the senior manager roles by 2019. Agrium maintains an employee Compliance Hotline to respond to a variety of ethics concerns or inquiries. We require employees to annually undergo refresher training and acknowledge their compliance with the Code. For more details, please see Principles 1 and 2. Agrium 2014 Communication on Progress Page 5 Commitment Actions and Outcomes and Systems Supply Chain We do not operate in locations where there might be significant risk of incidents of forced, compulsory or child labour. However, we further support human rights and sustainable development by working with our suppliers. In 2014, Agrium finalized a Supplier Code of CSR Conduct and began conducting in-person audits of suppliers on a risk basis. These audits have and will continue to use external experts or internal experts based on risk and cover a wide range of human rights issues including child and forced labour. For more details, please see Principles 1 and 2. For outcomes, please see the Performance Tables in Appendix 2, specifically the Workplace Section. Environmental Agrium applies the precautionary approach to environmental challenges through our risk management Principles process, use of management systems and regularly engaging our stakeholders. This structure enables us to be an environmental steward on the farm and in our own operations. Principle 7: PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH Businesses should support a precautionary Enterprise Risk Management approach to environmental Evaluating and balancing risk is a vital, ongoing responsibility at Agrium. We address risk through a structured challenges. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process and team. We integrate the environment, health and safety of our employees and the public into this process and continually scrutinize our operations to identify potential Principle 8: risks and find ways to eliminate or mitigate them.

We work with regulators and industry experts to extract raw materials in a manner that will minimize long-term environmental impacts and enable reclamation of the land. In our production processes, we work with our employees and external experts to maximize energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and prioritize safety. We work with customers, carriers and government to continually improve the security and effectiveness of our distribution system. We work with researchers, industry associations, and growers to ensure our products are applied using best management practices to improve environmental, social and economic performance. ON THE FARM As a supplier of agricultural products and services with 1,450 retail facilities in North America, South America and Australia, our reach is extensive and global. A large portion of the environmental impacts related to fertilizers occurs at the farm where the products we manufacture and sell are applied. We take a twopronged approach to reduce negative impacts. First, we collaborate with others to promote the uptake of scalable frameworks that reduce nutrient runoff and air emissions, such as the 4R Nutrient Stewardship System and Nitrous Oxide Emission Reduction Protocol (NERP). And second, we use technology and a variety Agrium 2014 Communication on Progress Page 7 Commitment Actions and Outcomes and Systems of services to prevent environmental losses while optimizing grower returns. 4R Nutrient Stewardship System Nutrients are essential to life in proper quantities, but excess and unwise nutrient use can contribute to a variety of issues. Agrium is committed to reducing the impact of our products after they leave our hands. We are a key supporter in the development of the 4R Nutrient Stewardship System, which is a science-based framework that identifies best practices for producers who apply nutrients. Following the 4Rs—applying the right form of product at the right rate, right place and right time—minimizes nutrient losses to air and water, replenishes and protects soil quality, and can help minimize impacts on wildlife habitat. The 4R system helps to produce more food for growing populations, and provides growers with the economic returns required to support their families and to build communities. Agrium has been a major contributor to developing and implementing the 4R Nutrient Stewardship System. This framework has been adopted by the Canadian Fertilizer Institute in Canada, The Fertilizer Institute in the United States, the International Plant Nutrient Institute, the International Fertilizer Institute, and the association of Plant Food Control Officials. These associations are now working with researchers, governments and NGOs to establish educational programming, best practice research and measurement systems to support long-term global implementation. We are continually working with researchers and growers to develop best management practices (BMPs) that support the 4Rs. Our agronomists work with growers to identify the practices that best fit their soil, climate and farming operation. Ensuring unique and appropriate BMPs for each situation improves performance and grower adoption. Commonly used BMPs include: soil testing to optimize nutrient rate; controlled-release fertilizers or split applications to match nutrient availability with crop need; and, banding and buffer strips to keep nutrients in the right place. Agrium also looks beyond responsible fertilizer use on the farm. Excessive nutrient application at the farm level can eventually result in damage to water bodies and wildlife habitat. We direct significant community investments to programs that restore and protect wetlands, as they play an integral role in intercepting nutrients and improving water quality in downstream water bodies. Nitrous Oxide Emission Reduction Protocol The application of fertilizers generates greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous Agrium 2014 Communication on Progress Page 8 Commitment Actions and Outcomes and Systems oxide (N2O) at farms. N2O has a global warming potential of about 300 times more potent than CO2. However, GHGs from farming activities can be reduced through the use of BMPs. Agrium worked with stakeholders to develop the Nitrous Oxide Emissions Reduction Protocol (NERP), which defines the BMPs growers can use to reduce N2O emissions associated with nitrogen fertilizer applications on the farm. Based on the 4R Nutrient Stewardship System, this protocol helps to increase nutrient use efficiency and reduce nutrient losses to the environment. It also provides the foundation for generating GHG offsets that can further contribute to growers’ economic viability since a tonne of GHGs reduced on the farm can sold to offset a tonne produced elsewhere. Researchers estimate that implementation of the NERP could reduce field emissions of N2O by 15 to 25 percent, without reducing yields. Theoretically, if growers of Canada’s top five crops followed the protocol, it is estimated that this would result in an annual reduction of 2.7 to 4.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Additional research is being conducted to further quantify and improve the effectiveness of this protocol. The province of Alberta, Canada has adopted the NERP and many jurisdictions worldwide are now considering adoption. Products and Services Agrium works with researchers to grow more food through the use of new technologies like controlledrelease fertilizers. Controlled-release products time the release of nutrients to match the needs of the plant. The improved nutrient efficiency allows farmers to reduce the volume of fertilizer required. These products limit the number of required applications to the crop, saving energy and time, minimizing loss to the environment, and boosting yields. As a significant retailer of seed, we research, develop and market improved varieties with new traits that reduce the requirement for chemical inputs such as herbicides. Beyond selling high quality products to our customers, our retail outlets also provide services that help reduce environmental impacts. By analyzing yield, soil and plant tissue tests, and weather and crop scouting data, our agronomists and certified crop advisors are able to help growers make better decisions to optimize inputs to reduce nutrients lost to the environment, and overall costs. With advances in technology, we are moving toward customized production prescriptions. Because we also apply to our customers’ fields a significant portion of the crop inputs we sell, we are able to follow the BMPs we help to develop. For example, through the use of global positioning systems we are able to apply nutrients and crop protection Agrium 2014 Communication on Progress Page 9 Commitment Actions and Outcomes and Systems products more precisely to reduce drift and overall application rates. IN OUR OWN OPERATIONS Product stewardship, water management and climate change are the major concerns associated with Agrium’s operations, as identified by Agrium and our stakeholders. We are also focused on preventing environmental releases and events to minimize risk and potential exposure. Product Stewardship We enhanced our EHS&S Management System in 2010 with a detailed Product Stewardship Standard to ensure that we develop strong and compliant best practices relating to product development, quality control, purchasing, registration, labeling/product safety information and emerging regulatory issues. As the biggest retailer of crop inputs in the United States, we purchase numerous products from third-parties for resale at our outlets. Unlike our own products, we have less control over the quality of third-party products. One way to ensure product quality is to purchase and distribute crop protection products that are U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered. We have communicated our corporate responsibility values with our major suppliers and are working with them to understand and confirm their commitments to our standards. We perform analyses of third-party products to ensure compliance with stated specifications. Water Management We use water in the production and manufacturing of our products. Where possible, we work to recycle and reuse water, including at some of our locations where we use wastewater from municipal treatment plants as process cooling water. Some locations recycle water numerous times in a closed-loop system. Some cooling water, along with some surface runoff water, is collected in on-site ponds. We are working with the communities where we have operations to become more efficient in water use. We also work with provincial and local governments to develop new water use and discharge standards for the Industrial Heartland area, where our Redwater and Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta facilities are located. Agrium’s water use, defined as water intake minus surface water discharge, has remained constant yearover-year, with some variability due to precipitation and site operations. Water intensity is related to our Agrium 2014 Communication on Progress Page 10 Commitment Actions and Outcomes and Systems production; generally, as production increases, water intensity decreases. In 2014, a decrease in production resulted in a nine percent increase in water use intensity (per unit of production) compared to five years ago. Climate Change We generate GHGs and other air emissions, directly and indirectly, through the production, distribution and use of our products. Agrium’s internal GHG reduction strategy focuses on the nutrient production stage of our business (estimated to account for more than 95 percent of Agrium’s direct emissions), and includes energy efficiency improvements, N2O emission reductions, and CO2 capture for enhanced oil recovery. In 2014, we set a target to reduce our direct North American Wholesale GHG emission intensity (per tonne of net fertilizer produced) by 20 percent, from our 2005 baseline, by 2020. We have reduced our North American Wholesale GHG emission intensity by almost four percent since 2005. We are pleased to see this efficiency gain, but continue to look for further improvements to meet our reduction target. The basic science of the nitrogen fertilizer production process places inherent limitations on the extent of the reductions we can achieve. Our focus has been, and continues to be, in collaborating with others to create meaningful change through frameworks that reduce impacts at the farm level, such as 4R and NERP, described above. Our company-wide direct GHG emissions have increased in absolute volume and intensity since 2010. Agrium’s emissions intensity highly depends on the nature of our operations for a particular year, varying primarily on factors such as operating time, plant turnarounds, catalyst changes, the ratio of ammonia to urea production, and our actual production volumes. For 2014, our emissions intensity increased due to plant downtime, the production mix at three of our major facilities, and lower production overall. In 2014, we reduced absolute GHG emissions by: • Introducing a new catalyst at our North Bend, Ohio nitrogen operations that helped to reduce N2O emissions by more than 50 percent. • Capturing and selling CO2 emissions from our Borger, Texas operations for enhanced oil recovery. Our indirect GHG emissions (for example, from purchased electricity), on both an absolute and intensity Agrium 2014 Communication on Progress Page 11 Commitment Actions and Outcomes and Systems basis, have remained relatively level since 2010. Environmental Events The number of environmental events (including reportable quantity releases, non-compliance incidents, and enforcement actions) declined 46 percent between 2010 and 2014. The majority of these events are unplanned ammonia releases that exceeded regulated amounts. We continue to work to identify root causes of these events, from which we can implement effective corrective action to reduce recurrence of similar incidents. In 2014, we exceeded our environmental incident rate/event index target of 0.16, achieving a rate of 0.11. This is target is evaluated and updated annually. For additional outcomes, please see the Performance Tables in Appendix 2, specifically the Environment Section, and the Summary of Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Activities table on our website. Anti-Corruption Agrium operates in a wide range of jurisdictions globally. We work internally with employees and Principles contractors, and externally with our suppliers, to be vigilant and proactive in preventing corruption. Principle 10: Businesses Every year, during the signing of the Code, all Agrium employees receive training on ethics and complianceshould work against all related topics (see table below). In the past, we trained all employees on anti-corruption and competition forms of corruption, law every other year, with additional training provided to employees working on higher risk projects. We are including extortion and currently planning to begin a program to train all employees annually on both competition law and antibribery. corruption as part of our Code of Conduct.
