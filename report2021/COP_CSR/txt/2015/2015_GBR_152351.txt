As EI celebrates its 12 year anniversary, the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-corruption are more than ever at the forefront of the business. When the Company was established in 2003, we set out to build enduring business relationships based on trust, transparency and exceptional levels of service. Never resting on our laurels, this has not changed and we remain committed to improve upon every opportunity. The Global Compact and its ten principles are of particular significance to EI and the way that it conducts its business. These principles represent the moral foundations in which the organisation was formed and has always upheld as a matter of basic principle. Our organisation works in environments where instability in terms of governance, security and economic factors are present. Working within such challenging environments, our Company make every effort to operate as a force for good. This annual Communication on Progress provides a medium for Edinburgh International to express to its internal and external stakeholders that it is a responsible and ethical Company. Throughout EI’s development, we have been involved in a number of employment schemes aimed at supporting the basic principles and tenets of good Labour practices. These schemes have been a great success and a result EI has been officially recognized and given an award with a note of appreciation from the Joint Coordination Centre and the Oil and Gas Committee, Basra. In the area of Public Policy, one of EI’s Directors is on the Board of the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers, and has played a significate role in contributing towards the metrics which can be fairly applied and objectively monitored across the security services sector. Edinburgh International was one of the initial signatories of the Articles of Association of the ICoC. Now a Transitional Member, EI used the PSC1 standard to gain recognition and aims to raise and maintain standards within the security industry, particularly in the area of human rights. The Global Compact standards are highly valued by Edinburgh International. The Company, by electing to align with the Global Compact’s initiative and principles, has focused its attention to what is truly important in the way that it conducts its business and how it interacts with its employees and those communities in which it operates. Frank Philip MBE President Edinburgh International Communication on Progress 3 Human Rights ©Edinburgh International 2015 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and, Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. ASSESSMENT Edinburgh International (EI), through the virtue of its business model, predominantly works in fragile, weakly governed and often hostile states. Operating in such environments can be challenging to say the least. Nevertheless, EI maintains its obligation to humanity putting those fundamental rights at the forefront of what it does. Highlighting this, Human Rights training is one of the first pieces of training all Staff undertake upon joining the Figure 1 EI Staff conducting training Company, irrespective of which department they are part of and whether they are working operationally or in our Dubai or London offices. This is conducted so that all Staff understand EI’s stance on human rights and also what is expected of them in the conduct of their work. EI’s overarching Policy is our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (The Code), which states: “Edinburgh International respects the dignity of all human beings. When working overseas, the Company requires compliance with all international and domestic laws and other obligations regarding human rights. The laws and obligations respecting human rights include the following:”  Hague Convention IV (1907);  United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948);  Geneva Conventions (1949);  Convention Against Torture (1975);  Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions (1977);  U.S. Code Title 18, Part I, Chapter 113C Anti-Torture Statute (1994);  Chemical Weapons Convention (1993);  U.S. War Crimes Act of 1996; Communication on Progress 4 Human Rights ©Edinburgh International 2015  Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000;  Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000;  Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (2000);  Montreux Document on Private Military and Security Companies (2008);  International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers (2010);  US Uniform Code of Military Justice; and  Host country and local laws. EI also believes that it has responsibilities and commitments that extend beyond its statutory obligations to comply with applicable legislation. EI will be a force for good wherever it operates, so to that end, EI voluntarily and actively supports the following codes of practice:  International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers  UN Global Compact  Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, 2000  Code of Conduct of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, 1995  NSI/ASIS PSC.1-2012 Staff and third parties that act on behalf of Edinburgh International must follow and comply with applicable laws and Company policies, procedures, and controls at all times. The Company shall take firm and definitive action, as called for by existing protocols, laws, and regulations, if staff or third parties engage in unlawful activities. Failure to follow these laws and obligations can result in termination of employment, criminal prosecution, fines, and imprisonment. Therefore all Staff, contractors, subcontractors and business partners, are required to conform to the Code. Where possible, EI employs host country nationals, and therefore, the Code has been translated and is provided to all Staff in their native language. Continuous training and monitoring is conducted to ensure compliance and understanding of the Code. This training is recorded on the Company’s online Training and Knowledge System (TraKS). IMPLEMENTATION ETHICS HOTLINE EI operates an anonymous telephone and e mail Ethics Hotline which are monitored by a designated EI Ethics Officer. The voice mail system is automated and is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This service can be used by staff and or third parties (including clients) to report any suspected human rights violations committed by either EI Staff or its contractors. Information posters about this service are clearly displayed at all EI worksites, and have also been translated into Arabic, Farsi and Pashto. This initiative of translation will also soon be reflected on EI’s website. Communication on Progress 5 Human Rights ©Edinburgh International 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS TRAINING It is compulsory that all EI staff comply with Human Rights legislation. Ensuring all staff understand and are complaint with this, the Company offers compulsory courses online, in classrooms and also through practical lessons given at the place of deployment. This training and guidance is also provided in several languages. TRAKS EI records and monitors all its training, including human rights, via its unique Training and Knowledge System (TraKS). This is a market-leading system that enables all training, including human rights and anti-bribery, to be conducted in line with EI’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. Every member of EI Staff is on TraKS and it shows all the training which they have undertaken, as well as when and who conducted the training. TraKS also provides an audit feature that allows managers to see what training has been completed in all of EI’s programmes and projects around the world, and what has not. In this way, for example, a director in London can investigate what percentage of the personnel within a project in Iraq have conducted training in human rights, when they passed and when they are due for a refresher Figure 2 Image from a TraKS audit for an Ethics lesson course. This also allows for audit and due diligence to be conducted both by EI and our clients. TraKS was implemented at the end of 2011 across offices in London and Dubai. It was subsequently implemented in the operational areas of Afghanistan in 2012, Iraq in 2013 and Nigeria and Tanzania in 2014. MINIMUM WAGE EI remains committed to paying its Staff above the minimum wage in the countries in which it operates; whilst at the same time ensuring that it conducts its business in a responsible manner. EI pays above the minimum wage but ensures that it is not too far removed from other relevant government industries, e.g. the local police force, so as not to undermine their recruitment effort and/or create a false economy. PUBLIC POLICY PARTICIPATION Since 2010 EI has been a signatory of the International Code of Conduct (ICoC) for Private Security Service Providers. ICoC is a set of principles created through a multi-stakeholder initiative convened by the Swiss government and back by the US and UK Governments. The code reinforces and articulates Communication on Progress 6 Human Rights ©Edinburgh International 2015 the obligations of private security providers particularly with regard to international humanitarian law and human rights law. Throughout the development of ICoC, EI has actively participated at various stages including the Launching Conference in September 2013 where an agreement was reached on the Charter for the Oversight Mechanism. Further to this, one of the EI Directors is a Board member of the ICoC Association (ICoCA) and has played a significate role in developing the code at every stage. In 2015, in accordance with the Articles of Association of the ICoCA, EI became a Transitional Member. Transitional Membership status recognizes that, by providing details concerning its efforts to implement the Code into its management and operations, EI has demonstrated its commitment to abide by and operate in accordance with the Code. As provided in the Articles of Association, Transitional Membership remains in place until one year following the publication of Certification Procedures by the ICoCA. Thereafter, all Transitional Members will be expected to become full Members by achieving certification in accordance with those Certification Procedures and by demonstrating their continued adherence to all obligations. Publication of the Certification Procedures is due to take place in the third quarter of 2015. As a standard to gaining ICoC recognition as a Transitional Member, EI on the 31st March received UKAS accredited certification for Quality of Private Security Contractor Operations, known as ANSI/ASIS PSC.1-2012. The PSC.1 standard establishes an auditable mechanism for Private Security Service Providers to provide demonstrable commitment, conformance, and accountability to the principles outlined in the International Code of Conduct (ICoC) for Private Security Service Providers and best practices of the Montreux Document.

Communication on Progress 8 Labour ©Edinburgh International 2015 Labour Principle 3: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. ASSESSMENT EI operates in countries that do not have the same enforceable measures in place as the UK or other European countries. EI has highlighted the potential labour dangers that it faces whilst operating in Afghanistan, Tanzania, Nigeria and Iraq. With this in mind, in 2013 EI initiated a quality, health, safety and environment (QHSE) enhancement programme. In 2014 the Company achieve the standard of OHSAS 18001 in Health and Safety Management. This standard combined with the previously achieved ISO 9001 quality management accreditation has assisted in developing policies, procedures and controls to ensure the best possible working conditions, aligned to internationally recognized best practice. This has ensured that the organisation treats its Staff and the local population with the highest regard for human rights and labour standards. EI’s overarching Policy is our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (Code), which states: “Edinburgh International Staff will respect the human rights of all persons they come into contact with, including, the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly and against arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy or deprivation of property… Staff are expected to treat their peers, superiors, or subordinates, as well as clients, suppliers and others with whom Edinburgh International does business, with respect and to not engage in abusive, disrespectful, violent or insubordinate behaviour.” IMPLEMENTATION DUE DILIGENCE EI’s Human Resources department has a rigorous and comprehensive due diligence and vetting system that has been successful for some time. All Staff who work for EI go through this procedure ensuring Communication on Progress 9 Labour ©Edinburgh International 2015 EI recruit Staff that are not complicit in human rights abuses. The process includes criminal record and background checks for all employees and additional local and governmental authority checks when employing host country nationals in Afghanistan and Iraq. As part of this screening, all ages of Staff are corroborated so as not to employ anyone under the age of 18 to carry out security service work and therefore ensuring that no child labour is used. LOCALLY HIRED STAFF As the Company’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct states, EI “will be a force for good wherever it operates”. Measures taken by EI to accomplish this include recruiting and training locally, providing Staff with contracts in their own language. EI recruits Staff from abroad only when it is absolutely necessary due to contractual requirements. The Company also has its policies and procedures available to Staff in their native language. Furthermore, EI invests its own time and money, to train its local work force for promotion to managerial positions. LOCAL COMMUNITY WORK Edinburgh International has been involved with a number of programmes over recent years designed to increase the earning potential of local communities within the regions it operates. In July 2013, Edinburgh International ran a hugely successful public service programme assisting economically the local community in Basra. The success of the programme was officially recognized and as a result we were given an award with a note of appreciation from the Joint Coordination Centre Figure 3 Qualifying with Distinction and the Oil and Gas Committee, Basra. Further to this, we also work with the Basra Governor’s Oil and Gas committee (BGOGC) who regularly provide a pool of candidates from which we are able to recruit, train and, subsequently, employ providing them every opportunity of career progression and further benefits within our organisation. The backgrounds of candidates recommended through BGOGC range from flower arrangers to taxi drivers. A growing number of citizens in pursuit of better salary and better working conditions, have now enjoyed a free week of pre-employment training designed to facilitate their entry into the growing security industry surrounding the southern oil fields. Training courses last between 4 and 7 days and take place at EI’s permanent and fully equipped training facility at Rumaila. Communication on Progress 10 Labour ©Edinburgh International 2015 Courses are offered at 2 levels: candidates with no previous security experience can enrol on a preemployment guarding course whilst those with previous industry experience can take the more advanced mobile security course covering mobile security techniques and defensive driving skills. Further, EI are focused on retention and are proud of a very strong track record relative to industry standards. In focusing on retention levels, we try to reward individuals who exude the relevant skills, experience and commitment. With this in mind, EI runs a company funded Deputy Team Leaders (DTL) course. The course is designed to build upon the skills already developed, with the view of promoting these individuals. On one of the courses 18 HCN’s took part. Having completed the course and employed within this new role, the newly promoted DTL saw their salary increase from $1300 per month, to $2,200.

ASSESSMENT Edinburgh International is fully committed to protecting the environment from the effects of its business. This commitment drove EI in 2013 to initiate the quality, health, safety and environment (QHSE) enhancement programme. As a result the Company in 2014 achieved ISO 14001:2004 certification which was in addition to OHSAS 18001 Health and Safety Management and ISO 9001 quality management. Considering the requirements of these International Standard, EI developed an Integrated Management System (IMS) which integrates all the organization's systems and processes in to one complete framework, enabling us to work as a single unit with unified objectives. The integrated management system manual is a statement of organisation, responsibility, processes, authority and control which has been implemented and maintained by EI. Using this system, EI was able to further develop an effective environmental management system, titled “Identification of Aspect, Impact, Hazard and Risk Prioritisation document”. The purpose of this documented procedure is to ensure that all environmental aspects and occupational health & safety hazards (operations and activities) that may be effected by or impact EI are identified and that the significance of their environmental impacts and occupational health & safety risk are assessed to permit improvement objectives via the implementation of necessary control measures. These procedures address routine, non-routine activities, and possible emergency conditions including contractors and visitors, having access to the workplace. IMPLEMENTATION VEHICLE FLEET Following an environmental impact assessment conducted in 2010 for the vehicle fleet EI operates, the decision was made to replace the entire fleet of petrol fuelled vehicles with diesel fuelled vehicles. It was estimated that this would reduce carbon emissions by an average of 21% per vehicle. Communication on Progress 12 Environment ©Edinburgh International 2015 Furthermore, from a safety point of view when operating on oilfields, diesel vehicles are deemed to be safer than petrol vehicles. In 2014 EI was successful in replacing all petrol vehicles for diesel. Additionally, to reduce further the environmental impact, EI sources all vehicles locally, where possible, either through hiring or outright purchasing. Moreover, sourcing locally helps to support the local economy.

ASSESSMENT The regions where EI operate can at times be susceptible to many forms of corruption. Often these regions are very poor and lack a rule of law, which can lend to the potential of high levels of corruption. Once corruption becomes established, in many cases it is routinely expected and ultimately accepted as part of the culture. To address this EI has put in place a strict zero tolerance Anti-Bribery policy. This policy is driven by the British Bribery Act 2010 and the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and governs all EI Staff. The Anti-Bribery Policy helps guide and focus EI’s attention on the business areas and personnel that are deemed to be most at risk to corruption. Additional training and validation is then conducted annually using EI’s Anti-Bribery Workshops which are held and monitored from our TraKs system. The following extract has been taken from EI’s Anti-Bribery Policy concerning EI’s commitment to training and educating its Staff. “All Staff are to adhere to this Policy along with all other relevant anti-bribery policies including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which can be found in the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct Policy on the Edinburgh International online library. All Staff are to take a zero tolerance commitment towards bribery and must report any suspected wrongdoings to their Management or the Ethics Officer on the Edinburgh International Ethics Hotline” IMPLEMENTATION ALL STAFF EI’s Anti-Bribery Policy applies to all Staff, contractors, sub-contractors and any organisation that the Company does business with. This Policy is required to be read, understood, and signed by all Staff upon joining the Company and again on an annual basis. This measure was implemented in 2011 and has had great success as a medium to deliver EI’s approach to anti-bribery. In order to further ensure that all Staff have a full knowledge and understanding of the Policy, annual anti-bribery workshops are conducted by senior managers and General Counsel. This training is given at differing levels dependent Communication on Progress 15 Anti-Corruption ©Edinburgh International 2015 on the role of the individual and the type of exposure to the risk of bribery. As with human rights training, TraKS is the platform for promulgating all material for anti-bribery training. All training is also recorded on TraKS. COMPANY AREAS DEEMED AT RISK The Company areas judged to be at greater risk due to the environments in which they operate are; Sales, Financial and Operations Departments. These areas receive additional training. This measure was put into practise in 2011 and since then, there has been a wide spectrum of anti-bribery policy training and workshops which have taken place. All of this training has been captured on TraKS and can be reviewed and audited as required. 2013 saw additional training take place, in line with the US Government’s Foreign and Corrupt Practises Act, led by the Company’s legal team. This training covered off the Sales, Financial and in-country Operational Programme Managers. More recently, the policy has been reviewed and updated and put into a format. The new format was in line with PSC1 compliance standard guidelines with the aim of making the Policy more streamline and easier for the end user to read and understand. INCIDENTS OF BRIBERY EI’s Ethics Hotline and email address are the conduits in place for Staff and third parties to use to anonymously report suspected bribery and corruption concerns. Since 2013, EI have received no complaints for bribery or corruption. AUDITING OF FINANCIAL BOOKS EI’s financial books are externally audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP on an annual basis. To date no financial irregularities have been identified during these audits.
