Page 10 2 Message Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 A Message from the Chairman F OO PR A Message from 8 the Chairman Message 2 Page 11 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 A Message from the Chairman F OO PR I am glad to say that success and growth have kept to the strategic trajectory envisioned for Access Engineering for the year 2014/15. Usually, this sentiment adorns messages as ‘the sum up line’, 8 but I felt it is the single valid sentiment that describes our enterprise and deserves to be the opening line of my message! Here at home, national GDP grew by 7.37%, on the back of strong growth in the construction sector. The devaluation of the Sri Lankan Rupee against the US Dollar posed a challenge to the business sector. Also, volatility and uncertainty beset the latter part of the year due to the Presidential Elections and the subsequent change of Government. The construction industry’s contribution to GDP growth stood at 10% for the year in review. For most of the year, Government support for infrastructure development remained steady. Internationally, the global economy continued to be driven by Access Engineering has identified value the powerhouses of Asia and the Far East. Economic growth engineering as a key component of its strategy in countries within the EU continued to be sluggish, whilst the USA showed encouraging signs of cautious growth. Although, and enterprise, which has helped establish the continuing to drive the global economy, countries of the Eastern hemisphere, more particularly China and India did experience Company’s edge within the industry some constraints, which caused growth to dip slightly when compared to their bull run of a few years ago. Growth in countries such as the USA augurs well for trade with countries such as Sri Lanka. In this backdrop, keeping Access Engineering’s success and growth trajectory true to its envisioned path was vitally important. Some key initiatives helped us do this. For a while now, Access Engineering has identified value engineering as a key component of its strategy and enterprise, which has helped establish the Company’s edge within the industry and amongst its peers. By this we mean providing our clients and principals with integrated engineering solutions that are innovative and cost effective. Our value engineering solutions flowed across all manner of construction – foundation laying, bridges, flyovers, water and telecommunications works – to name a few areas we targeted during the year in review. The acquisition and positioning of Access Projects (Private) Limited, enabled forward integration that further enhanced our integrated engineering solutions portfolio. In this manner, Access Engineering enhances not only the ‘build quality’ of the Company but also builds quality for people and Nation. I have to say that none of this activity would have seen the light of day had it not subscribed fully to the principles of sustainability that Access Engineering lives by. Sustainability is an integral component of our business philosophy. All our strategy and action is enacted across parameters of quality, environmental friendliness, health and safety that are in conformance with internationally-accepted frameworks and protocols. Looking ahead, Access Engineering will continue to consolidate its core business via our value engineering approach. We will continue our exploration of opportunities overseas. We are also looking at building a land bank, with the objective of exploring opportunities in the property development market of Sri Lanka. Before I conclude, I wish to inform you that Mr. Alexis Indrajith Lovell retired from the Board during the year in review after four years of dedicated service. Whilst thanking him for his contribution to the Company, I wish him all success in his future endeavours. I welcome Mr. Dinesh Weerakkody to the Board with effect from 1st January 2015. I have no doubt that the wealth of experience he brings to Access Engineering will augur well for the Company. I wish him a long and fruitful tenure with us. I would like to thank my colleagues on the Board, whose guidance and contribution have been invaluable in charting our course. I also thank our Managing Director and COO for the exemplary manner in which they steered the Company and also thank our staff of every rank who ‘lived the Access Engineering dream’ and helped the Company achieve success. I thank our stakeholders – our customers, international partners, bankers and the State – your support and co-operation has been integral to the results we have achieved and the reputation and standing we enjoy as one of Sri Lanka’s most respected firms in the industry. Sumal Perera Chairman Page 12 Management Discussion & Analysis Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Joint Statement of the Managing Director and the Chief Operating Officer F OO PR 8 Joint Statement of the Managing Director and the Chief Operating Officer Management Discussion & Analysis Page 13 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Joint Statement of the Managing Director and the Chief Operating Officer F OO PR 8 Access Engineering maintained positive business sentiments and momentum during most part of the year 2014/15. A Largely Enabling The external operating environment was for the most part an enabling one. From an Operating Environment economic perspective, Asia continued to drive global growth with India and China contributing significantly. China continued to lend/invest worldwide with an emphasis on developing both the land and maritime ‘silk route’. The Sri Lankan economy continued its healthy growth at over 7% for the year 2014. The construction sector was a major contributor to this growth. For the most part, the year in review progressed positively with a slowing down during the 3rd and 4th quarters due to impending Presidential Elections and the subsequent change in Government. This led to a slowing down of momentum in the industry, as implementation of some projects was delayed. The Industry Investment in Sri Lanka’s developing infrastructure continues apace, with many of the major projects receiving Chinese funding. Many other bilateral and multilateral funding agencies leant muscle to the country’s infrastructure development projects. Our primary focus for the year was on The construction industry has been at the forefront of national growth and development since the cessation of hostilities in 2009. In 2014, the consolidation of our core business, whilst industry’s share of contribution to national GDP was around 10% and constituted a YoY growth of approximately 12% over the results for 2013. expansion was only entertained where The industry also accounted for 7.3% of the country’s total labour force. synergies with our core values existed The construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing roads continued to be one of the development priorities in 2014 in line with the National Road Master Plan (2007-2017). Initiatives were taken to commence construction of Expressways utilizing reputed local and international contractors. The funding from China for infrastructure development included the extension of the Southern Expressway from Matara to Hambantota. The South Container Terminal (SCT), which has the capacity of handling 2.4 Mn TEUs per annum, was completed in April 2014 and the East Container Terminal (ECT) is expected to commence operations in 2015. The construction work of the Colombo Port City Project (CPCP) commenced in September 2014. Many projects were also initiated in the water purification and distribution sectors. Construction work on the Colombo Water Front Project, Shangri-La Development Project, ITC Colombo One Development Project and Altair among others, also commenced during the year. Areas of Focus Our primary focus for the year was on consolidation of our core business, whilst expansion was only entertained where synergies with our core values existed. We continued to invest in capacity building. The bulk of such investment – Rs. 714 Mn – went towards enhancing and infusing plant, equipment and machinery with new technological capability. This expenditure comes on the back of the Rs. 3.2 Bn the Company has spent over the previous three financial years. Our continuing search for ever greater productivity was greatly aided by the utilization to its full capacity this year, of our newly introduced ERP system. Access Engineering is the first local construction company to implement a comprehensive ERP system. Page 14 Management Discussion & Analysis Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Joint Statement of the Managing Director and the Chief Operating Officer F OO PR 8 Exploring business opportunities beyond Sri Lanka’s borders remains within our immediate focus. During the previous financial year, we commenced a project in Papua New Guinea which was completed in the current period of review, with a positive contribution to the bottom line. We opened a branch office in the Republic of Djibouti, to aid our push further afield in February 2015. Our focus on planned forward integration saw the Company acquiring Access Projects (Private) Limited, a leader in leisure, related building construction and a provider of total interior solutions with manufacturing capabilities in aluminium work and metal ceilings. Access Engineering also focused on reinforcing its presence in the field of mechanical engineering and this initiative saw fruition with the joint venture entered into by the Company with ZPMC China, the world’s largest container handling equipment manufacturer, which has led to the set up of ZPMC Lanka. This entity has since expanded its services overseas during the year under review including commissioning of cranes to Port Abdullah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This year, we were also engaged in the construction work of the superstructure of Access Tower II. Our Performance During the year under review, Access Engineering recorded a top line of Rs. 11.2 Bn. Top contributors to this result were – highways construction (40%), building construction (34%), sale of construction related material (11%) and water and drainage construction (10%). The Company enjoyed a gross profit ratio of 23%. We experienced a reduction in other income, mainly due to the depreciation of exchange rate of the Euro against the Sri Lankan Rupee, where we had income in Euro on the Labugama-Kalatuwawa water supply project. Our net profit ratio margin, at 16%, was well above the world industry average. Access Engineering is debt free and its liquidity is at a position of great strength. At the Group level, Access Realties (Private) Limited contributed approximately Rs. 314 Mn to the bottom line a YoY growth of over 130% mainly on account of a revaluation gain of Rs. 174 Mn. Sathosa Motors’ contribution to the bottom line was approximately Rs. 270 Mn while the recently acquired Access Projects (Private) Limited contributed Rs. 145 Mn. The Company continues to enjoy a preferential tax rate of 12% applicable to the construction industry. Achievements There have been several instances where the Company has delivered results we can truly be to be proud of proud of. For example we completed the Polduwa Bridge across the Diyawanna Oya, four months ahead of schedule, without compromising any of its key parameters. The innovative solution we provided to the ITC Hotel for the construction of its basements involved the incorporation of diaphragm walls, a concept introduced by a local contractor, for the first time in Sri Lanka. We undertook and completed piling works for the OCH Northern Section I, which to date remains the largest piling project undertaken by a private sector contractor. The ceremonial opening of 1,137 houses constructed under Phase I of the Underserved Resettlement Programme, well within the contract period and to witness the element of people in them was particularly heartwarming. Management Discussion & Analysis Page 15 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Joint Statement of the Managing Director and the Chief Operating Officer F OO PR 8 Then, there were the accolades received – the Gold award for construction companies at the Annual Report Awards organized by ICASL and the Infrastructure Sector Winner at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards 2014 organized by CCC, which further testified to the stature of the Company. What sets us Apart We are renowned as the most integrated engineering company with the best available human resources in the industry. Access Engineering is a clear leader when it comes to providing value engineering solutions to our clientele across all disciplines of civil engineering. We were the first company to introduce most of these solutions to the local construction industry. We are the only local construction company to run operations on a fully-automated ERP System which is based on SAP. We are the only local construction company to have the highest ICTAD Grading in nine disciplines of civil engineering. This is also complemented by our subsidiary Access Projects (Private) Limited which also has the highest ICTAD Grading for building construction, aluminium and ceiling works. Access Engineering values its positioning as a preferred partner among international contractors present in Sri Lanka. We were invited by China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) to work with them on a project in Papua New Guinea which has been completed successfully. Sustainability Building a sustainable enterprise resides at the core of our being. We are aware that construction as our primary activity can have an impact on societies and the environment. Every effort to mitigate or eliminate negative effects is taken. Our EMS is in conformity with the provisions of ISO 14001. We also utilize the latest and most up-to-date techniques available in construction in order to reduce the usage of natural resources. Across the social spectrum, we care for both our employees and the wider community, in areas where we are active. Access Engineering is a clear leader We provided industrial placements for over 90 individuals. An investment of over Rs. 10 Mn was made on Training and Development with an average when it comes to providing value training period of over 9 hours per employee. Our investment in human capital was recognized when we were rewarded at the SLITAD People engineering solutions to our clientele Development Awards 2014. across all disciplines of civil engineering All our projects operate in conformity with the provisions of OHSAS 18001. Our safety initiatives were recognized at the National Occupational Health and Safety Awards 2014. During the year under review, we carried out a total of 8 CSR initiatives on various platforms covering local community development, human capital building, health and wellness and environment stewardship. Page 16 Management Discussion & Analysis Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Joint Statement of the Managing Director and the Chief Operating Officer F OO PR 8 The Customer Customer centricity is at the top of our value chain. We recognize the customer as the at the Centre foremost value driver of our enterprise. We are committed to a continuous raising of the bar when it comes to offering a product or service. Access Engineering keeps ahead of the game by offering total/integrated value engineering solutions, engineering products and services that go beyond the traditional and the conventional. This has resulted in providing customers with cost effective solutions that often exceed expectations and thus fosters a high customer retention ratio. Looking to From the Company’s perspective, we will look to further develop and advance in the areas of the Future focus that have driven our business this year, which we have already alluded to. On our wish list are a few measures that would encourage us to leverage our business to serve the Nation even more effectively than at present. The continuation of the infrastructure development drive is a must for the country. We would like to see the stabilisation of the Rupee so that foreign funded projects would not suffer translation losses. The extension of facilities and incentives granted to encourage investments in new areas of business would, we feel, constitute a significant motivating factor to encourage enterprise. We would also wish for more consistency in the country’s tax and monetary policy. In conclusion, we would like to thank the Board and Corporate Management of the Company, whose guidance and input have been invaluable in administering the Company. We thank all shareholders as well as the wider stakeholder community, including our valued customers, whose trust and belief in the Company have made our task a happy one. We also thank every employee, of every rank – you are truly partners in the fortunes of Access Engineering and an invaluable asset to the Company. Christopher Joshua Rohana Fernando Managing Director Chief Operating Officer Management Discussion & Analysis Page 17 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Review of Business Operations F OO PR 8 The Year in Review Review of Business Globally, 2014/15 was what the IMF called ‘another year of transition’. Trends that Operations commenced in 2013 continued, with few international economic issues resolved. There were no major crises, though Greece edged closer to debt default and a possible exit from the Eurozone amid a great deal of sensation and comment. Some advanced economies, notably the USA, saw positive turnarounds, but in general the rich world fared less than well, while emerging economies, particularly China and the other BRICS nations, also felt the pinch. However, most consumer nations benefited from a decline in oil prices of around 40%, which helped ease the pains of economic uncertainty. The construction industry did relatively well worldwide and also in Sri Lanka where, for the fifth consecutive year, a strong commitment to rebuilding and reconstruction following the end of the 1983-2009 war helped the sector become one of the key contributors to GDP. Sri Lanka’s GDP grew by 7.37%, an increase of 1.66% compared with the figure for 2013. Industry sector (including construction) was the principal contributor to growth, followed by services sector. Per capita GDP was measured at $ 3,625. Private consumption declined year on year despite a substantial downward adjustment in interest rates by the Central Bank that was reflected in a decline of almost 30% in bank deposit and lending rates. With less consumer spending, there was a concomitant rise in private investments, which helped offset a fall in Government investment. The one-year Treasury Bill rate fell by approximately 28%. The Rupee weakened somewhat against the US Dollar in the course of 2014. The Colombo Stock Exchange had an excellent trading year in 2014, with the All Share Price Index crossing the 7,500 mark and market capitalization reaching Rs. 3 Tn. It was an active market, with daily turnover figures in the Rs. 1 Bn Rs. 1.5 Bn range. Political events in early 2015, however, had a negative effect on the bourse, causing both trading activity and share prices to decline somewhat.

These included the Southern Expressway (Phase II), the Colombo Outer Circular Highway Project (Phase I), the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant (Phase II) and the Deduru Oya Irrigation Project. It will be noted that some of these are multiphase projects, with further phases yet to be completed in many cases. Other large infrastructure projects made active progress in 2014. Among these were the East Container Terminal Phase of the Colombo Port Expansion Project, Phase II of the Colombo Outer Circular Highway Project, the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project, the Lotus Tower Project and the Port City Project. However, the future of some of these large projects is now uncertain: the new Government, formed in January 2015, is reviewing ongoing and proposed infrastructure projects to ensure their financial viability and environmental feasibility. Roads and Highways The construction of new roads and the rehabilitation of existing roads continued to be one of the development priorities in 2014 in line with the National Road Master Plan (2007-2017). Phase II of the Southern Expressway, a 35km stretch from Pinnaduwa to Godagama, was opened in March 2014. An Asian Development Bank-funded project to build link roads to the Southern Expressway was completed in January 2015. Another major highway project, the Colombo Outer Circular Highway Project, continued to make progress. Phase I of the project is now completed and Phase II (Kaduwela to Kadawatha, 9km) was physically 93% completed by the end of February 2015. Land acquisition and the construction of internal roads in Phase III of the project (Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya, 9km) are now underway. The Hatton-Nuwara Eliya Road is being redeveloped with the assistance of the Korean Economic Development Co-operation Fund (EDCF), while the construction of the Manmunai Bridge across the Batticaloa Lagoon was completed with Japanese assistance in April 2014. The Steel Bridge Project (Phases I and II), undertaken with the assistance of the United Kingdom, continued, as did the reconstruction and rehabilitation of 46 bridges with French assistance. Several bridges and flyovers across the country, including the Polduwa Bridge, a six-lane multispan composite bridge across the Diyawanna Oya in Kotte, were completed during 2014. Management Discussion & Analysis Page 19 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Review of Business Operations F OO PR 8 Roads in the Northern and Eastern Provinces are being rebuilt and improved under three large projects: the Northern Road Rehabilitation Project (NRRP), the Conflict-Affected Region Emergency Project (CAREP) and the Northern Road Connectivity Project (NRCP). Three roads rebuilt under the NRRP – Oddusudan-Nedunkerny, Mullaitivu-Puliyankulam and Nawathkuli-Karaitivu-Mannar – were declared open in 2014. Port of Colombo and Environs The South Container Terminal (SCT), which can handle up to 2.4 Mn TEUs annually, was completed in April 2014. Still under construction is the East Container Terminal (ECT), which is expected to become operational in 2015. Construction work of the Colombo Port City Project (CPCP), designed as a commercial district along with luxury apartment complexes and recreational centres to be built on 576 acres of reclaimed land adjacent to the port itself, was suspended pending Government review of an environmental-impact assessment earlier granted. Outlook for the Industry The review of large infrastructure projects following the change of Government in January 2015 has made forecasting future prospects for the industry an uncertain business. Though reliable estimates of future growth and activity are difficult, however, there is little doubt that the industry will continue to do well. Many ongoing projects are unaffected by the review process and will continue as before; in some other cases, there is hope that, once their utility and feasibility is confirmed, work on these projects will resume once more. Speaking for the longer view, the prospects are extremely good. Sri Lanka is now a nearmiddle-income country with a thriving economy that, in terms of increasing complexity, integration and commitment to future growth, has passed the point of no return. Barring unforeseen natural disasters or a truly extraordinary turn of events, our industry will continue to be a vital and valued engine of growth, making a significant contribution to the Sri Lankan economy for decades to come.

Soil nailing is a technique for stabilizing slopes during excavation works by reinforcing the ground in situ with relatively small, fully-bonded inclusions, usually steel bars. These are introduced into the soil mass, the face of which has been locally stabilized by sprayed concrete (shotcrete), and act to produce a zone of reinforced ground. The shotcreting process is a unique construction method that uses compressed air to pneumatically project mortar or concrete against a surface at high velocity. The shotcrete layers are reinforced by conventional steel rods, steel mesh, and/or fibre materials. yy Ground anchoring and micro-piling using KR 909-2 drilling rig. This compact and powerful drill rig, featuring tried and tested Klemm components, is easily adaptable to a wide range of drilling applications in civil engineering/geo-construction fields such as anchoring, micro-piling, soil-nailing, tie-back anchor drilling and high-pressure injection for the construction of columns and base slabs or for underpinning.

It is a two-way process; value deriving Value Creation and and value delivering. For AEL to create sustainable value for itself, it must also create value Capital Formation for its stakeholders. They go hand in hand. Value creation leads to capital formation, which may be financial or non-financial, internal or external to AEL. We derive value through the dynamic interaction between our external capital and our own internal capital, over the short, medium and long term. Our internal capital comprises financial capital and institutional capital. The latter includes intangibles such as integrity, corporate culture, specialized knowledge and processes, intellectual capital including patents and copyrights, our capacity to innovate, brand image, reputation and the like. We deliver value, both financial and non-financial, to our stakeholders. As stores of value, they constitute our stakeholder capitals that are external to the Company. They comprise investor capital, customer capital, employee capital and social & environmental capital. Value creation is a dynamic process with flows taking place between the various forms of capital all the time. Although we do not ‘own’ any of our external forms of capital, we have access to and use them, and along with our own internal forms of capital, create value for AEL (deriving value) and for our stakeholders (delivering value). The discussion that follows reviews our performance during the year and next steps in this context – the two sides of value creation that of deriving and delivering value that leads to capital formation. e delivered by A Valu EL AEL Stakeholders Value EL d erived by A Value derived leads to Value delivered leads to internal capital formation external capital formation Total capital of AEL Page 56 Management Discussion & Analysis Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Value Creation and Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Economic Economic performance is important for a business to grow and prosper in the long term. Value Creation The benefits are not limited to the business, but they also contribute to the well-being of the local community and ultimately the growth and prosperity of the economy at large. Positive economic performance is a win-win approach to a sustainable business. Economic value creation and distribution includes profits generated and distributed among shareholders, taxes paid to the Government, salaries and other emoluments to employees, payments to suppliers, subcontractors, etc. Environmental The nature of our business is such that most of our projects have a direct and often Value Creation significant impact on the environment. Therefore, our management approach is to design and manufacture products that do not harm the environment and to minimize the impact of our own activities. Our operations are heavily based on consumption of natural resources and hence if not conducted without proper regard to their effects, they may pollute or degrade the environment. Such effects could result in reputation loss or loss of economic value through fines for non-compliance with pertinent laws, rules and regulations. Thus, compliance with such laws, rules and regulations (together with periodic auditing to ensure it), enforcement of ISO 14000 environmental management standards, ecologically aware project planning and execution, the application of environment-friendly construction techniques, materials re-use and recycling, training employees in proper environmental practices and proper project demobilization are essential elements of every project we undertake. In addition, we undertake tree planting programmes in and around our project locations to increase the environmental capital generated by our operations. Social Value Being a diversified conglomerate in Sri Lanka, it is our duty to do the right thing and build Creation strong relationships in the communities in which we operate. Our sphere of responsibility is extensive; therefore, it is of utmost importance that our operations embrace a wide awareness of their social impacts and are thus stringently managed at all times. By monitoring and managing our impacts on surrounding communities, we are able to mitigate the negative effects of our operations while striving to maximize the positive impacts. We engage with our stakeholders, build long Our large infrastructure projects have significant effects on the community. Thus, the Company’s conduct as a corporate citizen term and mutually beneficial relationships may have enormous consequences; Access Engineering may come to be seen as a social and national asset, or as a liability, and nurture them, as they are of value to us based on its social conduct. On the positive side, good social in driving future earnings. behaviour can help smooth the way and generate support for our operations. On the negative side, reprehensible behaviour may lead to loss of preference among principals and clients and ultimately to loss of business; it may also help generate resistance, more or less organized, from people resident in project areas, which may raise the costs and difficulties associated with a project or cause it to be cancelled altogether. Access Engineering incorporates sensitivity to such issues into project planning and management, recruits staff from the local communities wherever possible, maintains regular and frequent dialogue with local communities and undertakes project audits at least three times during the life cycle of the project and more often if deemed necessary. Management Discussion & Analysis Page 57 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Value Creation and Capital Formation F OO PR 8 In cases where there are no injuries or losses of life, faulty construction incurs financial costs arising from repairs or rebuilding and from fines and reputation loss that may have major long-term economic consequences. Prudent project management from planning and mobilization through execution until completion and handing over of the project, the strict implementation of the ISO 9001 quality management system and the maintenance of a high degree of competence and responsibility among our people are essential factors in the mitigation of such risks. Labour Practices and People are one of the most important of all our ‘capitals’. True to our corporate values, we Decent Work have in place a culture that moulds a winning team. As a key to organizational development we continue to invest in our people, particularly through training and development. We recruit, train, develop and motivate our people to deliver their best. These span aspects include training and development, employee welfare, above industry-average pay and benefits, reward and recognition, succession planning and leadership development. Given the nature of the construction industry, companies engaged in it have high rates of employee turnover due to injuries and accidents associated. Some of the risks these companies are exposed to are fines for non-compliance with labour laws and regulations, the risk of lawsuits against the Company from disaffected employees and ex-employees. These could result in damaging the Company’s reputation. For all these reasons, the Company follows prudent human resources management principles, strictly applies the health and safety practices nominated in OHSAS 18001. The Ten Principles promulgated by the UN Global Compact (UNGC) concerning human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption, underpin every endeavour at AEL. The Group is a signatory to these principles. We are guided by the principles of the UNGC and Sri Lanka’s legal and regulatory regimes concerning safeguarding of human rights. We take particular care when subcontracting project work to local suppliers in remote and economically vulnerable areas of the country, where the potential exists for the exploitation of women and children as labourers, etc. Page 58 Management Discussion & Analysis Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Internal Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Financial capital Internal Capital Despite the macroeconomic and environmental changes that pressurized the economy, Formation Access Engineering PLC, along with its subsidiaries completed the financial year 2014/15 on a solid note. Prudent management of projects coupled with sound financial practices enabled the Group to achieve this feat.

Often, elements of institutional capital are easier to identify than to evaluate. In this report, we confine ourselves to a listing of the most salient and valuable elements of institutional capital. Organizational Knowledge and Expertise Our human resource base of over 1,800 includes over 100 engineering professionals with 20 chartered engineers and quantity surveyors. Collectively, this represents a sizeable pool of relevant knowledge and skill. To ensure that it is available to all, the Company facilitates effective knowledge sharing through the AEL Central Data Repository and the AEL News e-mail platform. Another important venue for knowledge sharing is the Key Employee Forum, headed by the Managing Director. Post project analyses are carried out to identify, clarify and record lessons learned and best practices for future reference. Finally, an in-house library contains a variety of books, journals and audio visual materials on all aspects of civil engineering, project management, etc. Brand Value At Access Engineering, we build our brand by delivering value for money on every project, very often going beyond client expectations. Our products – roads, bridges, buildings and other engineering works – are tangible and functional. Their quality and value is easily judged by their owners and users. For us, our ‘brand’ is not an artificial creation, designed to appeal to fickle consumers; it is, quite simply, our reputation. Thus it is with pride that we point to the fact that we are both the preferred partner of most international engineering contractors active in Sri Lanka and the preferred employer in our industrial sector due to the high retention rates we have been consistently maintaining. We design and diligently apply systems and processes to maintain performance, output quality, timeliness, etc. Our quality management, environmental management and health and safety management systems are all ISO certified, as is our geotechnical laboratory. A fully-integrated ERP system and fully-operational HRIS system, together with a set of standard operating procedures with which all relevant employees are familiarized, support our commitment to quality. Our broad-based capabilities enable us to offer integrated engineering solutions from design stage to commissioning, with many technical, laboratory, etc. resources available in-house. Governance AEL was the first diversified construction firm in Sri Lanka to broad-base its ownership through a listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Public ownership and the CSE’s own corporate governance requirements help contribute to good governance and sustainability. Supplementary to the basic requirements of regulators, AEL has sound internal controls in place, based on generally-agreed ethical principles that are integrated within our corporate culture. The Company’s vision and mission help articulate our position for the benefit of our customers, employees and other stakeholders. On an operation level, the Company protects its brand capital by close adherence to meaningful quality, environmental and health and safety policies and by strictly upholding a code of ethics that calls for honesty, integrity, discipline, co-operation and responsibility (both individual and collective). Management Discussion & Analysis Page 63 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Investor Capital External Capital Ownership of Access Engineering PLC is mainly concentrated in the hands of a few key Formation shareholders, many of whom have active and longstanding connections with the Company.

Elements of Customer Value Creation Value Engineering Solutions Given the nature of our business, customer value creation must begin with engineering. AEL offers customers a number of engineering solutions that deliver value in terms of strength, longevity, economy, etc. Among these, the following are especially noteworthy: Responsible Design Product designs are usually provided by architects or engineers separately retained by the customer. Our responsibility is to deliver a product that is fit for the purpose. This demands constant dialogue with customers, as well as with the architects and/or engineers retained by them. We often go to the extent of educating our customers on design aspects that require alteration or modification. We undertake compliance with all applicable standards. Consequently, we are often directly involved in details of the design of temporary works. Stability checks for walls, slopes and excavations are also carried out by us; we avoid reliance on ‘rules of thumb’. The Design Department also carries out model testing and all in-house designs are peer reviewed by third party consultants. Better Construction Techniques yy A technique of basement construction using diaphragm walls which can be erected in close, congested areas with minimal vibration and noise. Construction time is also reduced by this method. yy Slope stabilization using soil nailing and ‘shotcreting’ to increase landslide resistance. The technique creates slopes with low absorption and high strength. Shotcreting can even be used on slopes that are not easily accessible to heavy machinery. yy The use of post-tensioned concrete for high-rise buildings, which results in thinner concrete sections and/or longer spans between supports. This method saves energy in the construction process and also reduces cost and construction time. yy Ground anchoring and micro piling using a compact, remote controlled machine that can be used in limited-access situations due to its compact size and easy manoeuverability. This is ideal for environmentally sensitive projects because it causes relatively little disturbance to the surrounding area. yy Horizontal directional drilling for trenchless underground cable installation. yy Cable blowing for telecommunication works. yy Prefabricated panel walls that demand less working space, install faster and last longer. yy A new guardrail installation method that increases speed of installation, reduces costs and improves quality. yy The use of prefabricated steel bridges and flyovers to save project time and costs. Management Discussion & Analysis Page 71 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Surveillance and Monitoring yy Quality control of deep excavations using ultrasonic drilling monitors. yy Hydrogen leak detection for post-installation testing of pipes and ducts. yy Ground-penetrating radar for detecting underground utilities and artefacts. Quality Assurance Both our Company-wide quality management system and our geotechnical laboratory operations are ISO certified. An integrated audit of company QMS and EMS were carried out by Det Norske Veritas in the year under review. Every project we undertake is subject to a minimum of three internal audits during its life cycle in order to ensure the quality of the final product. These audits cover all aspects including quality, environmental performance and health-and-safety performance. Additional special audits are conducted if and when the need arises. Other Aspects of Customer Value Creation Access Engineering is the only Sri Lankan construction company to run its operations on a fully-automated, SAP-based enterprise resource-planning system. All operational centres – project management, sales and distribution, equipment and tools management, financial management, materials management, procurement and production planning – are based on this system. AEL is also the only local construction company to receive the highest ICTAD grading in nine disciplines of civil engineering. This is complemented by our subsidiary Access Projects (Private) Limited, which also has the highest ICTAD grading for building construction, aluminum works and ceiling works. Our in-house service portfolio covers a diverse spectrum of civil, telecommunications and mechanical engineering solutions. Again, our capabilities are complemented by our Subsidiary, Access Projects (Private) Limited, a leader in providing interior solutions. Finally, our commitment to sustainability and good corporate governance are also important contributors to customer value creation. Page 72 Management Discussion & Analysis Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Employee Capital Despite its high turnover and broad technical and geographical scope, Access Engineering has a relatively modest number of full-time employees: 1,887 as at 31st March 2015. Due to the physically demanding nature of work in our industry, the great majority of employees are male. The large manual labour demand on various projects is met through subcontracting of casual or contract workers. The following discussion focuses on full-time employees, commencing with an analysis of AEL’s workforce by age and gender: Human Resources Analysis Employees by Gender Category Male Female Total Management and Professional 149 22 171 Technical 500 26 526 Clerical and Supportive (Operational) 439 104 543 Skilled and Unskilled 646 1 647 Total 1,734 153 1,887 A similar gender balance is seen among new employees: New Employees by Gender Division Male Female Total Head Office 23 6 29 Project Management Division I 9 4 13 Project Management Division II 107 3 110 Project Management Division III 56 5 61 Total 195 18 213 An age analysis shows that our workforce largely follows the typical demographic pattern: Employees by Age Group Age Group Male Female Total 18-20 9 1 10 21-25 264 35 299 26-30 374 44 418 31-35 331 39 370 36-40 266 23 289 41-45 210 7 217 46-50 166 3 169 51-55 54 1 55 Above 55 60 0 60 Total 1,734 153 1,887 Management Discussion & Analysis Page 73 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Where Do Our People Work? Most employees work in the Western and North-Western Provinces, where non-agricultural economic activity in Sri Lanka is largely concentrated. The relatively high Northern Province head count reflects the focus on infrastructure reconstruction and rehabilitation in that province following the end of the war in 2009. Employees by Region Province Head Count Western 1,607 Eastern 5 North-Western 141 Southern 16 Northern 97 Uva 21 Total 1,887 The majority of our employees work in one of the three project management divisions, reflecting a relatively lean administrative infrastructure.

Among these was a rise in the value of personal accident insurance covering all our employees. Moreover, our people continued to enjoy the full range of benefits conferred in previous years. Staff retention rate for the year was just above 94%. This is a commendable retention rate for our industry. Our reputation as a preferred employee in the sector is borne out by this figure. Training and Development A close focus on training and development is an integral part of human-resource capital formation at AEL. In the year under review, we spent almost Rs. 10.26 Mn on training and development. The average Access Engineering employee spent almost nine and a half hours during the year in training and development activities. In addition, we facilitated a total of 96 industrial placements during the period. Average Training Hours by Employee Category Average training hours for staff 9h 41’ Average training hours for workers 7h 27’ Average Training Hours by Employee Category Men 9h 21’ Women 9h 37’ Subject Areas Training at AEL covers the gamut of relevant subjects. A strong emphasis on technical training is inevitable in our field, but our training schedule also covers health and safety training as well as the following: yy Technical skills yy Training and development (‘training of trainers’ or ToT) yy Management systems yy Leadership skills yy Soft skills yy Personal development All new employees participate in induction and orientation programmes. Apart from formal training sessions conducted at our head and site offices or at external venues, all employees also undergo continuous on-the-job training. Job rotation, job enrichment and job enhancement measures also form part of the process of employee training and development. External training and development activity includes employee participation in non-company, subject appropriate seminars, workshops and other knowledge-sharing forums, as well as industry visits and overseas training opportunities. Management Discussion & Analysis 3 Page 75 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Anti-Corruption Measures and Training Our industry is one that is traditionally vulnerable to corruption. Our stance on this issue, that of zero tolerance for corruption at any level, remains unchanged. All business units were analyzed for risks related to corruption in the year under review. The analysis covered a total of 71 operational projects in the year under review, whether begun, ongoing or completed – the latter consisting of projects still within the Defect Liability Period (DLP) or Financial Contribution Period (FCP) at year’s end.

Our record in this area is good and major effort is expended to maintain it. Annual maxima are set for H&S indicators such as accidents, diagnoses of occupational diseases, etc. For the year under review, these targets were: yy Occupational disease diagnoses: 0 yy Fatalities: 0 yy Major injuries: 0 yy Minor injuries: 4 The following statistics give a picture of operational health and safety at our project sites, plants, offices, etc. during the course of the year under review. Occupational H&S Indicators – 2014/15 Total safety hours 5,831,207 Fatalities 1 Major accidents 1 Minor accidents 6 Frequency of major accidents 0.137 < 1 Frequency of minor accidents 0.206 < 1 ‘Lost time to injury’ frequency rate (LTIFR) 1.71 The LTIFR figure for 2014/15 represents a reduction of 70% compared to 2013/14. In addition to our standard H&S procedures, such as safety signage displays, training sessions and awareness programmes, all of which are carried out at every project site and office location, we also screened a series of safety videos at project sites for new inductees. AEL employees are incentivized to follow safety procedures through the presentation of a monthly ‘Best Safety Performance’ Award at each project site. Management Discussion & Analysis Page 77 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Future plans and strategies in relation to H&S system compliance include the following: yy Conducting health and wellness programmes on a continuous basis yy Weekly health and safety e-mail to all employees yy Health and wellness sessions every month at Access Towers yy Elaboration of the health-screening programme by considering employees’ healthscreening history and individual job-related risk yy Calculation of the Body-Mass Index (BMI) of all workers yy Initiative for hazardous-waste management Health and Safety Training Between 1st April 2014 and 31st March 2015, the following H&S training sessions were conducted: Occupational H&S Training Schedule Programme Type Dates No. of Participants Average Training Hours General H&S Training (by Internal Audit Team) Internal April 2014 March 2015 1,737 5,424 General H&S Training (by Project Managers and Safety Officers) Internal April 2014 March 2015 1,500 18,000 Seminar on Occupational H&S External 29th April 2014 10 80 Certificate Course in Occupational H&S External 13th August 2014 (15 days) 5 600 ‘Industrial Safety for Higher Productivity’ External 18th September 2014 (2 days) 6 102 Internal Auditor Course (OHSAS 18001) External 2nd October 2014 (2 days) 4 64 Seminar on Occupational Injuries and Diseases External 14th October 2014 53 424 National Occupation Safety and Health Conference, 2014 External 16th October 2014 42 336 OHSMS Lead Auditor Course External 8th December 2014 (5 days) 2 80 First-aid Training Internal 4th -18th December 2014 (3 active days) 30 720 Page 78 Management Discussion & Analysis Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Health Screening for Employees As an additional benefit, all our employees undergo regular health screening at Company expense.

The other major component of expenditure was the purchase of safety equipment. Recognition Health-and-safety awards won during 2014/15 included two National Occupational Health and Safety Excellence Awards. AEL won the Sector Award for the Construction Sector Outright for its Performance on the Kadawatha-Nittambuwa Road Project, while our Polduwa Bridge Project obtained a Merit Award. Management Discussion & Analysis Page 79 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Business Another aspect of capital formation is partnerships. More often than not, AEL works Partner Capital in partnership with other suppliers and contractors. Our involvement may be as a joint-venture partner, as a subcontractor to the lead contractor (this is often the case with respect to large public infrastructure projects) or as a principal contractor overseeing one or more subcontractors and suppliers. Often these partnerships evolve into long-term strategic alliances. The year under review, saw the establishment or consolidation of several such partnerships. Of particular note was the further expansion of our partnership with Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries (ZPMC) through the commissioning of three 65-ton ship-to-shore cranes at King Abdullah Port in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. AEL was also chosen as the private partner in a public-private partnership undertaken by the Government of Sri Lanka: an Urban Development Authority Project to construct 608 residential housing units for public sector employees. The commencement of this project is currently delayed due to finalization of facilities and financial options to be made to the prospective public sector buyers.

Thus, the most important component of our input to society and culture comes from our normal business operations – and from our active commitment to quality and sustainability in respect of those operations. However, recognizing that good corporate citizenship in our day and age means more than simply a job well and appropriately done, we undertook a number of dedicated CSR projects in the year under review. These are grouped below, ordered by area of intervention: CSR Initiatives by Category – 2014/15 CSR Platform No. of Projects Human Capital Building 02 Local Community Development 04 Health and Wellness 01 Environmental Stewardship 01 Total 08 Building Human Capital In a country where technical skills are in short supply at all levels, a company like ours has the responsibility to promote their acquisition and development among future generations. This is enlightened self-interest – it is from the pool of technically trained and capable Sri Lankans that we will draw our future employees – but it also benefits our industry and the nation as a whole. Mentoring Programme: ‘Life Skills for Engineering Students’ This programme, conducted for undergraduates in the Engineering Departments of the Universities of Moratuwa, Peradeniya and Ruhuna, is designed to prepare them for smooth entry into the corporate world. ‘Personal and Practical Views on Getting Ahead’ – Mentoring and Motivational Session Again targeted at Engineering Students at Peradeniya, this initiative saw AEL’s Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer make presentations on prospects and developments in the construction industry. Local Community Development AEL will consider supporting or funding appropriate and sustainable community projects where a clear need and clear potential benefits are demonstrated. In the year under review, we undertook community projects of two very different kinds. Meth Mihira This is a home for ‘differently-abled’ children in Moratuwa, built and donated by AEL as a service to the community. Distribution of Stationery and Clothing to Poor Villagers in the Gampaha District Used, but usable garments, collected from our employees and their families, were donated to needy families in the Gampaha District. Along with clothes we also provided stationery items to schoolchildren in the district. Management Discussion & Analysis Page 81 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 Rehabilitation of Irrigation Works at Kebithigollewa The Kuda Nelugola Tank near Kebithigollewa had been abandoned for some thirty years. Rehabilitating this small tank would enable 15 farmers in the vicinity to resume cultivation of a ten-acre extent of adjacent paddy land. AEL identified this as a CSR project of a type that we were well-qualified to undertake and rehabilitation work commenced in August 2014. Additionally, we installed a water-purification plant fed from a deep artesian well, complete with elevated storage tank and pump system, supplying the local community with potable water. The plant has a daily output of 5,000 and benefits 125 families in the area. As part of this community-development initiative, we also equipped the nearby Halmillawatiya Public School with textbooks, sport equipment, uniform ties and school badges, as well as a mini-drip irrigation system for the school vegetable garden. Rehabilitation of Irrigation Works in Vavuniya An initiative similar to the one mentioned above, but on a larger scale, saw the restoration of Kande Nawakkulama Tank in the Vavuniya District, which had been abandoned for the past three years in Vavuniya District. Work included reconstruction of the tank bund, spillway, sluice-gates and distribution canals. The restored tank irrigates more than 200 acres of paddy, benefiting more than 75 farmers, who can now obtain two harvests a year instead of the one previously obtained. Health and Wellness As with community development, this is another area in which AEL is happy to consider proposals for interventions that result in tangible improvements in the lives of the target group. Donation of Spectacles In collaboration with the organization ‘So Others May See’, we screened 6,086 children in the Trincomalee District for vision defects such as myopia and donated a total of 1,200 pairs of spectacles to children who required them. This project was undertaken through public schools in the district. Environmental Stewardship Construction projects have the potential to cause environmental degradation. For the most part, this is temporary, but definite action is required to avoid permanent damage. One way in which Access Engineering seeks to mitigate the environmental consequences of its business operations is through the restoration and rehabilitation of local environments and more broadly through maintaining and extending tree cover. Tree-Planting Campaign, 2014/15 During the financial year under review, we planted 1,719 trees across the island. This is in addition to the 11,726 trees planted over the years to date – a significant contribution to a greener Sri Lanka. Mitigating Our Environmental Impact Acutely conscious of the potential for ecological degradation and pollution resulting from our operations, we undertake extensive and responsible actions to mitigate their environmental impacts. The following table lists operational aspects, their impacts and the mitigation strategies adopted in each case. These activities were undertaken – as and when appropriate – at all project sites and facilities during the course of the year.

It is in AEL’s interest to reduce energy consumption as much as possible through the adoption of conservation and efficiency measures. Perhaps even more important, in the long term, is the need to reduce both our carbon footprint and the national energy debt. In the year under review, we targeted a reduction of 2% in electricity consumption. To reach this target, we adopted the following practices: yy Site offices, meal rooms and rest rooms rely on natural ventilation rather than air conditioners and fans. yy Use of thermal insulation on the roofs of AEL buildings. yy Use of solar energy for welding, drilling and powering service vehicles. Management Discussion & Analysis Page 83 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 External Capital Formation F OO PR 8 yy Installation of energy-efficient light bulbs (compact fluorescent lamps and LEDs). yy Evaluating vehicle and machinery procurement choices based on energy efficiency. yy The introduction of LCD monitors for desktop computers. yy Configuring all computers and laptops for more efficient power management yy Isolating meeting rooms from the central AC system. yy Dividing the lighting system into active zones with separate switching. yy Installation of a power factor correction capacitor. Through these and other measures, the amount of electricity consumed by AEL was reduced. The budgeted reduction of 2% implied an annual consumption of 1,419,115 units (as defined by the Ceylon Electricity Board). Actual consumption for the year under review was held to 1,156,788 units. This amounted to a total saving in electricity consumed of 18.48%, more than achieving the objective. Indeed, this was one of the noteworthy achievements of the financial year.

These included: yy Re-using water as much as possible at all our construction sites. yy Installation of waste water treatment plants to purify and recycle water to avoid contamination of the soil, surface water and natural water bodies. In the year under review, treatment plants were in operation at Mabima Batching Plant and Ranala Workshop. yy Improving efficiency in water consumption by budgeting water usage by activity (construction and day-to-day) at all work sites.

Stewardship 4 Page 95 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Corporate Governance F OO PR 8 Constructed on a sound philosophy, ethics, policies, values, accountability and sincerity Corporate of action, AEL’s corporate governance ethos works within a culture of performance that Governance emphasizes a framework of conformance and compliance. To us, corporate governance goes beyond the tenets of conformance and compliance into a milieu where our business is grown and nurtured into a sustainable and equitable one, presenting all our stakeholders with a future to grow with us. Maximizing shareholder wealth on a sustainable basis while safeguarding the rights of multiple stakeholders are fundamentals which are permeated through all levels of our management and staff, who in turn work on the trusses of truth, trust, principles and honesty to ensure that the end justifies the means and remain strategically aligned to the core principles of our corporate governance practice. Our governance and operating model facilitates efficient and timely decision-making coupled with pragmatic resource allocations, which in turn are integrated into a transparent, accountable and ethical framework that are compliant not only with the laws of the country but also with self-imposed codes of ethics, standards and regulations that position us on a platform of critical governance features to ensure a culture that goes beyond compliance. This is thus manifested in the composition of the corporate management team, division of powers and duties and the promotion of sound corporate ethics across the Company. The Company’s vision and mission remain firmly embedded in our future journey with the Board of Directors and Executive Management providing the necessary stewardship to our team and other stakeholders to achieve our objectives. Evaluating and setting the direction of the Company’s strategic initiatives, performance objectives and targets also remain entrenched within the Board of Directors, in addition to strengthening the overarching Company principle of protecting the interests of all stakeholders and consolidation of business activities to ensure continuity and sustainability. The Board of Directors of AEL endeavours to provide entrepreneurial leadership through effective formulation and execution of policies and procedures to attain the objectives of the Company. The Board comprises of ten Directors out of which five are Executive Directors and five are Non-Executive Directors. There is no female representation on the Board. Chairman of the Company who acts in an Executive Capacity is mainly responsible for directing the affairs of the Board while maintaining effective external relationships. Day-to-day affairs of the Company are headed by the Managing Director who is supported by the Director/ Chief Operating Officer (COO). Three of the Non-Executive Directors are independent in respect of criteria laid down by the regulatory authorities and have no interests or relationships in relation to the affairs of the Company. This composition has encouraged the Company to demonstrate more transparency and independent judgment in the decision-making process. Decisions regarding new Board appointments are taken by the Board collectively and the qualifications and experience of Board members are decided based on the nature of the business of the Company and the value addition the member is expected to bring to the Board and the Company. The Company also adopts the main corporate governance committees under the highest governance body; Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee to strengthen its commitment on corporate governance. Beyond the mandatory requirements, the Company also has in place a Strategic Planning and a Compliance Committee to ensure adherence to best practices. The Board carries out a self-evaluation of its performance both individually as well as collectively against economic, environmental and social targets/goals set at the beginning of each year. Results of these evaluations are properly minuted by the Company Secretary who is responsible for maintaining the same. The Executive Directors are required to adhere with the provisions of the ‘Company Policy on Disciplinary Management’ to avoid any potential Page 96 4 Stewardship Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Corporate Governance F OO PR 8 conflict of interest. Implementation of the said policy is periodically monitored by a sixmember committee. The Non-Executive Directors are required to confirm the existence or non-existence of conflict of interest in the dated declaration submitted to the Board. Shareholders being the primary stakeholder group, the Company has in place a clear mechanism for facilitating their recommendations. Shareholders could meet the Members of the Board on prior appointment or via the Company Secretary who keeps a record of their concerns. These concerns are promptly replied either directly or via the Company Secretary as the case maybe. Access Engineering’s Corporate Management team is committed to achieving sustained value creation for the benefit of all stakeholders through adherence to a set of well-defined corporate governance principles, coupled with maintaining effective structures and processes within the Company. The team, which comprises the Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer, Board Members and Senior Management, meet at regular intervals to discuss the management of business activities. Project implementation is carried out by the Project Management Divisions wherein General Managers and Deputy General Managers work on plans and targets, matching those to realistic time frames and ensuring any shortfalls or delays are speedily rectified. Authority is exercised within an ethical framework of business practices established by the Board, which demands compliance with existing laws and regulations as well as best practices in dealing with employees, customers, suppliers and the community at large. We have also infused a milieu of increased participation by middle management to permeate the need for a more responsible, transparent and accountable administration, which in turn will strengthen the financial discipline of the Company. The culture of high authority tied-up with high accountability has given us the freedom to respond to customer needs faster than most of the competitors which has been the cornerstone of our competitive advantage. The permeation of authority and accountability right down to the shop-floor level and the front-line has freed up the top management to dwell on the more strategic and conceptual inputs. Driving a team branded on excellence, people remain centric to our entire operational capabilities and engineering competencies. The experience and professionalism within our team has been the catalyst in integrating our core competencies into strategic partnerships. Maintaining a healthy work life balance with an environment of superior human resource development via a comprehensive Quality Management System and Occupational Health and Safety Management System inculcate the culture of meritocracy and performance oriented individuals who make up for an excellent team, driven to achieve ambitious goals. Part of the compensation of staff including Executive Directors and the Corporate Management is performance based and the distribution of the same is decided by the Board and the Management after the evaluation of multiple factors including but not limited to performance of the Company and the individual concerned. Employees are encouraged to make recommendations to the Board via their respective Department Heads. 1.

(Attitude towards risk). 3. Identify Risks (Event Identification) We identify the risks faced by the organization with possible categorization. The following categories are considered: yy Business and operational risks yy Financial risks yy Legal and regulatory risks yy Strategic risks The following techniques can be used to identify risks: yy Interviews yy Trend analysis yy Research yy Forecasting yy Analysis of past performances 4. Risk Assessment 4.1 Analyze Risks Risk analysis is carried out by identifying a specific risk based on a significant activity of the Company. Risks identified in a risk portfolio which is mentioned below is then assessed based on likelihood of the occurrence and severity of the risk. Risks are further analyzed by preparing Qualitative Risk Analysis and Quantitative Risk Analysis. Qualitative Risk Analysis – Risk is analyzed based on the subjective evaluation of probability and impact. This method is quick and convenient due to pre-defined rating scale and flexibility. No sophisticated system would be required when carrying out this method. Quantitative Risk Analysis – Risk is analyzed based on the probable estimate of time and cost. This method is time consuming due to the requirement of specific and large volumes of accurate information. 4.2 Evaluate Risks This step includes risk prioritization and comparing the necessary course of action to be taken against existing internal controls. In this process the feasibility of a course of action for prioritized risks is also evaluated in order to ensure effective allocation of resources for risk treatment. 4.3 Risk Matrix for Risk Assessment The following risk matrix is developed as a technique for analyzing and evaluating risk. This matrix mainly focuses on risk analysis based on qualitative perception. The likelihood of occurrence of a risk is determined based on past experience, industry and organizational trends and judgment. Stewardship 4 Page 125 Access Engineering PLC / Annual Report 2014/15 Enterprise Risk Management F OO PR 8 The severity of a risk is the potential financial or a non-financial loss/damage to the organization. This can also be determined based on experience, discussion, calculation, judgment etc. Based on likelihood and severity, risks are categorized into three categories where relevant actions are proposed. Accordingly risks need to be monitored, communicated and controlled. These three areas are identified based on the risk tolerance (appetite) limits agreed as given below: Impact Plan for Action Immediate Action Immediate Significant (Mitigate or (Mitigate or Action Transfer) Share) (Mitigate or Share) No Action Plan for Action Immediate )Accept or Avoid( (Mitigate or Action Moderate Transfer) (Mitigate or Share) No Action No Action Plan for Action Minor (Accept) (Accept) (Mitigate or Transfer) Likelihood Low Medium High Assessing Likelihood of a Risk Value Estimation Descriptor Indicator 1 Predictable.

Risk Response Broad risk treatment approaches are identified through the risk matrix. General control approaches that can be used as Risk Treatment are. Avoidance – Avoid the risk due to unacceptability of identified risk. Not highly recommended due to correlation of risk and opportunity. Acceptance – Risk is accepted due to insignificance, non-feasibility or ineffectiveness of an action plan. The level of risk is managed and monitored continuously. Sharing or Transfer – One of the mitigation procedures where the risk is transferred to a third party. Mitigation – Implementing feasible and effective strategic action plan to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. 6. Control Activities Appropriate control methods have been taken based on the risk appetite of the Company. 7. Communicate and Consult Effective communication is required in all stages of the risk management process. Specific approaches for risk reporting need to be implemented, such as: Risk register Residual risk report Identify new types of risk sequent position audit Periodic reviews Feedback reports 8. Monitor and Review The risk management structure/policy and framework is reviewed and updated regularly. The effectiveness of the process and actions taken is also reviewed to incorporate necessary changes.

The Board is of the view that the system of internal controls in place is sound and adequate to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Financial Statements for external purposes and is in accordance with relevant accounting principles and regulatory requirements. System of Internal Control Following features of the System of Internal Control put in place by the Board provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting. They also ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the system: yy Committees appointed by the Board to assist them in ensuring the effectiveness of Company’s daily operations and to ensure that these daily operations are within the corporate objectives, strategies and annual budget ratified by the Board. yy Internal Audit Department which is headed by the Chief Internal Auditor, carries out periodic audits on an on-going basis covering all operational projects/units to ensure the effectiveness of the system of internal control. These audits are carried out in accordance with the Annual Audit Plan approved by the Board Audit Committee and findings of the same are submitted to the Board Audit Committee for their review on a quarterly basis.

Board’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements The Board of Directors (“Board”) are responsible for the preparation of these Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and for such internal control as the Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements are free from material misstatements. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements. The procedures selected depend on the Auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the Auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries dealt with thereby as at 31st March 2015, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements As required by Section 163 (2) of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007, we state the following: (a) The basis of opinion and scope and limitations of the audit are as stated above.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Group’s principal financial liabilities, comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group has trade and other receivables, other financial assets, short-term investment and cash and short-term deposits that arrive directly from its operations. The Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarized below: 42.1 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. 42.1.1 Trade Receivables Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. The requirement for an impairment is analyzed at each Reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. Additionally, a large number of minor receivables are grouped into homogeneous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The calculation is based on actually incurred historical data.

The Company’s approach to managing is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal or stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation. To measure and mitigate liquidity risk, Company closely monitor its net operating cash flow, maintained a level of cash and cash equivalents and secured committed funding facilities from financial institutions.
