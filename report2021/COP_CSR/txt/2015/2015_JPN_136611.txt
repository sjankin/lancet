Subsidiaries Years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements (1) Description of business Nabtesco Corporation (the “Company”), a Japanese corporation, was established as a holding company on September 29, 2003, through a stock transfer process, by TS Corporation (formerly Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd.) and NABCO Ltd. As a result of the stock transfer, both TS Corporation and NABCO Ltd. became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The Company completed its business integration through the acquisition of the two wholly owned subsidiaries on October 1, 2004. The main products of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Companies”) include precision equipment, transport equipment, aircraft and oil hydraulic equipment, and industrial equipment. (2) Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and its related accounting regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. The accounts of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are based on their accounting records maintained in conformity with generally accepted principles prevailing in the respective countries of domicile. The accounts of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with either International Financial Reporting Standard or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, with adjustment for the specific five items as applicable. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restructured and translated into English from the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. Certain supplementary information included in the statutory Japanese language consolidated financial statements, but not required for fair presentation, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The translation of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars is included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan, using the prevailing exchange rate at March 31, 2014, which is ¥102.92 to U.S. $1. The convenience translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate of exchange. 115 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (1) Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its 47 subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions, account balances and unrealized profits are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in 10 affiliated companies (generally 20% to 50% owned), over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policy, are accounted for by the equity method. (2) Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposits with banks withdrawable on demand and short-term investments which are readily convertible to cash subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and which are purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. See Note 5 as to reconciliation to cash and deposits on the balance sheets. (3) Allowance for doubtful receivables The allowance for doubtful receivables is provided in amounts management considers sufficient to cover possible losses on collection. The allowance is based on past collection experience and management estimate of the collectability of individual receivables. (4) Provision for loss on order received To cover the future losses relating to order received, the provision is recorded when the future losses are anticipated and the losses are reasonably estimated. (5) Securities The Companies are required to examine the intent of holding each security and classify those securities as (a) securities held for trading purposes (hereafter, “trading securities”), (b) debt securities intended to be held to maturity, (c) equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and (d) for all other securities that are not classified in any of the above categories (hereafter, “other securities”) The Companies have no trading securities at March 31, 2014 and 2013. Held-to-maturity debt securities are expected to be held to maturity and are recognized at amortized cost computed based on the straight-line method. Other securities with available fair market values are stated at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported, net of applicable income taxes, as a separate component of Net assets. Realized gains 116 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 and losses on sale of such securities are computed using the moving-average cost method. Other securities with no available fair market value are stated at moving-average cost. If the market value of equity securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and other securities declines significantly, such securities are written down to their fair market value and the difference between fair market value and the carrying amount is recognized as loss in the period of the decline. For equity securities with no available fair market value, if the net asset amount of the investee declines significantly, such securities are written down to the net asset amount in the income statement in the period of decline. In these cases, such fair market value or net asset amount will be the carrying amount of the securities at the beginning of the next year. (6) Inventories Inventories of the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries are stated at the lower of the cost or net realizable value, while inventories of its consolidated foreign subsidiaries are principally stated at the lower of cost or market. The evaluation methods for the cost of inventories are as follows: Inventories Evaluation method Finished goods and Work in process Mainly weighted average method (however certain finished goods and work in process are determined by the specific identification method) Raw materials and Supplies Mainly weighted average method (however certain raw materials and supplies are determined by moving average method) (7) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries calculate depreciation mainly by the declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, except for the buildings acquired on or after April 1, 1998, and owned by the Company, which are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. In addition, the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries depreciate Machinery and equipment, whose acquisition cost is \100 thousand or more but less than \200 thousand, over a period of three years on a straight-line basis. The consolidated foreign subsidiaries calculate depreciation mainly by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Depreciation of assets acquired by the domestic companies after March 31, 2007 is calculated mainly by the straight-line method under the amended tax code for building, not including building fixtures and by the declining-balance method under the amended tax code for the remaining assets. 117 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 (8) Lease assets Property, plant and equipment capitalized under finance lease arrangements are depreciated over the lease term of the respective assets. Finance leases which do not transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee commenced prior to April 1, 2008 and have been accounted for as operating leases, continue to be accounted for as operating leases with disclosure of certain “as if capitalized” information. (9) Derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions The Companies use derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of mitigating fluctuation risk of interest rates with respect to loans payable and future risk of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates with respect to foreign currency receivables and payables. The basic policies for executing the derivative transactions are managed by the Board of Directors of the Company. Based on such policies, the finance departments of each company establish the internal regulations which prescribe the specified limits and procedures on the derivative transactions. After execution, each finance department has to report certain information on derivative transactions to the Board of Directors of the Company. The following summarizes hedging derivative financial instruments used by the Companies and items hedged: Hedging instruments Hedged items Interest rate swap contracts: Loans payable Foreign currency trade receivables Forward foreign exchange contracts: and trade payables The Companies evaluate hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative changes in cash flows from or the changes in fair value of hedged items and the corresponding changes in fair value of the hedging derivative instruments. The Companies are required to state derivative financial instruments at fair value and to recognize changes in the fair value as gains or losses unless derivative financial instruments meet the criteria for hedge accounting. If derivative financial instruments are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the Companies defer recognition of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments until the related losses or gains on the hedged items are recognized. If interest rate swap contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap contract is added to or deducted from the interest on the assets or liabilities for which the swap contract is executed. 118 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 If forward foreign exchange contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, hedging instruments and hedged items are accounted for in the following manner: 1) When a forward foreign exchange contract is executed to hedge an existing foreign currency receivable or payable, (a) the difference, if any, between the Japanese yen amount of the hedged foreign currency receivable or payable translated using the spot rate at the inception date of the contract and the book value of the receivable or payable is recognized in the income statement in the period which includes the inception date, and (b) the discount or premium on the contract (that is, the difference between the Japanese yen amount of the contract translated using the contracted forward rate and that translated using the spot rate at the inception date of the contract) is recognized over the term of the contract 2) When a forward foreign exchange contract is executed to hedge a future transaction denominated in a foreign currency, the future transaction will be recorded using the contracted forward rate, and no gains or losses on the forward foreign exchange contract or the forward foreign currency options are recognized. (10) Amortization Goodwill is amortized using straight-line method over a period within twenty years. However, if the amount is insignificant, it is expensed as incurred. Software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (five years). (11) Research and development costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. (12) Income taxes The Companies recognize tax effects of timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for tax reporting purpose. Income taxes comprise of corporation tax, enterprise tax and prefectural and municipal inhabitants taxes. (13) Provision for product warranties Provision for product warranties is provided to cover the estimated cost for customers’ claims relating to after sales repairs. 119 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 (14) Translation of foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the year-end rates. Financial statements of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the year-end rates, except that shareholders’ equity are translated at historical rates and income statement items resulting from transactions with the Company are translated at the rates used by the Company when the transactions occurred. Foreign currency transaction adjustment is reported in net assets. (15) Appropriation of retained earnings Under the Japanese Corporate law, the appropriation of retained earnings with respect to a given financial period is made by a resolution of the shareholders at a general meeting held subsequent to the close of such financial period. Therefore, the accounts for that period do not reflect such appropriations. (See Note 22) (16) Retirement benefits The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries provide two types of retirement and severance benefit plans, unfunded lump-sum payment plans and funded non-contributory pension plans, under which all eligible employees are entitled to benefits based on the level of wages and salaries at the time of retirement or termination, length of service and certain other factors. The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries provide allowance for employees’ severance and retirement benefits at the end of year based on estimated amounts of projected benefit obligations, actuarially calculated using certain assumptions and the fair value of the plan assets at the date. Past service costs are recognized as expense when incurred, and actuarial gains and losses are recognized as expense from the following fiscal year using the declining-balance method over a certain period (10 years) not exceeding the average of estimated remaining service period. (Change in accounting policy) Effective from the year ended March 31, 2014, the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries have applied the Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits (ASBJ Statement No. 26, May 17, 2012 (hereinafter, the “Statement No.26”)) and Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits (ASBJ Guidance No. 25, May 17, 2012 (hereinafter, the “Guidance No.25”)) except the article 35 of the Statement No.26 and the article 67 of the Guidance No.25 and actuarial gains and losses that are yet to be recognized have been recognized and the difference between retirement benefit obligations and plan assets has been recognized as a liability for retirement benefits. In accordance with the article 37 of the Statement No.26, the effect of the change in accounting policies arising from initial application has been recognized in accumulated adjustments for retirement benefit in accumulated other comprehensive income. As a result of the application, a liability for retirement benefits in the amount of ¥7,112 million ($69,102 thousand) has been recognized and accumulated other comprehensive income has decreased by ¥309 million ($3,002 thousand), at the end of the current fiscal year. The effects of this change on earnings per share are described in the related note. 120 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 (Additional information) The Company amended its retirement benefit plan on July 1, 2013. The purpose of this amendment is to raise the proportion of defined contributions in the overall retirement benefit plan from the 30% to 60% by terminating the defined-benefit pension plan and to transfer the entire amount to the defined-contribution pension plan. Following this amendment to the pension plan, an extraordinary loss of \837million ($8,133 thousand) has been recognized at the current fiscal year end. (17) Earnings per share The computation of basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock after consideration of dilution that securities or other contracts to issue common stock are exercised or converted into common stock, or resulted into issuance of common stock. Amounts per share of net assets are calculated based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the year-end. Cash dividends per share include interim dividends of the Company proposed by the Board of Directors in addition to year-end dividends approved by shareholders at the annual meeting held subsequent to the end of fiscal year. (18) Recognition of significant revenues and expenses Accounting for construction of completions When the construction work is in progress at year end and the progress rate of construction work up to that time is deemed certain, the percentage-of-completion method is applied. The progress rate is estimated using cost-to-cost method. When the above condition is not met, the completed-contract method is applied. 3.

Due to this, in calculation of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2014, the effective tax rate was changed from 38.0% of the previous year to 35.6% for temporary difference that are expected to be eliminated in the period beginning from April 1, 2014. As a result, deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities have decreased by \155 million ($1,506 thousand), and income taxes (deferred) have increased by \155 million ($1,506 thousand) for the year ended March 31, 2014, respectively. 11. Net Assets Under the Japanese Corporate Law, upon issuance of common stock, the entire amount of the issue price is required to be accounted for as common stock, although companies may, by resolution of the Board of Directors, account for an amount not exceeding one-half of the issue price of the new shares as additional paid-in capital, which is included in capital surplus. Under the Japanese Corporate Law, in cases where a dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in-capital and legal earnings reserve must be set aside as additional paid-in-capital or legal earnings reserve. Legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the Japanese Corporate Law, legal earnings reserve and additional paid-in capital could be used to eliminate or reduce a deficit by a resolution of the shareholders' meeting. Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve may not be distributed as dividends. Under the Japanese Corporate Law, however, all additional paid-in-capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends. The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Japanese Corporate Law. 136 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report 2014 12.
