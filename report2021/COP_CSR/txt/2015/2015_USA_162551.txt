This commitment is one of the reasons Kimberly-Clark has earned the trust and respect of people around the world for more than 140 years. Our vision to lead the world in the essentials for a better life is not limited to the products we provide. It also calls us to deliver them in ways that prioritize clean air and water, healthy forests and strong communities, while delivering shareholder value.

To deliver this vision, we challenge ourselves to create a better future by being responsible stewards of our shared natural resources, enhancing the lives of those who use our products and making positive contributions to the communities we touch. We do this while working to deliver superior business results and shareholder returns. Our thinking regarding the sustainability of our business has evolved since our founding in 1872, but it is part of our heritage. As we approach the conclusion of our Sustainability 2015 goals, you might be interested in a few of the accomplishments we achieved: Lisa Morden Senior Director,  Our Supplier Social Compliance Standards (SSCS) are part of KimberlyGlobal Sustainability Clark’s workplace accountability programs. In 2014, we continued to make progress on our SSCS goal by increasing key suppliers participating in the program to 87 percent of in-scope suppliers and by expanding the standards to include oversight of conflict minerals and anti-corruption compliance.  Kimberly-Clark is committed to advancing positive social change in the communities where we live and work. In 2014 we had active social programs in 97 percent of all Kimberly-Clark communities. We’re also working on initiatives such as our Toilets Change Lives program, which will support local entrepreneurs around the world who are addressing sanitation in a sustainable way.  We are committed to reducing our climate impact and are proud that we achieved a 6.9% percent reduction in our absolute greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. This exceeded our Sustainability 2015 goal of 5 percent.  We’ve exceeded our Sustainability 2015 target for net sales, set at 25 percent, from products in our EcoLogical portfolio.  As of the end of 2014, we were diverting over 88 percent of our manufacturing waste from landfills. We also implemented several programs aimed at reducing waste at the end of the product lifecycle.

As we look to Kimberly-Clark’s 150th anniversary in 2022, how will we use principles of sustainability to further deliver essentials for a better life? This question has been at the heart of our work to develop our Sustainability 2022 platform and the next set of goals that it will entail. This work was built on an analysis of the global mega-trends that will impact our business, followed by a collaborative process involving our internal stakeholders, business and brand leaders and other participants. Using our 2013 materiality assessment and our analysis of global trends as a guide, we engaged this broader group in a number of business and regional workshops that took place throughout 2014. This process allowed us to prioritize issues based on their relevance to the business as well as the potential impact we could have, including: PEOPLE: Investing in innovative social programs so people who lack the basic essentials in life – sanitation, health, well-being – get the help they need; PLANET: Reducing pressure on precious natural resources with the development of sustainable alternatives; PRODUCTS: And innovating to extend the life of product and packaging materials. I look forward to sharing our specific goals with you soon.

Nearly one quarter of the world’s population purchases our products every day and experiences the health, hygiene and other social benefits they offer. We recognize the responsibility this gives us, and we extend our role by also supporting communities where families get the essentials they need to grow and thrive. This includes programming that expands access to essentials such as sanitation facilities. These values extend to our team members. Their talent, diversity and commitment are crucial to our innovation and success. Our work environment fosters personal and professional growth and nurtures innovation through product development and customer solutions while upholding safe and ethical working conditions. Our global team works together in a spirit of cooperation and trust to lead the world in the essentials for a better life. Our materiality assessment and stakeholder engagements have shown that social compliance and social impact are the issues of most relevance to our internal and external stakeholders. See how we’re specifically addressing these material issues in the pages that follow. Color -> White -> Black -> 2 0 1 4 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT | 9 PEOPLE S OCIAL COMPL IAN C E Within our supply chain, there are a range of sustainability-related issues that, if not properly managed, could present potential risks to our ongoing success. These include human rights concerns, corruption and worker safety. Our corporate social compliance program takes a risk-based approach to predicting and preventing potential business disruptions to ensure that our supply chain is responsible, resilient and is operating with high integrity and ethics. S OCIAL IMPAC T Through the Kimberly-Clark Foundation and our community impact programs, we help those in need through a range of health, humanitarian, economic and environmental initiatives. The Foundation maintains strategic partnerships with global organizations that address issues related to our business, our consumers and our customers. We aim to deliver social benefits through leading brands like Kleenex®, Huggies®, Kotex® and Depend®. Through this combination of brand-led commercial programming, retail execution, partnerships and Kimberly-Clark Foundation support, we seek to achieve meaningful and lasting change while growing brand equity. Additionally, we create unique opportunities for employee engagement in direct support of the identified missions.

Implementing our Accelerated Development program is helping us ensure that our top talent is ready for senior roles and has the necessary exposure and sponsorship to support them in their success. In addition, we ensure all director-level and above jobs open within the company have a diverse slate of candidates. Our aspiration is to “Unleash the Power of our People” to lead the world in the essentials for a better life. Increasing the representation of women (globally) and ethnic minorities (U.S.) in senior management positions (defined as director-level and above) is part of our ongoing diversity and inclusion strategy. By embedding our core Diversity & Inclusion values as an integral part of our business strategy, we are able to further foster senior-level leadership commitment. In 2014, we received the Catalyst Award, acknowledging the progress we have made in advancing and promoting women and the culture we have created that enables us to attract and retain our top talented women at Kimberly-Clark. P R OTECTIN G HUMA N R I G H T S Our commitment to protecting human rights continues our heritage of fairness, honesty and integrity. This commitment is formalized in our Human Rights in Employment Policy and our Code of Conduct. Our policies align with the goals of several international standards, including the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and those of the UN Global Compact. We respect international social compliance and environmental principles aimed at promoting and protecting human rights and the environment. We also promote human rights in our supply chain. We do this through our Supplier Social Compliance Standards, which set the expectation for suppliers to demonstrate that they are identifying, preventing, mitigating and accounting for human rights violations, with a focus on countries at high risk for human rights abuses. Companies within our contract manufacturing supply chain, including our packaging supply chain, are expected to sign annual declarations of compliance. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our efforts to ensure compliance with the Code of Conduct, other internal policies and certain legal and regulatory requirements.

The company relies on its Code of Conduct to guide interaction with suppliers, partners, customers and consumers worldwide. C ASE STUDIES In an effort to ensure more active oversight of key external suppliers, Kimberly-Clark established a Corporate Social Compliance program in 2012 which has managed more than 250 audits of supplier workplaces in more than 25 countries since its inception. Audits MAT E RI A L I T Y support suppliers in meeting rigorous standards in areas like work hours and wages, Primary Material Issue: eliminating discrimination, freedom of association and collective bargaining, safe workplaces SOCIAL COMPLIANCE and protections against child and forced labor.

Compliance We use a variety of factors to determine which suppliers fall within the scope of this audit program. This approach allows Kimberly-Clark to direct auditing resources to areas with the most significant risk of human rights issues. In 2014, we completed 122 social compliance audits, driving improved working conditions for more than 35,000 employees across our supply chain. Where audits identified conditions in violation of audit standards, we provided mitigation instructions and required suppliers to verify what measures they implemented to resolve the violation(s).

Millions of girls miss school every month because menstruation becomes too hard to manage without proper facilities. And countless children are absent from school because of the spread of disease and infection from a lack of C ASE STUDIES basic sanitation. At Kimberly-Clark, we are taking action to help provide the basic essentials of sanitation. This aligns to our mission and our core value of caring, and it is important for our future MAT E RI A L I T Y business growth. Primary Material Issue: SOCIAL IMPACT In 2014, we co-founded the Toilet Board Coalition, a group of leading companies, government agencies, sanitation experts and non-profit organizations, which aims to develop commercially sustainable and scalable solutions to the sanitation crisis. Beyond the financial support provided to the coalition, we are also contributing through our people – who bring a variety of skills, from marketing, sales and finance to research and engineering – to accelerate the agenda of the coalition. “” With a donation of £250,000 from Kimberly-Clark through our partnership with Andrex, we’re on the ground in rural Angola, helping empower local communities to build their own safe and clean toilets using local materials. Together, we’ll be able to transform the lives of 60,000 people and help stop children dying from preventable diseases like diarrhea. Thank you, Kimberly-Clark, for supporting us in our journey to help make the world open-defecation free. — Sarah Mitchell, Head of Partnerships Development at UNICEF 1 WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP), released in early 2013 (collected in 2011); Improved sanitation includes sanitation facilities that hygienically separate human excreta from human contact. Color -> White -> Black -> 2 0 1 4 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT | 1 4 PEOPLE We also implemented a pilot program in the United Kingdom with our Andrex bath tissue brand in partnership with UNICEF and commercial retailer Sainsbury’s. We invited consumers to join this effort by purchasing special promotional packs of Andrex bath tissue. A portion of sales from every pack purchased went to support UNICEF’s efforts in Angola to expand access to sanitation and meet national sanitation targets. The pilot was a great success, showing that our brands can do well by doing good. Our results helped 60,000 people gain access to sanitation and the strong consumer engagement helped sell one million rolls of Andrex.

EN VIR ON MEN TAL CO MP LI A N C E Kimberly-Clark navigates a range of environmental issues that are potential risks to our ongoing success. Operating in compliance with environmental regulatory requirements is fundamental to managing our business. Our efforts go beyond environmental regulatory compliance while building predictive and preventative measures. In 2014, Kimberly-Clark received a total of 12 notices of violations from environmental regulatory agencies. Of these regulatory notices, six involved minor environmental releases and six were related to environmental permitting procedures. We are continuously improving our initiatives to be increasingly transparent regarding our current performance while developing a standard for predicting and preventing environmental compliance challenges and their business impacts.

Protecting the world’s forests is critical to addressing climate change and conserving terrestrial biodiversity, but deforestation continues to be a global concern. Through our membership in the Consumer Goods Forum, we are committed to helping them achieve zero net deforestation by 2020. In addition, major environmental groups, including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund, have recognized Kimberly-Clark as a market leader for responsible fiber sourcing and forest protection. We aim to extend our leadership by reducing our impact and dependence on natural forests through the development of sustainable alternative natural fibers while increasing our use of Environmentally Preferred Fibers (EPF) such as recycled fibers and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified fiber. We are also continuing our long-standing commitment to a 100 percent certified fiber supply through our preference for FSC-certified fiber supply and are committed to zero deforestation, free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) and protection of high conservation value forest ecosystems, including peat lands. WASTE Kimberly-Clark products meet the essential needs of people every day, and our waste programs challenge us to design products and packaging with smarter materials, to produce them more efficiently and to find a second life that sustains their value after use. As we continue to encourage waste recycling and the elimination of the use of landfills to dispose of manufacturing waste, we are bringing new emphasis to the resources left behind after our customers and consumers use our products. WATER Water is a resource that is essential to Kimberly-Clark’s business. Because we use large amounts of water in our manufacturing processes and because water is vital to human and ecosystem health, we have invested significant capital to minimize our absolute water use and to support the water needs of communities in which we operate.

(DNV GL) was commissioned by Kimberly-Clark Corporation to conduct independent assurance of its 2014 Global Sustainability Report (‘the Report’), as published on the company’s website at http://www.kimberly-clark.com/ sustainability.aspx Our assurance engagement was planned and carried out in accordance with the DNV GL Protocol for Verification of Sustainability Reporting, VeriSustainTM. We evaluated the Report for adherence to the VeriSustainTM Principles (‘the Principles’) of stakeholder inclusiveness, materiality, responsiveness, completeness, neutrality, and reliability. We evaluated the performance data using the reliability principle. It was agreed with Kimberly-Clark that the performance data in scope were: Energy; Water; and Waste as well as any applicable claims in the Report relating to that data. Information presented in the Report, with the exception of financial information presented in the Corporate Overview, was included in the scope of our assurance engagement. We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance opinion. We are providing a limited level of assurance. R ESPON S IBIL ITIES O F K I MB E R LY-C LA R K C O R P O R AT I O N AN D OF THE ASSU R A N C E P R O V I D E R S Kimberly-Clark has sole responsibility for preparation of the Report. DNV GL, in performing our assurance work, is responsible to Kimberly-Clark’s management. Our statement, however, represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform all stakeholders including Kimberly-Clark. DNV GL was not involved in the preparation of any part of the Report except for this Assurance Statement. This is our sixth year of providing assurance for Kimberly-Clark. We adopt a balanced approach towards all stakeholders when performing our evaluation. DNV GL’s assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by the client to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith. DNV GL expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Assurance Statement. Our team comprised: Tom Gosselin and Natasha D’Silva.

We undertook the following activities:  We conducted interviews with senior executives and managers based in Roswell, GA, Neenah, WI, Irving, TX, Reigate, United Kingdom, and Sao Paulo, Brazil who are responsible for areas of management and stakeholder relationships covered by the Report. The objective of these discussions was to understand top level commitment and strategy related to corporate responsibility and Kimberly-Clark’s governance arrangements, stakeholder engagement activity, management priorities, and systems;  We visited one facility in Loudon, Tennessee. During the on-site visit, we met with the plant manager, environmental coordinator, health and safety coordinator, and human resource manager to assess controls and processes present at the operational level in comparison with claims made at the Group level and to conduct a review of data samples on indicators contributing to the Report.  We conducted a general review of issues that could be relevant to Kimberly-Clark’s operations and policies to provide a check on the appropriateness of statements made in the Report;  We assessed documentation and evidence that supported and substantiated claims made in the Report;  We interviewed internal auditors responsible for internal data verification, reviewed their work processes and approach, and discussed specific competencies related to data verification;  We provided feedback on the Report based on our assurance scope. OPIN ION On the basis of the work conducted, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Report does not properly describe Kimberly-Clark’s adherence to the Principles. In terms of reliability of the performance data, nothing came to our attention to suggest that these data have not been properly collated from information reported at the operational level, nor that the assumptions used were not appropriate.

Kimberly-Clark is extremely active in sustainability and upholds a commitment to driving social, environmental, and economic improvement throughout its business operations and value chain. This is seen through the company’s collaborative efforts and memberships with industry organizations working to address issues that are among Kimberly-Clark’s most material sustainability issues along with multiple awards won by its global operations. A culture of stakeholder engagement is evident at all levels of the organization and the company is able to demonstrate that sustainability is embedded within most engagement activities. There are strong examples of the company working with stakeholders to reduce environmental impact and to increase positive social impacts. We also commend KimberlyClark for its work with its global supply chain through its standards, supplier summits, risk assessments, and audit actions to support continuous improvement among its suppliers. Materiality: identification of those issues which are necessary for stakeholders to make informed judgments concerning the organization and its impacts. The report addresses the most material environmental and social issues facing the company and its stakeholders. Kimberly-Clark has used the sustainability materiality assessment conducted in 2013 to confirm the topics covered in the report. Furthermore, through its ongoing stakeholder engagement efforts, Kimberly-Clark has demonstrated that it has established processes for identifying the issues stakeholders view as significant and the report content addresses this feedback. As Sustainability 2015 will be coming to a close at the end of this calendar year, the company has begun to develop its next generation sustainability strategy and goals which have been informed by the outcomes of its materiality assessment. In order to drive internal engagement and informed decision-making related to cost-benefits of its efforts to reduce environmental impacts of its global operations, at both the corporateand site-levels, Kimberly-Clark has dedicated significant resources to measuring the return on investment of specific sustainability objectives. The company is applying its learning from its initial focus of energy-related initiatives to other issues of significance such as fiber and water consumption. This helps to drive capital and resources towards site-level initiatives that support targets identified as material. Color -> White -> Black -> 2 0 1 4 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT | 6 2 I N D E P E N D E N T A S S U R A N C E S TAT E M E N T While the company has begun to assess the return on investment on initiatives such as Toilets Change Lives, we recommend that as Kimberly-Clark increases its strategic focus on investing in programs that help it achieve its social objectives, the company develop more robust criteria to track and measure its social benefits. This can support the company in better articulating the impact of initiatives to both internal and external stakeholders. Responsiveness: the extent to which the organization responds to stakeholder issues Stakeholder ideas and concerns influence decision-making throughout the organization. This is particularly evident through innovative and collaborative initiatives addressing sustainability challenges throughout the company’s value chain. Examples include the development of the Alternative Natural Fiber Standard with the Rainforest Alliance and other partners to increasing diversion rates in the post-consumer waste stream through projects such as RightCycle which have required inputs from both customers and suppliers. Kimberly-Clark has also developed internal mechanisms through the Product Stewardship Council to proactively address changing market concerns on a global basis in its operational landscape and relating to its personal care products. We welcome Kimberly-Clark’s commitment to extend the impact of the Product Stewardship Council beyond the personal care portfolio. Completeness: how much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organization and its stakeholders is reported Kimberly-Clark’s reporting of performance including the disclosure of data is comprehensive. Re-statements to performance indicators arising out of organizational boundary changes from the divestment of its Healthcare division are considered to be adequate. Neutrality: the extent to which a report provides a balanced account of the organization’s performance, delivered in a neutrality tone The tone in the Report is considered neutral with no obvious and deliberate intent to unduly influence the reader. The report outlines a number of challenges that Kimberly-Clark currently faces including environmental compliance and waste diversion. Performance indicators are disclosed in an unbiased manner. We recommend that Kimberly-Clark disclose its plans to address these challenges moving forward – both as the company reflects on sustainability 2015 and as it updates readers on objectives related to Sustainability 2022. Color -> White -> Black -> 2 0 1 4 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT | 6 3 I N D E P E N D E N T A S S U R A N C E S TAT E M E N T Reliability: the accuracy and comparability of information presented in the Report, as well as the quality of underlying data management systems Sustainability 2015 goals and performance are generally presented in a clear manner. The specified data presented in the report are considered to be reliable and accurate as minimal technical errors have been identified based on the sampling conducted by internal audit at the corporate level and by DNV GL at the site level. Kimberly-Clark has implemented a new data management platform which has greatly reduced the risk to data accuracy including those resulting from conversion and typing errors as well as those resulting from misinterpretation of regional variances such as emission factors. We recommend that as the company continues the rollout of this platform globally that further training is provided to data managers at the site level to help them better understand the capabilities of the new system thereby increasing their confidence in the database reporting outputs and reducing the risk of local data coordinators continuing to maintain spreadsheets as a primary form of data collection and collation.
