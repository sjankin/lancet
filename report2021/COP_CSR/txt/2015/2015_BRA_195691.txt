The fertilizer is placed in the planting area and, through decomposition, it slowly releases the nutrients present in the organic compound. The chemical fertilizer is formed by chemical compounds originating from mining or industrially made and brings the acronym NPK indicating that the product contains the most important elements in the development of soil: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Organo-mineral fertilizer on the other hand is the organic compound plus In 2014, the company providing collection, transportation, disposal, potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus. and recycling services of waste By mixing these minerals into to generated by private companies organic compound, this decreases the reached the goal of business consumption of pure NPK, and thus expansion by entering new markets reduces dependence on imports. and expanding geographically in Organosolví is Solví Group’s fertilizers such as potassium, order to position itself strategically company specialized in organic nitrogen, and phosphorus.

With this initiative, Group Solví innovated the market, offering a green solution in a pioneering way at a time when the country is in high demand, especially for sustainable sources. With the shortage of supply, companies are investing in alternative sources of electricity. Today, 80% of the megawatts produced in Brazil come from hydroelectric plants. Thus, biogas is one of the leading alternatives of power generation. B u si n e ss Hig h l ig h t s – Solví ENERGY VALORIZATION B u si n e ss Hig h l ig h t s – Solví ENERGY VALORIZATION And let there be light! The two thermal power plants, priority projects of the Group’s WTE area, will be inaugurated in 2015, thus contributing to the supply of clean energy in the current high-demand scenario. The Minas do Leão plant received an investment of R$ 50 million. It will have an installed capacity of about 8.5 MW/h, receiving daily a good part of the municipal waste of Porto Alegre (RS), a daily average of 2,400 tons. For the Caieiras plant, the investment was R$ 150 million. The plant has a capacity of 27 MW/h and will receive about 8000 tons of waste per day. Salvador Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Salvador, it is the first thermal power plant fueled by biogas in the Northeast region with a capacity to generate about 20 MW. The unit receives biogas captured from Salvador’s metropolitan landfill, which is managed by Battre, another company of the Solví Group, processes it, and uses it as fuel. In 2014, Termoverde redesigned its operating model from a fixed amount to a variable per MW/h, which was implemented in January, and this had a positive impact on its profitability. The company has been committed to increasing the volume of energy generated, reaching 12.64 MWm. 80 Annual Report 2015 Annual Report 2015 81 Solví today is one of the largest private operators of urban systems of water and sanitation in Brazil. It has a solid technical base and the most advanced technologies make it possible to combine high productivity, quality, and permanent respect for the environment.

The CPAs are responsible for the average output of 3.93 million m3 of treated water. All CPAs have an average of 200 meters deep, which is the standard required by environmental legislation, as well as having chlorine, which is the guarantee of drinking water. As for the sewer system, it operates with one integrated and 34 isolated units that have emerged to meet the growing demand as a result of population growth. In May 2014, São Gabriel Sanitation, the utility company responsible for water supply and sanitation services in the city of São Gabriel (RS), completed two years of concession and is becoming known for its quality services. A satisfaction survey conducted by Innovation Surveys in Porto Alegre (RS) points to the community’s approval: 77.8% of the residents are satisfied with the services provided by the company. The study was conducted in 32 districts of the city divided into ten regions.
