We believe that companies in their function as good corporate citizens can create both business and societal value when addressing social, environmental and ethical challenges. The CSR Policy mandates EKF’s work with environmental and social sustainability in relation to our stakeholders, in the transactions we guarantee as well as internally in EKF. EKF’s CSR Policy constitutes an umbrella for other rela­­ted policies, including policies on openness and code of conduct as well as on environmental and so­­ cial sustainability on the transactions we guarantee. With our Openness Policy our aim is transparency. We disclose information on the transactions we participate in on our website while respecting customer confidentiality.

Also part of our CSR Policy is the recognition that EKF as a state-owned entity has an important responsibility in promoting human rights, both in the transactions we are part of as well as internally in EKF.
