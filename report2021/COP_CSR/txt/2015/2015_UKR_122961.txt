Coping with information challenges As a law-abiding provider of programme service VOLIA amends the list of channels that are broadcasted in our feature packages based on the decision of eligible authorities the National Television and Radio Broadcasting Council of Ukraine, or the court. In addition, neither the operator nor the provider has legal right in Ukraine to interfere in the content of the programmes that are broadcasted on the network (the laws of Ukraine «On Television and Radio» and «On Telecommunications»). Abiding the law is our prerogative, so regarding Russian channels VOLIA company clearly followed current Ukrainian legislation. Unfortunately, during 2014 Russian news channels did not demonstrate objectivity and balance on the events in Ukraine, furthermore, they turned into tools of information war against our country. There was no consensus among Ukrainian spectators regarding the blocking of these channels. However, an obvious lie and calls for war with Ukraine that our customers were receiving through Russian channels, forced them to accept the opinion of the National Television and Radio Broadcasting Council of Ukraine on temporary suspension of broadcasting these channels. March 26, 2014 VOLIA received a resolution of the Kyiv District Administrative Court of 25 March to suspend broadcasting channels «НТВ Мир», «РТР Планета», «Первый канал. Всемирная сеть»and «Россия 24» in all feature packages of provider’s software service in Ukraine. Later, by the decision of the newly elected National Council an access to the channels ТВЦ, РВК and «История» was also suspended. Therewith, the company adhered to such important issues as informing subscribers and owners of changes in feature packages beforehand and replacement of the channels the access to which was temporarily denied, by the others. 6 Non-financial report of VOLIA company VOLIA today One of the leaders of The leader of the Ukrainian the domestic entertainment segment market of cable covering about television with 3.5 million households over 20% in 33 cities of Ukraine The number of Makes the top subscribers of The number three of Internet VOLIA’s Internet of users of market and TV more HD-package in the country than 1.8 million about 100 thousand More than 17 thousand VOLIA subscribers Data Center’s in all corners of capacity Ukraine are using 8000 units interactive TV VOLIA’s investments in VOLIA innovation and Data Center’s Number of employees 2000 technical modernization power consumption of networks in 2014 1 MW more than 310 million hrn. 7 Non-financial report of VOLIA company Changes in the reporting New face of national brand In early 2014 VOLIA began a gradual restyling: the quality and customer experience.
