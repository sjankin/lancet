Atea has focus on the environment and ensuring that the company's operations should have as little environmental impact as possible. Atea also places emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR) both in attitudes and in actions internal/external. Issues due to CSR is seen in different activities according to continually refine employees well-being, health and power as well as in analyzing our supply chains and supporting specific projects in developing countries worldwide. Atea has launched an effort to formalize its guidelines for vendors and implement a declaration that will be part of vendor agreements. Furthermore, procedures are established under which senior Atea employees must sign a declaration stating that they understand the code of ethics and perform their work in accordance with this code. This will help ensure that Atea’s Corporate Social Responsibility requirements are met by the company and its suppliers. Objective and measures Atea's objective is to maintain the solid work and the results achieved in relation to environmental and CSR work, by the company itself and in collaboration with its customers. The existing solutions are continuously being improved and offered to customers as part of the portfolio. CDP reports and Carbon Footprint reports are to be followed up on, and internal projects, including One Infrastructure, completed. One challenge which Atea has to face is the fact that the company does not produce any products itself, and the company is, therefore, to some degree dependent on its suppliers, in their own interest, living up to the code of ethics. Atea’s objective, therefore, is to constantly ensure that suppliers have their own guidelines and that these are followed. The largest international suppliers are at the efforts to ensure ethical guidelines within their ranks.
