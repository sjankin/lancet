At Guardian this year we aim to deliver key training modules to our contractors and employees around the world to cover anti-corruption training. Alongside our new ISO accreditation, this will go a long way to help our people to understand what we expect of them regarding ethics and integrity. Guardian has been a key follower and member of the International Code of Conduct, which covers some very important aspects of Human Rights issues. Guardian has taken on these principles from the outset and will always strive to maintain and increase these standards across our policies and procedures. One of our strengths as a company is the ability to hire extremely competent individuals, delivering the highest of standards to our clients. We have also learned that it is equally important to develop our youth and talent within the company and we will be announcing our coaching programme this year which will cover this aspect of our growth through the development of labour standards. When it comes to the environmental category I have asked some key individuals within the company to develop a scheme within the organisation that allows our people to be involved with the environmental aspects of our business, I look forward to hearing about this in the near future. We are certainly very excited about the year ahead and how we can incorporate UNGC principles into our rapidly growing business. James Kirsop-Taylor CEO, Guardian Global Resources Limited Communication on Progress www.guardian-gr.com Guardian Global Resources Ltd enquiries@guardian-gr.com Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Assessment Guardian Global Resources Ltd has an operational footprint both in the Indian Ocean HRA and the Gulf of Guinea and there is a realistic chance that during the execution of their duties, our Staff will encounter situations where they will have to deal with Human Rights issues. As part of our commitment to our operationally deployed and support staff, Guardian Global Resources is dedicated to delivering first class training to all its personnel. The Human Rights training is formed of two parts; initial training which is delivered during an employee’s induction and refresher training which is conducted annually thereafter. The training is structured to cover the following points:  Definition of Human Rights  Historical overview of Human Rights  Montreux Document 2008  Importance of Human Rights  International Code of Conduct  Conduct of Personnel  Management and Governance  ISO PAS 28007 Aspects of Human Rights Guardian Global Resources adheres to the following legislation and codes drawn up by sovereign governments and international agencies:  European Convention on Human Rights  Human Rights Act 1998  Montreux Document 2008  UNCLOS 1982  SOLAS Guardian Global Resources also believes that it has responsibilities and commitments that extend beyond its statutory obligations to comply with legislation. Guardian Global Resources aims to be a force for good wherever we operate and we plan to work with all our clients to ensure that we conform to the relevant legislation in all our jurisdictions. To that end we voluntarily and actively support the following codes of practice:  International Code of Conduct for Private Security Provides (ICoC)  UN Global Compact (UNGC) Communication on Progress www.guardian-gr.com Guardian Global Resources Ltd enquiries@guardian-gr.com  UN Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR)  ISO/PAS 28007  Montreux Document All Staff both operational and non-operational are required to conform to these codes. Where Guardian Global Resources employs overseas contractors, they are trained to the required Guardian Global Resources standard. Continuation training and monitoring is conducted to ensure compliance and understanding of the code. This training is recorded on personal training records for permanent staff and in the Contractor Handbook. Implementation Guardian Global Resources has a Whistle Blowing Policy in place that allows all permanent staff and contractors alike to report any suspected Human Rights violations from either contractors or clients alike whilst operationally deployed. Human Rights Training All staff and contractors are given formal training and presentations on the following:  Definition of Human Rights  Historical overview of Human Rights  Montreux Document 2008  Importance of Human Rights  International Code of Conduct  Conduct of Personnel  Management and Governance  ISO PAS 28007 Aspects of Human Rights In addition to this, all operationally deployed contractors are given role specific training which includes:  Guardian Global Resources’ Rules for the Use of Force  Escalation of Force  Use of Lethal Force  Guardian’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)  Stowaway/Detainee Policy Training is conducted during the initial induction phase of employment and is recorded on a personal training record. Thereafter, refresher training is conducted annually to permanent staff and contractors alike to ensure that they remain current and competent in the handling of Human Rights issues. Where Guardian Global Resources uses overseas contractors we make certain that they are trained in line with current Guardian Global Resources policies and ethos. In addition to this, we also engage the services of a local manpower recruitment agency to ensure that we conform to local employment law and to assist in the delivery of all Guardian Global Resources’ company training ethos and company policies. Communication on Progress www.guardian-gr.com Guardian Global Resources Ltd enquiries@guardian-gr.com Plans for 2015 – 2016 In the forthcoming year Guardian Global Resources plans too:  Regularly review our policies and procedures to ensure that lessons are learnt and that our methodologies are being amended and improved periodically  Continue to enhance our training provision in respect of Human Rights  Achieve ISO/PAS 28007 Stage 2 Accreditation  Achieve PSC 1 Standard Accreditation  Work more closely with our partners and clients to ensure that we have an excellent understanding of their Human Rights policies and procedures Labour Principle 3: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Assessment At Guardian Global Resources we are committed to providing opportunities for our people to develop, achieve their professional aspirations and enjoy successful and rewarding careers within the company. This commitment is reflected in our selection and recruitment policy and is underpinned by our staff training programme. Guardian Global Resources aims to create an environment that welcomes and respects the different perspectives of our staff, as well as those of our clients and suppliers. Where we have a footprint in an overseas country, Guardian Global Resources has formed partnerships with local companies with the aim of providing financial investment and supporting local growth. By having this type of infrastructure in place, we can ensure that our partners keep us fully up-to-date in all jurisdictions and make certain that we conform to all relevant employment laws. Through these partnerships, Guardian Global Resources is making a true commitment to the employment of local nationals and utilising locally skilled trade persons. We recognise the need to train our staff in the policies and ethos of the company, ensuring that they fully understand the nature of the business and are clear on the standards and behaviour that we expect from our staff and contractors. We are mindful of all local traditions and always conform to Human Rights and Labour Standards. Communication on Progress www.guardian-gr.com Guardian Global Resources Ltd enquiries@guardian-gr.com Implementation Guardian Global Resources has a number of key policies in place which guarantee that all our staff and contractors have a good understanding of the company vision and the type of behaviour which is expected. In addition to these policies we have comprehensive guidelines to safeguard our staff, these are as follows:  Contractor Media policy  Conduct of personnel policy  Equality and Diversity policy  Health and Safety policy  Whistleblowing policy  Drugs and Alcohol policy  Ethical Practices policy  Human Rights Policy All staff are given induction training upon enrolment and subsequently annual refresher training to ensure that they remain up-to-date with industry required qualifications and with company policies. In addition to this, permanent staff and contractors alike are issued with a handbook which contains key information on company ethos, ethics policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). For all permanent staff we have a structured induction package which is to be completed within the first weeks of employment. The aim of this is to give a good understanding of the company, the visions and goals, and to raise awareness of company policies. All contractors are given a similar formal training package which again explains about Guardian Global Resources, its vision and goals, company ethics and policies. Further to this, our contractors are reminded of all industry related legislation, and interviewed by Guardian to verify their qualifications and assess their suitability for becoming a Guardian Contractor. Personal Development Guardian Global Resources takes its commitment to personal development very seriously. All permanent staff receive regular formal appraisals where they are given the opportunity to review and give feedback on their personal progress and that of the company. Employees are actively encouraged to take a degree of ownership over their career path within the company and budgets are put in place to develop individuals’ skillsets. Contractors also receive formal feedback on their performances including recognition for high quality work. Equally where it is found that staff do not meet the required standard then a remedial training plan is drawn up to help the individual to improve. Plans for 2015 – 2016 In the forthcoming year Guardian Global Resources plans too:  Review current staffing levels to ensure that people are not overstretched  Review current qualifications of staff and implement additional specialist training where necessary or desired  Provide a mentoring programme for more junior members of staff  Provide support and training to assist staff in achieving their personal development goals Communication on Progress www.guardian-gr.com Guardian Global Resources Ltd enquiries@guardian-gr.com Environment Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: Encourage the development and effective diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Assessment Guardian Global Resources is committed to improving our company’s understanding and awareness of the environmental challenges associated with our industry. As a global company with offices in multiple locations, we recognise how important it is to consider the impact of our day to day business operations on the environments in which we operate. We must not only remain conscious of our footprint, but strive to improve our performance wherever possible. Our Environmental Policy states that the managers and staff at Guardian Global Resources (GGR) are aware of and committed to:  Continual improvement of environmental performance  Prevention of pollution and minimisation of environmental impacts  Compliance with applicable legal requirements  The development of realistic and achievable environmental objectives and targets  Working with contractors to minimise potential environmental impacts  The communication of the environmental policy both within GGR and to external interested and relevant parties. During 2015, Guardian’s plan for improving our environmental impact will fall into three broad categories: 1. Improving employees’ environmental understanding and awareness 2. Reducing carbon footprint 3. Reducing office waste Implementation As a small firm, environmental factors have not featured prominently in our policies or in the routines of our daily operations to date. As we grow, it is important that employees are more aware of the impact that their actions have on the environment around them. Guardian have a number of plans in place for 2015 to improve employee awareness and understanding of environmental concerns. The nature of our business means that we are constantly transporting people to different parts of the world. With environmental concerns in mind, our contractors are always expected to travel on public transport rather than using private cars or taxis and wherever possible we fly them directly to Communication on Progress www.guardian-gr.com Guardian Global Resources Ltd enquiries@guardian-gr.com their final destination and always on normal chartered flights. To reduce transiting costs further, we try to use local partners and staff wherever possible. As Guardian grows and acquires larger premises, it will be important for us to put a number of initiatives in place in our offices. Office waste is not something that has featured on our company’s agenda to date, but the issue will be given more precedence in 2015. Plans for 2015 – 2016 Guardian’s plans for developing our environmental considerations in 2015 fall into three broad categories: Improving Employees’ Environmental Understanding and Awareness A plan for improving employees’ environmental awareness is being formulated for 2015. We will be choosing a topic of focus every month which will be announced on noticeboards and by email. The emphasis will be on making one small change every month such as a ‘Think before you print’ campaign and a Boris Bike challenge. Reducing Carbon Footprint In 2015 we are planning to install video conferencing facilities to reduce the need for staff to travel to our offices for meetings and briefings. This is particularly relevant for contractors who currently visit the office before and after travelling overseas for preand post-deployment briefings. Also, as the company continues to expand internationally, this facility will be beneficial for maintaining contact across our international locations and time zones. Further to this, we are looking to promote green initiatives in our London HQ, such as shutting down computers and TV screens at night, switching off all lights and power switches when not in use and acquiring plants to improve the air quality of our city centre location. Reducing Office Waste In the following year, Guardian Global Resources plans to:  Lobby our Managing Agent to improve facilities for the disposal of office waste and recycling.  Use less paper through a ‘Think before you print’ initiative and by setting machines to print double-sided by default.  Recycle our current ink cartridges and source remanufactured replacements. Communication on Progress www.guardian-gr.com Guardian Global Resources Ltd enquiries@guardian-gr.com Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Assessment Guardian Global Resources is committed to the very highest of ethical standards in relation to its business integrity and that of its client base. We have a detailed ethical practices policy which clearly sets out our stance on anti-corruption and bribery. At Guardian Global Resources we recognise the real threat and danger to our staff and contractors in relation to anti-corruption and bribery and we aim to mitigate these risks with the policies and procedures we have in place such as anti-corruption, anti-bribery and ethical practices policies. The Bribery Act 2010 is the over-arching legislation which forms the basis of our policy, and assists the CEO in his wish to embed a culture of best practice in anti-corruption and anti-bribery measures across the company. Implementation Guardian Global Resources’ anti-bribery and corruption policy states that we do not pay bribes directly or indirectly, and that we expect business partners to adhere to principles of integrity that are consistent with our own. These principles apply with particular force to commercial agents, representatives and subcontractors. This policy is a key part of all staff and contractor induction training and annual refresher training which is signed off on an individual training record. The Guardian Global Resources policy covers:  Business integrity  Bribery  Corruption  Kickbacks  Facilitation payments  Public officials  Gifts  Hospitality and expenses  Personal conflicts of interest  Charitable donations  Political activities  Business relationships As part of Guardian Global Resources’ commitment to Industry compliance we conduct regular internal audits of all key business areas. Audits include a review of all aspects of compliance regarding local and international law as well as company policy. We have a robust follow-up process for all actions identified. Communication on Progress www.guardian-gr.com Guardian Global Resources Ltd enquiries@guardian-gr.com Internal Whistleblowing Guardian Global Resources’ employees are encouraged to make an anonymous report, in line with our Whistleblowing Policy if they suspect that a staff member is engaging in unacceptable or unethical conduct – including corruption – and if they feel unable to raise the issue with their line manager. This principle extends to similar situations relating to agents and clients alike. Plans for 2015 – 2016 In the forthcoming year Guardian Global Resources plans too:  Review our current training programme, run refresher courses as appropriate for both overseas and UK-based contractors.  Promote the importance of this policy to all Guardian Global Resources employees  Ensure that partners, agents and suppliers alike are aware of our policy and conform to Guardian Global Resources’ ethical practices, anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies.
