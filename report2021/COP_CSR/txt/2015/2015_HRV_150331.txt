Dukat Dairy Industry Inc. COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 Statement of continued support and business challenges It is my pleasure to present to you our third Communication on Progress, as a demonstration of application and commitment to the United Nations Global Compact principles, covering the activities of Dukat Dairy Industry Inc. in the area of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption in 2014. Responsible business operation has always been the strategic focus of our company, whether it concerns the relationship with employees, consumers, business partners, social community or attitude towards the environment. Assuming the responsibility for the role and influence of our company on the local community, and wider, is an integral part of our business strategy and commitment to sustainable business operation. We systematically apply and promote the United Nations Global Compact principles in the area of human rights protection, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Nevertheless, we emphasize that the context of Dukat’s socially responsible operations is significantly wider. Incentives to primary and sustainable agricultural production, especially milk production, are of great significance for the company and for the community in which we operate. Furthermore, we invest our knowledge and experience in promotion of proper and balanced nutrition and healthy habits. Croatian economy has faced its sixth consecutive year of deep economic crisis and its negative effects on the agricultural and dairy sectors. Negative economic and sector trends continued in 2014: from increase in unemployment rate, further decline in purchasing power and optimism of Croatian citizens to the ever weaker competitiveness of milk producers and dairy industry. Accession of Croatia to the European Union has made the local food and dairy sector face considerable pressure in goods supply from other EU member states. The Russian-Ukrainian crisis additionally undermines the import-export balance of Croatia, particularly in the dairy sector, since Croatia is becoming one of the receptive markets for European surpluses of UHT milk, butter and yellow cheese, which are the result of the Russian embargo introduction. Despite exceptionally difficult conditions in which it operates, in 2014, Dukat Dairy Industry Inc. based its operations on the principles of sustainability, adjustment to the needs and possibilities of Croatian consumers, renovation and development of new products and investment in quality. At the same time, it continued to optimize business processes and costs, and to increase the efficiency on all levels of business operations. However, we are aware there is still room for further progress in responsible operations, and reporting to our stakeholders on implemented activities is an important part of the acknowledgement of our contribution and motivation to continue improving our practice in this field. This report, therefore, together with the overview of activities related to the application of UNGC principles, provides the answer to a number of G4 sustainability indicators in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative. This provides our stakeholders with a clear and relevant framework for the comparison of our activities with the previous and the future ones, which we will continue to report on. Despite numerous challenges we face, we remain committed to sustainable operations and improvement of our responsible business practices, presented to you in the text that follows.

Bjelovar Plant 9,711,301 kWh 9,447,151 kWh Emissions of pollutants into the air from both plants were measured in December 2014, and the values met the prescribed emission limit values according to the Ordinance In 2014, the total power consumption in the Zagreb Plant on limit values of pollutants in the Air. was 22,660,752 kWh, which is 1.2 percent higher compared to the consumption in 2013. Total power consumption in the In 2014, Bjelovar Plant consumed 2,404,670 m3 of gas, which Bjelovar Plant was 9,447,151 kWh during 2014, which is 2.7 is 6.4 percent less than the consumption in 2013. percent less than in 2013. Steam Steam 2013 2014 Zagreb Plant 41,541 t 43,997 t Total steam consumption in the Zagreb Plant was 43,997 tons during 2014, which is 5.9 percent higher than the steam consumption in 2013. Bjelovar Plant has its own thermal energy production steam. 19 Water Dukat assigns great importance to the economic water consumption and constantly strives to find new ways for reducing its consumption. Both plants (Zagreb and Bjelovar) draw most of the water from their artesian wells, while the rest is used from the public water supply. In 2014, at the Zagreb Plant site, 99 percent of water was used from own well, same as in 2013, and only 1 percent was used from the public water supply. At the Bjelovar plant site, 58 percent of well water was used and 42 percent of public water supply (compared to 97 percent of well water and 3 percent of public water supply the year before). 2013 2014 Volume (m3) Water Public Water Public Water Own well Total Own well Total Supply Supply Zagreb Plant 3,227 366,960 370,187 8,963 402,373 411,336 Bjelovar Plant 7,058 253,908 260,966 98,520 138,266 236,786 In 2014, total water consumption at the Zagreb Plant was product is the result of technical changes in production and 411,336 m3, which is 11.1 percent higher than the total water warehouse premises, the production of own technological consumption in 2013. Water consumption from the public steam and the production trend. water supply was 8,963 m3, which is 177.5 percent higher than in 2013 (3,227 m3). Total water consumption at the Bjelovar Plant was 9 percent lower in 2014 (236,786 m3) than the consumption in 2013. Water consumption from own well was 402,373 m3, or 9.7 percent higher than the year before. The average ratio of water consumption over processed milk was 3.3 l of water/kg of processed milk in 2014, which The index of production (IP per one kilogram of a produced is slightly more compared to the 2013 ratio (3.2 l of water/ product) in 2014 increased slightly to 3.68, from 3.5 in 2013. kg of processed milk). This increase in consumption of water per kilogram of 20 Air emissions Zagreb Plant As mentioned above in the section on Gas, there are two combustion plants running on natural gas at the site of the Zagreb Plant. The emissions of pollutants into the air from both plants were measured in December 2014, and the values meet the prescribed emission limit values under the Ordinance on limit values for pollutants emissions into the air.

In the total balance, mixed packaging was the most collected, followed by waste paper and cardboard and multilayer packaging waste. In 2014, the total volume of separated and Bjelovar Plant received hazardous waste increased to 27.6 tons, from 11.6 tons of the year before. Bjelovar Plant has its own waste water treatment plant with the capacity of 1100 m2/day, and the processed waste water Non-hazardous waste in the Bjelovar Plant mostly included outflows meet the limit values under the water management paper and cardboard packaging. In 2014, the total of 1,703 license. Outflowing waste water is discharged into the public tons of waste was sorted by type. sewage of the City of Bjelovar after the treatment procedure. In 2014, the total of 323,060 m3 of technological waste water was processed by the waste water treatment plant, which is 14.2 percent more than in 2013. The average value of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in water after the treatment procedure was 339 mg/l, which is 28 percent less than in 2013 when COD 472 mg/l. A decrease in the waste water treatment factor (Fx) is also noticed, as it was 1.44 in 2014 compared to Fx being 1.67 in 2013. 23 Consumption of Noise chemicals Noise for the day and night work conditions at the Zagreb Plant site ranges within the legally permissible limits. Since Bjelovar Plant borders with residential noise zones on the southeast and the southwest side, at the time when Zagreb Plant consumption of washing and the noise level was measured for the purpose of preparing disinfecting agents integrated environmental requirements, minimum exceeding of permissible level of noise was established. Total volume of 2013 2014 washing and disinfecting agents 942,060 kg 970,082 kg In 2014, Zagreb Plant consumed 2.9 percent more washing Compliance and disinfecting agents than the year before. Sodium base In accordance with legal provisions, Dukat makes an annual was the most used, and 485 tons of it, which is 53 tons more assessment of adherence to (compliance with) the legal and than in 2013. There were 46 tons of nitrogen peroxide used, other environmental regulations. which is 1 ton less than the year before. No major deviation from the legal and other regulations and requirements was recorded in 2014. There were also no extraordinary situations recorded, and there was no Bjelovar Plant consumption of chemicals in need to undertake any of the prescribed measures in the waste water treatment plant event of incidents.
