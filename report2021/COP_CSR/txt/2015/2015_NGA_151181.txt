As a voluntary, multi-stakeholder initiative, the UN Global Compact brings together all relevant actors – government, business, labour and civil society – to advance universal principles in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. By joining the Global Compact, we wish to demonstrate our continuing commitment to advancing the ten principles of the Global Compact in our policies, programmes and business operations.
