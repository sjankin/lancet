Environmental approval Skjern Papirfabrik’s latest review of the environmental approval Environmental legislation is from 2000. The environmental approval is under review. Environmental Protection Act Danish Statutory Order on Waste Supervising Authority Chemical Substances and Products Act The Danish Environmental Protection Agency Aarhus REACH The Municipality of Ringkøbing-Skjern Various authorisations and others Industry/NACE code Period covered 21.12 – Production of paper and paperboard 1/1-2014 to 31/12-2014 17.12 – Production of paper pulp Date of issue April 1, 2015 Next sustainability report Early April, 2016 General information on the production site The mill’s land register is classified as an industrial area, which on all sides borders on residential areas and housing districts. Therefore, the environmental approval includes a number of noise requirements to prevent unnecessary inconvenience for the mill’s neighbours. Skjern Papirfabrik A/S is located in surroundings of scenic beauty close to the Skjern River. Changes at the production site The mill’s wastewater treatment plant was closed in the summer of 2014. Wastewater from the plant is now led to the wastewater treatment plant of Ringkøbing Skjern Forsyning in Tarm. In June the use of river water as process water was replaced by raw water supplied by Ringkøbing Skjern Forsyning. Page 4 Preface Skjern Papirfabrik supports the UN Global Compact Since 2013 Skjern Papirfabrik has been a member of the UN Global Compact, which is a global initiative to promote sound business and ethical practice. For Skjern Papirfabrik the membership of the UN Global Compact has been a natural extension of our activities as a responsible company. As a member we obliged ourselves to incorporate the UN Global Compact 10 basic principles in our company and to communicate them to our customers, suppliers and other business partners. This report describes how Skjern Papirfabrik performed in the individual fields. Another 365 days passed and are now behind us.

The mill has since its start in 1965 used water from the Skjern Jørgen Thomsen River as process water for production of the different paper CEO qualities. Deviations as to different substances and temperatures of the river water have over the years given the factory challenges as to production capacity.

At Skjern Papirfabrik there is a natural replacement of employees who retire or take advantage of early retirement benefits. By the end of 2014 17.8 % of the employees are over 60. For white-collar workers 33.3 % of the employees are over 60. The number is increasing, and will also in the years to come give a natural replacement of employees. In spite of this the yearly replacement in 2014 is only 6.8 % of the workforce. Employees of other nationalities constitute 9.6 % of the labour force today. The number is increasing and completely in line with our CSR policy. The gender distribution has been very constant during recent years. This is due to the fact that there are currently no women employed in production, only in the administrative and cleaning departments. Both men and women may apply for vacancies in production, but for many years no qualified female applicants were to be found. Whether this is due to work shifts or the type of work is unknown.

This waste fraction is transported to a controlled composting, before it is used for soil improvement. This fraction was expected to be left out after the reconstruction of the mill’s pulper section end of 2013. However, the reconstruction did not have the effect needed, and therefore the fraction has been there most of 2014.

This is primarily due to an increased focus on the water consumption and a considerably higher production in total, which has a direct influence on the specific water consumption. Furthermore, there is a reduction due to less water consumption to wastewater treatment plant.

This was under consideration, partly due to uncertainties as to future environmental requirements, and partly due to anticipations of large investments for expansion of the treatment plant. This together with surplus capacity at the Tarm wastewater treatment plant made the considerations as to mutual purification actual.

Therefore, no goals will be set for the wastewater treatment, but instead focus will be on water consumption and wastewater amount. The total wastewater amount was in 2014 333,259 m3. The goal for 2015 is to reduce the wastewater amount by approx. 10,000 m3 compared to 2014. A reduction of 10,000 m3 corresponds to a reduced discharge of approx. 3.0 % compared to 2014. This is expected to be realised by a solution in the 2nd half of 2015 for recycling of condensate from the discharge to the air/ water exchanger. However, there will be an extra wastewater stream from the wood chips fired boiler plant, which will probably come into operation during the 4th quarter of 2015. An amount of approx. 4,000 m3 of wastewater is expected from here in 2015.
