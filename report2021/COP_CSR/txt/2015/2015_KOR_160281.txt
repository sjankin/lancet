Cu sto mers “It was 24 years ago, in 1991. that TECNOMACH first met Doosan Infracore. Specifications for machine tools are extremely diverse and different depending on industries and regions. Therefore accurate communication with dealers well versed in local circumstances is a critical factor for a manufacturer’s success. Doosan Infracore not just listens to our voices to hear our customers’ requirements. It strives to find solutions to issues in a proactive manner and works hard to develop and present over 1,200 new products. I think it was the result of our close collaboration with Doosan Infracore that out company was able to reach a market share of over 25% in the Italian machine tools market and surpassed the 10,000 unit mark in our aggregate sales (dealers) of Doosan Infracore machine tools in Italy over the years. I hope that as we always have, we will continue to trust each other and maintain cooperative relationship between us for our shared growth for many years to come.” 32 33 2014 Doosan Infracore Integrated Report Our Strategic Performance DEVELOPING POTENTIAL OF GROWTH I NDONE SI A Walter Berry, chairman and president, Berry Companies, Inc. My vocational expertise and efficiency have jumped since my training at Doosan Vocational School “I was extremely lucky to participate in Doosan Infracore’s machine tools training of training (TOT) course. I was fully content with the practical curriculum, which I could apply to my job right away. I am sure that the training will be instrumental in my career development down the road, too. Previously, I operated machines set by others. Now I can do the job myself thanks to the education on computer programming and sophisticated precision machining at the TOT course. As the training was provided by an equipment manufacturer, I was able to learn about diverse features of the machine tool. I hope that TOT course will continue to provide Indonesian companies and employees with more opportunities to train them to enhance their practical job competence.” STRENGTHENING LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIP I always feel Bobcat and its dealers are ‘one’ through open communications. “Bobcat always delivers more than we expect. We say that the company will not be U SA able to make any more improvement whenever it releases a new attachment. Bobcat however always comes back and surprises us with even better products. Despite its huge dealership network – more than 600 in North America Bobcat maintains open communication with each of us, making us feel that the company and we are one. Bobcat hosts regular conferences with us to share not only the company’s product roadmap and information on new products but also the company’s strategies and visions. Combined with active personal contact among dealers, the occasions further strengthen the bond between the company and its dealers. I believe that Bobcat set the world record by producing one million units of compact equipment, more than any of its competitors, because of such strong partnership with its dealers. Witnessing Bobcat doing its utmost for mutual success, I feel extremely lucky to work with Bobcat. I am also proud to maintain special relationship with Bobcat as my father did starting since the 1960s.” Taufiq Nur A trainer from MIDC (Metal Industry Development Center), Indonesia 34 35 2014 Doosan Infracore Integrated Report Our Strategic Performance CHINA BUILDING RELATIONSHIP WITH INTEGRITY Really amazed at the thoughtful consideration about the sales of my second-hand equipment A potential customer from a power generator “When Doosan Infracore called me to ask if our company was willing to put its manufacturing company who attended at ‘Middle stock of second-hand heavy equipment up for auction, honestly, I was a bit suspiEast Electricity’ cious. Until then manufacturing and sales were clearly two different things. I mean, I hadn’t met a manufacturer making moves for the auction of its second-hand products. Doosan Infracore told me that it would be opportunity to repair and sale the equipments. It said that our company could purchase their new vehicles from the sales revenue of auction. I realized then that they were suggesting rebuilding our relationship instead of putting an end to our relationship. We eventually agreed to the auction idea. The auction of our heavy equipment was participated by more CUSTOMERS ENGAGEMENT FOR NEW people than we had expected. A total of 47 out of 53 equipment units were sold OPPORTUNITIES off.

As a power generator manufacturer, our company has continued to participate in the trade show to meet our present and future customers. I visited the Doosan booth and found a familiar face among Doosan Infracore Engine Business Area members there. Thanks to their kindness, I was able to carefully check the company’s DP Series, a new generator engine, displayed at the exhibition booth. I also took part in a conference where I was able to learn much more about Doosan Infracore through presentations on the company’s engine lineup and new products on display at the event as well as its corporate strategies and visions, the staff visited our company’s booth and we talked a lot about our common interests including power generator engines.
