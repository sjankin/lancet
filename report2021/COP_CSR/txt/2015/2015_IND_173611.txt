Sustainability Review 2014-15 From embedding sustainability as a business driver across the Group to empowering individual businesses to drive sustainability, within eight years, we have successfully cascaded sustainability from a boardroom vision to a shop oor reality. Powered by Alternative Thinking our bespoke approach to sustainability, we enhanced awareness, expounded a strong business case to employees, institutionalised frameworks, invested in capacity building plus rewarded and recognised outstanding performers. The road to sustainability is fraught with obstacles some have to be overcome with innovation, some with determination, and some simply by perseverance. But as we overcome each obstacle, we come across doors of opportunities with multiple outcomes that take us to the next level. This thought is graphically represented in this design theme. The upward moving transverse lines represent the Group's ambitions. The pillars of myriad colours are the roadmaps of individual businesses. While the ones in red are symbolic of Mahindra's Rise for Good philosophy that continues to guide them all. BUSINESSWISE is the next phase in our sustainability journey. In it, every individual business is driving the sustainability agenda on issues material to their stakeholders and aiming to set new benchmarks within their sector and geographies. It is like pursuing the sustainability agenda with independent teams who are not only committed but capable and experienced. This enlarged team, new vigour, focus and greater ownership has created a multiplier effect that aims to transcend incremental growth and give rise to a transformational change. And it has begun to yield accelerated results in the very rst year.

Besides, no capes were involved and all the tools were developed in-house. 72 Economic Performance OVERVIEW FY 2015 was a year that began with a lot of hope in India. A new government had just come into power and was expected to shake policies and decision-making processes out of limbo. But it takes time for hope to turn into reality and till that time, one needs to continue having faith in it. Although Indias economy grew by 7.3 percent during FY 2015, growth hastened slowly, constrained by weak demand at home and abroad. Against the backdrop of such an economic condition and subdued consumer interest, Mahindra Group saw a minor blip in its ﬁnancial performance in FY 2015. The consolidated Gross Revenues and Other Income for the Group was INR 760.15 billion as against INR 787.36 billion in the previous year. The consolidated Proﬁt After Tax, after deducting minority interests, stood at INR 313.7 billion as compared to INR 466.7 billion in the previous year. Similar performance was seen in Auto and Farm Sectors as well, which is usually our biggest revenue contributor. Automotive Division saw de-growth in sales across all major segments. Passenger vehicles including UVs, MPVs and cars saw an 11.9% decrease in volumes due to the increasing preference for new launches, petrol engines and compact UVs. Yet we continued leadership of the domestic UV market by posting a market share of 37.4%. Bolero retained the title of being India's largest selling SUV for the 9th consecutive year and became the 5th highest selling passenger vehicle in India. Sales of commercial vehicles also came down by 4.8% due to slowdown in agricultural income and ﬁnance availability. Similarly Farm Division (including Swaraj Division) recorded sales of 234,766 tractors, a decrease of 12.6% over last year. This mirrors the overall decline of 13% in sales for the Indian tractor industry in FY 2015. That said, we still command a leadership position with a market share of 40%. The business performance did not dampen our efforts of promoting technology and innovation in our products. We introduced Arjun Novo, the rst tractor model to roll out of the all-new high horsepower (hp) platform. It is set to create new benchmarks in performance, technology, comfort and ergonomics. Meanwhile, our Group Companies continued to forge ahead on the road to prosperity. Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd. posted a consolidated Total Income and PAT (pre-minority interest) of INR 11.48 billion and INR 2.83 billion respectively an increase of 52% in the former and a highly satisfying 157% increase in the latter. Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. also reported a 14% increase in its consolidated income and also expanded its network to 1,108 ofﬁces in 26 states and 5 union territories in India. 73 Our ﬁnancial performance in FY 2015 however had no bearing on the general During the reporting market perception of our business abilities.

As a diversied business conglomerate, we are proud to support the nation’s agship manufacturing initiative. This support was exemplied with the launch of the new generation Scorpio which is a truly ‘Made in India’ SUV. We have to make 'Make in India' work. We all have to do our bit. I am very delighted to say that we are ﬁrst off the block. The new generation Scorpio makes us proud not only in India, but also validates 'Make in India' around the world. Anand Mahindra, Chairman & Managing Director, Mahindra & Mahindra Group MANAGEMENT APPROACH Innovation is one of the key Over the years, sustainability has become well-entrenched in the Mahindra ethos. tools that enables us to When we call our social and environmental expenditures as investments, it is not for political correctness; it is because they have started bearing us rich returns. achieve responsible business excellence.

The consolidated Group Prot for the year, after exceptional items and tax, and after deducting minority interest was INR 31,370 million as against INR 46,669.3 million earned last year. BEYOND FINANCIALS GIVING WHEELS TO GLOBAL DREAMS MTWL acquires 51% stake in Peugeot Scooters Over the past few years, Mahindra has strengthened its position in the two-wheeler segment globally. In January 2015, the global ambitions of Mahindra Group received a tremendous shot in the arm when Mahindra Two Wheelers Ltd. (MTWL) completed all the necessary formalities for acquiring 51% stake in Peugeot Motocycles (PMTC), part of the Euro 54 billion PSA Group based in France. PMTC (a.k.a. Peugeot Scooters), a key player in urban mobility in Europe for 116 years, is the oldest motorised two-wheeler manufacturer in the world. It offers one of the most comprehensive range of scooters and mopeds, from 50cc to 400cc, including the successful three-wheeled scooter Metropolis in the European market. The coming together of Mahindra and Peugeot is expected to beneﬁt the two-wheeler businesses of both companies. Mahindra offers access to the India market, mass market product technology and competence in marketing while Peugeot brings premium range, a strong European footprint and a globally recognised brand. This partnership would enable both MTWL and PMTC to speed their international expansion by driving synergies and leveraging respective strengths of both parties.

This is testament to its tremendous business opportunities in addressing climate change. commitment in adopting measures to cut emissions and While we continue to keep a sharp focus decelerate, if not mitigate climate change. on our carbon footprint, we understand 81 LOCAL SUPPLY In recent years, we have been steadfast towards achieving our global ambitions. But while we have trained our vision to foreign shores, our intention to localise our production and operation remains strong as ever. Although the boundaries of India remain the de facto deﬁnition of local supply, some businesses have their own deﬁnition and boundary of what constitutes as local. This is based on its industry requirements and other on-ground realities like access to technology and know-how, tax and duty regimes, and supply of skilled manpower. But the objective remains to promote local talent and give it an opportunity to ﬂourish on a larger scale. That said, we have exacting quality standards and stringent processes to identify and empanel our suppliers. Some of the factors inﬂuencing supplier selection include: Costs Performance and Compliance on environment, Commitment to reduce Statutory on-time delivery health and safety guidelines the carbon footprint requirements Sector Purchases from Purchases from % of Local Nine out of 15 sectors Top 10 Suppliers Local Suppliers Suppliers (INR million) (within top 10) (within top 10) source 90% or more of their (INR million) total requirements from AD 32,255 32,255 100 local suppliers.

Notable milestones include turning Water Positive as a Group and Mahindra Lifespaces conducting a Natural Capital proﬁling a ﬁrst in the Group. While we marched ahead to achieve our big goals faster and sooner, we kept a sharp focus on introspective small steps that eliminated roadblocks and helped lay the foundation for big impacts. This resulted in enhanced environmental performance in areas of energy conservation, water reduction and waste management across the Group. We embarked on new initiatives across our value chain to ensure that we created better value for our customers and our stakeholders while growing our business. MANAGEMENT APPROACH Our approach to environment management stems from our core purpose to drive positive change in the lives of our stakeholders and enable them to Rise. It is rooted in our belief that only businesses that embrace sustainability and environment efﬁciency will generate long-term value for their stakeholders. Thus environmental efﬁciency is central to all our processes, products and premises. We are committed to make a positive difference across our entire product lifecycle. From green manufacturing facilities to imbibing green consciousness in our people, our approach to environmental sustainability covers all the high-impact material issues across our businesses. We consistently raise the bar and set ourselves ambitious targets and goals. We leverage Alternative Thinking to unleash new ideas to achieve these goals. 83 ENVIRONMENT POLICIES Mahindra is committed to make its products and services environmentally sound and secure. This commitment to environment management is reﬂected in our Environment Policy. The aim of the Policy is to reduce the organisation's carbon and ecological footprint, maintain balance in the eco-system, and create long-lasting value for business and society. The Policy, which was originally formulated for Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., has been cascaded across Group Companies. The Group Companies not only comply with all the laws and regulations pertaining to environment, they also assume leadership roles in various green disciplines. Adherence to the policy is the responsibility of each employee at Mahindra. This implementation is overseen by plant managers of respective facilities. For our Environment Policy; please refer to Sustainability Report 2009-10. All manufacturing plants of M&M are certiﬁed with ISO-14001-2004 Environment Management System. GREEN IT GUIDELINES GREEN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT POLICY To ensure that we use Information We recognise that integrated management approach works best, when one Technology (IT) more efﬁciently, we wants to achieve sustainability throughout the value chain. We therefore formulated the Green IT guidelines proactively engage with our suppliers and vendors to incorporate environmentin 2008-09. These guidelines help us friendly practices beyond our factory gates and encourage them to adopt green embrace more efﬁcient processes initiatives. for sourcing, management and disposal of IT equipment. All Group ENGAGING WITH SUPPLIERS IT agencies and users are committed to adhere to these guidelines. MLDL organised suppliers and contractors meets in the West, North and South zones in Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai respectively. Participating suppliers at all the three places witnessed presentations on sustainable operational practices as well as a dialogue session. Suppliers gained knowledge on various sustainability aspects such as energy conservation, water efﬁciency, waste management, use of alternate energy, local sourcing, operational safety and biodiversity. MLDL's Sustainability Roadmap 2020 was also shared during the meetings. All three meets saw an overwhelming response with around 65+ individuals from 50 companies in the West zone, 50+ individuals from 35 companies in the North zone and 100+ individuals from 80 companies attending the South Zone meet. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT Our Environment Management approach aims to achieve continuous improvement in environmental performance in all our activities. We follow a well-structured process to manage waste, water and energy resources across the Group operations. Environment parameters are now aspects of roadmap. Employees at all levels are responsible for Company's environmental performance. Robust monitoring practices, stringent feedback measures, continuous introspection along with a well-deﬁned reporting structure, enables us to be ahead of the industry curve on environment KPIs. Sustainability reporting contributes to our sustainability agenda in more ways than one. While we report, we also reect. Disclosures result in deliberations and gures transform into ground level initiatives and strategic interventions. 84 INVESTMENT IN ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT INR million Type of Expenditure Amount In the reporting period, STP/ETP Maintenance Contract cost and expenses we spent over incurred for treatment chemicals 14.66 INR 63.23 million towards Expenses incurred for air emission monitoring (Stack and ambient) 3.55 environment protection Cost for water quality monitoring 1.55 which includes investments External Certiﬁcation of Management Systems 1.49 in waste disposal, treating Expenditures for the purchase and use of emission chemical waste, and certiﬁcates (Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates) 11.58 controlling air pollution.

Business growth is coupled with employee growth which in turn leads to a growth in the number of vehicles deployed for their commute, leading to an increase in the carbon footprint as well as pollution. As an IT ﬁrm, business travel including employee commute is a signiﬁcant issue and one of the biggest contributors to Scope 3 emissions. Hence, we continuously monitor it as well as take initiatives to reduce it. An employee commute survey was conducted in March 2015, with an easy to ﬁll questionnaire which captured the travel mode, vehicle type, fuel type and the distance travelled. In a period of one and a half months, about 2,500 employees took the survey. It was encouraging to see that over and above participation in the survey, a host of employees were enthusiastically sharing ideas on how to reduce Scope 3 emissions. This led to co-creation of ideas and greater ownership. Results of the interventions will be seen in the next reporting period. 90 BIODIVERSITY Conservation is better than restoration. The Mahindra Group believes in preserving the biodiversity of ecosystems and its services which are beneﬁcial for the communities and the businesses rather than quick ﬁx solutions for its revival. As part of the conservation strategy, during the reporting period, we signed India Business and Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) declaration. This was not only to take the lead and inspire other organisations, but also to mitigate risks and identify new business opportunities in the emerging green sector. As part of the IBBI declaration, Mahindra World City, Chennai went through assessment of impacts and dependencies on biodiversity to develop strategies for effective management. Biodiversity and human development need to progress together, in synergy. We supported the empowerment of Adivasis in the Araku Valley in Andhra Pradesh by creating livelihood opportunities for them. The Group's commitment to increase green cover by planting trees under the Hariyali project continued this year. INITIATIVE SECTOR SNAPSHOT Sector / Number of Location trees planted Project Hariyali During the reporting period, the Group planted Auto Sector 40,261 1,557,347 trees under Farm Equipment Sector + Swaraj 260,613 Project Hariyali through the combined efforts of Power Train Division 53,398 its employees and Mahindra Real Estate 25,150 community partners.

Araku 1,024,663 Total 1,557,347 91 CASE STUDY 1 Cultivating Livelihoods for Communities CHALLENGE INTERVENTION In consultation with the Adivasi community, our NGO, the Naandi Foundation evolved a horticultural development project on marginal, degraded community lands to enrich their local nutrition, their ecosystem and augment the community's income. OUTCOME The Adivasi farmers, who became part of this horticulture project, started growing Arabica coffee through organic agriculture. They use only bio-fertilisers, bio-pesticides and encourage natural predators such as spiders and ladybirds to keep pests under control. The Adivasi community in Today, these farmers harvest, process and export this organic coffee to different Araku already had a countries across the world. The coffee has received an international organic and fair-trade certiﬁcation. They also grow food fruits such as papaya, mangoes, mud robust centuries-old food apples (chikoo) and oranges to provide a nutritionally rich food basket to their cropping pattern that is own families. subsistent by nature. But a traditional production system was inadequate, without technological improvements and resource planning, to feed an increasing population. Modern life mandated sufcient cash income for health, educational and other aspirational needs. IMPACT 'Fair trade' coffee grown organically and mostly exported overseas, is now a viable livelihood option for these Adivasi farmers and brings the coffee-growers annual income of INR 100,000 plus. Naandi Foundation also encouraged the Adivasi farmer community to form the largest organic coffee cooperative in the world -the Small and Marginal Farmers Mutually Aided Cooperative Society (SAMTFMACS). This coffee cooperative ploughs its proﬁts into village development projects like healthcare, ambulances and drinking water. Naandi Foundation's work in the Araku region began over 15 years ago and embraces the Adivasi values of caring for the community and the forests. This makes the programme a success and it continues to positively impact over 100,000 Adivasi lives. 92 CASE STUDY 2 Conserving Biodiversity CHALLENGE INTERVENTION Being India's ﬁrst green home developer, Mahindra Lifespaces is leading the way on both these fronts. Mahindra Lifespaces has formulated a biodiversity management plan for its Happinest project in Boisar, situated in Palghar district of Maharashtra. The purpose of this plan is to develop strategies that can enhance biodiversity and nurture the local ecosystem. The plan assumes added signiﬁcance since the project is located in the sub basins of Western Ghats, around 5 km away from the mountainous patch designated as a reserve forest area in Dahanu, which is rich in ﬂoral and faunal biodiversity. India accounts for nearly 7% of globally recorded species while supporting 18% of global human population with just 2.4% of the world's land area. As population rises, urbanisation is imperative, but the real estate development needs to tread carefully and grow in a sustainable manner. As part of the plan, a biodiversity assessment study was undertaken to create an inventory of the ﬂora and fauna, identify endangered and threatened species if Conservation of any, and study the vegetation proﬁle in a 2 km radius from the boundary of the biodiversity and reducing proposed construction area. Transects were strategically marked in different the effects of directions from the core area. On every transect, survey methods for individual component of ﬂora and fauna was carried out at a suitable interval. The interval of developmental activity on every 500 m was decided for the study whereas if any special feature viz. streams environment is the only etc. were encountered, extra effort of sampling was taken at these locations. way to promote and sustain the real estate sector in today's ecological fragile world. 93 Conserving Biodiversity OUTCOME The eld study found several species of ora and fauna in the area. FLORA DIVERSITY 46 species of trees FAUNA DIVERSITY 64 species of birds belonging to 24 belonging to 35 different families different families 16 species of 40 species of shrubs belonging butterﬂies belonging to 13 families to three families 52 herb species Two reptile belonging species belonging to to two families two families Along with the ﬁeld study, a socio ecological survey was also initiated to understand from the local communities the wildlife they have encountered in and around the project area, identify problem animals and possible CSR opportunities. Eight villages Bategaon, Birwadi, Vakore, Sarpada, Umroli, Man, Padgha and Kahirpada were included in the survey and the presence of two types of venomous snakes was detected in the area apart from other non-venomous snakes. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS The ﬁndings of the assessment study have been discussed in depth with landscape architect and an action plan has been drawn. Some of the key recommendations on how Mahindra Lifespaces can sustain and enhance the biodiversity in the area include: Plantation strategy for core area fruiting, Green walls shading, and medicinal trees Buttery habitat creation Installation of bird baths and feeders 94 CASE STUDY 3 Valuing Natural Capital CHALLENGE INTERVENTION To measure and evaluate environmental costs, Mahindra Lifespaces participated in the India Business & Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) baseline assessment, which offers an overview of the relations between the organisation and the Natural Capital, covering the entire value chain, and the extent to which the organisation manages these relations. Businesses value their IBBI baseline assessment was conducted at Mahindra World City, Chennai.

Baseline Assessment Summary RECOGNITION Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd. (MLDL) was featured in the India Business & Biodiversity Initiative report 'Business and Biodiversity in India: 20 Illustrations' in 2014. Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd. can be considered a front runner in sustainability, as per the assessment. The Company focuses on green design of With this MLDL became buildings, and undertakes strategic plantation within its integrated business cities the rst real estate to strengthen biodiversity and facilitate reduction in temperature. It also institutionalises effective and efﬁcient waste management, energy management developer in India to be and water management within the cities it develops. featured in this report. The Company's performance on sustainability is considered to be a strong brand differentiator. This can be further reinforced by enhancing stakeholder understanding of the Company's potential contributions to the wider ecological system. The Company may be able to create an interesting USP for new developments by showing how the Company's long term presence in an area contributes to the creation and preservation of ecosystem services available to local stakeholders. Moreover, communicating within the cities about the steps taken by Mahindra on natural capital management, will strengthen the support for Mahindra's approach and will contribute to a sense of pride among employees, companies and residents. Through its role within the integrated business cities, Mahindra may also wish to explore the opportunities to involve companies within the city in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Such an initiative could focus on biodiversity not only within the city, but also on biodiversity policies within the companies, where companies exchange experiences and best practices. The next step in this journey should be to integrate natural capital considerations in the Company's supplier requirements, thereby further improving the Company's sustainability performance in the design and construction of residential homes. 96 ENERGY Energy is the lifeline of industry as it moves men and machines.

Mahindra Group is a frontrunner in this endeavour. M&M's Farm Division took up a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project on Micro Irrigation System in association with the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). Under the project, farmers were encouraged to use an efﬁcient irrigation system such as drip and sprinkler irrigation, compared to the conventional ﬂood method of irrigation. FD sold drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation systems to farmers in Gujarat in the year FY 2012-13. Water is an essential commodity for continuation of industrial activity. In recent times, its availability is becoming an alarming concern. In a WATER SAVINGS: 48% survey conducted by FICCI on Water Use in the Indian Industry in 2011, 60% of the IMPACT respondents felt that that availability of water is The use of micro irrigation systems resulted in several beneﬁts including savings in water consumption between 30% and 50%. Farmers also saw a decrease in the impacting their business use of fertilizers and increase in the yield. while 87% sensed that it This project also proved to be a milestone in the sustainability journey of will impact them in the next Mahindra Group. 10 years. Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. effected 8.40 million m3 water savings during FY 2013-2014 against the 6.1 million kl total water consumption of the Group, turning Mahindra water positive. The veriﬁcation report by Bureau Veritas Certiﬁcations India Pvt. Ltd. (BVCI) conﬁrmed with a limited level of assurance that the quantum of water savings thus effected exceed the water consumption of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. during the period FY 2013-14.

Over the years, we have taken a range of water management interventions to make the division water selfsufﬁcient. Some of the key ones include treatment of domestic and process wastewater, enhancing stormwater percolation, and stormwater harvesting. These efforts gained pace after Mahindra Group launched its H2Inﬁnity, the water conservation programme in 2012-13. OUTCOME Water is equally The treatment of domestic & process wastewater resulted in savings of 425 m3 / day important for of water. The enhancement of stormwater percolation check dam capacity led to domestic as well as increase in water storage capacity to 1,100 m3 per annum. Stormwater harvesting added 2,500 m3 of water per annum. industrial purposes. The speciﬁc water consumption in FY 2015 (till December) reduced by 35% compared to FY 2011. Also, the water table has risen in the area reducing the power The industries have to required for drawing water by 50%. The reuse of wastewater has increased depend on the conventional considerably with 10% of the treated ETP water being used for grill cleaning activity and the balance treated water for gardening purpose. water sources for their various requirements. 10% treated However, these sources are water was now under stress due to being used for grill cleaning growth in population and activity increase in urbanisation, forcing industries to look Balance treated for other alternatives. water was being used for gardening purpose IMPACT As a result of the strategic water management interventions, the dependency on Zaheerabad municipality for water has been eliminated making the manufacturing plant water self-sufﬁcient. The facility can now meet the water demand for next 10 years production plan. Dependency on The manufacturing Zaheerabad Municipality site can now meet for water has been the demand for the eliminated making the next 10-year site self-sufcient production plan 110 INITIATIVES Saving water today for a plentiful tomorrow Water is essential for life.

Less waste means less disposal cost plus conservation of natural resources and energy. Reuse of waste helps cut raw material costs and decreases the burden on the environment. This focus on reduction or reuse of waste is pervasive right from the design stage to the manufacturing process and distribution of ﬁnished goods. At every step we are looking for opportunities for waste minimisation and reuse. Whatever waste we generate is responsibly disposed keeping the compliances, rules and regulations of the land in mind. Hazardous waste is handed over to authorised hazardous waste collection vendors equipped with the requisite treatment, storage and disposal facilities, while a major portion of non-hazardous waste is disposed through contractors who hand it over to large-scale recycling units or reuse it. 115 GROUP TOTAL Note: Hazardous waste 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 Hazardous solid waste (Tonnes) includes ETP Solid (Tonnes) 7,219 9,219 25,429 sludge, phosphating sludge, paint sludge, eSolid (Nos) waste, biomedical waste, oil soaked waste 175,269 193,863 240,334 Hazardous solid waste (Nos.) includes Liquid (kl) 2,038 2,467 23,193 batteries, containers and e-waste Liquid (Nos) 3,205 122 0 Hazardous Liquid waste (kl) includes scrap oil, DG set waste oil, used oil from vehicles Non-Hazardous waste and waste coolant Solid (Tonnes) 225,701 176,800 173,811 Hazardous Liquid waste (nos.) includes containers of waste oil Solid (Nos) 156,490 81,454 76,219 Non-Hazardous solid waste (Tonnes) includes Liquid (kl) 0 0 135 wooden, steel, metal scrap, food waste, paper waste, plastic scrap, rubber scrap Non-Hazardous solid waste (Nos.) includes empty containers / barrels AD Hazardous solid waste (Tonnes) increased as few sectors were able to provide the data in Hazardous waste 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 tonne for containers which they used to Solid (Tonnes) 3,187 3,121 3,239 earlier report in numbers.

In recent years, we have considerably reduced our consumption of non-recyclable material to make the packaging of our products convenient, economical and environment friendly. SPILLS Spills prevention is prudent in any business. Spills increase operating costs, lower productivity and can have a negative impact on the environment. At Mahindra Group, we are committed to ensure complete safety of our operations and the environment through a comprehensive environment management system which also encompasses spills. During the reporting period, we did not witness any signiﬁcant incidents of spills. ENVIRONMENT COMPLIANCE Conforming to the environmental laws, rules and regulations is the cornerstone of any successful business. Mahindra Group continues to adhere to environmental compliances and abide by all the applicable laws of the land for all of its projects. During the reporting period, we were not ﬁned for any non-compliance. 121 Social Performance MANAGEMENT APPROACH At Mahindra, organisational growth and societal development are two sides of the same coin. Hence, we approach social interventions with the same commitment, passion and professionalism as our businesses. We have been contributing 1% of our Proﬁt After Tax (PAT) towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in a structured manner since 2005  long before it became a mandate. Hence we were better prepared to shift to a higher gear of 2% of threeyear average net proﬁt as prescribed by the guidelines laid down in the New Companies Act 2013. Our goal is to create self-sustaining transformations across the weaker sections of society by empowering them to Rise.
