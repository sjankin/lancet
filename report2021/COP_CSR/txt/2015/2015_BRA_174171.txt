We continue to work to consolidate our success in the Brazil’s E&P sector. The certainty that we are on the right path comes not only from our operational success, but also from our comfortable financial position. Among our strengths are our technical excellence and active participation in concessions, even those that are not operated by the Company. We continue to expand our technical staff by hiring highly experienced professionals in critical knowledge areas for QGEP’s projects of greater impact. To this end, we maintain our investments in training, The positive financial performance is linked to a diligent investment policy, while operational success is based on a especially for young professionals, both on the job and through formal courses. Today, the Company has over 130 technical team that combines a solid academic background with extensive practical experience. Our success is built employees, including a fully qualified team to face the challenges posed by the exploration and production of oil and on long-term planning which includes key elements such as: our financial responsibility; our technical excellence;, natural gas in deep and ultra-deep waters, which are the focus of our work. respect for the environment and for all our stakeholders, and a system of corporate governance that is constantly reaching new standards of excellence. In order to emphasize QGEP’s commitment to ethics and transparency, we are ever improving our Code of Ethical Conduct through the establishment of policies and procedures aligned with the anti-corruption laws of Brazil and The sharp drop in the price of oil per barrel in the international market as of mid-2014 represented a factor that those countries where our partners are listed on public stock markets.

Additionally, in Brazil, the sector was placed in the center of an Conduct is a requirement not only for our managers and employees, but also for our partners and suppliers of goods institutional debate, whose outcomes still need to be better evaluated.

We understand that the efficient management of and extreme operating conditions, QGEP promoted adjustments in its portfolio of exploration assets, disposing of the integrated health, safety, and environment policy is a strategic factor in QGEP’s decision-making process, in which projects in the Camamu-Almada and Campos basins. the Board of Directors plays a key role. Even with the recent headwinds in the oil and gas industry, we ended 2014 with over R$ 1 billion in cash to execute QGEP’s principles reflect the management policy based on the permanent search for new opportunities and in the our investment program, without the need for new funding until 2016. prudent analysis of the risks inherent to the sector. This is the balance that has always guided the Queiroz Galvão Group for more than 60 years. QGEP’s financial results were not affected by oil price fluctuations in the international market as our operating revenues stemmed, almost entirely, from Manati gas sales. The Company’s exposure to the international oil price will Antônio Augusto de Queiroz Galvão only occur in mid-2016, with the entry into operation of the Early Production System of the Atlanta Field. QGEP’s Chairman of the Board of Directors 4 5 ANNUAL REPORT 2014 We also cannot fail to mention the promising prospects of the discovery in the Carcará pre-salt, which occurred in 2012 in the BM-S-8 Block. Throughout 2014, the first phase of the extension well was drilled, which extended to the base of the salt layer. It is a transformational project for the Company, which will significantly increase our production in the long term. As for the short and medium term, similar to what was recorded in 2014, we will continue to count on a strong gas production in the Manati field, which is the current source of our operating revenues. We expect to maintain this production at historic levels for at least three more years, from the entry into operation of the compression station, scheduled for mid-2015. Our privileged cash position ensures the continuity of our projects. We reported net revenue of R$503 million and EBITDAX of R$285 million. Net income was R$166 million, 13.6% less than when compared to the previous cycle due to the increase in exploration expenses and the return of blocks BM-CAL-5, CAL-M-312, and the Biguá area. Nevertheless, we finished 2014 with a cash balance of R$1.1 billion, which ensures security for the execution of our short and medium-term investments. Despite the drop in the price of the barrel, which does not affect us at this time, as our revenue comes from the sale of gas, and the turbulent political context experienced in the country since mid-2014, we believe in the oil and gas sector’s potential to generate jobs and continue to contribute to Brazil’s development. We are aware that our growth is not dissociated from the growth of our employees and partners. In this sense, we have prioritized the inclusion of experienced and highly qualified professionals, combining the exchange of knowledge with the energy of young talent, and increasing the investment in technology. The prospect of an increase in the scale CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER of our operations in upcoming years has motivated a series of improvements in QGEP’s organizational structure. In GRI G4-1 / G4-2 this sense, we highlight the implementation of the Fiscal Council and Planning and Management Department, which strengthen our governance practices with new initiatives.

The Company created the foundation of its operational success with bold business decisions and based on the best management practices of the E&P sector. An important milestone of this story is the Manati production. This exploratory block acquired in Round Zero, in 1998, included the effective performance of our professionals in its discovery and is now one of the largest non-associated gas fields active in the country. The acquisition of Carcará and Atlanta proved to be extremely on target and marked QGEP’s entry into ultra-deep waters, completing an attractive and balanced portfolio of assets in Brazil’s main sea basins. Our successes – and boldness – are essential and underpin QGEP’s vision of being among the largest Brazilian companies in the oil industry by 2020. The journey as an operator in ultra-deep waters has led us to being on the verge of producing the first oil, scheduled for 2016, in the Atlanta Field (Block BS-4), in the pre-salt exclusion area of the Santos Basin. The choice of this promising asset for the beginning of the new phase of Company activities meant overcoming countless challenges already known in the Field. The water depth, heavy oil, and geological conditions of the Atlanta reservoir demanded the application of innovative technologies to overcome the obstacles and obtain advances in the development. To this end, we put together a team formed by highly qualified professionals, whose professional experience includes some of the greatest achievements of the Brazilian oil and ANNUAL REPORT 2014 gas industry.

The Field was responsible for a growth of 3.5% of the Company’s net revenue, totaling R$ 503 million. The gas is sold to Petrobras, the field’s operator, with a long-term contract through which With a diversified assets portfolio and some of the challenges faced a volume corresponding to QGEP’s 45%share in the project is sold. The condensate, a by-product of natural gas, is in operations, associated with a well-planned management, QGEP sold to Dax Oil Refino S.A. continues to constantly seek new investment opportunities – exclusively With the conclusion of the construction of the gas compression station, scheduled for mid-2015, the expectation is focused on the exploration of oil and gas in Brazil. that Manati’s potential volume of production reaches a daily average of 6 million m3 in the last five months of the year. The Company does not have any practices related to customer satisfaction surveys, since the main buyer of its products is also the operator of Manati field, who is responsible for the standards established in the project. In In 2014, these guidelines culminated, among other achievements including general, 100% of QGEP’s products –natural gas, condensate, and, in the future, oil – are used, and nothing is left over the announcement of the Early Production System (EPS) for the Atlanta for recycling and reuse. Given their characteristics, they are not packaged for transport and storage. For this reason, Field, in Block BS-4, in the pre-salt exclusion area of the Santos Basin.

The chartering of FPSO Petrojarl I for operations in Atlanta is the main highlight of the project, which is expected to produce up to 25,000 barrels per day during the first phase of production, taking into account two producing wells. Portfolio Management The achievement of these important milestones is mainly attributed to In 2014, QGEP decided to return Block CAL-M-312, the operational success achieved by QGEP in the completion of drilling, part of the BM-CAL-12 (Camamu-Almada Basin) formation tests, and completion of two of the project’s 12 wells. The Concession, due to the lack of attractiveness activities were the result of careful planning, which took into account the indicated by technical and economic feasibility geological characteristics of the reservoirs. The Company is also evaluating studies conducted in the area.

The Brazilian economy has shown slight improvements in its main indexes. The Brazilian GDP grew by only 0.1% in 2014, totaling R$ 5.52 billion, with the lowest performance since 2009. The inflation rate was 6.4% (IPCA) at the end of the year, compared to 5.9% at the end of 2013. The Central Bank increased the basic SELIC interest rate to 11.75% in November, higher than the 10% rate at the end of 2013. The average unemployment rate in the year was 4.8%. In the oil and gas sector, companies have had to face difficulties arising from the international situation reflected in the 46% drop in the price of the oil in 2014. For QGEP, this has adverse panorama had little influence on their results, as the company’s revenue is linked to the production of natural gas in the Manati Field. In the specific case of Brazil, the institutional crisis now facing the sector is an additional challenge, leading to developments in the investment plans of the largest oil company in the country. To date, QGEP does not expect the situation to directly affect their portfolio or exploration program for 2015.

It is worth noting that 14 recommended “purchase” and three recommended “maintenance” of QGEP’s shares, based on the evaluation of the Company and its principles.

The market value totaled R$1.9 billion at the end of the year, with an average trading of R$5.7 million. The highest target price for the Company’s shares was R$19.20, and the lowest, R$9.90, with an average target price of R$14.90 per share, which represents an upside potential of 107% in relation to the QGEP share closing price at the end of 2014. Dividends As part of the commitment to generate long-term value for investors, QGEP’s Board of Directors approved in 2015 the adoption of a dividends policy, establishing a payment proposal above the minimum mandatory dividend established in the Bylaws. The resolution, to be valid from 2015, includes a proposal to distribute the results annually to be submitted by the Board of Directors at the Annual General Meeting, covering the payment of a dividend in the amount of R$ 0.15 per share. This amount includes the minimum mandatory dividend. The payment of the supplementary dividend is subject to the existence of earnings or profit reserves.
