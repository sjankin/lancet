Recently, a gang Rape of a 16 year old girl in Kenya highlighted how severe the issue is. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/28/kenya-gang-rape-petition_n_4171283.html Africa Biosystems stepped up to support the fight against human rights by donating DNA kits that will bring the perpetrators to justice.

In addition, we extended free of charge training and application support to for DNA extraction for tissue and bone samples. This enabled the correct results that can be entered into a trial. The estimated value of training is $10k USD. ABL also extended free training to the Government Chemist in Tanzania. This included Sample Acquisition at the scene of the crime, DNA extraction, amplification and analysis. The estimated value of the training was $10k USD.

ABL promotes environmental responsibility by driving DNA technology to enable environment preservation. Implementation For example, ABL will be supporting the transformative $40 million project to revitalize Africa’s orphaned crops. Orphan crops' are African food crops and tree species that have been neglected by researchers and industry because they are not economically important on the global market. The 100 targeted crops are the 'back garden' crops of rural Africa, home to 600 million people. So improving them will greatly improve the diets of Africa's children, helping to eliminate hunger and malnutrition, which causes stunting. Stunting short stature for age and incomplete neurological development is rife among the children of rural Africa. http://www.nepad.org/fr/foodsecurity/news/3206/centre-improve-orphan-crops-opens-nairobi http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10021 In addition we are continuously looking to reduce our environmental footprint in other ways, from using recycled content and reducing unnecessary travel.

We did this with partners Life Technologies, at the internal center for Agro Forestry. NEPAD project. Managing Director Yasmin Verjee says this technology will improve the nutrition and productivity of important crops in Africa and will ultimately reduce malnutrition and stunting that millions of children suffer.
