CCC has approached this response in relation to the following four key areas – Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. CCC’s ongoing commitments showcase constant focus on core values and principles such as the development and growth of staff on all levels, the sense of belonging and harmony for all manpower, continuous propagation of innovation, sustainable commitments to the environment and anti-corruption ideals as well as the utmost respect of cultural identities on company projects. This report was created and developed by a select taskforce composed of staff stemming from diverse departments such as human resources, renewable energies and innovative solutions, construction support and development and health and safety. The objective of this taskforce is to examine and access the sustainability impact of the company across all facets of its operations. Meetings are held every month in order to conduct discussions and assessments of various parameters in order to constantly filter information that will eventually be utilized to compile the report using the contribution and input on all members of this taskforce. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 HUMAN RIGHTS UN GC Principle 1: “Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights”. In CCC, more than 100,000 people from 80 nationalities work side by side in harmony to deliver mega projects in energy and infrastructure that increase the standard of living of millions around the world. While going about our impressive work achievements, we never lose sight of our enduring promise to uphold and respect human rights. CCC upholds and respects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the historic declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948. In its work related Article 23, the declaration highlights everyone’s right to “favorable conditions of work”. In the context of construction, favorable work conditions significantly relate to:  worker accommodation (to be further elaborated under Principle 2 in this report),  food and hygiene, and  safety and the relevant to these three parameters regulations, standards and achievements on our project sites. Our unyielding commitment to offering to our employees food and hygiene of high standards at their messing and accommodation facilities, has not gone unnoticed in Qatar. CCC and about 25 other companies working under Mesaieed Industrial City participated in the QP Annual Food Safety & Hygiene Awareness Session that the prestigious local petroleum company organized in November 2014. CCC was awarded on the 27th of November 2014 “Certificate of Appreciation for compliance & excellent execution of food safety / hygiene regulations during 2014” from QP (photo of the certificate attached). CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 Our Midfield Terminal Building (MTB) Project in the Abu Dhabi Airport UAE, implements a very strict policy on food and hygiene that actually exceeds the national norms and standards. The ultimate aim of this policy and practice is to ensure our workers receive the best care and welfare resulting in a win-win situation for all involved. To this end CCC implements an integrated policy covering the follow aspects: Food Safety Policy: 1. All kitchens are managed by a licensed food service company (catering company) or by food staff appointed by the accommodation facility management. 2. All kitchen staff must be trained & licensed, and go through periodic medical checkup to determine fitness to work. 3. All kitchens’ designs must be approved by the relevant local authorities and equipped with high standard equipment and systems. 4. Supplementary utilities (i.e. raw materials receiving area, loading/offloading decks, cold stores and dry stores etc.) are all built to purpose and in line with the applicable codes and regulations. 5. Messing & Menus are prepared according to different nationalities and different cuisines. 6. Daily food samples are taken and sent to specialized laboratory for analysis; samples are kept for 3 days and then disposed. 7. Continuous maintenance and housekeeping in the kitchens, mess halls and all other dining areas. 8. Breakfast & Dinner are served in the accommodation (camp) mess halls, while lunch meal is transported to work site and served in dedicated welfare and dining facilities. Food transportation is governed by strict procedure and always in a well-controlled environment. 9. Self-cooking onsite (during working hours) is strictly prohibited. 10. Storing of food items onsite (for lunch) is strictly prohibited, food is distributed by CCC and served daily and fresh at lunch time. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 Hygiene Policy: 1. Dedicated full time hygiene staff deployed at each guest workers accommodation, following and implementing established hygiene plans and procedures. 2. Waste Management Plans in place, segregation of waste, recycling and reuse, and referral to disposal as the last option. 3. Pest Control procedures, regular implementation and utilization of qualified and specialized 3rd parties to carry out the pest control activities. 4. Healthy ventilation & lightening standards that meets or exceeds the international norms and best practices (in bed rooms, bathrooms, halls, dining areas, common facilities, etc…) 5. Dedicated professional laundry service (collection & return at least twice per week), also communal laundry is provided to residents (labors) who prefer to wash some of their clothes privately. 6. Ongoing training & awareness sessions, posters, signs, and promotional items to camp residents and labors (with refresher trainings and tool box talks on regular intervals) Significant initiatives have also been undertaken in our MTB Project on safety, an issue that tops our Management’s agenda in its perceived importance. An HSE Incentives & Awards Program has been developed and implemented where recognition and rewards are given to those who make a positive impact on their surrounding working environment, the safety of themselves and their co-workers, and the workplace in general. The awards include special categories for drawings, sketches and slogans. Participants (mainly labors) are encouraged to express their feelings and to reflect on how they perceive safety and the wellbeing of themselves and their families. A large scale ceremony is organized on monthly basis where winners are congratulated by Senior Management and receive generous awards and gifts in front of an audience that consists of their peers, their supervisors, their senior managers and the Clients. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 Our MTB Project in Abu Dhabi, UAE, is our reference project in sustainability achievements, and provides us with precious knowhow, constantly informing our practices on human rights, labor, environmental and anti-corruption issues throughout the Group’s activities. CCC incorporates human rights when drafting employee ethics codes and policies, treats its people as members of a greater family, and interacts with supply chain associates, always in the spirit of the UDHR, in order to finally create a safe, friendly, and diverse workplace.

CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 UN GC Principle 2: “Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.” The responsibility of a company to respect human rights extends beyond the narrow framework of its own employees. On many occasions our mega projects require that in our capacity as the Main Contractor, we employ a large number of specialized contractors. These contractors often employ in turn further subcontractors, resulting in a heightened need for due diligence in the human rights practices of a long chain of command. We have repeatedly demonstrated our respect and support of human rights of the employees of our subcontractors, in our efforts to provide to workers indirectly associated with our projects, favorable work and living conditions. For this report we would like to highlight the relevant successes of our flagship -in terms of Sustainability achievementsMidfield Terminal Building (MTB) Project in the Abu Dhabi Airport. All workers working at MTB Airport Project must be accommodated in camps that meet or exceed the requirements set in UAE Cabinet Decision No. 13/2009 (General Standards Manual for Group Labour Accommodation). Compliance is mandatory among all Contractors, Subcontractors and Suppliers down to the last/smallest tier. The requirements are included in their Tender Package as well as in their Contract Documents so that every company working in MTB Airport Project is aware of the relevant standards prior to joining the Project. All Contractors/Subcontractors must demonstrate compliance prior to mobilization through the submission of Inspection/Compliance Reports supported with evidence and photos etc. This is then followed up by other rounds of inspection & auditing by CCC (The Main Contractor). CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 In average CCC conducts 1 audit per camp per contractor/subcontractor per month. This is a serious effort when we keep in mind the number of personnel & subcontractors working for MTB Airport Project (as of December 2014 nearly 25-30 Subcontractors with total manpower exceeding 14,000 employees). Upon establishing initial compliance, CCC demands all Contractors/Subcontractors to carry out regular inspection & maintenance programs (weekly or monthly) and to provide status update reports to ensure that the same level of compliance is maintained at all times. Companies which do not comply with the above said requirements are penalized through the issuance of NCRs (Non-Conformity Reports) and the withholding of the relevant sum of their monthly progress payments. If the situation is not rectified within the agreed time-frame, an escalation is made through the deduction of the relevant sum of monthly progress payments until such time Contractors/Subcontractors prove full compliance. We remain committed to screening and acting upon potential human rights abuses of our business partners. Abu Dhabi – By the end of 2014 we had successfully qualified 4 worker camps. Representative photos of the qualified camps: CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 LABOUR UN GC Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Equal opportunities for employment and career development for staff regardless of gender, religion, race, age or sexual orientation are foundations of CCC’s ideals and Human Resource policy. This policy has been incorporated as a staple in company procedures that must be adhered to at all projects, offices and sites of CCC, through concise instructions and regulations enforced. We continuously aim to work towards the well-being of all staff, be it through continuous education and training, propagation of welfare committees that are responsible for living and working conditions at sites and through applying and adhering to HR policies and regulations which not only aid the company achieve its set goals but also contribute to a fairer, respectable and equitable work environment and society. UN GC Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. As a devoted upholder of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) CCC adheres to the international labour laws of each country and provides its staff with the relevant and applicable compensation. In the case of overtime work, employees are duly remunerated for this. Wherever applicable, all extra emoluments are paid in a timely fashion as per the laws unique to each country. UN GC Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. We are adamant in the international directives of not employing persons below 18 years old at all projects, areas and offices. This notion has been a core procedure and ideal of the company since its inception. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 UN GC Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. The CCC group provides employment for more than 104,000 staff members from over 85 nationalities around the world, a 9.11% increase when compared to end 2013. This rise is mainly reflected in the difference of a decrease of 2% for management and commercial staff and an increase of 2% for technical staff, in contrast to the previous year. An increase of 10.45% was observed across the daily skilled and unskilled manpower, when compared to 2013. The distribution of manpower for 2014 can be seen below: An unanticipated movement between the female/male ratio occurred during 2014, adjusting to 37.99/62.01 respectively. The countries where social circumstances allow for this to be observed are the United Kingdom, Lebanon and Greece. It is encouraging to notice that an increase of the CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 female number of staff has fluctuated towards an increase when comparatively the year before, the ratio was 30/70. People that work for CCC differ in age, gender, religion, ethnicity and views and sexual orientation. This diversity is an important factor for our continuous success and distinctions are based purely on fundamental requirements of each particular employment position. The array of talent, employment methodology and work experience has a conclusive effect on project work and cultivates the corporate culture in the company. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 ENVIRONMENT UN GC Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Environmental Procedures CCC Environmental Procedures are applicable to all activities and locations throughout camp and work areas within the Projects. They outline the basic actions that will be taken during construction activities to mitigate any environmental impact; they also establish the compliance requirements for Environmental Management and describe the handling and disposal methods for all liquid and solid wastes generated during the execution of the project. Moreover, our Environmental Procedures address air pollution prevention and control, noise pollution prevention and control, protection of water resources, and site reinstatement. Furthermore, CCC continuously improves and updates its environmental procedures to make sure that they meet and even exceed local requirements. These procedures have developed an environmental friendly mentality embedded within the company’s culture. Consequently, the Company has gained the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems certification by Bureau Veritas, ensuring that the company is dedicated to environmental conservation according to international standards.

UN GC Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Sustainability Initiatives As a pioneer in the construction industry, and with a vision to lead in promoting green awareness, Consolidated Contractors Company (CCC) believes in providing future generations with a healthy and safe environment as well as social and economic prosperity. As a result, CCC started examining the implementation of sustainability Initiatives in construction camps and project site facilities in the Middle East early on. Those initiatives cover the following categories: Use of solar powered luminaires for the camp inner street lighting Energy Conservation Use of solar heater in camp’s kitchen (Renewable and laundry Energy) Use of solar photovoltaic power plant for CCC’s camps CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 Use of low flow sanitary fixtures for all toilets Water Conservation Use of wastewater treatment plant Sustainability Initiatives Implementation: CCC implemented the sustainability initiatives in various CCC units and projects as described below: Camp Initiative Results Image The daily hot water consumed by using the A solar-heated water with a total solar water heater system is approximately capacity of 11,500 liters provided 58,400 liters per day.

UAE CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 CCC won the Best Green Initiative of the year 2014 at the BGREEN Awards, in recognition of the numerous sustainability initiatives implemented at its locations. CONSOLIDATED CONTRACTORS COMPANY COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 UN GC Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Electric Pick-up Trucks and Hybrid Busses CCC has been investigating the use of electric vehicles in its fleet, including hybrids and pure electrics. Already several electrical pick-up trucks & hybrid buses have been purchased, registered and are being used under pilot schemes mainly in the UAE. The preferred pick-up trucks are pure electric vehicles and have proved to be more efficient than internal combustion engines. The selected type of hybrid buses have a capacity of 47 people and are currently undergoing testing to examine reliability and fuel saving capabilities. They combine an electric motor connected directly to the drive shaft of the bus. During the drive the bus can work on electricity alone up to a speed of 40 km/h and after that the diesel engine begins operation in to provide the necessary power to for the bus to reach the maximum speed of 80km/h. For CCC the benefits of embracing electric vehicles range from lower operating costs and less expensive vehicle maintenance as well as cleaner environment.

Bulletin Issue 112 | 4th Quarter 2014 C C C 41 CSR News Report Supporting the Friends of the Child Nursery School CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Friends of the Child is an organization that provides widespread assistance to over 450 families annually. One of the several programmes it runs is a day care for neglected children, who come from families living in severe poverty. Here the children eat, sleep and bathe and engage in educational and recreational programs. The Athens Committee is providing support to cover the nutrition needs of the children attending the nursery school. Parenting Seminars and Support Groups This is a new Athens CSR Committee initiative which focuses on the well-being and work-life balance of CCC employees and their families. The complexities of modern life put heavy pressure on working people and their spouses, those having to adapt to changing environments and those living in multi-cultural surroundings. This new CSR initiative aims to help CCC parents to cope with these factors and to build their children’s resilience to cope with today’s high pressures and increasing expectations. The topics cover both children and teenager issues such as: understanding teen misbehaviour; peer pressure and bullying, discipline and fostering self-esteem. They also include mentoring of children and teenagers themselves. These sessions are offered by CK Mentoring who offer as well Parent Support Groups and the first Parenting session took place on 12 December 2014 at the Athens office. Donation of Electronic Whiteboard to Special Needs Vocational Training Workshop Although based in Greece’s capital Athens, the city called home by nearly half the country’s population, the Athens CSR Committee has always been open to supporting the efforts against social exclusion in challenging times. Such a distinguished effort is taking place at the Workshop of Special Vocational Educational and Training in Pylaia, Thessaloniki. A group of highly specialized teaching professionals and social workers are guiding around 50 students experiencing disorders such as cerebral palsy, quadriplegia, mental retardation, autism, vision impairment, even blindness, severe and mild disabilities, epilepsy just to name a few. Responding to the school’s request, CCC donated and installed in the main classroom an electronic whiteboard along with an iPad, where the latest software in special education can be utilized.

RAHMAN ‘Helwa Ya Baladi’ The beauty of Egypt stems from its oldest places and continues to the newest, a multi-layered culture, which seems to accord equal respect to ancient and modern. Today, among the most popular places to visit are the monuments of the Nile Valley, the souks, mosques and churches and many other recreational sites. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Since CSR Egypt was founded, it took the responsibility of supporting tourism in Egypt by running an initiative called Helwa Ya Baladi (My Country Is Beautiful) in order to discover the beauty of Egypt and to visit historical places in particular which most of us have not yet seen. As well as promoting the tourism industry, employees would get a chance to meet in one place and increase acquaintances between them. Christianity and Judaism On Friday 7 November 10:00am quite a good number of CCC employees at the call of CSR initiative hired a couple of tour guides to illustrate and demonstrate the historical backgrounds which spread useful knowledge to the CCC attendees about the various monuments. It was a great opportunity to take plenty of fascinating pictures of those places as well as many photos of the group of employees. The tour started with the Amr Ibn El-Aas mosque which is the first mosque built in Egypt and Africa, and the fourth mosque built in Islam after the mosques of Medina. Then the tour continued to the neighbouring Hanging Church, one of the most important churches. Its name comes from the fact that it was built over the Roman fortress of Babylon at a height of 13 meters above the ground. The tour concluded with a visit to the synagogue which was originally a temple, then turned into a church until the reign of Ahmad Ibn Tulun, when it became a temple again after his allegiance with the Jewish leader at that time, Abraham Ben Ezra. This temple is also known as the Temple of Ben Ezra. The participants had a great time mixed with fun and everyone enriched their knowledge and discovered that Egypt is really beautiful and worth visiting. All the participants were enthusiastic about joining a future trip, to be announced. C C C Bulletin Issue 112 | 4th Quarter 2014 A. A.

Although still under investigation, numerous physicians have noted that blood donors typically have fewer cases of heart disease than non-donors. • Boosts the production of red blood cells: the donation of blood reduces the number of red blood cells in the blood. The bone marrow immediately replenishes the lost cells. As a result, the blood of a donor is refreshed every time they donate because of the increased production of new blood cells. • Psychological Advantage: acts of altruism make you feel good! Giving feels great, especially when you understand that one hour of your time and one pint of blood can make such a difference. • Beach cleaning is not just about trash for CCC; it’s about the need for clean oceans, shorelines and waterways and about employees acting together to create lasting solutions to marine pollution. Our oceans and waterways have been a dumping ground for man-made debris. The harmful effects of marine debris are severe: negative economic and aesthetic impacts, harm and risk to human health and safety, injury and death to animals through entanglement and ingestion and habitat destruction.

KAHOUSH Five Steps towards a Greener Datacenter at Athens Office During the past few years, the ISD infrastructure team has dramatically improved the performance and reduced the costs associated with our datacenter at the Athens office. The target was to align with the company’s Go Green strategy. In our datacenter in Athens, we have followed the below five strategies to reach our goal: 1. Virtualization By using virtualization we were able to reduce the number of physical servers from 200 to 14 and CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY thus decrease the carbon footprint. Oracle SQL Application Servers Email File Print Power multiple “virtual machines” on one server with virtualization 2. Improved Overall Storage Practices We have applied several storage techniques to enhance storage efficiency and reduce costs. a. Tiered Storage: Four-Tier storage helped us increase effective utilization of storage resources, improve our performance and reduce costs. b. Data duplication: To improve backup speeds and better utilize the storage. Bulletin Issue 112 | 4th Quarter 2014 C C C 51 Five Steps towards a Greener Datacenter at Athens Office 3. Hardware Refresh Cycle CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Replacing older hardware every five years will result in significant cost and energy savings. New hardware now offers green, energy-efficient options, a smaller foot print and better management. 4. Datacenter Airflow We have applied the following strategies to optimize the cooling in our datacenter: a. Hot Aisle/Cold Aisle design: Equipment is placed on racks to ensure that air intake comes from a cold aisle and all output air is expelled into a hot aisle. b. Datacenter Temperature: The datacenter should not feel like a freezer; overcooling in a datacenter is a common problem. c. Replaced the air conditioners with VRF types (Variable Refrigerant Flow): The VRF results in superior energy savings, redundancy and sound levels as low as 23dB. C C C Bulletin Issue 112 | 4th Quarter 2014 Five Steps towards a Greener Datacenter at Athens Office 5. Multifunction Printers (MFP) and Managed Print Services (MPS) with Security CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY By choosing the right printer model that has all the features that the user needs in terms of printing and security, we were able to cut down the number of printers by more than half. Printing is now also secure as all the new MFPs have access card readers that will enable the users to use their existing security cards to collect their printouts. To summarize, the five steps above have led to the reduction in costs in the Athens datacenter as shown below. Our next goal is to implement these steps in other areas and projects. • Electric power cost reduction of server room cooling is down by 67%. It decreased from 162,000KWH/year (24,300€ /year) to 54,000KWH/year (8,100€/year). Saving = 16,200€/year. • Printing costs including power saving are reduced by 37%. They decreased from 130,944€/year to 95,577€/year. Saving=35,368€/year. • Printers were reduced by 67%. 85 printers were replaced by 28 MFPs. Saving=57 Printers. • Carbon footprint emissions from the server room cooling and printers were reduced by 60%. They decreased from 178 TONs CO2 /year to 70 TONs CO2/year. Saving = 108 TONs CO2/year.
