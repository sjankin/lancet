CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 4 Company data (as of March 31, 2014) Name Casio Computer Co., Ltd. Headquarters 1-6-2, Hon-machi, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan, 151-8543 Established June 1, 1957 President and CEO Kazuo Kashio Employees 2,728 (consolidated: 10,992) Paid-in capital ¥48,592 million Net Sales ¥321,761 million (consolidated) Operating income ¥26,576 million (consolidated) Ordinary income ¥25,743 million (consolidated Net income ¥15,989 million (consolidated Timepieces, Electronic Dictionaries, Calculators, Label Printers, Electronic Musical Instruments, Major Products Digital Cameras, Handheld Terminals, Cash Registers, Office Computers, Page Printers, Data Projectors, Molds Sales and operating income by reportable segment/ Sales by region CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 5 We will keep creating universal value in order to help build a more sustainable global society. The Next Inventions That Will Change Society Casio Computer Co., Ltd., has contributed to the development of society, from its first day to the present, by continually creating innovations and providing them to the world. As we move into the future, we will never waver from this corporate creed of “Creativity and Contribution.” Our calculators, timepieces, and musical instruments—all powered by the digital technologies invented by the late chairperson emeritus Toshio Kashio—still drive Casio’s core business today. Why are these products so successful? Because they have universal value: everyone sees them as necessary. If people see a product as essential, demand for it will never disappear. Many of the products we have created over the years demonstrate this: the Casio Mini, which was the world’s first personal calculator; the G-SHOCK brand of shock-resistant watches; and the QV-10, one of the very first consumer-grade LCD digital cameras. Good inventions like these bring new value to the world, create new markets and culture, and contribute to the development of society. As we look at the future of our business at Casio, we believe that our mission is to keep inventing new products and services that will provide new value—on a level that equals or surpasses our past achievements. Addressing Social Issues with Creativity The world today faces many challenging social and environmental issues. As Casio continues to expand as a global enterprise, we are determined to ensure that our core business contributes creative solutions to these issues. Respect for human rights, which Casio has been focusing intently on for the last two years, is one example. In July 2014, we established and announced the Casio Group Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights, which states our commitment to addressing human rights issues in and outside the group. We also created a tool for monitoring the status of human rights observance and used it to take stock of efforts to address human rights issues at all production and sales sites in and outside Japan. Going forward, we will use the results in the PDCA cycle to drive improvement at each site as we strengthen human rights due diligence group-wide. We continue to deliver on our long-term commitment to tackling other pressing social and environmental issues. One of our priorities is education, where products like our electronic dictionaries and calculators make a difference around the world. We are also very concerned with “realizing a low-carbon society,” “building a recycling society,” and “living in harmony with nature,” the three commitments set out in the Casio Environmental Vision 2050. Casio is determined to help build a sustainable global society not only by striving to resolve these social and environmental issues, but also by providing new value through its products. The key constructs of our vision of a sustainable global society are: resource recyclability, biodiversity, fairness across generations, and fairness across regions. To help us achieve these commitments, in recent years we have been strengthening the non-financial factors of corporate value, such as governance, environmental performance, and CSR by responding proactively to heightened social expectations in these areas. We are enhancing our non-financial reporting based on the latest international standards for CSR reports, and actively disclosing information related to these initiatives. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 6 The Growth of Each and Every Employee Drives Casio Creativity While helping to build a sustainable global society by realizing our social vision, improving corporate value, and delivering steady growth, it is also our mission at Casio to keep providing decidedly original products that have high added value for users. Products and services that are backed up by completely original ideas as well as technologies so unique that they can’t be copied even by others who want to—these are the results of Casio creativity; this is what it means to go from “0” to “1,” making something from nothing. The secret to all this Casio creativity is the talent and energy of our employees. That is why we are continuing to upgrade our human resources system. We are vigorously fostering diversity by hiring and encouraging women, seniors, persons with disabilities, and non-Japanese employees to play active roles. We are also working hard to promote work-life balance. Both of these efforts are designed to facilitate the further growth and success of each and every employee. Let me say a word right here to all Casio employees: I ask that each of you think for yourself about the kind of society you want to create and the kind of company you want Casio to be, and then take action accordingly. I would also like you to think about how your work is connected to and benefits society, and to bring that awareness into your day-to-day tasks. I’m convinced that you are the source of the Casio creativity of the future. This report presents the major CSR initiatives of the Casio group in fiscal 2014. I am confident that we can keep on making positive contributions in the future through our core business by sharing our vision for society with stakeholders and continuing to meet their expectations. I look forward to hearing your frank opinions of our efforts. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 7 As we aim to help build a sustainable global society, what does society expect from Casio, and what issues does Casio have to tackle? These questions were posed to Casio employees in two special in-house workshops on future strategy. Young Employees Envision the Future at Casio On April 14, 2014, Casio held a workshop with 29 young employees in their late twenties to early thirties—the people who will carry Casio forward into the next generation. The theme of the workshop was reaffirming Casio’s uniqueness and considering the kind of future the company should seek to create. The purpose was to give employees the chance to articulate a future for Casio that they could create with their own efforts, to reflect upon what needs to be done to incorporate this vision into their day-to-day work, and to come up with their own ways of tackling these challenges. During the workshop, the participants engaged in discussions following the flow outlined below, taking a fresh look at themselves from the outside through the perspective of stakeholders and painting a picture of their future. The participants saw the strength of the Casio brand as driven by the company’s ability to go from “0” to “1,” which is the company’s original spirit, as well as toughness. Taking various social background factors into consideration, they generated many ideas about how to accelerate and evolve manufacturing in a way that is true to Casio, in order to further reinforce the company’s brand strength in the future. Their views, which went into good detail on key concepts, included the importance of continuing to propose new things to society and aspiring to be a company that continues to embrace challenges by making the most of the strengths of young people to build “a new Casio.” Workshop feedback from the participants included remarks such as, “I was able to see the essence of CSR,” “Opportunities like this should be created more often, as they form the basis for thinking about work,” and “I was surprised that we had a similar awareness of issues, regardless of the departments we belong to. I felt that now really is the time to take action.” Some also pointed out challenges, including, “I was unable to express my deeper opinions, so in the ideas we proposed, I felt I was relying on other’s thoughts to reach my own objective.” Although the workshop was four hours long, the time seemed to fly by, as the content of the discussions was so absorbing. The young employees who participated were able to reaffirm the roles that they are expected to play. Going forward, Casio will continue to think of new and creative ways to bolster its efforts to enable all employees to engage in their work in a future-oriented manner. The company will keep providing opportunities like this one for employees to contemplate the future from their own perspective. Flow of the workshop with young employees 1) Participate in CSR seminar to learn about changes in the social environment 2) Discuss in teams their own understanding of Casio’s uniqueness CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 8 2) Discuss in teams their own understanding of Casio’s uniqueness 3) Contemplate expectations of Casio from stakeholders’ perspective and share results with everyone 4) Discuss in groups how society will have changed by 2020 and what Casio should strive to be like at that time, and what Casio must work at now to achieve that vision 5) Share ideas with everyone via presentations by each group Creating the Future: What Initiatives Should Casio Address on a Priority Basis? Following the workshop with young employees, Casio held a workshop with the 44 members of the CSR Committee on May 28, 2014. Building on the results of the first workshop with young employees, the discussion focused on materiality for Casio (important CSR issues) with the objective of thinking of detailed action strategies aimed at achieving a sustainable global society. Participants considered beforehand what Casio should address in the future, looking from the internal perspective of Casio’s uniqueness and the external view of stakeholders’ expectations. The workshop started with individuals sharing their own ideas. They ended up selecting those matters that Casio will give priority to, making reference to the 46 aspects specified in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which is the international guideline for sustainability reporting. The results of discussions in each group were then shared with everyone. Key concepts in social trends relating to Casio that came up in the workshop included: Japan’s dwindling birth rate and aging population, globalization, environmental problems, and supporting the advancement of developing countries.

Key concepts in social trends relating to Casio that came up in the workshop included: Japan’s dwindling birth rate and aging population, globalization, environmental problems, and supporting the advancement of developing countries. Issues that the members felt deserved priority attention were: contributing to social issues through the core business (“Creativity and Contribution”), contributing to the environment through the core business, and strengthening human resources measures such as hiring, workplace environment, and education. Having a meeting of the CSR Committee in a discussion format was a new approach that produced a number of discoveries. Feedback from the participants included opinions such as, “The workshop format enabled us to have very meaningful discussions,” and “It is important to tie the discussions into future output,” as well as many forward-looking opinions such as, “We have to make clear what the Casio uniqueness is that has been lost and get back to being the old feisty Casio,” and “Women’s opinions should also be included in the CSR Committee.” Casio is aiming to identify and report on materiality in its 2016 sustainability report. Moving forward, Casio will continue to make use of this workshop format to advance these discussions in and outside the company. Flow of the CSR Committee workshop 1) Share in each group what should be addressed in the future while making use of Casio’s uniqueness, which participants had considered beforehand 2) Discuss materiality for Casio (important CSR issues) in each group CASIO3)SUSTAINABILITY Share with everyoneREPORT 2014 via presentations by each group 10 2) Discuss materiality for Casio (important CSR issues) in each group 3) Share with everyone via presentations by each group CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 11 On June 13, 2014, Casio held a meeting with external experts in fields such as the environment, consumer advocacy, and human rights. The purpose of the meeting was to hear the experts’ diverse perspectives on what is expected of Casio and what Casio should prioritize in the future. Answers to these questions will be used to help identify materiality as seen by of stakeholders. On the day of the meeting, each expert presented an evaluation of Casio’s CSR and spoke about future expectations as seen from his or her area of expertise. Casio employees who attended the meeting as representatives of the CSR Committee then asked questions and expressed opinions, generating some lively discussion. One Casio participants commented, “Even though I recognize the importance of CSR, honestly I can never get around to it when swamped with usual work.” The expert reply was, “That is understandable, but it raises the question of whether there is a shared goal within the company of pursuing long-term value, not just short-term gain.” Many participants saw Africa as a region to focus attention on in the future, and the discussion grew quite animated as the participants considered the unique ways Casio could contribute. Feedback from employees who listened to the opinions and advice of the experts included: “It was stimulating,” “It put some wind in my sails,” “I had the feeling that the term ‘social contribution’ might not in essence fit corporate operations, which pursue profits. On the other hand, I realized that we could make an even bigger social contribution by focusing on essential needs and integrating them into our business,” and “I felt once again that stakeholders’ biggest expectation of Casio is to contribute through its business.” Below are overviews of the opinions of each expert. Communicate your environmental commitments to your product customers Sadayoshi Tobai Conservation Director, WWF Japan Every business on earth including Casio depends on ecosystem services, benefits provided by the ecosystems of the earth. How to achieve sustainable use of these services is the challenge the corporate sector needs to meet. For example, in order to produce the paper products used in Japan, deforestation and species losses are happening overseas. Casio has already made it a part of its policy to ensure the traceability of the paper it uses, and I hope to see the progress of this policy’s implementation and the publication of its progress in the public domain. In order to create a low-carbon society, Casio has already set and is working towards clear Sadayoshi Tobai goals in the area of energy savings. On the other hand, in the area of sourcing more Conservation Director, WWF Japan renewable energy, Casio is still in the process of setting targets, and WWF Japan hopes that Casio will set clear, numeric, and time-bound targets and follow up in their implementation. WWF Japan currently has approximately 42,000 supporters in Japan, but the number of Casio customers who regularly use the company’s products is several hundred or several thousand times more—and they are both in Japan and overseas. That is a strength, and WWF hopes that Casio will takes advantage of this strength to reach out widely and communicate how its business processes take full account of its environmental footprint. That type of communication can help promote wise choices in society. Help foster ethical consumers CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 12 company’s products is several hundred or several thousand times more—and they are both in Japan and overseas. That is a strength, and WWF hopes that Casio will takes advantage of this strength to reach out widely and communicate how its business processes take full account of its environmental footprint. That type of communication can help promote wise choices in society. Help foster ethical consumers Kikuko Tatsumi Executive Advisor Nippon Association of Consumer Specialists I think that the kind of message that the company disseminates when it ultimately delivers things to consumers is the most important issue. Looking at your CSR report, I get the feeling that Casio is a company that carries out manufacturing based on well-established philosophy. Now I would like to see you put more effort into spreading your message far and wide. For instance, you say that you want to provide customers with environmentally friendly products, but what kind of products do you call “environmentally friendly”? Until now, we consumers had not turned our attention much beyond the stages of product use and Kikuko Tatsumi disposal, even when we thought we were choosing eco-friendly products. Actually, however, Executive Advisor I think that products that are truly “eco”—or in other words, truly good products—go beyond Nippon Association of that. They allow everyone involved throughout the supply chain to think, “I’m happy I had the Consumer Specialists chance to be involved in this.” This is why I would like Casio to convey to consumers what kind of people are involved and in what way Casio products are environmentally friendly. If you do that, it will lead consumers to think and study, and to adopt the same ideas when making other choices, as well. In this way, I think that perhaps part of your CSR is to help consumers become “ethical consumers” who make choices while taking both environmental and ethical aspects into consideration. Build a shared recognition of your involvement in the community Kaori Kuroda Executive Director CSO Network Japan This does not apply only to Casio—but so-called “social contribution” activities often come to mind when people talk about contribution to the community. You have specified five social contribution priorities and undertake significant activities such as the “Class on Life.” However, involvement in the community means in fact a much broader and deeper concept. First of all, I think that Casio needs to form a certain shared recognition and policy of its involvement in the community and local society. For example, Casio should ascertain the current condition of activities conducted at each site and recognize what is being done and what should be done. Be aware not only of the Kaori Kuroda obvious parties for communication in each community, such as suppliers and business Executive Director partners, but also other potential stakeholders that are not always as visible. In addition, do CSO Network Japan more than taking an active approach in the form of “social contribution”; also consider whether your corporate operations have any negative impact on the community and if they do, how you can remedy that. Of course, that could include such things as human rights problems. I would suggest that you reconsider your involvement in the community from that kind of broad perspective. Even if the manpower at each site is small, as long as there is a clear policy spelled out by the head office and support systems in place, there should be a way to carry out some kind of initiative, even with just a few people. Most likely, this will lead to a good practice within the areas where you are already active, and that will take you to a sustainable future. Corporate value is determined by the kind of investors who choose your company Takeshi Mizuguchi Professor Takasaki City University of Economics The first thing I would like you to think about from the perspective of my specialty of responsible investment is what kind of investors you want to attract to your company. If you want to gain “good investors” who will support the company over the long term, then you must communicate how you are addressing a variety of social challenges and how that action squares with the long-term value of the company. Take, for instance, using calculators to teach arithmetic in developing countries. You have to show investors a vision: what kind of world are you trying to create through that initiative, and what kind of role are you trying to play?

Your effort may help drive the whole industry in the right direction. Thank you for your contribution. Look back from the future when asking, “What should we do now?” Hideto DeDe Kawakita Chief Executive Officer International Institute for Human, Organization and the Earth (IIHOE) What we have all been asking in common today are not just questions like, “What have you accomplished so far?” but also “When you consider an issue from the standpoint of the future, how much should you have accomplished?” In other words, we are saying you must define clear goals. And I suggest that you more actively seek help from the outside, in order to achieve those goals. When you think about business developments outside Japan, for example, the scenario of what will be the next consumer electronic device to sell in developing countries—especially in the least developed among the developing countries—keeps on changing as a result of Hideto DeDe Kawakita the rapid evolution of ICT. Power generation and distribution, communications, and other Chief Executive Officer infrastructure development have advanced at an overwhelmingly faster pace than we had International Institute for Human, imagined a dozen or so years ago and, what is more, it has jumped several stages of the Organization and the Earth (IIHOE) usual process. Now we must respond to that progress. From that point of view, for example, instead of selling calculators, it would be better to think that you are selling ‘the function of calculation’ and to have opportunities to think together with people in the country where you want to sell (while listening to their explanation of the situation) how to turn the next evolutionary form of calculation into a business. In Japan as well, given the increase of the elderly population, rather than calculation for the purpose of getting an answer, arithmetic done deliberately as brain exercise might become a more familiar practice. In this way, Casio should form hypotheses as to how social changes and your basic business domains overlap. Then, in preparation for the evolution of your business models, you need to think about how to recruit the right human resources for the job, and what kind of companies could create possibilities if made into alliance partners. In connection with that, it is important for Casio to do more to get out this message from the top: “These are the challenges our company intends to embrace going forward, and that is why we are looking for human resources who can do these things together with us.” CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 15 Making life richer and more convenient by creating innovative products—this was the aspiration of Casio’s founders, and it is summed up in the corporate creed, “Creativity and Contribution.” Casio believes that part of its social responsibility is to pass down this corporate creed to all of its employees without fail. Casio is determined to ensure that its businesses, which make something from nothing, or go from “0” to “1,” continue to make a consistent contribution to a more sustainable global society. Welcoming the challenge of helping to build a more sustainable global society In recent years, there has been widespread concern over the sustainability of human civilization in its current form. While economic activity has enriched the lives of many people, it has also put great strain on the global environment and social systems. Cooperation is needed to overcome this global crisis and leave a sustainable global society to future generations. In order to achieve this, proactive initiatives need to be taken by individuals, companies, governments, and international organizations. A company has a much larger impact on society than an individual, and corporate activities are responsible for some of the current impact on the planet. This is why society now has much greater expectations for companies to actively implement their own initiatives to help resolve sustainability issues, or in other words, to fulfill their corporate social responsibility (CSR). Today, a company’s performance on social responsibility impacts its corporate value. Firms that fail to fulfill their corporate social responsibilities are no longer valued or allowed to survive by society. Casio’s corporate creed of “Creativity and Contribution” contains the company’s founding idea of social contribution through the provision of innovative products that have never existed before. Everyone working at Casio fully appreciates this corporate creed, and the company is always striving to help build a more sustainable global society by pursuing business activities designed to make something from nothing, or go from “0” to “1.” This is Casio’s CSR approach. To ensure that it continues to deliver on the commitments of its corporate creed, Casio has established three key documents. The Charter of Creativity for Casio outlines the basic principles behind the mindset and conduct expected from everyone at Casio, while the Casio Common Commitment provides specific conduct guidelines for implementing the Charter. The Casio Group Code of Conduct establishes norms for ethical conduct and requires all Casio group executives and employees to comply with relevant laws and internal rules. With recent changes in the external environment, in June 2013 Casio revised the Code of Conduct to reflect the higher expectations of the international community with a focus on the areas of human rights, supply chain management, and anti-corruption measures. Casio has established four specific keywords, shown below, to guide its efforts to address social and environmental issues that relate directly and indirectly to its business operations. By addressing these issues the company aims to help build a more sustainable global society. The world today is faced with many complex economic, environmental and social problems of a very serious nature. Humanity as a whole needs to consider its own best future, and then find ways to move in that direction. If economic activities are to be maintained on this planet with limited resources, every member of society must try to help achieve sustainability. Casio is determined to do its part to find solutions for social and environmental issues while continuing to provide new value to society, based on its corporate creed of “Creativity and Contribution.” Casio will steadily pursue specific initiatives while always seeking to conceive of ideal solutions for each issue. Keywords for a sustainable world and Casio’s main initiatives ■ Resource recyclability (social and economic activities on a planet with limited resources) Reducing daytime power consumption through the use of geothermal electricity and the installation of power storage equipment, etc. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 16 Casio is determined to do its part to find solutions for social and environmental issues while continuing to provide new value to society, based on its corporate creed of “Creativity and Contribution.” Casio will steadily pursue specific initiatives while always seeking to conceive of ideal solutions for each issue. Keywords for a sustainable world and Casio’s main initiatives ■ Resource recyclability (social and economic activities on a planet with limited resources) Reducing daytime power consumption through the use of geothermal electricity and the installation of power storage equipment, etc. ■ Biodiversity (respecting the uniqueness of all living organisms and recognizing their interdependence) Establishing an Environmental Action Plan, and evaluating the entire impact of the business, etc. ■ Fairness across generations (the current generation properly appreciating the legacy of previous generations and passing it on to future generations) Setting medium and long-term CO2 reduction targets, and promoting next-generation development and education, etc. ■ Fairness across regions (fairly distributing wealth and assets across regions) Being a member of the UN Global Compact, and conducting CSR activities globally, etc. Casio’s CSR Platform Charter of Creativity for Casio and Casio Common Commitment In 2003, Casio adopted the Charter of Creativity for Casio and Casio Common Commitment, a promise from everyone working at Casio. They are designed to ensure that Casio employees will be aware of the corporate creed at all times, and act upon it.

United Nations Global Compact Casio products are made through cooperation not just within the Casio Group, but with many other parts and consignment manufacturers. Through global distribution, over 100 million Casio products are sold each year in 140 countries around the word. In order for consumers worldwide to purchase Casio products with confidence, the company believes that it must support and adhere to common global principles for sustainable growth for the international community, beginning with Casio’s global supply chain. This is why, in December 2010, Casio joined the United Nations Global Compact, and made Casio Group employees thoroughly aware of this. While pursuing specific initiatives for the realization of the Global Compact principles, Casio is also appropriately disclosing progress. Casio is also active at the local network level of the UN Global Compact, serving as a member of the Japanese Global Compact Local Network (GC-JN). 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact Human Rights 1.

United Nations Global Compact Main stakeholders of the Casio Group Casio strives to ascertain and understand how its operations impact the environment and society and what kind of contributions it can make. It then identifies stakeholder groups and strives to implement appropriate measures for each. Companies must not become complacent in their efforts to pursue social responsibility and maintain social trust. The first step in earning stakeholders’ understanding and trust for the initiatives of the company is listening to what they have to say. Good communication is a necessity, and it is not a one-way street. Companies must find solutions that benefit both their stakeholders and their business, as well as the global society as a whole. By actively disclosing information to stakeholders, and creating opportunities for dialogue with them, Casio finds out what stakeholders expect, evaluates its existing activities, and plans future initiatives.

Steps in CSR Implementation Since the establishment of its CSR Promotion Office in 2004, Casio has been implementing CSR activities while expanding the themes to be undertaken and the scope of their impact. In the initial stage, there was an emphasis on protecting corporate value through compliance and risk management (preventative CSR). Starting in fiscal 2011, Casio began focusing on using CSR to improve corporate value (proactive CSR). In fiscal 2012, Casio appointed managers and team leaders who have responsibility for implementing CSR in order to advance CSR globally at group companies around the world. At the same time, Casio evaluated and analyzed the status of initiatives at each company based on the core subjects under ISO 26000. In fiscal 2013, Casio once again surveyed its group companies concerning CSR activities with a focus on respect for human rights, among the priority issues identified in the previous year. Based on an evaluation and analysis of the survey results, Casio has been making group-wide efforts to improve sensitivity to human rights issues, making this a priority since fiscal 2014. As part of those efforts, in June 2013 Casio implemented revisions to the Casio Group Code of Conduct reflecting the latest global standards relating to respect for human rights and fair business practices. In July 2014, it established and announced the Casio Group Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights (Casio Human Rights Policy), in order to show its commitment to human rights problems in and outside the company. It also used an independently developed tool for checking the status of human rights initiatives to take stock of efforts in this area at each group company. Going forward, Casio will regularly conduct these checks of human rights practices and will strive to improve human rights due diligence group-wide by making the assessment, analysis, and feedback of the results a routine process. Additionally, Casio made efforts to identify materiality for the group. First it held an employee workshop and a CSR Committee workshop to explore materiality in the eyes of employees. Then it held a meeting with experts in different areas to hear stakeholder perspectives on materiality. From here on Casio will continue these kinds of initiatives in an effort to increase the precision of its output (Casio’s materiality). Implementing CSR initiatives CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 24 CSR Committee CSR Committee Casio has established a CSR Committee headed by the director responsible for CSR under the board of directors. The committee is the central body for implementation of CSR. The CSR Committee is composed of a Secretariat that administers the committee as well as representatives of staff-related departments at Casio Computer Co., Ltd., and all Casio group companies worldwide. The staff-related departments and group companies appoint their own CSR chiefs and managers. The committee meets once every six months, but its activities are carried out based on fiscal-year management cycles. At the start of the fiscal year, the Secretariat checks progress made on various themes in the previous year. It then determines the most important CSR themes for the current year, and draws up its action plan for the year. According to this action plan, ongoing themes are continued and new themes are introduced. Next, the current situation and challenges are ascertained, and a working group establishes new themes, as needed. The CSR-related departments then implement programs based on the established goals for the themes they are responsible for and the annual plans to achieve the goals. At the end of the fiscal year, progress made on the themes is evaluated. Based on the results, issues are identified, and then used to improve the plan for the next year. CSR Committee System In fiscal 2014, “fair business practices” was added as a key policy initiative alongside “respect for human rights,” which is a core objective of ISO 26000 that Casio had been working on since the previous fiscal year. A total of six themes were promoted: one compliance-related theme and five themes focusing on CSR issues. The following table outlines the progress made on these themes in fiscal 2014, along with the fiscal 2015 plan. <Individual themes for fiscal 2014 and implementation status> No. Theme Fiscal 2014 performance Status Fiscal 2015 plan Fair business practices: Drafted guidance and Issue guidance and 1 Ongoing take action to prevent corruption conducted survey produce manual Create system for checking Drafted policy and checked Tally issues and 2 Ongoing respect for human rights human rights issues plan countermeasures Increase and utilize Manage and promote 3 Launched Diversity Project Ongoing employee diversity the project Implement measures to Surveyed and assessed Consider conducting 4 ensure no conflict minerals Ongoing suppliers a second supplier survey are used CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 Address Scope 3 in 25 fiscal Finished calculating 5 Completed ― environmental performance 2013 data In fiscal 2014, “fair business practices” was added as a key policy initiative alongside “respect for human rights,” which is a core objective of ISO 26000 that Casio had been working on since the previous fiscal year.

True to this commitment, Casio works to ensure that management decision-making is quick and that all operations are executed properly and efficiently. Corporate governance framework Casio recognizes that not only quick decision-making and appropriate execution of business operations, but also the strengthening of management oversight to improve management integrity and transparency, are important in order to reliably achieve management goals and continually improve corporate value. The board of directors is tasked with management decision-making and supervision of the execution of business operations. Directors and corporate auditors attend board meetings, where they deliberate upon and make decisions on important business issues. As of June 30, 2014, the board of directors is composed of 11 directors, two of whom are outside directors. The term of office for directors is one year so as to clearly delineate the responsibility that they have for management and to facilitate quick responses to changes in the business environment. In addition, Casio has adopted an executive officer system, in order to keep the board of directors at an appropriate size and to strengthen the business execution function. Casio has a board of corporate auditors. In accordance with audit policies set out by the board of corporate auditors, the three auditors, two of whom are outside auditors, perform rigorous audits by attending meetings of the board of directors and other important meetings, by interviewing and receiving reports from directors and others, and by reviewing resolution documents. The outside directors and outside auditors are independent officers registered with the Tokyo Stock Exchange in compliance with regulations. Accounting auditors perform external audits according to generally accepted Japanese auditing standards, and they also provide recommendations for operational improvement. The Internal Audit Department carries out audits to ensure that all organizations in the Casio Group are operating in compliance with laws and regulations as well as internal standards. It also has a full-time staff that provides support for the corporate auditors.

Risk management Based on its Basic Risk Management Policies, Casio has built a system to manage risks efficiently. The company established the Risk Management Committee as the steering body to implement management programs with an emphasis on compliance risk. In the early stage of risk management, Casio identified 70 laws relating to its businesses and listed measures being taken to comply with each law. Regarding laws where Casio had deficiencies relating to management cycle operation and documented practices, the committee analyzed the importance of each risk based on the possibility of its occurrence and its potential impact on company management. Casio implemented measures first to address the risks of higher importance, and developed a system to continue analyzing and addressing risks. In fiscal 2011, Casio transferred the risk management function from the Risk Management Committee to the CSR Committee, and it continues to implement this function. Under risk management at Casio, departments with roles most closely associated with certain risks establish the necessary mechanisms to ensure compliance and risk management. The Internal Audit Department then confirms these mechanisms through internal audits. Accordingly, as of the end of fiscal 2011, the relevant departments have the necessary measures in place for management of all risks. Now, however, Casio has changed its risk management implementation method. It is transitioning to a system whereby the Secretariat checks new and revised laws and regularly monitors the risks identified so far, and confirms whether there are any deficiencies in management cycle processes. Risk management system Business Continuity Plan (BCP) initiatives In order to respond to emergencies with the resources of the company organization, Casio has created a Crisis Management Manual for securing the safety of all employees, executives, and their families, preserving corporate assets. Sequential updates of the manual keep pace with changes in the business environment, and the company is taking practical initiatives at the same time. Specifically, the following measures have already been undertaken: Implementation of regular evacuation drills and general lifesaving classes for employees Distribution of emergency assistance kits to employees and additional disaster stockpiling Disaster prevention drill with the local community and provision of an open area for a temporary evacuation site However, in the Great East Japan Earthquake, which struck in March 2011, circumstances were encountered that far exceeded previous CASIOexpectations. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 Casio used the lessons learned to identify various points 32for improvement. These points were reflected in a largely-revised Crisis Management Manual based on the premise of responding to a major earthquake with Tokyo at its epicenter. Casio also produced the Disaster Handbook for the families of its employees to deepen understanding of disaster countermeasures in the home and promote Business Continuity Plan (BCP) initiatives In order to respond to emergencies with the resources of the company organization, Casio has created a Crisis Management Manual for securing the safety of all employees, executives, and their families, preserving corporate assets.

These points were reflected in a largely-revised Crisis Management Manual based on the premise of responding to a major earthquake with Tokyo at its epicenter. Casio also produced the Disaster Handbook for the families of its employees to deepen understanding of disaster countermeasures in the home and promote disaster readiness. Together with the initiatives above, Casio is working to enhance its business continuity plan (BCP). In the event of an emergency that interrupts business operations, such as a major earthquake with an epicenter in the Tokyo area, the plan outlines measures for the rapid confirmation of executive and employee whereabouts and well-being, as well as damage conditions, and the quick recovery and maintenance of operations. This mechanism is focused on Casio’s global supply chain. For example, if the headquarters suffers a disaster, an emergency headquarters is set up at the appropriate key site, based on a priority determined in advance. Under the direction of the headquarters, the aim is to minimize damage by continuing to provide products and services to customers worldwide based on limited resources. Through rapid restoration of business operation, the confidence of business partners and customers is maintained. Information system disaster response measures With the risk of power interruptions following the Great East Japan Earthquake that struck in March 2011, disaster response measures are more important than ever before. In addition to an internal data center, Casio utilizes a secure external data center that features seismic construction and self-contained power generation. As a measure to reduce disaster risk, Casio finished moving all its important servers, including those for mission-critical tasks, to external data centers and established an environment that can continue to operate even after a disaster. It also moved its e-mail system, an important means of communication, to an external provider. The company also performs disaster drills in conjunction with the group-wide business continuity plan. Information security Casio is aware of its important social responsibility to maintain the security of information that it collects from customers and other stakeholders in relation to its business activities. Casio has established Information Security Rules and implemented regular education for employees to continuously raise awareness of information security and ensure the implementation of safety measures.

Information security Casio is aware of its important social responsibility to maintain the security of information that it collects from customers and other stakeholders in relation to its business activities. Casio has established Information Security Rules and implemented regular education for employees to continuously raise awareness of information security and ensure the implementation of safety measures. As an important measure, Casio has established a system for prioritizing the protection of personal information, has publicly disclosed its Privacy Policy on its website, and is striving to handle personal information safely and appropriately. In December 2005, Casio Computer Co., Ltd., obtained Privacy Mark*1 certification and has maintained it since. In November 2007, Casio’s Information System Department obtained information security management system certification (ISO 27001).*2 The aim of applying for certification was to evaluate fulfillment of responsibility by the department, which takes care of information assets for the entire company. Since then, Casio has made continual improvements using the PDCA cycle. The fitness and effectiveness of Casio’s information security management system was again evaluated with a certification renewal audit in January 2014. *1 Privacy Mark: A program where the Japan Information Processing Development Corporation, a public-service foundation, evaluates the adequacy of corporate protective measures related to the handling of personal data. Companies that are found to have adequate protective measures in place are certified and permitted to display the Privacy Mark. *2 A program whereby a company establishes a system for using, maintaining, and protecting information within the applicable scope (e.g., business, locations) based on international standards for information security management systems, and a certification body conducts audits of the system and issues certifications. Whistleblower Hotline As a way to help ensure compliance, Casio set up a Whistleblower Hotline in April 2006. The hotline has been functioning with neutrality and fairness across all of its internal and external contact points. Operating on a basis of impartiality, the hotline follows up on all whistleblower reports and consultations, and takes resolute measures against any improper behavior discovered. Effort is put into preventing issues before they grow into real problems. In fiscal 2014, the hotline received six calls. The whistleblowers were interviewed, details were investigated, and corrective measures were taken. The issues were resolved with the whistleblowers’ understanding. The company will continue to watch for any latent problems and strive to improve its corporate culture. To ensure thorough hotline awareness, Casio will strive to further increase employee understanding in fiscal 2015, with an intranet site dedicated to information on whistleblower protection.

It involves regulations on the export of goods and technology that could be diverted for the development of weapons of mass destruction or other weaponry. The regulations are designed to prevent such goods and technology from reaching countries and regions of concern or terrorist organizations. In 1987, the Export Control Security Program of Casio Computer Co., Ltd. (a compliance program) was established in order to make sure proper measures are taken to ensure the security of exports. The program has since been continually updated along with changes in the Japanese Export Control Regulation. Casio has appointed employees responsible for export control in relevant departments as part of an internal system to ensure observance of the program. As the Exporter Compliance Standards took effect in April 2010, Casio has been striving to maintain and manage its system by conducting voluntary annual audits while ensuring through legal compliance, in response to the revision of applicable laws and regulations. Efforts include the strengthening of training activities at group companies in Japan. Casio has also established a management system for complying not only with Japanese export laws but also with US Export Administration Regulations. The company is working to improve global export management, including the implementation of export management training in fiscal 2013, at group companies in the UK and Germany, and in fiscal 2014 at a group company in the US. Initiatives for compliance with fair trade and advertising laws In order to promote proper transactions as well as fair, transparent and free competition, it is essential for sales employees to have a proper understanding of Japan’s Act on Prohibition of Private Monopolization and Maintenance of Fair Trade and Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations. The sales offices of Casio Computer Co., Ltd., in Japan are strengthening their measures to ensure compliance with these laws. Since 2011, Casio has distributed a Sales Compliance Card to all employees involved in sales in Japan as a tool to promote appropriate and fair competition and trade. These employees are required to carry the card. When the company revised the card in September 2013, it expanded the distribution to include employees engaged in sales outside Japan in an effort to ensure understanding and familiarity with fair competition and trade. In addition to the Charter of Creativity for Casio and excerpts from the Casio Group Code of Conduct, the card contains a compliance test, as well as contact information for a consultation service, and the number for the Whistleblower Hotline. Whenever a salesperson is in doubt over a course of action during daily sales activities, he or she can quickly perform a self-assessment or consult with a knowledgeable expert. A dedicated department regularly conducts internal inspections to make sure there are no actions being taken that could conflict with Japan’s Antitrust Act or the Designation of Unfair Trade Practices published by the Fair Trade Commission, as a way of monitoring compliance with competition laws. Casio also strives to provide appropriate product information by checking product catalogues and promotional materials based on relevant laws such as Japan’s Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations and company rules, and corrects any expressions that could be misleading to customers. The timepiece division in particular has a committee on product information composed of relevant persons from within the company. The committee leads efforts that help make the wording of product information more appropriate, using tools such as a specialized glossary. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 35 Additionally, the overseas sales department of Casio Computer Co., Ltd., has made it mandatory for all employees who transfer into the department to receive training on competition law overall and the prohibition on bribing foreign bureaucrats.

Casio Sales Compliance Card (revised version) Corruption Prevention Initiatives Based on ISO 26000, the international guidance standard for social responsibility, from 2012 to 2013 Casio took stock of the main CSR challenges facing each group company in and outside Japan, assessing and analyzing the status of their initiatives. The issue that rose to the surface as a challenge warranting priority attention alongside respect for human rights was fair business practices–in other words, corruption prevention initiatives. The Casio Group Code of Conduct prohibits bribery, and recently Casio specifically developed Guidance on the Prohibition of Bribery. This guidance articulates a basic philosophy for group companies, making it clear that bribery inhibits sustainable social development. Additionally, Casio headquarters encourages group companies outside Japan to produce local rules and manuals in an effort to strengthen systems for the prohibition of bribery throughout the group.

More More Stable Supply of Products Casio is working to strengthen its global supply chain to meet rising product demand. More CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 42 Casio aims to develop products that meet the latent needs of customers. To do this the company is constantly improving its ability to generate new ideas. Casio’s primary objective is to make products that work reliably in any environment, and can always be used with safety. From the initial engineering phase to the release of the final product, Casio takes great pains to ensure there are no compromises on manufacturing quality. Development（Product Planning / Design） Thinking like a customer Throwing off existing preconceptions, Casio generates new ideas by taking the perspective of those that will use its products. One example is the pomrie stamp maker, used to make original stamps. It is a new product based on an idea from female product designers. They carried out many surveys and studies on the surging Japanese hobby craft market to develop the product. As a communication tool that expresses feelings instead of words, the pomrie stamp maker has gained broad popularity with many women who enjoy crafts. pomeie Another product created out of the desire to take on new challenges with new ideas is the Logosease two-way radio, which enables underwater conversations. The product development began with the simple question, “Why shouldn’t we be able to talk underwater?” Using ultrasonic and bone conduction technologies, the Logosease serves as an underwater wireless communication device for recreational diving. Logosease Product development incorporates insights from the classroom Nearly every year since 2007, Casio has invited teachers from outside Japan who are passionate about mathematics education and research to a Global Teachers Meeting held at its Hamura R&D Center. The purpose of these meetings is to contribute to the development of mathematics education by incorporating the perspectives of teachers with real-world insights from the classroom into Casio products. The overarching goal is to provide products that are optimally suited to the diverse educational settings worldwide. In 2013, the participants had a lively discussion about features and specifications that would make Global Teachers Meeting 2013 calculators easier to use, make math easier to teach, and deepen students’ understanding. Much of the focus was on the standard scientific calculators made by Casio and used in many countries around the world. The teachers’ views helped to shape the development of the new features and specifications of the ClassWiz series of next-generation standard scientific calculators that was launched in China in July 2014. Already earning high ratings from customers, the ClassWiz series will be rolled out gradually to contribute to the development of mathematics education worldwide. ClassWiz series fx-991CN-X for China CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 43 Not just color, but also a variety of materials and textures Casio uses a product design technique called “CMF” for color, material, and finish. In order to create a rich product variety, it is vital not only to offer different colors, but also different material textures and surface finishes. This approach gives each single product model broad expressivity. For example, the shock-resistant G-SHOCK line of watches offers models that evoke the look and texture of metal used for many years in harsh environments. The exterior parts have a special finish. After goldcoloredion-plating, black ion-plating is applied on top, and then some of the black layer is removed. This gives a unique aged look and a vintage appeal to the watch. In addition, metal is used for the side buttons to symbolize toughness. Gold color is applied to these buttons, the crown, the solid lines that delineate the inset dials, the hands, and the three-dimensional numerals. All this maximizes the feel of quality. For watches, this technique is used not just for the hands and dial, but also for the watchband, giving products strong individuality. The diversity of the lineup allows people to express themselves more freely with their choice of watch. This is the kind of value that Casio aims to provide. Going beyond universal design to human-centered design Casio works to develop products using human-centered design (HCD) in conformity with ISO 13407 processes, with the objective of improving product ease of use as part of the product’s overall quality. In the HCD process, Casio seeks optimal ease of use by determining important issues from customer feedback and observation of product use in real-world situations. Through repeated evaluation and verification, Casio works to develop highly desirable products. The V-T500 series of tablet terminals was developed to provide support in a variety of business environments. They feature a user-replaceable, high-capacity rechargeable battery for long hours Business support Tablet terminal of operation, and a SAM slot to support a higher level of security. The tablets can also withstand V-T500 drops from one meter, are dust and splash-proof (IP54 compliant), and can operate in temperatures ranging from -20°C to 50°C. The V-T500 series offers outstanding grip-ability for comfortable operation even in the rain or other environments where objects become slippery. This performance is based on the testing and evaluation of multiple exterior designs, including a raised frame around the screen and hand-gripping grooves on the back of the device. Technology Technological expertise is needed to turn an innovative idea into a new product. Utilizing its five core technologies, Casio creates products that were not possible before. Durability Tough construction to withstand harsh environments Casio continues to focus on durability so that customers can enjoy its products for many years. As one technique for increasing shock resistance, Casio mounts a strong metal plate on the back of its display panels to increase strength and prevent warping. By also placing a shockabsorbing cushion between the display panel and its casing, any external shock is mitigated and destruction of the LCD is prevented. Tough Casio calculators also offer splash-resistant and dust-resistant performance, and are used in outdoor work such as civil engineering surveying. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 44 Digital technologies High-speed image processing delivers a wide range of expression instantly The “EXILIM Engine HS, Ver.3 ADVANCE” is a highspeed image processing engine that quickly and smoothly performs all the image processing right from digital camera startup. By simultaneously operating dual CPUs and two parallel image processors, this unique image processing engine offers high-speed operation. One feature enabled by this technology is the world’s first dual combination bracketing function.* With just one press of the shutter button, the camera shoots nine images while automatically varying a pair of parameters, such as focus and aperture, or white balance and brightness, in three stages. Setting the user free from complicated settings, this feature makes it possible to shoot stunning photos and realize new possibilities for expression not seen before. *For a bracketing function encompassing two kinds of parameters like white balance and brightness for a digital camera with a built-in lens. (As of November 14, 2013; based on a Casio survey.) Energy saving New concept for highly efficient solar cells With regular solar-powered analog watches, the solar cells are arranged linearly in six sections. This is because it is necessary to have multiple cells in a series to ensure the necessary voltage. The disadvantage of this design is that the cell providing the least power impacts the entire series. When the shadow from the watch hand falls on one cell, the upper limit of power generation for the entire series is lowered. Overcoming this, Casio developed a high-output solar cell with blocked-light distribution. By arranging the cells in a spiral and distributing the hand shadow over multiple cells, the decrease in power generation is minimized. This ensures efficient and stable power. This energy-saving technology enabled more freedom in watch designs and improved functions. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 45 Casio is actively promoting intellectual property activities in line with its management strategy through cooperation between its R&D and business divisions.

Policies for promotion of intellectual property activities Casio takes a mediumto long-term perspective in order to increase its technology management ability, and is systematically promoting research and development for the creation of future business. While recognizing R&D results as intellectual property, Casio is taking steps to ensure that they are properly managed and utilized in order to secure profits. Casio places importance on intellectual property as an important measure of corporate value. In order to effectively promote intellectual property activities, Casio has set the following goals for promoting intellectual property activity, and implements them group-wide for effective utilization of intellectual property. Intellectual property goals Casio is working to increase its intellectual property capacity using the following goals. ▪ Increase the intellectual property capacity of Casio ▪ Protect technology and products globally with strong intellectual property capacity ▪ Guarantee creative technology and product development through strong intellectual property capacity Role of the Intellectual Property Department Since its founding, Casio has worked to develop innovative new technologies and products that are completely original and have never existed before. The protection of these development results through the creation of intellectual property rights is vital to ensuring corporate competitiveness. At the same time, protecting Casio brands and designs from counterfeiting by securing intellectual property rights is also an important activity for the company. The Intellectual Property Department aims to secure intellectual property rights on a global level. Its role is to utilize patent, design, and trademark rights in order to help establish competitive advantage for corporate management. The center also broadly manages intellectual property (rights) such as copyrights and trade secrets as well as general intangible properties, while signing contracts with third parties and resolving disputes. Intellectual property activities Casio implements various intellectual property activities. Casio actively utilizes the intellectual property that it has accumulated over the years, and carries out activities to protect its businesses. The company conducts ongoing R&D necessary for sustained growth, and has put in place various systems for producing new intellectual property. 1. Patent application and rights acquisition activities Casio constructs patent nets based on patent application and registration in priority fields (selection and concentration), and actively promotes activities for the acquisition of effective patents based on quality improvement. The company carries out patent application and rights acquisition activities worldwide, including in the USA, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and other Asian countries. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 46 Global patent portfolio 2. Intellectual property rights utilization In addition to securing intellectual property rights for its inventions and other proprietary developments, Casio works to ensure freedom of operations by preventing legal claims from other companies and earns profits by licensing its technologies to other companies (including cross licensing). The company also uses intellectual property as a barrier to deter other companies from entering the same business, and carries out activities to establish competitive advantage for corporate management. In particular, Casio takes stringent measures to combat counterfeit products, and cooperates with government agencies to remove fakes from the marketplace. 3. Patent expert system Casio initiated a patent expert system in 1994 in order to promote the ongoing creation of outstanding intellectual property. With the aim of business strengthening through stronger intellectual property, engineers with high-level understanding of technologies and leadership skills have been assigned to each division as patent experts. While cooperating with the Intellectual Property Department from positions within their respective divisions, these patent experts work to strengthen the intellectual property abilities Meeting for patent experts of their respective organizations. Here are details of specific activities. 1. Patent activity planning based on ascertainment of technology and development trends at Casio and other companies, as well as target management 2.

The company is working to strengthen its global supply chain, and to continue providing cutting-edge products without interruption. Approach to stable product supply Delivering a stable supply of products to consumers is one of the most important responsibilities of a manufacturer, and is required to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty. As part of Casio's mission to provide delight, happiness, and pleasure to customers through its innovative products, the company is promoting the following policies. Policies on Stable Product Supply 1. We strive to shorten production lead-time and improve planning and execution accuracy by using IT to optimize the supply chain (procurement-production-logistics-sales-service). 2. We build good relationships with component suppliers to ensure stable procurement. 3. We maintain the flexibility needed to address various risks involved in manufacturing by: building a production system with at least two production sites for each product; producing multiple products and improving capacity for high-mix/low-volume production at each Casio Group production site maintaining in-house production and inlining of key devices and components. Supply network is highly responsive to changes in demand Casio uses supply chain management (SCM) at production sites in response to changes in market conditions and demand for high-mix/lowvolume product offerings, seeking to speed up the planning cycle and provide a stable supply of salable products. Specific initiatives include efforts to standardize work processes such as parts delivery controls, materials warehouse management, and manufacturing process management. Casio aims to achieve integrated manufacturing (total optimization) by using the same systems and same methods at different production sites. These initiatives are necessary to increase shipment precision, shorten production lead times, and shrink unused assets, and are already becoming mission-critical systems. The timepiece business in particular, which conducts production at multiple sites, in Yamagata (Japan), China, and Thailand, must respond rapidly to the changing environment in each region. Smooth operation of SCM enables the deployment of standardized IT tools and production equipment as well as the appropriate distribution of supply capacity. Casio will move to multisite production in other product categories in the future and build an even more sophisticated SCM system. Diversifying production risk and producing core components in-house Casio maintains a stable supply of products by having each production site manufacture multiple product items, and by ensuring that two different sites can produce any given Casio product. The company is also increasing the internal production of components in order to protect newly created technologies and to reduce parts procurement risk. Production sites for individual products CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 61 Casio will move to multisite production in other product categories in the future and build an even more sophisticated SCM system.

Securing right price and quality Casio endeavors to secure right price and quality in order to provide its customers with stable supply of optimal products, CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 63 which ensures that Casio gains the full confidence of customers around the world. 7. Prohibition of personal-interest relationships Casio does not allow any employees to have personal-interest relationships with any suppliers. Fulfilling social responsibilities together with suppliers In order to ensure compliance with the Procurement Policies together with its suppliers, Casio has established the Supplier Guidelines (available at link below). All of Casio's suppliers in Japan and elsewhere have agreed to these guidelines to help Casio fulfill its social responsibilities. Casio is also managing its supply chain more successfully by introducing a regular monitoring system that ensures that these guidelines are properly fulfilled. Supplier Guidelines Disseminating supplier guidelines Casio carries out the majority of its production outside Japan at Casio plants and manufacturing subcontractors (electronic manufacturing services). Every year, Casio holds briefings on its Procurement Policies in Southern China. Initially, these briefings simply involved Casio explaining its business policies to suppliers and asking them to undertake initiatives. Since fiscal 2010, however, Casio has been using these briefings as an opportunity for two-way communication. Suppliers are invited to participate actively, for instance by asking those with exemplary CSR initiatives to present examples of their efforts to promote and improve CSR. This enables the sharing of useful case studies and know-how for addressing CSR. By working collaboratively with its suppliers in this way, Casio is continually improving the level of CSR performance in its supply chain. In fiscal 2014, Casio explained its policy on conflict minerals and how it is addressing the issue. It asked suppliers to understand the significance and importance of avoiding conflict minerals as a human rights issue and requested their cooperation in the conflict mineral surveys the group would be conducting later in the year. In June 2009, Casio revised the Basic Business Agreement it signs with suppliers in Japan. Clauses were added to require measures such as legal compliance, respect for human rights, and environmental protection. The new agreement is being rolled out steadily.

The goal is to ensure that no problems occur.In fiscal 2011, group companies drew up their own action plans under the basic plan of the Subcontract Act Compliance Committee, establishing courses of action for maintaining proper subcontracting transactions using the PDCA cycle. In fiscal 2012, Casio encouraged the continuation of this process and the PDCA became firmly established. Casio will continue to promote understanding of the Subcontract Act among its employees, and work to strengthen its system for even better compliance.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 67 Casio discloses information promptly and fairly to shareholders and investors, and always strives to increase shareholder returns. Basic policy for shareholder returns Casio considers the maintenance and expansion of returns for all of its shareholders an important management issue, and constantly strives to improve its business performance and financial structure. The company's dividend policy calls for maintaining stable dividends, and Casio determines the allocation of profit by taking into account all factors such as profit levels, financial position, the dividend payout ratio, and future business development and forecasts. Considering this policy, Casio paid dividends of ¥ 25 per share in fiscal 2014. This was an increase of ¥ 5 over the previous fiscal year. Casio again plans to pay dividends of ¥ 25 per share in fiscal 2015. Inclusion in an SRI Index Morningstar Socially Responsible Investment Index (MS-SRI) Casio Computer Co., Ltd., is included in the Morningstar Socially Responsible Investment Index (MS-SRI). Morningstar Japan selects 150 companies from among all listed companies in Japan based on their social responsibility track records, and indexes their stock prices (January 2014). Communication with shareholders and investors IR events Every quarter, Casio holds a financial results briefing for institutional investors and securities analysts on the same day that the company announces its results. The president or the director responsible for investor relations is the main speaker at these briefings, and explains the financial results and forecasts. Casio also holds meetings with institutional investors and analysts worldwide, while occasionally providing factory tours and business briefings. Improving IR publications To provide IR information for shareholders and investors, the company issues an Annual Report, semiannual business reports (Japanese only), and quarterly Consolidated Financial Results. Casio's Investor Relations website also features these publications and other IR information. Casio also updates its Investor Relations site in a timely fashion to reflect market changes and make the information more accessible and useful. Investor Relations Reaching out to individual shareholders and investors Casio is carrying out various initiatives in order to deepen the understanding individual investors and shareholders have of its business. At its General Meeting of Shareholders, the company described its main products and key businesses. On the Japanese Investor Relations website, a section was added specifically for individual investors in an effort to make information disclosure clearer. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 68 At Casio, the human resources mission is organized around two themes: contributing to the development of the company through the growth of all employees based on their desire to always take on challenges and make improvements; and achieving both corporate development and employee growth under optimal conditions.

More CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 69 Casio established the Casio Group Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights on July 1, 2014. Casio strives to raise awareness of human rights while thoroughly implementing the policy throughout the group. Casio is also creating a framework for human rights due diligence. Policy on Respect for Human Rights Casio recognizes respect for human rights as an important CSR issue as it continues to expand its business globally. Accordingly, it is stepping up its efforts in this area based on international norms relating to human rights. Since December 2010, Casio has been a signatory to and participated in the UN Global Compact, which consists of 10 principles related to human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption advocated by the United Nations. Moreover, Casio long ago spelled out its commitment to the prohibition of discrimination, the prohibition of child and forced labor, and the prohibition of harassment in the Casio Group Code of Conduct and put that commitment into practice. In June 2013, as part of an overall reconsideration of the content of the code, Casio revised its Code of Conduct, explicitly stating a commitment to uphold and respect international norms relating to human rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to respect basic labor rights. Recognizing the importance of ensuring effectively functioning global governance related to respect for human rights going forward, Casio held dialogues with group employees outside Japan and experts*1 in the process of drafting the Casio Group Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights. This policy specifies, among other things, the group’s commitment to carrying out initiatives related to respect for human rights based on the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to continuously performing human rights due diligence*2 after the framework for that purpose is established. From here on, Casio will thoroughly communicate this policy throughout the group and carry out initiatives in accordance with it. Casio also recognizes the importance of spreading the idea of respect for human rights outside its organization together with its entire supply chain. All suppliers have been made aware of Casio’s Supplier Guidelines, which clearly mandate respect for human rights and prohibit discrimination. In addition to requesting compliance, Casio strives to verify implementation using questionnaires and other means. *1 See the feature story, “Casio’s Commitment to Human Rights” in the 2013 Sustainability Report for details. *2 Human rights due diligence refers to the continuous process for recognizing, avoiding and mitigating any negative impacts Casio has on society using preventative means. Casio Group Code of Conduct Casio Group Policy on Human Rights Responsibilities to Suppliers Creating and using a tool for checking the status of human rights Casio has been taking stock of human rights issues since 2012, using ISO 26000 as a guide. In order to strengthen its due diligence, Casio sought the advice of experts and, in February 2014, created its own tool for checking the status of human rights, taking the Danish Institute for Human Rights’ Human Rights Compliance Assessment Quick Check as a reference. Casio will use the new tool to make effective assessments and conduct education relating to human rights. Using the tool, Casio took stock of the status of initiatives addressing human rights issues at the group’s production companies in and outside Japan from February to April 2014. It did the same thing for the group’s sales companies in and outside Japan from April to June 2014. Going forward, it will analyze the issues at its head office and use the PDCA cycle to make improvements at each site based on the results in an effort to enhance human rights due diligence throughout the group. Education and awareness raising Casio provides internal education for Casio Computer Co., Ltd., and group companies in and outside Japan, in order to instill awareness of respect for human rights. In fiscal 2014, respect for human rights was taken up as one of the important items in CSR learning conducted in August. Experts were invited to a meeting of the CSR Committee held in December 2013 and asked for their opinions on Casio’s draft human rights policy and draft human rights check tool. In addition, education on human rights is conducted during training sessions at Casio Computer Co., Ltd., for new hires as well as before and after promotions or appointment as a manager. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 70 Preventing sexual harassment and power harassment Casio has stipulated in the Casio Group Code of Conduct that it will not engage in any acts that ignore individuality, and will not countenance sexual harassment and power harassment. The company has issued Guidelines to Prevent Sexual Harassment and established a hotline. A full-time hotline officer is available to respond to issues raised by telephone, fax, e-mail and postal mail, demonstrating Casio’s determination to prevent harassment and quickly address any issues which arise. Moreover, in its employment regulations, Casio has specified that persons who commit sexual harassment or power harassment will be subject to discipline. Awareness of preventing harassment is especially stressed in training sessions for managers. Establishment of employee hotline Casio has established a special hotline on the company’s intranet for employee concerns and inquiries on corporate culture, human relations, pay and working conditions. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 71 Casio is reinforcing its global expansion in all business fields, including existing and new businesses. In light of its continuing business expansion outside Japan, Casio has started creating a global human resources strategy. This project includes the enhancement of human resources functions at group companies outside Japan and the establishment of a system for developing human resources who are prepared to meet global standards. Vision of global talent Casio’s employees around the world must always think from the headquarters’ perspective in order to demonstrate leadership. The human resources department uses various opportunities and tools to convey and share with employees messages on the importance of thinking of Japan as just one area in the world and of changing one’s mindset to work with a global outlook. Example: Company intranet C’s ☆ CAFÉ “Vision of Global Talent” CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 72 Example: Message from the officer responsible for human resources in the company newsletter CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 73 Example: Message from the officer responsible for human resources in the company newsletter Establishment of standards for the roles of persons sent on assignment outside Japan It is important to increase the number of human resources with the aptitude for assignment outside Japan. At the same time, however, Casio is endeavoring to develop local employees and create more opportunities for their promotion. It does this by sending people on assignments outside Japan only to perform roles that cannot be done by local employees and by clarifying their division of roles with local employees. Casio will establish a table of standards and develop a check system to enable its employees around the world to shine by placing the right people in the right jobs. Example: Image of the use of the table of standards for the roles of persons sent on assignment outside Japan CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 74 Establishment of a structure for developing employees in Japan who can play an active role on the world stage Casio is committed to accelerating the globalization of employees in Japan in terms of recruitment, placement, and development. In 2013, Casio established the stage-based human resources development system described below. At present, Casio is enhancing the educational content at each stage and deepening coordination between stages in an effort to create systematic human resources development. Positioning of stage-based education Casio implements measures such as the following at each stage in order to achieve this kind of human resources development. Provision of local information to persons going on assignment outside Japan and development of multicultural management skills Casio systematically provides grade-based training to persons going on assignment outside Japan according to their mission at the location of assignment. In fiscal 2014, it added Training for Presidents outside Japan for top management, Site Management Skills Training for senior management, and Multicultural Management Skills Training and Assignment Location Situation for all persons going on assignment outside Japan. Additionally, in 2014 Casio stepped up safety measures, the provision of educational information for accompanying children, and other efforts to strengthen on-location living support. Training system before assignment outside Japan CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 75 In fiscal 2014, it added Training for Presidents outside Japan for top management, Site Management Skills Training for senior management, and Multicultural Management Skills Training and Assignment Location Situation for all persons going on assignment outside Japan. Additionally, in 2014 Casio stepped up safety measures, the provision of educational information for accompanying children, and other efforts to strengthen on-location living support. Training system before assignment outside Japan In the Multicultural Management Skills Training, members of completely different ages and assignment locations engaged in heated debate, revealing their enthusiasm for going on assignment outside Japan. The educational content was made more practical by engaging participants in discussions of issues that seem likely to actually occur and by learning the specific stories of the instructors’ experiences. Training for Presidents outside Japan provided education to candidates for positions as future presidents of companies outside Japan. The training was held twice in 2014 for six persons. Nearly all the participants were extremely satisfied with the training, which included systematic lectures covering not only management but also the roles of presidents outside Japan and the thinking of business managers as well as case studies based on real-life examples. Casio will continue to enhance the education it provides to persons who will be appointed as presidents to raise their awareness as business managers and convey the importance of management. Improvement of global business skills in candidates for assignments outside Japan (registered candidates) Casio is registering candidates for assignments outside Japan more systematically than ever before and will put into effect systematic education, including global aptitude checks and acquisition of necessary skills, with a view to sending candidates on assignments a few years later. Encouraging all employees working in Japan to adopt a global mindset Casio holds seminars to help employees working in Japan to become more comfortable communicating in English with non-Japanese people. The goal is for all employees, whether in Japan or outside Japan, to conduct business with global standards in mind. Global career path In order to continuously develop global human resources, it is not enough to use a direct approach from the human resources department to employees; people who can develop global human resources must be developed and promoted as managers so that employees can grow through their work in the field. Accordingly, Casio has developed its conventional career path into a global career path. So that employees in addition to those involved in sales outside Japan will have even a broader perspective, the company has enhanced personnel placement to give employees wide-ranging experience before they become section chiefs, department managers, and division managers. This approach will be used in future human resources development and placement planning.

Example: Company intranet C’s ☆ CAFÉ Global career path (sales) Strengthening human resources functions at group companies outside Japan The strengthening of human resources functions is becoming an increasingly important issue at group companies outside Japan, which are increasing in number and growing in size rapidly around the world with the continued expansion of Casio’s business outside Japan. In this environment, Casio is working at enhancing human resources functions throughout the group, ensuring that they reflect the shared Casio corporate creed, by sharing its global human resources philosophy and know-how. This effort includes restructuring human resources systems to make them suitable to each company, taking into consideration each country’s values, laws, and other characteristics. Global human resources governance system Casio actively engages in exchanges of opinions on what the Casio Group perspective should be about local problems and circumstances. The headquarters human resource division also directly dialogues with and provides advice on system design to members of human resources departments at local companies. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 77 Some progress has been attained through various activities led by the Working Group for Female Employee Advancement as the first step in promoting diversity. Casio has now launched a Diversity Project that, starting in fiscal 2014, is focusing on enabling all employees—including seniors, persons with disabilities, and non-Japanese employees, not just women—to perform at their full potential and reach even greater heights. Launch of the Diversity Project Casio has launched a Diversity Project in which employees participate. The goal of the project is to create conditions where all employees can work enthusiastically and enjoy job satisfaction, regardless of gender, nationality, age, or level of ability. Working groups on women, seniors, persons with disabilities, and non-Japanese employees are promoting positive actions. Supporting advancement of female employees Casio actively and continuously carries out a variety of measures with the aim of supporting all female employees so that they can fully demonstrate their abilities. Casio actively promotes ambitious and talented employees, and the number of women in senior staff positions increased from four in fiscal 2011 to 20 in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, efforts focused on the main theme of following up with employees who made use of shorter work hours for childcare, and with employees who adopted a working style that does not allow for overtime due to household chores. Specifically, Casio previously had no uniform guidelines relating to such matters as allotting duties to and evaluating the performance of employees who work shorter hours. The allocation of duties was left up to each workplace and cases of misunderstandings between superiors and subordinates regarding evaluations were occasionally seen. Accordingly, to avoid these problems and support the career formation of employees who work shorter hours, Casio put together guidelines on management considerations, such as the allocation of duties, the establishment of goals, and performance evaluations, with regard to those employees. While Casio has had a training system prior to reinstatement when employees return to work after taking childcare leave, there were cases in which interviews before reinstatement were not conducted, as they were an optional part of that system. When interviews were conducted, they tended to focus on confirming the work shift and the content of the returning employee’s job after reinstatement, but did not include discussions of future career and working style. That is why, with no opportunities for superiors and subordinates to talk about the subordinate’s future career, some employees who had returned to work after taking childcare leave experienced a decrease in motivation due to such things as excessive concern caused by insufficient communication. Given this background, Casio revised and established a new reinstatement interview system including interview items to foster communication about careers and working styles. Making interviews a requirement before and after reinstatement will facilitate the smooth return to work of employees who take childcare leave and encourage the formation of their future careers. Additionally, Casio also adopted a mentor program with the aim of easing anxiety and supporting career development by offering advice for balancing work and family life and for career advancement. The company has heard back from female employees that these initiatives have eased the anxiety that they had few role models and that it is difficult to sketch a career plan.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 78 Hiring and encouraging non-Japanese employees to play active roles Aiming to stimulate and internationalize the company, Casio is actively hiring foreign students studying in Japan who wish to work at Casio. During the selection process, Casio makes careful efforts to prevent disadvantages at the time of selection resulting from insufficient understanding of information due to differences in language, culture, and customs. (The company has hired foreign students studying in Japan every year since 2012.) In fiscal 2014, Casio established a Diversity Project working group including non-Japanese employees who are already playing active roles and sought to improve the company’s systems from their point of view. Casio is working hard to build an environment in which non-Japanese employees can feel secure about continuing to work for a long time after joining the company. At present, Casio’s non-Japanese employees are playing active roles while displaying their individuality in many kinds of workplaces. Improved menu signage in the cafeteria Even for non-Japanese employees who are proficient in Japanese, it can be difficult to understand the names of food ingredients and cooking methods. Accordingly, Casio now displays cafeteria menus in both Japanese and English. This has also enabled employees of group companies and suppliers outside Japan who are visiting Japan on business, as well, to use the cafeteria more freely. Additionally, for the benefit of people with dietary restrictions due to religious precepts, menu displays now also include illustrations making it clear what kind of meat is used in each dish. Pork mark English menu descriptions (bottom); chicken and fish marks (upper right) New system of leave for returning to one’s home country Casio grants special leave to non-Japanese employees in Japan so that they can participate from time to time in important events in their home countries and to create opportunities for them to see their family and relatives in their home countries once every several years. Until now it was possible for non-Japanese employee to use paid vacation to return home, but establishing a system has made it easier for them to take leave by clarifying the purpose. Establishment of a prayer room Casio has prepared a room with space for Muslim employees to put down a prayer rug and pray. Description of applications to update one’s status of residence in Japan Non-Japanese employees must apply to update their status of residence in Japan every five years. Employees had to collect all the necessary documents and make a request to the company, and sometimes the procedures were difficult to understand. Accordingly, Casio has put up a description of the procedures on its company intranet. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 79 Working together with persons with disabilities Casio hires people who display creativity and have the desire to work and take on challenges, regardless of any disabilities they may have. The company is creating workplace environments that allow every individual to display their full abilities and aptitudes. Upon request, it provides hands-on training in the workplace before hiring in an effort to dispel anxiety about actually working there and to eliminate gaps between expectations and reality. Casio has also adopted and uses a follow-up system for persons with disabilities throughout the group. This system is intended to constantly aim for the most suitable environment in light of the opinions of both the workplace and persons with disabilities by conducting periodic interviews after a person with disabilities joins the company so they are not left alone to face any anxieties or problems. The interviews help to quickly resolve any problems, check aptitude for work duties based on actual performance of those duties, and facilitate the provision of care if a disability has changed with the passage of time. This also helps to relieve the anxieties of the families and former schools of employees with disabilities. These kinds of initiatives have been commended by public institutions and featured in a DVD produced by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government introducing superior companies that it endorses. The system has led to the resolution of many problems, and employees with disabilities themselves have said it is comforting to have such a system in place. Casio also invites sign language interpreters to company events to help convey information to the hearing impaired and makes active use of job-related assistive tools from public institutions. A working group in the Diversity Project is advancing community development for persons with disabilities. It is carrying out initiatives aimed at making Casio an easier place to keep working by incorporating the opinions of persons with disabilities regarding issues such as environmental retrofitting focused on ensuring safety, measures to increase awareness in workplaces where persons with disabilities work, and measures to further establish their position in the workplace. The company aims to create an environment in which all Casio employees can work enthusiastically and enjoy job satisfaction, regardless of level of ability. In this way, Casio actively hires people who display creativity and have the desire to work and take on challenges, and gives them a stage on which to play an active role. Percent of workforce with disabilities As of April 1, 2012 As of April 1, 2013 As of April 1, 2014 Average for consolidated group companies in Japan 1.64% 1.84% 1.95% Encouraging the hiring of seniors / supporting the lives and employment of seniors Casio has a Senior Employee Program to provide retirement-age employees with employment opportunities, and to effectively utilize the skills and know-how that these individuals have accumulated over the course of their careers. It has now revised this program following amendment of the Act for Stabilization of Employment of Older Persons. Under the post-revision program, Casio offers continued employment with reasonable treatment according to past performance and the roles and responsibilities assumed after retirement age. The system creates workplaces where seniors can continue using their career skills and expertise within the Casio group. Each year, Casio holds Life Planning Seminars for employees who have just reached age 53 or age 58. The seminars cover topics such as the pension system, as well as living costs, taxes, and health after retirement. This provides participants with an awareness of these issues while they are still working, and helps them plan their post-retirement lives. Taught by an outside instructor, the seminars also provide financial information including details on the costs required to sustain full retirement. These learning opportunities have been well received by participants. In fiscal 2013, Casio launched the Second Career Working Group as part of its Diversity Project. Together with members of the working group, which includes senior employees, the company is incorporating opinions from the perspective of the persons concerned into discussions aimed at creating systems and an environment where employees can work with enthusiasm regardless of age. Prioritizing local hiring and promotion at subsidiaries outside Japan Along with the globalization of its operations, Casio is actively pursuing local hiring at its sites outside Japan. The aim is to promote management that is responsive to local conditions in each country, as a truly global company. This is being done not just in manufacturing, but also in various other fields.

Casio provides equal employment opportunities to anyone with the desire to work. Casio also endorses the Japan Business Federation’s charter of hiring ethics. The company strives to avoid early hiring of undergraduate university students to minimize any impact on their studies. It also conducts voluntary explanation meetings at universities around the country and holds hiring events at different times during the day and week, splitting up selection periods into four or five different times. In this way, Casio is striving to provide hiring opportunities to as many students as possible. Human resources data Number of employees in Japan (As of end of March 2014) Casio Computer Co., Ltd.

It has prepared a number of support programs and strives to foster a corporate culture that accepts diverse working styles. Recognizing its initiatives to date, in 2009 the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare granted Casio the Kurumin mark for helping to foster the next generation. This certification recognizes Casio as a company that actively supports employees’ efforts to balance work and family life. Kurumin mark for helping to foster the next generation Helping employees balance work and family life Casio has introduced programs that enable employees under restrictions caused by childbirth, parenting, and family nursing care to feel at ease and to demonstrate their full potential on the job. The company has developed programs that help employees balance work and family life, such as a shorter working hours system for childcare and nursing care and an hourly paid leave system.

The system is available to all employees and can be combined with half-day leave so that it is used effectively and flexibly. Employee Comments Left an hour early for lunch to renew a drivers license “Previously, one had to take a half day off in order to attend to a personal matter during the work day. Now, one can take time off on an hourly basis, which is a more efficient way to use holiday time.” Took hours off to take her two-year-old daughter for vaccinations and to meet with daycare staff It is handy to take time off by the hour, since I also want to save my holiday time in case my daughter gets sick.

Casio values close communication between labor and management. At the core of this labor-management communication is the Group Workers' Labor-Management Conference, which is held four times a year (February, May, September, and November). At these conferences, management and labor, together representing the entire group, exchange opinions about current conditions at the company. In addition, close communication is maintained at various other levels, including the Central Labor-Management Meeting, the Division Labor-Management Meeting, and the Sales Chapter Labor-Management Meeting. Casio operates on a union-shop basis; as a rule, all employees except for managers are members of the union. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 85 Casio works to maintain a healthy corporate culture where fairness and impartiality are valued in all promotion decisions. The company uses a merit-driven system combined with a performance-based approach to evaluate employees and determine compensation. Policy for fair evaluation and compensation Based firmly on a foundation of fairness, Casio aims to continuously improve its human resource system in light of changes in the social environment. Within that system, the present basic human resources policy combines a role-based system that grades individual employees based on the extent of their roles with a performance-based approach to evaluation and compensation based mainly on outcomes of job performance within their roles. Additionally, the company puts a premium on the following points of view: ▪ Respect of will: Grant significance to the individual's will and intentions ▪ Human resources development: Create opportunities for the acquisition of knowledge and skills needed in work ▪ Significance of abilities: Grant significance to abilities demonstrated through work ▪ Right person for the right job: Reflect individual wishes in job requests ▪ Priority distribution: Distribute limited management resources as efficiently as possible ▪ Stable employment: Strive to create workplaces where employees can work according to their abilities In addition to the above policy, Casio will place a premium on these points of view as it pushes ahead with innovative personnel measures. By taking this approach, Casio aims to strike the optimal balance between the growth and revitalization of society and the expansion and growth of the company. Casio’s design and application of an impartial personnel system ensures fair rating, evaluation, and compensation according to the level of duties, regardless of academic background, years of service, or gender. Casio feels that goal management is important in its evaluation system and so it has supervisors and their subordinates share goal information via the intranet. The company will further develop this in the future and plans to consider horizontal disclosure in order to share goals among colleagues and measure synergistic effects. The company evaluates each employee at an interview twice a year. Casio uses evaluation sheets based on goal management to notify employees about the results of evaluations, a mechanism designed to improve transparency and ensure that evaluation of employees is highly credible. Human resources system overview Education for fair evaluation and compensation Casio requires managers to take evaluator training in an effort to improve their evaluation, leadership, and interviewing skills, in order to operate its human resources system fairly and appropriately. Additionally, all managers are evaluated by their colleagues and subordinates about once every three years. The results are fed back to managers during training sessions to encourage continual improvement. An overview of the evaluation and compensation system is posted on the company intranet to keep all employees thoroughly informed about this system.

Overview of human resource development Casio has various human resource development programs designed to develop creative employees who are eager to take on challenges and to train professionals with early tracking into specialized fields. Casio aims to develop professionals in the form of strategic generalists who pass on the company's corporate culture, and technical specialists who pass on the company's unique technology and know-how. For this purpose, based on the convictions that people grow through their work and that the source of growth is personal motivation, Casio helps employees improve their skills by providing environments that enable them to overcome challenges through personal determination and effort. Accordingly, the company emphasizes on-the-job (OJT) training to improve practical skills, complemented by off-the-job (off-JT) training to provide theoretical knowledge. In recent years, the training system has been improved to ensure even more effective, efficient skill development via a broader choice of training courses. Training System Casio conducts the necessary training for all the job grades in its in-house ranking system, and the company is working constantly to upgrade and enhance its human resource development system. As part of this system, Casio offers measures to train existing workers to make them professionals and training for specific job grades to all eligible employees.

Casio also makes its intranet and database available to the managers of each department to allow them to conduct comprehensive assessment of the human resource development information on their subordinates, which they then utilize for training within the department. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 90 Each and every employee must be able to work safely and in good health in order to perform at his or her full potential. Based on various laws and work regulations such as Japan’s Industrial Safety and Health Act, Casio makes group-wide efforts to create workplace environments where all employees can work with peace of mind, in order to maintain and enhance the health of employees and prevent occupational injuries or their reoccurrence.Group companies outside Japan comply with their local laws and regulations and also implement similar measures. Occupational health and safety activities Casio has established Occupational Safety and Health Committees in all of its business locations. The committees independently design and implement policies tailored to each workplace, doing all they can to keep employees physically and mentally healthy and to ensure occupational safety. Committee activities are reported to employees via the intranet. Casio also runs campaigns to raise employee awareness about occupational safety and health. Initiatives for managing and promoting employee health Casio goes beyond employee health management. It also seeks, by taking active measures to promote better health, to improve employee motivation and raise productivity. It also supports the advancement of health by providing various types of health guidance and raising health awareness, working in cooperation with the Casio Health Insurance Association. Regular health checks Regular health checks for employees at Casio are more thorough than legally mandated: they include many additional items intended to help employees maintain their health and to prevent lifestyle-related Healthy menu diseases. Nearly 100% of employees come for the health checks every year. The company has also standardized rules on follow-up in order to help individuals whose health check revealed some concerns to take better care of themselves. Initiatives to counter lifestyle-related diseases In the effort to prevent lifestyle-related illnesses, Casio, together with the Casio Health Insurance Association, is promoting initiatives that focus on exercise and healthy eating. From September to November and from March to May every year, Casio holds a Walking Campaign at sites across Japan to encourage the habit of getting moderate exercise. In fiscal 2014, 2,657 people participated in the campaign. Participants can check their progress and ranking on a special website. The employee cafeterias provide healthy menu choices featuring a balance of calories and nutrition. Wellness Fairs are also held at all Casio cafeterias. Initiative to prevent working long hours Casio is carrying out an initiative to prevent the damaging health effects to the brain or heart which can be caused by accumulated fatigue due to long working hours. In order to ensure proper work schedules, all employees that work 80 hours or more of overtime in a month must be interviewed by an industrial physician. The physician then checks the employee's health condition, and provides the person with advice and guidance. In this way, Casio is working to prevent health problems from overwork, and to ensure employees observe appropriate working hours. Mental health care initiatives Casio has established a mental health education system to support the mental health of its employees. As part of this system, Casio Computer Co., Ltd., has initiated an e-Learning Program, a Self-Checkup, and a Stress Test by Organization for all its employees.

Example commendations Example commendations CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 93 Striving to be a model corporate citizen, Casio makes the most of its unique know-how and management resources to fulfill its various social responsibilities. Philosophy on social contribution Casio’s social contribution initiatives aim to help build a healthy, spiritually rich society. The five priority areas are education of the next generation, study and research, environmental conservation, community service, and culture and arts. Casio takes a proactive approach to these initiatives, seeking to communicate with various stakeholders in order to determine how it can be most helpful as a good corporate citizen. In this process, Casio seeks to make innovative social contributions, leveraging its unique expertise and management resources as well as the broad range of knowledge and experience possessed by its employees. Raising up the next generation Classes in the company, and school visits Casio offers a diverse array of products used in schools and other educational settings, such as calculators, electronic dictionaries, musical instruments, and projectors. Seeking to make educational contributions to the next generation, Casio strives to understand the challenges faced in various educational settings in different countries and regions. It then works to provide suitable products that can help to resolve challenges in the classroom. Thus, this Casio business seeks to improve the very way education is approached. Beyond its main business, Casio is also actively engaged in other efforts befitting a good corporate citizen to contribute to the education of the next generation. Since 2007, Casio Computer Co., Ltd., has been offering original educational programs, primarily for elementary and junior high school students. These include school visits and classes offered at company facilities. In these programs, Casio aims to make a broader and more profound contribution to education. The school visit program is roughly divided into a three sections, on “connectedness, creativity and emotional growth,” “connection with life,” and “today’s world.” The first section seeks to make children aware of the value of life by facilitating dialogue among them. The second section of the program, on connection with life, seeks to give children opportunities to feel a connection with life and experience living through the senses, by using equipment to listen to the beating of the heart. The final segment, on today’s world, provides a forum for children to share and discuss their ideas about the global environment that supports human life and on the various problems children face around the world. This helps to encourage awareness and action on such issues as life, peace, poverty, and the environment. Since 2007, the school visit program has been conducted for over 29,000 children at a total of 340 schools. The classes offered at the Hachioji R&D Center, one of the Casio Group’s most advanced eco-friendly business sites, focus mostly on environmental initiatives. The program includes activities such as a tour of the thermal storage tank and rooftop garden as well as hands-on experience with taking apart and then reassembling environmentally friendly products. At other facilities, engineers lead classes in which they convey to children the fun of making things and the value of craftsmanship.

Casio made a donation to the One Foundation for 500,000 yuan (about ¥800 million), which was used to assist victims and reconstruction in the disaster area. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 101 In April 2012, Casio established the Casio Environmental Vision 2050, a long-term environmental management policy with a target year of 2050. At the same time, the company also issued the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020, which is its medium-term action guideline. Casio’s determination to become a leading environmental company is demonstrated by its commitment to visionary global initiatives to help build a more sustainable world. Environmental Executive Message Casio’s goal is to help build a more sustainable world while contributing to the creation of new markets and cultural phenomenon by developing compact, lightweight, slim, and energy-efficient products. The Casio Environmental Vision 2050 articulates our objectives for environmental management as we look toward the year 2050. Serving as a milestone on the road to 2050, the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020 sets out our action guidelines with a target year of 2020. Both the Vision and the Declaration share three priorities: (1) realizing a low-carbon society, (2) building a recycling society, and (3) living in harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity. By working toward these goals, we will ensure legal and regulatory compliance for Casio, improve the strength of the Casio brand and highlight the advantages of our products—all of which help us to meet the expectations of our various stakeholders, including customers and suppliers. Akira Kashio Senior Executive Managing Officer Realizing a low-carbon society In April 2014, the current Japanese government administration approved a resolution on a new Basic Energy Plan. In preparation for the COP21 conference to be held in Paris, France at the end of 2015, the plan includes consideration of new goals for climate change policies beyond the year 2020 as well as international frameworks for achieving those goals. As one of the leading efforts in Japan in this area, Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) issued its Commitment to a Low Carbon Society in April 2013. Casio has announced that it will participate in the Commitment. We are working hard in the area of energy conservation, seeking to reduce average annual per-unit energy consumption by 1% by 2020. This fiscal year, to ascertain the greenhouse gas emissions produced by our entire supply chain, we are expanding the range of our Scope 3 assessments to include 12 categories and disclosing the results of those assessments. Allowing us to clearly picture the CO2 emissions at each level of our business activities—Scope 1, 2, and 3—we believe this effort will help Casio to further reduce emissions. We are also continuing to study options for introducing renewable energies, such as the installation of solar panels at various group facilities. Building a recycling society As we work to make compact, lightweight, slim, and energy-efficient products, we are designating products that fulfill our own higher eco product standards as Casio Green Star Products. Our goal is to see these products account for 50% of total fiscal 2015 sales. Thus far, Casio has recycled personal computers and rechargeable batteries in compliance with Japan’s Act on the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources while also making voluntary efforts to collect page printer toner and drum sets and NAME LAND cartridges. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 102 results of those assessments. Allowing us to clearly picture the CO2 emissions at each level of our business activities—Scope 1, 2, and 3—we believe this effort will help Casio to further reduce emissions.

Thus far, Casio has recycled personal computers and rechargeable batteries in compliance with Japan’s Act on the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources while also making voluntary efforts to collect page printer toner and drum sets and NAME LAND cartridges. However, in fiscal 2014, in response to the passage of the Small Electronic Appliance Recycling Act, we established the required product specifications for improving recyclability. Since then, we have applying these specifications in the product development and design processes and continuously implementing improvements. Living in harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity In March 2011, Casio issued the Casio Group Biodiversity Guidelines. As part of the guidelines, we established a target for implementing impact assessments, aiming to preserve biodiversity related to our operations and the locations of our offices and plants. Based on this, Casio has been implementing a pilot environmental impact study on “paper” since fiscal 2013. This fiscal year, we are expanding the scope of this study and looking at whether the user manuals and pamphlets that accompany Casio products, as well as the various paper products used in our offices, pose any problem with regard to biodiversity preservation. We also take biodiversity into consideration when formulating paper procurement policies. Conclusion Casio is developing its business globally. We are determined to implement our own environmental management policies as we continue to create products that are compact, lightweight, slim, and energy efficient, as well as products which help to realize a paperless society. We believe that these activities will further improve the strength of the Casio brand, presenting Casio as a leading environmental company. New Environmental Management Initiatives and Policies Starting in fiscal 2014, Casio has been implementing environmental management with three main priorities, including CASIO the new goal of SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 103 Conclusion Casio is developing its business globally. We are determined to implement our own environmental management policies as we continue to create products that are compact, lightweight, slim, and energy efficient, as well as products which help to realize a paperless society. We believe that these activities will further improve the strength of the Casio brand, presenting Casio as a leading environmental company. New Environmental Management Initiatives and Policies Starting in fiscal 2014, Casio has been implementing environmental management with three main priorities, including the new goal of “building a recycling society,” with an initial target year of fiscal 2016, based on the Casio Environmental Vision 2050 and the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020. Under the priority of realizing a low-carbon society, in fiscal 2014 Casio registered targets with Keidanren’s Commitment to a Low Carbon Society and with the electrical and electronics industries, expanded the scope of its Scope 3 assessments, and assessed its total carbon footprint. In fiscal 2015, in addition to steadily promoting its measures under the Commitment to a Low Carbon Society, Casio is working to improve the precision of its Scope 3 emissions assessments. In fiscal 2016, it is planning to establish policies for achieving the goal of zero environmental impact. In the area of “building a recycling society,” Casio has been implementing programs to comply with Japan’s new Small Electronic Appliance Recycling Act since fiscal 2014, while also seeking to expand its portfolio of paperless products beyond electronic dictionaries and projectors. In fiscal 2015, Casio is introducing an offset index for contributions to reductions from products, and in fiscal 2016 it will take action to address its water footprint and seek to establish new environmental businesses. In relation to living in harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity, in fiscal 2014 Casio implemented a pilot study of its impact on biodiversity of the papers it uses in its business activities pursuant to the Casio Group Biodiversity Guidelines. In fiscal 2015, Casio is formulating paper procurement policies for its businesses in Japan. In fiscal 2016, building on those efforts, Casio will study policies for reducing impacts on biodiversity and will begin by implementing measures deemed to be of the greatest importance.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 110 In order to minimize the various risks mentioned above, and expand opportunities, Casio must contribute to the sustainability of the planet and its human societies. Casio recognizes that this is an extremely important issue for further strengthening its business foundation, and will make even more strenuous efforts in the fight against climate change. Measures for achieving mediumand long-term targets Casio has set medium and long-term targets for achievement by 2020 and 2050. Among the three areas that the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020 focuses on, Casio will put the highest priority on realizing a low-carbon society. Realizing a low-carbon society The Casio Group will provide products and services that make an even greater contribution to the reduction and absorption of CO2 emissions. In addition to expanding products and services that use energy sources that are friendly to people and the planet, including solar, wind, and hydro power, Casio will incorporate these renewable energy sources into its own business operations. Casio Europe has been operating geothermal cooling and heating in its office building since January 2009. In fiscal 2013, Casio will also begin investigating initiatives for the use of renewable energy including solar. Regarding other indirect CO2 emissions (GHG Protocol Scope 3 emissions), Casio will work to expand the scope of disclosure of other indirect CO2 emissions generated during distribution and product usage, which it already discloses, based on the calculation guidelines being considered currently by the electrical and electronics industry associations. Measures for 2020 Casio is studying the potential of the following initiatives to achieve the medium-term target for 2020. It will also strive to assess as quickly as possible their potential to help meet the 2050 target. 1. Response to social environment changes after the Great East Japan Earthquake ・Responding to energy issues ・Introducing renewable energy sources 2. Environmental contribution through product usage ・Reducing the amount of electricity used by products ・Minimizing and optimizing the amount of product packaging ・Increasing the percentage of products that run on solar cells 3. Utilizing carbon offsets ・CO2 absorption effect based on the expansion of paperless products (reducing demand for logging, etc.) ・Purchasing carbon offsets for products ・Promoting tree planting and greening ・Emissions trading, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI) 4. Reduction of CO2 emissions in various business activity processes ・Materials procurement, product manufacturing, transport and distribution, product usage, recycling, and disposal ・Expansion of the scope of CO2 emission data gathering on logistics, transport efficiency improvement, and modal shift ・Making production facilities more energy efficient, and improving production processes 5. Increasing the percentage of non fossil-fuels used at sites ・Installation of LED lighting ・Installation of solar panels ・Installation of highly efficient air conditioning equipment New Energy Conservation Targets for Fiscal 2014 (Power, Fuel, etc.) Starting in fiscal 2014, Casio established the new energy conservation targets described below with a target year of fiscal 2016 in an update of its energy conservation targets up to fiscal 2013. By fiscal 2016, the Casio group overall will reduce energy usage (crude oil equivalent kL) by 13% per unit of total floor space compared with fiscal 2011. In setting the new target, Casio changed from establishing targets for production sites in Japan, offices in Japan, production sites outside Japan and offices outside Japan, respectively, as it did in the past, to establishing an overall Group target. Moreover, while the target for production sites was previously expressed per production, Casio has employed per unit of total floor space for the new target, which is as close as possible to an absolute target. Casio has established energy conservation targets as a crude oil equivalency (kL) for fuel and power usage, and this has made it possible to evaluate actual energy conservation programs without relying on the CO2 emission coefficient for purchased power. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 111 Fiscal 2014 Performance Casio has established energy conservation targets as a crude oil equivalency (kL) for fuel and power usage, and this has made it possible to evaluate actual energy conservation programs without relying on the CO2 emission coefficient for purchased power. Fiscal 2014 Performance CO2 emissions for the Casio group overall in fiscal 2014 were down 18% compared to fiscal 2013, for a total 71% reduction since fiscal 2006. Due to the closure of the production subsidiary Hong Kong Casio (Panyu Plant) and energy conservation activities that included power economizing efforts by the entire Casio Group, the total amount of energy used by the entire Casio Group was down about 13% from fiscal 2013, on a crude oil equivalent basis. For more information, see “Reducing CO2 emissions”, “Fiscal 2014 Casio Environmental Action Plan Performance”. （PDF / 48KB） CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 112 This page introduces Casio's initiatives for preserving biodiversity. Casio's approach to biodiversity preservation The 10th Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP10) was held in Nagoya, Japan in October 2010. At this important international conference for resolving issues related to preserving the abundance of life on this planet, the following measures were adopted. ▪ New Strategic Biodiversity Plan (2020), and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (2050) ▪ Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing While benefit from biodiversity, corporate activities also have a significant impact on it. By fully understanding this relationship, Casio aims to avoid the risks associated with failing to make efforts in the area of biodiversity and, instead, to identify the opportunities that these efforts present. Example Problems in the upstream supply chain identified from the perspective of biodiversity preservation could make it impossible risk: to use certain resources, materials, and parts, and Casio could lose customers because it is perceived as having a negative impact on the environment. Specifics: Use of carelessly sourced paper contributes to global forest decline. Due to the toxicity of the mercury used in projector light sources, its use is legally restricted. Example Casio takes the lead ahead of other companies in implementing policies that allow it to more safely and reliably procure opportunity: resources, materials, and parts, as well as substitutes for the same, and is therefore able to highlight the environmental friendliness of Casio products when appealing to customers. Specifics: Efforts that address environmental impact, such as the formulation of a paper procurement policy, are well received by the general public. Through original development of a light source that does not use mercury, Casio is able to supply projectors that are legally compliant. By supporting NGOs and NPOs with Casio products, for instance by issuing collaborative wristwatches that support dolphin and whale conservation, Casio is able to strengthen its product brands. In March 2011, Casio established Biodiversity Guidelines for the entire Casio Group, taking the first step on this issue in its Environmental Action Plan. Casio is now carrying out activities based on this. In FY2012, Casio began investigating a checklist for environmental impact evaluation, with the goal of assessing biodiversity impact. The company also carried out e-learning for about 700 employees in relevant departments concerning basic biodiversity preservation knowledge and Casio measures, in order to create a foundation for future impact assessment. In fiscal 2013, Casio prepared a biodiversity impact survey sheet covering “paper” relating to products and sites in cooperation with external NPOs and NGOs active in environmental protection and commenced a pilot study of suppliers. Specifically, regarding instruction manuals, pamphlets and other materials in the area of products, and paper for copiers, drafting and other uses in the area of sites, Casio conducted a study into the usage of waste paper and paper from certified forests evaluated by third-party organizations and not products from manufacturers about which there are concerns over the legality of logging and environmental destruction and other areas. In fiscal 2014, Casio conducted pilot studies of paper use associated with both its products and offices in Japan, and found no major problems in either area. In fiscal 2015, Casio is focusing on surveying its businesses in Japan, and it plans to formulate a paper procurement plan in Japan within the fiscal year. Even beyond fiscal 2015, Casio will continue conducting activities aimed at achieving the target below, which were established in fiscal 2013.

Participation in the Consortium for Sustainable Paper Use Companies and NGO Collaborating to Achieve Sustainable Paper Use by 2020 In June 2014, Casio joined the Consortium for Sustainable Paper Use, which was established to promote the use of paper in a way that is both environmentally and socially responsible throughout society. Casio has been working hard as a dedicated member of the Consortium. The Consortium was established in November 2013 by five companies that are making progressive efforts related to their use of paper, the WWF Japan, and Response Ability, Inc, which promotes corporate sustainability. By enabling each member to promote uses of paper that are environmentally and socially responsible from their various perspectives, the Consortium hopes to expand the sustainable use of paper throughout the broader society.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 116 Casio's Green Star Products offer even greater environmental performance than Casio's conventional products. Green Star Product concept In order to minimize the environmental impact of its products, Casio is promoting the development of environmentally friendly products in every aspect of planning and design. In 1993, Casio began product assessment in order to systematize and promote its development of eco products. New products had to undergo a preliminary assessment for their environmental impact and meet certain criteria in order to be certified as Casio Green Products. Prior to FY2008, Casio worked towards an initial Green Product sales target of 80% of total sales, and in that year the company achieved 84%. Now the company promotes to continue target of 80%. With the achievement of this target, Casio decided to create even stricter criteria and implement more specific, detailed assessments. Qualifying products are certified as Green Star Products, representing the best of Casio Green Products. This ensures that Casio's products continue to set the bar higher and drive the realization of a sustainable society. For Green Star certified products, the environmental features are listed in catalogues and on the product packages.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 125 In order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, Casio’s main sites have acquired ISO14001 certification and operate an environmental management system. Under the environmental management system, Casio plans and executes environmental protection activities based on a range of environmental legislation and the Casio Group Environmental Action Plan as well as various voluntary action plans established by Keidanren and the industry association. Moreover, Casio applies and operates its own unique environmental management system to relatively small office sites, which takes into account the extent of their environmental impact. CO2 Medium-and long-term greenhouse gas reductions Casio has established medium-term (2020) and long-term (2050) objectives on reducing its total greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts are being made to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions from business activities by 30% by fiscal 2021 and 80% by fiscal 2051 (compared to fiscal 2006). Results for fiscal 2014 indicate that emissions were already about 71% lower than the base year, indicating that Casio has already met its medium-term goal and is even approaching its long-term goal of an 80% reduction. On the other hand, since the transfer of its device business, which took place after the base year of fiscal 2006, had a large effect on reductions achieved so far, making it all the way to the long-term goal will still be a challenge. Casio is earnest in its commitment to reach the long-term in order to help build a low-carbon society, and the company is looking at ways to quickly adopt measures, such as the adoption of renewable energies, included in the fiscal 2015 environmental management policy. Greenhouse gas emissions Energy Conservation Casio revised its Environmental Action Plan in fiscal 2014 and established an energy conservation goal that covers all of its sites. This goal is to reduce energy usage (crude oil equivalent kL) by 13 % per unit of total floor space compared to FY2011, by FY2016. This report is being issued in the first year of that period, but while energy use was 0.0457 kL/m2 in the base year of fiscal 2011, it was 0.0397 kL/m2 in fiscal 2014. This reflects a decrease of about 13%, thus revealing that the established goal has already been achieved. This is attributed to the closure of a production site outside Japan, the Panyu Factory of Casio Computer (Hong Kong). Casio is aware that it is already approaching the overall reduction goals that were just set last fiscal year, but it will continue to implement further reduction efforts. Casio is continuing to strive to conserve energy at its production facilities and to improve production processes at all production sites in Japan and abroad. At offices in and outside Japan, Casio is promoting energy conservation efforts in its lighting, heating, and cooling equipment, and is striving to reduce CO2 emissions.

Energy Conservation Reducing CO2 Emissions in Logistics [Logistics in Japan] The target for CO2 emissions from logistics activities in Japan is a 20% reduction per unit of domestic sales in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2014, emissions were 35.6% lower than in fiscal 2011, already achieving the target. Nevertheless, Casio will keep working to further reduce CO2 emissions. In August 2011, the logistics center was relocated from Suzuka City, Mie Prefecture to Toda City, Saitama Prefecture. In January 2012, the Eastern Distribution Center in Koto-ku, Tokyo was amalgamated with the logistics center. Through this staged effort, Casio reduced the number of consumer distribution centers in Japan from five to four. This transition not only shortened transportation distances, but also facilitated a modal shift from truck to rail, helping to further reduce CO2 emissions. In fiscal 2013, Casio began an initiative to send products manufactured overseas directly to the Western Distribution Center in Osaka. This allows transport distances to be shortened significantly by cutting out transit through the Toda Logistics Center. [Logistics outside Japan] No specific CO2 emissions reduction target has been set for logistics activities outside Japan. Cargo shipped from China to North America used to be sent to a sales company warehouse in Chicago, before being forwarded to client logistics centers. Since 2009 however, the cargo has been shipped from China direct to the various central logistics centers of clients, which is helping to reduce CO2 emissions. Going forward, Casio will continue striving to improve energy efficiency and production processes at all of its production sites in and outside Japan. Moreover, Casio will promote energy efficiency, including for lighting and heating and cooling equipment, as it works to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions at its office sites in and outside Japan.

Waste Reducing waste Casio revised its Environmental Action Plan in fiscal 2014, and transitioned to absolute volume goals that are not dependent on production volumes. [All sites in Japan] The target is to reduce waste from sites in Japan by 4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2014, a reduction of about 7% had already been achieved versus fiscal 2012. By weight, this converts to a reduction of about 107 tons. However, for fiscal 2014, Casio recorded a total increase in waste of about 194 tons. This was due to the addition of about 121 tons caused by changes in the waste calculation methods used at seven sales sites in Japan (a change was made in the coefficient used when converting from volume to weight, and all types of waste are now calculated using the larger conversion coefficient when specific types of waste cannot be confirmed. Another cause was the addition of about 73 tons of waste from fiscal 2014 from Yamagata Casio (the Yamanashi Office) which had not been added to the actual figures for the base year. Even after making these additions, the total volume of waste compared to the base year was still down by about 107 tons, revealing that Casio's various sites are making good progress. Casio will continue to work to reduce waste. As a result of treating type-unknown waste as landfill, Casio's final landfill waste volume increased about 134 tons compared to fiscal 2013. [Production sites outside Japan] The target is to reduce waste at production sites outside Japan by 48% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2014, Casio achieved a reduction of about 73% compared to fiscal 2011, thereby hitting its target. This major decrease can be attributed to the closure of the Panyu Factory of Casio Computer (Hong Kong). Casio will continue to work to achieve further reductions.

Generation of waste and volume of final landfill disposal (all sites in Japan) Generation of waste and volume of final landfill disposal (production sites outside Japan) Water resources Reducing input of water resources Casio revised the parts of its Environmental Action Plan related to water resources in fiscal 2014, and transitioned to absolute volume goals that are not dependent on production volumes. [Production sites in Japan] Casio's goal is to reduce water usage at production sites in Japan by 5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2014, Casio achieved a reduction of about 31% compared to fiscal 2011, thereby hitting its target. This significant decrease is attributed to personnel reductions at Yamagata Casio and the closure of the Murayama Factory. Casio will continue to pursue further reductions.

For emissions in sites outside Japan, the “emissions factor adjusted for the CO2 emissions from CHP (combined heat and power) generated electricity” was used. It is taken from the latest year value (2003 estimate) in the Japan Electrical Manufacturers’ Association (JEMA) estimate survey (June 2006). 2. Air pollutants Calculated at sites that have smoke generating facilities based on the concentration measurements and gas emissions at each facility. 3. Wastewater Calculated from values at sites that measure wastewater amounts. Sites that do not measure wastewater amounts but can ascertain tap water use treat the amount of tap water used as their wastewater amount. 4. PRTR Release and transfer quantities are calculated for each chemical substance subject to Japan's PRTR Act whose annual usage is 0.05 tons or more. 5. Waste Waste is tabulated as the total amount of industrial waste generated when product is transferred from a Casio site to the processor, general waste derived from sites, and the quantity of valuables. Because sales sites are small in size and mixed waste is handled by a contractor, it is difficult to get accurate figures for recycling quantities and landfill waste quantities. Thus, all waste from these sites is conservatively treated as landfill waste for calculation purposes. 6. Base year figures To evaluate mediumand long-term goals, Casio sets base year values by combining actual figures for all sites in existence in the established base year. Figures are not revised in conjunction with business transfer. For reference, the results obtained after adjusting base year figures in accordance with the GHG Protocol are shown in blue text in the Casio Environmental Action Plan Performance Report. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 135 Building a low-carbon society is one of the mediumto long-term goals of the Casio Environmental Vision 2050 and the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020. This will require not only efforts from within the Casio Group, but also a commitment to reducing CO2 emissions both upstream and downstream in the supply chain. For this reason, Casio has calculated emissions for each category in an effort to help everyone involved visualize CO2. CO2 emissions for the entire Casio Group supply chain in fiscal 2014 were 550,747 t-CO2. • Scope 1 direct emissions (e.g., fossil fuels, natural gas) were calculated at 5,210 t-CO2. • Scope 2 indirect emissions (e.g., electricity) were calculated at 33,169 t-CO2. • Scope 3 other emissions (e.g., use of sold products and end-of-life treatment of sold products, transportation and distribution, employee commuting, lease assets, and investments ) were calculated for 12 of 15 categories (with the three lowest-impact categories excluded). When CO2 emissions were calculated pursuant to the GHG Protocol that serves as the international standard, emissions for fiscal 2014 stood at 512,368 t-CO2. As a result, Scope 3 accounted for more than 90% of entire supply chain emissions. Within Scope 3, purchased goods and services accounted for the greatest share, about 56%. On the other hand, low emissions for use of sold products are attributed largely to the energy-efficient designs for which Casio products are known. In the future, the following issues will be addressed: • Improve calculation accuracy in each category • Propose and implement emission reduction measures for each category within Scope 3 • Develop measures for reducing emissions both upstream and downstream in the supply chain For information on results calculated for fiscal 2013, see the website of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan (in Japanese).

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 138 Overview of fiscal 2014 performance In fiscal 2014, environmental accounting showed that the following categories remained at virtually the same level as the previous year: investments and expenses in environmental conservation, and economic benefits of environmental conservation. Investments in environmental conservation, such as system upgrades, were valued at ¥37 million, while the cost of environmental conservation including recycling products, parts, and toner cartridges and other consumables was ¥1,272 million. Meanwhile, the economic benefits from environmental conservation included real effects, like business profits due to recycling activities of ¥971 million. They also include estimated effects valued at ¥256 million related to reducing environmental impact through the use of, for example, paperless products and non-mercury lamp projectors. Total economic benefits for the fiscal year were ¥1,227 million.Moving forward, Casio will accurately ascertain and inform people about the effects of its environmental management activities from an economic perspective and will strive to engage in efficient and effective environmental conservation efforts.

It also includes the environmental benefit of paperless products such as electronic dictionaries and data projectors and smaller non-mercury lamp projectors and printers, efforts to increase the longevity of the parts on these devices that require regular replacement, and distribution cost reductions achieved by a modal shift from air to sea transport. Regarding the reduction of power consumption during product use by customers, the monetary value of the environmental impact reduction effect is calculated as follows: Reduction of power consumption during product use by customers = (Annual power consumption of the previous model – Annual power consumption of the new model) x Number of units sold in the year x Electric power unit price. When calculating the estimated effects, the following coefficients are used: CO2 unit prices are the average full-year value for fiscal 2014 based on the EU emissions trading price (¥641.7/t). The electric power unit prices are fiscal 2014 electricity costs from the Fiscal 2014 Energy White Paper issued by Japan’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (¥17.53/kWh).

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 140 Carbon offset initiative As an initiative to help combat climate change, Casio began selling toner cartridges featuring a carbon offset in July 2008. In general, carbon offset works like this: an organization purchases a credit equivalent to a reduction of emissions of certain gases thought to contribute to climate change in order to “cancel out” its own emissions. Even though Casio’s products are compact and energy-efficient, which in itself reduces emissions, Casio’s toner initiative seeks to offset CO2 emissions equivalent to the amount generated to produce the electric power the printer uses during the life of the toner cartridge. This fiscal year, in an effort to provide some support for reconstruction from the Great East Japan Earthquake, Casio offset 1,286 tons of emissions (CO2 conversion) accounting for about 60% of its total offset, with credits from a greenhouse gas reduction project conducted in the Tohoku region. It offset the remainder with credits in other regions of Japan.

Casio’s Special Committee on Packaging spearheads the company’s effort to revise and improve general packaging. Specifically, the committee promotes efforts to improve transport efficiency, reduce CO2 emissions during transportation, and reduce the amount of material used in packaging by making packages more compact and lightweight for all products. Here are three examples of these activities. 1. Watch packaging: Eliminated an extra step of distribution processing by standardizing packaging that had been different for each customer, and further reduced the packaging size. 2. Electronic dictionary packaging: Realized more compact packaging with fewer package components by improving the shock resistance of the products themselves. 3. Digital camera packaging: In consideration of actual customer usage, eliminated some included items (accessories) and revised specifications of others, thereby reducing packaging weight. Watch Packaging Casio redesigned three different packaging formats (C ring stands) that had been used for North American customers. By standardizing the packaging format, the packaging volume was reduced by about 17%. In addition, a step of distribution processing was eliminated. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 144 Electronic Dictionary Packaging One of the packaging components, the product tray, was eliminated by improving the shock resistance of the products themselves. Also, by redesigning the box construction, a place for putting the included product accessories was created. In total, the box volume was reduced by about 13%. Digital Camera Packaging In consideration of actual customer usage, some included items (accessories) were eliminated and the specifications of others were revised to reduce packaging weight. For instance: Simplified user manual content, with further details provided online Changed the manual from CD size to A7 size Eliminated the CD-ROM CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 145 Digital Camera Packaging In consideration of actual customer usage, some included items (accessories) were eliminated and the specifications of others were revised to reduce packaging weight.

Logistics process initiatives Casio is actively reducing its environmental impact by striving to reduce CO2 and waste emissions arising from logistics. In order to reduce CO2 emissions in the logistics process, Casio is promoting the following three action plans. Shortening transport distances： Promoting direct shipping to customers from logistics centers in and outside Japan Promoting a modal shift： Actively using modes of transport with low environmental impact such as rail for transport between sites Improving loading efficiency and reducing transport volume： Improving the packaging design of digital cameras, electronic dictionaries, musical instruments electronic cash registers, and other products, and reducing the volume of packaging Relocation and Consolidation of Logistics Centers in Japan Casio’s logistics center in Mie Prefecture was moved to Saitama Prefecture, and then its distribution center in Tokyo was ultimately consolidated with the logistics center, a transition that was achieved in stages. In August 2011, the logistics center was moved from Suzuka City, Mie Prefecture, to Toda City, Saitama Prefecture. Then in January 2012, the company’s Eastern Distribution Center in Koto-ku, Tokyo, was consolidated with the logistics center. With this change, Casio reduced the number of consumer product distribution sites in Japan from five to four. This transition not only shortened transport distances, but also promoted a significant shift from truck to rail shipment, and has contributed greatly to CO2 emissions reduction. Promoting Modal Shift and Reducing Intermediate Transport ■Results of the Transfer and Consolidation 1. Elimination of intermediate transport CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 147 ■Results of the Transfer and Consolidation 1. Elimination of intermediate transport Shortened the distance from the logistics center to the Hokkaido Distribution Center in Sapporo Intermediate transport no longer required from the logistics center to the Eastern Distribution Center in Tokyo 2. Promotion of modal shift Partial shift to rail between the logistics center and the Western Distribution Center in Osaka Switch to rail between the logistics center and the Kyushu Distribution Center in Fukuoka 3. Transport distance shortened Shortened the transport distance in the Kanto (Tokyo) region which accounts for about 46% of direct shipments from the logistics center (delivery direct to customers without going through a distribution center) * Based on the results described above, Casio reduced CO2 emissions by approximately 340 tons in fiscal 2013, and approximately 300 tons in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2013, Casio began an initiative to send products manufactured outside Japan directly to the Western Distribution Center in Osaka. This allows transport distances to be shortened significantly by cutting out transit through the Toda Logistics Center. Promoting direct delivery to North America Casio is promoting direct delivery from logistics centers to corporate customers. In the past, products shipped from China to North America were sent to a warehouse of Casio America, Inc. in Chicago, before being delivered to the logistics centers of corporate customers. In 2009, however, Casio began shipping directly to the central logistics centers of customers, thereby helping to reduce CO2 emissions. In fiscal 2011, about 1,800 tons of CO2 emitted by the Casio Group and its customers were eliminated in this way. From fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2013, about 4,200 tons of CO2 emitted by the Casio Group and its customers were eliminated in this way. Promoting direct delivery to North America CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 148 Introduction of reusable shipping cartons in Asian distribution customers, thereby helping to reduce CO2 emissions. In fiscal 2011, about 1,800 tons of CO2 emitted by the Casio Group and its customers were eliminated in this way. From fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2013, about 4,200 tons of CO2 emitted by the Casio Group and its customers were eliminated in this way. Promoting direct delivery to North America Introduction of reusable shipping cartons in Asian distribution To reduce packaging material, Casio is working to introduce the use of reusable shipping cartons in its Asian distribution operations. In an effort to switch to plastic reusable shipping cartons in its air freight shipments between Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand, Casio launched the use of new cartons in September 2009.

Environmental laws and regulations relating to Casio products and green procurement As a company with operations around the world, Casio must comply with the laws and standards of many different countries. This is why Casio starts with the design and procurement stages to ensure that its products comply with restrictions on specified chemical substances in parts and materials, while complying with obligations for labeling, information provision and energy-saving standards for finished products. Covering the procurement stage, Casio has formulated Casio Green Procurement Standards to cover the legal regulations for the chemical substances contained in Casio products, and is procuring its parts and materials in accordance with those standards. To ensure that Casio products comply with the latest laws and standards around the world, the Casio Green Procurement Standards are constantly reviewed and updated. Thus, by procuring parts and materials that meet its own strict standards, Casio can be confident that its product development meets legal requirements worldwide. Casio also ensures the compliance of its products by scientifically verifying and analyzing the content of chemical substances in parts and materials used. In the design stage, the company confirms that all parts and materials that will go into a completed Casio product meet the Casio Green Procurement Standards. Products are approved for production only after confirmation using a database of the chemical substances contained in procured materials. Casio selects recyclable materials and provides symbol marks and the necessary information to ensure separate collection, complying with the relevant laws and standards worldwide on product recovery and recycling as well as on chemical substances contained in products. In response to laws and regulations requiring more energy-saving designs (such as the ErP Ecodesign Directive), Casio is creating technical documents and other internal standards.

Saving resources by eliminating defects At Yamagata Casio, which boasts the most advanced manufacturing technologies of any Casio facility, a computer-simulated system is adopted for the design process in an effort to eliminate the creation of defective products even before the trial production stage. They calculate the flow of resin inside a mold, and try to predict and resolve any problems that might occur in the manufacturing process. This enables production to begin without a test production phase, thereby minimizing the waste of resources. Simulation display In the mass production stage, the condition of the molds used to form components is analyzed digitally using acoustic emission (AE) technologies that Yamagata Casio developed itself. This technology detects even slight deformations or cracks that appear in the mold over the course of manufacturing many tens of thousands of parts, sounding an alarm before such problems can have an impact on product quality. This prevents the generation of defective products As an indication of the success of these initiatives, the factory is now using parts per million (PPM) Mold diagnostic system using AE rather than a percentage (%) as the index to manage its defective product production rate. Environmental performance data at production sites (Environmental Data) CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 154 All Casio office sites are engaged in efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and cut resource use by upgrading office equipment and improving work processes. Reducing power consumption through server integration Casio has vastly reduced its energy consumption by integrating the servers that had once been disparately located across the group. Server integration results A total of 970 servers had been integrated by March 2014. Effects of reducing power consumption through server integration This server integration effort resulted in a total reduction in power consumption of 1,450,000 kWh, yielding a reduction in CO2 emissions of 528 tons.

Casio Europe's energy-efficient building Casio's office sites have shifted from focusing on reducing CO2 per unit of production to cutting the total volume of CO2 emitted across the entire Casio Group. In January 2009, Casio Europe integrated its offices, distribution center, and service center, which had previously been separately located around Germany, into a new energy-efficient building. CASIO Europe This building has an innovative air conditioning system that uses geothermal exchange equipment 130m below ground to pump water through pipes embedded in the concrete ceiling and floor of the building. The system pumps cool water in the summer and hot water in the winter to either cool or heat the building. Energy consumption in the building is further reduced by controlling room temperatures using blinds that open and close automatically according to the weather as well as proper ventilation. Diagram showing the use of geothermal heat CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 155 Hachioji R&D Center takes on the challenge of climate change and environmental preservation The Hachioji R&D Center was designed and constructed to reduce CO2 emissions in order to contribute to the fight against climate change. The center continues to take on the challenge of environment protection. Some of its innovations are highlighted below. Ongoing power-saving activities The Hachioji R&D Center completed in November 2003 is a research and development facility that incorporated environmentally friendly equipment from the initial design stage. It has been running efficiently for approximately ten years since it opened, boasting energy-saving features such as high-efficiency vertical thermal storage tanks, a natural ventilation system, automatic blinds, lighting control and equipment control based on weather forecasting. With the participation of the construction company, the center holds ongoing meetings to consider power-saving measures. Thus, instead of just relying on its hardware, the center has been enthusiastically pursuing other improvements such as finely tuned temperature control adjustments, and the revision of operation methods based on actual daily data. As a result of these efforts, in fiscal 2010, five years after the base year of fiscal 2005, the center was able to reduce CO2 emissions by 27.5%. Subsequently, the organization and the number of employees at the center underwent significant changes in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 because some of its departments carried out business combinations with other companies, and substantial changes in singular values were also observed in the amount of CO2 emissions. However, in fiscal 2013, CO2 emissions were less than half of what they were in the base year of fiscal 2005. Base year emissions FY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009 FY2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 (FY2005) Emissions (tons) 2,952 2,802 2,618 2,452 2,303 2,140 705 961 1,319 1,272 Reduction rate compared to 5％ 11％ 17％ 22％ 28％ 76％ 67％ 55％ 57％ the base year Figures reported up to fiscal 2010 differ due to a change in the CO2 emissions calculation method Click here to see CO2 emissions from office sites (environmental data) The Hachioji R&D Center – environmentally friendly since the design stage The air-conditioning system at the Hachioji R&D Center features a large vertical thermal storage tank that passed through all the floors of the building. It contains water that is cooled during the night when electricity is cheaper, and then used for climate control during the day. Using a vertical thermal storage tank allows the system to make use of thermal stratification in the stored water to reduce the volume of cooled water used and makes it easier to draw water up to the upper floors of the building. Although the system can operate entirely on its own, it is actually run with human guidance for “semi-automatic” operation. In other words, by having human technicians make the finely tuned adjustments that the system cannot make automatically, greater savings in Thermal storage tanks energy consumption and CO2 emissions are being achieved to protect the The distinctive yellow tower is noticeable even from a environment. distance, and the storage tank has become an energy-saving symbol for the entire Hachioji R&D Center. It holds roughly the same volume of cooled water as a pool, and uses it for air conditioning. Natural ventilation system maximizes use of outside weather conditions No heating equipment is needed at the Hachioji R&D Center. This is because the building has comprehensive protection against cold weather, which prevents interior heat from escaping and improves thermal efficiency. Since room temperatures increase even in winter, due to body heat and heat from equipment such as computers, the interior is cooled by letting outside air in as needed through ducts on each floor. This provides ventilation through natural airflow using the chimney effect to lower room temperatures. Thus, the temperature is adjusted using hardly any electric power. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 156 Making the most of sunlight with automatic blinds The opening and closing of the blinds is controlled automatically by calculating the position of the sun and using sensors to detect its intensity at the same time. Thanks to this technology, a comfortable interior environment is maintained. In addition to this, the system reduces unnecessary usage of electricity by regulating air conditioning to match the number of people in the center obtained by using building entry data and automatically control interior lighting, switching it on and off and adjusting brightness with sensors that detect room brightness and human movement. The building also has a green wall of vegetation to prevent it from heating up. The center has developed educational tours for local elementary school students and others to explain the use of its features. Automatic blinds Related materials: See the “Environmental Communication” section for information The automatic blinds help to maintain optimal interior about educational tours of the facility temperatures and lighting through automatic control of natural http://world.casio.com/csr/env/communication/ light. They block the intense summer sun. In addition, employees came up with the idea of saving more electricity by opening the blinds at lunchtime to let light in and turning off the Through these measures,the Hachioji R&D Center is contributing greatly to the lights. reduction of CO2 emissions, thereby helping in the fight against climate change and protecting the environment. While fully utilizing the environmentally friendly functions of this energy-saving building, the center is implementing cycles of improvement, operation, results,verification, and evaluation in order to achieve even more power savings in the future. A green wall The center sports a green wall of bitter gourd plants. While it only covers part of the exterior, it shields the surface of the building and the interior from direct sunlight to prevent increases in temperature.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 158 Casio's environmental management system is driven by the biannual Casio Environmental Conferences. The company makes the most of this system to implement its environmental management strategy. Implementation framework The biannual Casio Environmental Conferences decide on the company's specific environmental plans, including its environmental policies and action plan targets. Positioned within the conference are special committees that deal with environmental issues shared by all group companies. Each business site and group company then implements the policies and plans. An environmental management system based on environmental management tools such as ISO 14001 has been adopted at each site and group company, and since fiscal 2012, 100% of group company employees have been working at sites with ISO 14001 certification.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 160 Worldwide, environmental regulations are being strengthened to preserve the beauty of the Earth. Whether global or local, compliance with environmental regulations has become an integral part of the corporate mission. Companies today recognize the need to address issues such as risk management and environmental information disclosure, while complying with greenhouse gas emissions regulations, the prohibition of products containing harmful chemical substances and ISO 14001 legal requirements. Here is an overview of Casio’s environmental compliance initiatives. Standards management and audits: Regular internal audits and third-party audits There are 14 Casio sites which have obtained ISO 14001 certification. Each of these sites regularly implements conditions management and improvement activities by measuring concentrations of dust, SOx, and NOx in exhaust emissions, based on voluntary standards and standards established by national and local governments. They also measure wastewater quality (water containing harmful substances). Moreover, the sites measure and report usage conditions for harmful atmospheric pollutants, as well as handling quantities and atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Each site trains internal environmental auditors and environmental provisional auditors. In addition to carrying out internal audits, third-party audits by external organizations are also regularly performed, and improvement activities are carried out. Going forward, Casio will work to improve the environmental risk detection skills of its internal environmental auditors, as a way to improve its overall environmental audit capability. Casio will also seek to improve auditors’ understanding of various environmental laws, and provide training in worldwide laws relating to chemical substance control and information management. Casio intends these auditors to lead the way in environment compliance, starting at the local site, by discovering issues and proposing ways to improve. Compliance Audits in the Phases of Product Development, Design, and Manufacturing In recent years, laws and regulations on the environmental performance of products have become stricter. In addition to stricter regulations in EU nations and US states, stronger laws are also being discussed and enacted in the newly emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, referencing those already established by developed countries. In some cases, the newer laws are based on the established ones, but they often have small differences in the specific requirements. It is vital for Casio to interpret these regulations properly, and make whatever product adjustments are needed. Accordingly, Casio always obtains the latest news from each region and specialized information services, while also exchanging information with other companies in the same industry. The information is used to check that Casio products meet legal requirements. The company analyzes the text of laws including those under deliberation, and establishes specific product response policies immediately after new laws are officially announced, ensuring that all Casio products are legally compliant. Casio has established a Product Environment Law Study Working Group within its New Green Product Development Council. The working group includes representatives from the environmental management, technology, development/design, and sales departments, and investigates measures for product compliance. The group members share information, establish reasonable response policies, and confirm response progress, for efforts relating to both current and future laws. They also offer support to the development, design, manufacturing and sales departments. The working group performs the following. 1. Gathering and sharing legal information from and with sources such as industrial associations, sales companies in each region, information services, and other companies in the same industry 2. Analyzing and interpreting legal information 3. Ensuring obligations are met by manufacturing, import, export, and sales entities 4. Creating development and design standards, and conducting inspections 5. Improving the usage efficiency for design support tools (database of chemical substances contained in products, etc.) With the enactment of some regulations carrying severe penalties, Casio also recognizes the need to keep CASIO SUSTAINABILITY strengthening REPORT 2014 risk management. 161 Furthermore, Casio conducts environmental audits before shipping new products in the development and design departments to check for 5. Improving the usage efficiency for design support tools (database of chemical substances contained in products, etc.) With the enactment of some regulations carrying severe penalties, Casio also recognizes the need to keep strengthening risk management. Furthermore, Casio conducts environmental audits before shipping new products in the development and design departments to check for environmental design that conforms not only to laws and regulations by also to the Casio Voluntary Plan for the Environment. The group also conducts audits of chemical substances to check whether products comply with laws and regulations on chemical substances in various overseas markets. Products are cleared for shipment on confirmation that all parts and materials satisfy standards on chemical substances. Compliance Relating to Chemical Substances Contained in Products Countries around the world have implemented new laws pertaining to chemical substances contained in electrical and electronics products, while existing laws continue to be strengthened each year. Individual laws and regulations vary in terms of the applicable chemical substances, regulated applications, exempt applications, threshold values, scope, and requirements (content restrictions, labeling, and information provision, etc.). Casio has consolidated the requirements of various laws on chemical substances contained in products and has incorporated them into the Casio Green Procurement Standards. The development and design departments are then able to comply with regulations worldwide by checking a database to see whether a part or material to be included in a product meets the Casio Green Procurement Standards. Compliance Relating to the Proper Collection, Recycling, and Disposal of Used Products Countries around the world also have regulations for the collection and recycling of used electrical and electronics products, packaging materials, and batteries. Companies must comply with the requirements of each law including product design to save resources and facilitate recycling, labeling and information provision to promote user participation in the sorted collection of products for recycling, as well as information provision for proper product disposal. Through audits at the end of the product design process, Casio evaluates each product design in terms of resource savings, ease of dismantling, recycling potential, and recycled material content. Confirmation is also made to see whether the recycling symbols and displayed information meet legal requirements worldwide. In response to the enactment of the Small Appliance Recycling Act in April 2013, Casio has pulled together a project team that includes employees involved in each product category (such as designers and others) to develop products that are easily recyclable. As part of this project, Casio is asking intermediate processors and metal smelters who recycle used small household appliances to participate in interviews regarding dismantling methods and other issues. The lessons learned are being incorporated into internal design manuals, helping Casio to create products that are easy to recycle. Compliance Relating to Power Consumption There are also regulations on power consumption and efficiency for electrical and electronics products including external power supplies and chargers, based on product categories and power source types. Companies must also meet various requirements relating to power consumption and efficiency, including regulations that require the meeting of minimum standards and those that mandate the display of power consumption information. Casio confirms the applicable regulations for each of its products, and carries out product development and design to meet the requirements. Approval applications and reports are made to the relevant agencies as necessary. Compliance Relating to Energy Saving and the Prevention of Global Warming Casio is committed to investigating and strengthening its voluntary efforts, such as those included in its Environmental Action Plan, based on laws and regulations related to energy conservation and the fight against global warming. Casio has measures addressing regulations around the globe, but this section focuses on the steps Casio is taking to comply with the laws and regulations in Japan that apply to its relatively large business facilities. 1. Act on the Rational Use of Energy Pursuant to the requirements of the Energy Conservation Law, Casio is separately evaluating the rational use of energy at the business level. Casio Computer Co., Ltd. and Yamagata Casio are both currently designated as specified businesses. Since fiscal 2010, Casio has been regularly submitting reports and medium and long-term plans on this issue, and in accordance with the determination standards relating to the rational use of energy at plants and facilities, has been promoting the development of management systems, such as creating the new position of energy management supervisor. 2. Act on the Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures CASIOCasio SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 does not exceed the standards for emissions of greenhouse gases 162 other than CO2 arising from energy use set by Japan’s Act on the Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures. It is complying with requirements for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, by regularly submitting reports under the Act on the Rational Use of Energy relating to the rational use of energy at plants and facilities, has been promoting the development of management systems, such as creating the new position of energy management supervisor. 2. Act on the Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures Casio does not exceed the standards for emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 arising from energy use set by Japan’s Act on the Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures. It is complying with requirements for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, by regularly submitting reports under the Act on the Rational Use of Energy 3. Environmental Regulations in Tokyo Since fiscal 2009, the Tokyo Cap-and-Trade Program for greenhouse gas emissions has been in effect for large business facilities (with energy usage of more than 1,500 kl per year, crude oil equivalent) located in Tokyo. The system requires companies to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions against standard emission amounts in each upcoming five-year reduction period. Casio's Hamura R&D Center participates in this program, and has been making steady progress in reducing total emissions. Soon, the facility expects to achieve its reduction obligations, which will enable the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to lift its designation. Separate from the program described above, the Global Warming Countermeasures Reporting Program has been in effect for all small and medium-sized business facilities (less than 1,500 kl per year in crude oil equivalent energy use) in Tokyo since fiscal 2010. Under the program, if total energy use of the small and medium-sized business facilities of one company exceeds 3,000kl per year, the company must submit reports. Casio Computer Co., Ltd. was originally subject to this program, but with actual results for fiscal 2010 showing that the company dropped below 3,000 kl per year in crude oil equivalent, Casio received a “Notice Confirming Non-Applicability of the Global Warming Countermeasures Reporting Requirements” for this facility. Since progress has been made on reducing emissions at the Hamura R&D Center, as mentioned above, Casio is expecting that facility to be treated as a small and medium-sized business facility, making it subject to this program. In that case, since the total energy use for applicable facilities would once again go over 3,000 kl/year or more on a crude oil equivalent basis, Casio expects that it will again become obligated to submit reports under the Global Warming Countermeasures Reporting Program. Compliance relating to environmental information disclosure There is a growing international movement calling for the creation of information disclosure standards for companies. Along with the need for Japanese standards to coincide with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), there is a movement calling for the provision of Management Commentaries (MC) as a form of disclosure of non-financial and corporate forecast information. In other words, companies will need to disclose non-financial data which describes the connections between the company’s current situation, business strategy, risks, and financial performance, and other relevant information. In order to provide its stakeholders with the proper environmental information in a way that it is easy to understand, Casio has the following aims. 1. To adopt more accurate indices relating to environmental impact, and to provide comparable information 2. To provide non-financial information including environmental information that indicates the connections with corporate strategy 3. To explain the capability of environmental information to improve corporate performance Along with working to disclose environmental information, Casio will promote international disclosure standards for non-financial information, and work towards standardization. Highlight: Participating in the Wal-Mart Sustainability Index Project Sustainability is becoming a key word for manufacturers, retailers and suppliers. Recently, retailers are aggressive about achieving their sustainability goals. Manufacturers and suppliers need to respond and be actively involved in retailers’ initiatives. For example, Wal-Mart is actively engaged in sustainability initiatives. One of its initiatives is a Sustainability Index. Wal-Mart conducted a Supplier Sustainability Assessment which is a brief survey to evaluate supplier’s sustainability in 2009, and Casio responded to the survey.

The 2013 show was entitled Eco-Protect, Eco-Create. Based on the concepts of resource conservation (eco-protect) and energy self-sufficiency (eco-create), the Casio exhibit highlighted Casio Green Star products and the Casio Group's various environmental initiatives. The stage featured entertaining and interactive talks, as well as eco-protective and eco-creative performances to highlight the importance of nature and the need to restore the balance of the global environment. In the Casio booth, the company also featured which parts of its products are environmentally friendly in a way that is more easily understood, using memorable slogans and stamp rally-inspired quizzes. In addition to the calculator assembly class, which is popular every year, Casio also hosted a pomrie stamp-making experience for adults. The exhibit attracted a large number of visitors over the course of the event, including children and students. Casio Green Star products, which have earned the use of the EcoRail logo, were also part of an exhibit co-sponsored by the Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport and the Railway Freight Association. The Casio booth displayed the certificate indicating approval of the use of the EcoRail logo, while the Railway Freight Association booth included displays of Casio products as well as a video presentation on EcoRail logo-approved Casio products. By continuing to participate in this exhibition, Casio can widely publicize its environmental activities and propose new concepts and strategies for taking care of the environment.

Casio also supports the organization as a corporate member. The Beautiful Tama River Forum In fiscal 2012, Casio began providing support for the Beautiful Tama River 100-Year Plan, which aims to make the Tama River beautiful through three main types of projects promoting the economy, environment, and cultural education. Earth Watch Japan Earth Watch Japan organizes a wide array of volunteer activities in and outside Japan, conducts various wildlife surveys, and engages in research activities. Casio has been a Corporate Partner of Earth Watch Japan since fiscal 2014. Tree planting In an effort to promote harmonious co-existence and mutual prosperity with the global environment and its local community, Casio Electronics (Shenzhen) has been participating in tree-planting activities for the past nine years. On March 29, 2014, 40 employees participated in the fiscal 2014 tree-planting activity jointly sponsored by the Shenzhen City Management Bureau and the Shenzhen City Green Fund. This activity has been going on for many years in partnership with the local government, but this year it began raining while volunteers were working. In spite of the difficult footing and muddy conditions, the volunteers managed to get 20 trees planted. Tree planting in the rain This year, everyone was wearing Casio blue clothing while participating in this event, ensuring that the activity not only raised awareness of environmental preservation issues, but provided a good opportunity for participants to feel proud of their role as Casio employees. Families also participate in community activities CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 168 Initiative to Save Otoguro Cherry Trees Otoguro cherry trees (scientific name: Cerasus serrulata, or Komatsunagi ) are a type of wild cherry that comes into full bloom in mid April. They have white blossoms measuring 5 to 6 cm, and the leaves emerge at the same time as the blooms. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, this cherry tree variety was growing along the banks of the Fuefuki River, which flows through present-day Chuo City in Yamanashi Prefecture. The Otoguro cherry gets its name from the Otoguro Embankment in the Otoguro District, where the trees used to bloom. This variety of cherry tree has long been a favorite of the people in that region. However, with the improvement of the Fuefuki River in 1932, the Otoguro cherry trees were cut down. Mr. Matsuhiko Tanaka of Otoguro District grew grafted seedlings from a few remaining descendent trees, in order to bring back the historic Otoguro cherry. His activities eventually came to fruition, and a volunteer group for saving the Otoguro cherry was established in 2002. The Tamaho-cho (now Chuo City) Board of Education lifelong learning center led the whole community in efforts to save and cultivate Otoguro cherry trees. This was achieved through cutting and Otoguro cherry trees on the grounds grafting methods using a few remaining descendents of the original trees. As part of Kofu Casio’s environmental activities, the company offered to participate in the cultivating of this endangered type of cherry tree, for the purpose of preserving the variety and beautifying the landscape around the plant. Kofu Casio received a donation of trees from Tamaho-cho (now Chuo City) in 2004, and over the three subsequent years, the company planted more than 30 Otoguro cherry trees. All the transplanted trees took root, and every spring they provide a beautiful display of blossoms for people to enjoy on the grounds of the Kofu plant. The Otoguro cherry serves as a symbol of the connection between Casio and the people of Chuo City. The company is proud of its early participation in helping to preserve the tree variety, as part of its biodiversity protection efforts on the local level. This is just one example of Casio’s vision of harmony among people, businesses, and living things. Since fiscal 2013, the Kofu Office of Casio Business Service Co., Ltd., has managed the trees. Employee efforts to preserve biodiversity by protecting endangered species I work on environmental preservation activities, and I am also a photographer who holds regular photo exhibits featuring photos of wild animals. In recent years, as greater attention has been paid to environmental and biodiversity preservation, I have held photo exhibits to share information about endangered species, and I make donations to relevant environmental organizations based on the number of people who visit. I hope to continue to contribute to the protection of endangered species through these kinds of activities.

Consideration Casio Computer Co., Ltd. was responsible for preparing the Report, and JQA’s responsibility was to conduct verification of Greenhouse gas in the Report only. There is no conflict of interest between Casio Computer Co., Ltd. and JQA. Tadayuki Yano, Executive Board Director For and on behalf of Japan Quality Assurance Organization 1-25, Kandasudacho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan 30 June, 2014 CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 170 The opinion presented here was written based on the content of this report (website version) and interviews with Casio personnel responsible for environmental, procurement, human resources, and CSR initiatives. Casio is now at a stage where the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) management cycle, with a focus on reducing the company’s environmental impact and ensuring socially responsible procurement, should be used to expand CSR initiatives group-wide. Commendable efforts by Casio With respect to its mediumto long-term environmental management policy, Casio has set greenhouse gas targets for fiscal 2021 and 2051 and has expanded its efforts to reduce environmental impact into the areas of packaging and distribution. This is in line with its three commitments of “realizing a low-carbon society,” “building a recycling society,” and “living in harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity.” It is especially commendable that Casio began conducting surveys to verify that the paper used in its user manuals, pamphlets, and other publications is made from recycled paper, certified timber, and legally logged timber. Also laudable were the surveys and calculations done to determine CO2 emissions for the entire product lifecycle. In addition to efforts within the group and supply chain, I have strong expectations that Casio will develop initiatives that cover the entire product lifecycle including the customer stage—such as providing instructions on optimal product usage and improving the recycling rate at the time of disposal—and also disclose information on the progress of those initiatives. As an initiative to improve supplier CSR, Casio conducted a questionnaire using a five-point scale on issues such as reducing environmental impact, protecting the human rights of workers, and avoiding conflict minerals. Responses were received from 253 suppliers in Japan, 149 suppliers in China, and 32 suppliers in Thailand. By providing feedback based on the results, making inspection visits to 14 suppliers in China and Thailand, and presenting awards and providing case studies at meetings, Casio continued to ascertain and appraise its suppliers’ commitment to social responsibility. In the future, I recommend that Casio ask suppliers to provide data and other verifiable proof in their self-assessment of initiatives, and work to make the specific measures and issues even more readily visible and understandable. I also hope that Casio will further improve its system of interaction with suppliers with a view to making continual improvements. Points for improvement while commending progress to date With respect to the company-wide CSR implementation system, it is admirable that Casio established a Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights, its own tool for checking the status of human rights, and guidelines on the prevention of corruption based on a survey of 32 group companies in and outside Japan conducted in fiscal 2013 focused on human rights and fair business practices, which are two of the ISO 26000 core topics. It is also noteworthy that Casio disclosed the number of times its whistle-blowing system has been used. However, I have strong expectations that Casio will develop an implementation framework that ensures these guidelines and tools are actually put to effective use in everyday management. Regarding the fostering of a CSR culture throughout the group, it is commendable that Casio maintains a CSR series in its in-house magazine, Casio. In the future, I hope that team leaders who have responsibility for implementing CSR globally will be appointed to each site and department. Again, I strongly urge Casio to convey messages from senior management, translated into multiple languages, to Casio sites around the world and to increase opportunities for ensuring that employees on the frontlines, at headquarters, and at sites around the world get a rapid and detailed understanding of the company’s initiatives. Regarding group-wide efforts to increase and utilize personnel diversity, it is commendable that Casio launched a Diversity Project aimed at encouraging diverse human resources including persons with disabilities and non-Japanese employees as well as women to play a more active role, and that it defined a future policy for a group-wide human resources governance system that includes companies outside Japan. In the future, I hope that Casio will envision in detail a global personnel portfolio that transcends departmental and corporate boundaries, establish a comprehensive system for recruitment, development, exchange, and evaluation of human resources, expand its human resources database to bring local staff members in each country into the picture, and develop other strategies and systems for making active use of personnel diversity, aiming for a target year in the near future, say 2020. Regarding efforts to create more supportive workplaces for employees, it is commendable that 4.25% of employees at Casio Computer Co., Ltd., made use of the company’s leave and reduced working hours programs for childcare and nursing care. With an expected increase in employees that continue to work while caring for a family member at home or face other challenges outside of work, the company needs to provide more opportunities for its employees to hear from users of these care support programs and ask questions about any topic. In the area of employing persons with disabilities, Casio’s average consolidated performance in Japan dipped below the legally mandated rate of employment, although this was related to the decline in the total number of employees in connection to business restructuring. I CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 171 other verifiable proof in their self-assessment of initiatives, and work to make the specific measures and issues even more readily visible and understandable. I also hope that Casio will further improve its system of interaction with suppliers with a view to making continual improvements. Points for improvement while commending progress to date With respect to the company-wide CSR implementation system, it is admirable that Casio established a Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights, its own tool for checking the status of human rights, and guidelines on the prevention of corruption based on a survey of 32 group companies in and outside Japan conducted in fiscal 2013 focused on human rights and fair business practices, which are two of the ISO 26000 core topics. It is also noteworthy that Casio disclosed the number of times its whistle-blowing system has been used. However, I have strong expectations that Casio will develop an implementation framework that ensures these guidelines and tools are actually put to effective use in everyday management. Regarding the fostering of a CSR culture throughout the group, it is commendable that Casio maintains a CSR series in its in-house magazine, Casio. In the future, I hope that team leaders who have responsibility for implementing CSR globally will be appointed to each site and department. Again, I strongly urge Casio to convey messages from senior management, translated into multiple languages, to Casio sites around the world and to increase opportunities for ensuring that employees on the frontlines, at headquarters, and at sites around the world get a rapid and detailed understanding of the company’s initiatives. Regarding group-wide efforts to increase and utilize personnel diversity, it is commendable that Casio launched a Diversity Project aimed at encouraging diverse human resources including persons with disabilities and non-Japanese employees as well as women to play a more active role, and that it defined a future policy for a group-wide human resources governance system that includes companies outside Japan. In the future, I hope that Casio will envision in detail a global personnel portfolio that transcends departmental and corporate boundaries, establish a comprehensive system for recruitment, development, exchange, and evaluation of human resources, expand its human resources database to bring local staff members in each country into the picture, and develop other strategies and systems for making active use of personnel diversity, aiming for a target year in the near future, say 2020. Regarding efforts to create more supportive workplaces for employees, it is commendable that 4.25% of employees at Casio Computer Co., Ltd., made use of the company’s leave and reduced working hours programs for childcare and nursing care. With an expected increase in employees that continue to work while caring for a family member at home or face other challenges outside of work, the company needs to provide more opportunities for its employees to hear from users of these care support programs and ask questions about any topic. In the area of employing persons with disabilities, Casio’s average consolidated performance in Japan dipped below the legally mandated rate of employment, although this was related to the decline in the total number of employees in connection to business restructuring. I continue to have strong expectations that Casio will promote community creation efforts based on disability and job types and continue making workplaces more supportive in the future. I hope to see improvement as soon as possible. Points for improvement Regarding the environmental impact reduction data in this report, it is commendable that details are provided on the principal sites in and outside Japan including group companies. My hope, however, would be that Casio will continue to increase the level of accuracy of group reporting, not only for environmental data, but also for personnel and procurement initiatives and data.
