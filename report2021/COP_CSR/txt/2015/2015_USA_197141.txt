The world has changed and the transformations have been accelerated during the past few years.

Assessments, policy and goals The respect of the proclaimed Human Rights is essential in the WCTI Partners’ management and partnerships. To pretend to contribute to an innovative world, we must be certain for a profitable business that this code of conduct’s primary basis is highly fulfilled by all of our stakeholders. 2. Implementation All our invested companies has to signed up a statement of non-abusive general treatments (human-rights, security of employees, control of their providers, environmentally friendly …) just before the investment statement’s signature. About Human Rights, the statement will be improved thanks to our work for this report, with the followings: • Respect of the proclaimed World Human Rights for its employees and salaries. • Make sure that its providers know and comply with the world proclaimed Human Rights for its employees and salaries, if not signed. However we recognize two failures in our system: • The statement is declarative • Our clients are mostly at the seed and early stages of their business and certain of these are composed by less than 10 employees whose are from the board committee or from the general management. We think nevertheless we can influence their development by creating a synergy between them. WCTI partners’ goal is to contribute to create several innovative hubs in partnership with European universities. We will buy commercial real estate so: • some of our clients will work in a similar environment, they could support and control each other (peers control); • the proximity with great institutions whose holding the Human Rights principles as universities and scientific world could influence our clients in their organization. 3. Measurements of outcomes WCTI Partners visits each of its clients’ business offices to control several business points during the required audits (due diligence and monitoring). To speak with employees, explore the site and read the HR report are ones of the auditing steps. Page 4 on 15 LABOUR (principles 3, 4, 5, 6) 1. Three questions to Isabelle Perche, Head of Healthcare Portfolio As the only woman in the team of portfolio managers, how could you say that you are considered as a peer by the others? « In my professional background, I have frequently been the only woman within a men’s team. I have always felt comfortable with such situations and I have never perceived any negative behavior or consideration from my colleagues. The relationship with the WCTI Portfolio managers is still recent, hence it is uneasy to provide you with an accurate answer. However, I should answer to your question by another question: why do you raise this point? Women shouldn’t envisage those kind of questions. Be yourself, do your best effort to achieve a high level of competency and no matter about the opinion of the men’s staff as far as your work is recognized and appreciated by the management of your company. » How do you think the CEO, Didier Dippe, is considering yourself in his organization regarding his others portfolio managers? « The CEO was looking for a specific professional background, profile, skills and competencies. Apparently and hopefully, he has estimated that I am the appropriate candidate according to his requirements and criteria. I think and I hope that man or woman did not make the difference and did not lead his choice and decision. » Do you consider your place at WCTI Partners as a privileged one comparing to women position in others world investment companies? « It is a real honor and advantage to work for a VC company as WCTI while being a woman in a men’s field. In that way, I live this job experience as a privilege. However, I have no sufficient feedback to compare my situation versus other women positions in world investment companies. But I am convinced that those women and I have surely a similar feeling, attitude and are ready to struggle if required. » 2. Assessments, policy and goals From our strategy: « Through regular dialogue with key general partner relationships, WCTI Partners’ portfolio managers work to systematically and proactively source attractive new coinvestment opportunities. » « WCTI Partners is currently settling innovative centers in Europe: Belgium, Switzerland, Lithuania, France and Germany. These centers will offer workspaces and support services such as administrative services and access to a scientific committee and its laboratory to accommodate startups and SMEs and provide them a professional environment. This innovative center has indeed set up a scientific team assigning to assess, improve technologies created and developed by hosted companies and file international patents. » Page 5 on 15 3. Implementation WCTI Partners is board member of all his invested companies providing our ongoing support and expertise in leading companies (as well as human resources and global organization, financial plan…) Besides, WCTI Partners has established a strict process to select companies in which we invest and their leaders with who we work. It is based on facts, evidences, numbers, current market, ethical and public and environmental policies, esteemed impact on the society, etc. And we make sure that at least three different experts have examined carefully the deal, in addition to the chief executive. 4. Measurements of outcomes Portfolio managers’ reports and auditing’s reports are constituting the « database » of our measurements. WCTI Partners plans to acquire portfolio management software to generate tendencies and occurrences and gathered figures for strategic decision-making. The WCTI Partners’ strategy will include a balance goal in each area portfolio to let business owners more equality chance to become our partner. This strategy will initiate new measurements in our deal recruitment process to rebalance it, regarding: • the organization (startups vs. SMEs), • the tendency on our current investments, • the current market in the area, • the country of origin, • the gender equity, • the global impact, • etc. Page 6 on 15 ENVIRONMENT (principles 7, 8, 9) 1. Assessments, policy and goals From our strategy: « Since September 2012, WCTI Partners’ new management decided to close positions in companies at seed and early stages, to focus only in direct investment in startups and SMEs involved in four main sectors such as hightech, IT, healthcare and cleantech and to settle first innovative center in Switzerland. » The notably cleantech (a shortened form of « clean technologies ») portfolio is composed by innovative environmentally friendly companies. These ones attempt to increase performance, productivity and efficiency by minimizing negative effects on the environment. 2. Implementation In our four areas and to value each deal, WCTI Partners brings together a scientific committee and experts whose all are largely recognized by their peers as well. We encourage moreover our salaries and partners to print few documents, and promote electronic files sending or secured sharing platform online. When it is necessary, we print our documents on both sides and in black and white as far as possible. Besides, WCTI Partners does not own any photocopier, nor printer. The company has also established frequent videoconferences instead of frequent meetings to contribute to reduce the greenhouse gas emission. We begin to put on our signature the « think before printing » message and encourage our partners to do the same: 3. Measurements of outcomes Concerning the Cleantech portfolio, the value of deals is based on environmentally friendly criteria: • Proof of concept: the innovative cleantech product is working. • Proof of market: the innovative cleantech product has a social and environmental purpose, a market exists for selling it. • Quality of management: a good governance of the company which includes the respect of Environment, Human Rights, Non-abusive Labour and Anti-Corruption. The next version of our statement (signed by our clients) will include those four precise areas. Page 7 on 15 ANTI-CORRUPTION (principle 10) 1. Assessments, policy and goals « WCTI Partners set investment procedures executed by portfolio managers, consultants, advisors and senior executive officers: • Senior analysts under supervision of portfolio managers select and assess targeted companies based on internal investment criteria. WCTI Partners has developed strong relationship with consulting firms for auditing and assessing selected projects; • An Advisory Board consists of key experts and opinion leaders in the targeted sector(s) indicate outlines of their investment recommendation and then provide advisories and follow-ups upon the Investment Committee's decisions. The members of this board has been regularly selected based upon their skills, roles and experiences in a determined field; • The Investment Committee approves or disapproves the investment operation based on analysis from senior analysts, portfolio managers and from the Advisory Board's recommendation; • Our legal advisors will implement legal compliance.
