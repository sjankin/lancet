UN Global Compact Communication On Progress 2014 The 10 principles of the STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Yet another year has passed on our relentless efforts to enrich the local and regional communities with the mentality of CSR, CSV, sustainability, corporate citizenship, and the like. For the last six years, we remained committed to the UN Global Compact principles and we vow to continue our efforts in this domain. Lebanon and the Middle East have some of the most pressing socio-economic and environmental problems in the world along with political instability and insecurity, and companies are still lagging behind their global counterparts in responding to these issues. Uncertainty has almost become the byword for businesses in Lebanon. However, it is in such circumstances that embedding CSR is particularly important. Whether this is in taking initiative in efficient management of resources, engaging with stakeholders, creating partnerships, collaborating with governments, or backing investments in social causes; all are indispensible ingredients for alleviating the risks generated by uncertainty and stimulating transformative social and environmental impacts. The private sector is not only expected to be the main active player, but also a powerful force for social progress. One of CSR LEBANON’s main achievements in 2014 was organizing, hosting and launching the UNGC participants workshop aimed towards the launch of the UNGC local network in Lebanon, after continuous efforts which started in 2009, and which received a great boost with the appointment of the CEO of CSR LEBANON as the contact person of UNGC in December 2012. The workshop took place on the 30th of September, 2014, with the attendance of more than 45 participants (Kindly find details on pages 23-25). It aimed at promoting the understanding of the UNGC as a global corporate sustainability learning platform, the various global engagement opportunities, and the basic reporting requirements. It also aimed at initiating dialogue on value proposition and creation of a formal network in Lebanon. Our continued commitment to promoting and implementing the GC Principles is based on: First, proving our support for the Global Compact. The UNGC continues to represent the most widely accepted set of international business standards in relation to CSR and human rights. CSR LEBANON 5 Second, demonstrating the positive impact of the ten principles that we have achieved, despite our small size and the country’s dramatic situation, mainly through our awareness-raising activities which we have been relentlessly working on. In 2014, we held our Fourth CSR LEBANON FORUMTM titled ‘CSR: The Business of Making a Difference’ (December 8-9, 2014) which was held under the patronage of the Governor of Banque du Liban, H.E. Mr. Riad Salamé, and was strongly supported by the European Union, the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture of Beirut and Mount Lebanon, and the American Lebanese Chamber of Commerce. The Forum attracted key leaders from the Lebanese private sector and corporations and hosted a number of prestigious international speakers who introduced CSR and sustainability concepts and know-how to participants. We also facilitated a large scale training course and workshop which aimed at helping participants identify the key to getting the most value from stakeholder relationships and how they can look at CSR issues from a business perspective towards identifying the business case. The two-day event was attended by more than 600 participants mainly from Lebanon and the Arab business communities. (Kindly find details on pages 15-21) We also continued to publish our Responsible Business Quarterly Review despite the difficulty in the publishing world. (Kindly find details on pages 32-33) Third, ensuring that as our business grows, it does so in a socially responsible way. Using the Global Compact self-assessment procedure has enabled us to identify areas where further improvements are needed to ensure that the business grows sustainably and continues to have a positive impact in society. We will continue to use it as a tool for evaluation and improvement. Finally, we live in a country and region which still suffer from the prevalence of uncommitted business leaders dealing with CSR agendas as a fashionable PR tool, and compromising on their credibility and reputation in an era where disclosure has become the norm. However, we will continue our sole efforts to provide the proper international standard knowledge on CSR among the private sector, in order to help businesses meet the genuine CSR values: materiality, stakeholder engagement, and social impact.

ABOUT CSR LEBANON Why CSR LEBANON Lebanon is a country with extensive human capital as well as a strong and continuously growing private sector. Despite substantial initiatives by the public, private, and non-profit sectors, there is still a genuine need for a sustainable group effort to address the socio-economic issues facing the country. There is a significant lack of awareness about CSR in Lebanese corporations and their role in the development of the country. Contrary to the fast-growing CSR trend across the global business world, the implementation of CSR strategies in Lebanon and the region is still very limited, and is only undertaken by a few corporations in specific fields. This fact negatively affects companies’ competitiveness, profitability, and sustainable growth. CSR LEBANON plays an essential role in tackling these challenges through the following strategic goals: • Spreading the culture of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Lebanon and the region. • Empowering the Lebanese private sector to implement CSR. • Helping banks and other corporations meet universal CSR and sustainability standards. • Presenting new CSR programs adapted to the Lebanese communities’ needs. • Developing CSR ties between businesses, civil society, governmental entities, and the media. • Establishing a regional CSR media platform based in Lebanon. CSR LEBANON 11 Our Challenges 1. Lack of funding because of the inexistence of an adequate legal status in Lebanon for operating as a social enterprise, rather than a for-profit company. This resulted in CSR LEBANON’s inability to approach local and international institutional donors. 2. Operating within an economy that is based on family-owned businesses where integrating a new culture inside the organization remains challenging and difficult. 3. Time constraints: Expenditures growing at a faster rate than income is generated. This prevents quick reinvestment into new initiatives and risks losing some of the positive momentum created. 4. Security and economic constraints as well as weak infrastructure and local and regional political instability. 5. The weak back-up from the public sector which keeps the sphere of collaboration small and hinders the proper adoption of CSR since the corporate sector remains free in the way it approaches CSR (although CSR is voluntary in nature) and has the capacity to manipulate public expectations because of the absence of relevant regulations and supervision. 6. As a new trend in the region, many parties, mainly event organizers and some consultants, deal with CSR as a commercial opportunity rather than a business approach. CSR LEBANON is then expected to invest further efforts to adjust the misconceptions created by similar unprofessional practices. 7. Lack of local and regional expertise which obligates CSR LEBANON to partner with international experts thus increasing its costs. COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE CSR LEBANON was established in 2009 with the aim of raising awareness about Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability in Lebanon and the region. The company follows a multi-year strategic program towards enhancing corporate engagement in surrounding communities by integrating responsible practices in their workplaces, marketplaces, environment, and society. With many impressive achievements so far ranging from hosting high caliber events, four international level CSR Forums with global reach, banking workshops, CSR strategies, project consultancies, media campaigns, a specialized magazine, and publications, CSR LEBANON has already succeeded in creating a great momentum and raising the bar in the strategic perception of the concept among corporations and stakeholders. The social enterprise uses a communications mix aimed at reaching all of our stakeholders.

The website also includes a news portal highlighting selective local, regional, and international CSR news and updates. CSR LEBANON 15 CSR LEBANON Events In 2014, CSR LEBANON organized its Fourth CSR LEBANON FORUMTM on December 8-9 under the patronage of the Governor of Banque du Liban, H.E. Mr. Riad Salamé, and the leading support of the European Union and the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture of Beirut and Mount Lebanon. The Forum was held under the title of ‘CSR: The Business of Making a Difference’. COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE Although the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region is one of the fastest growing economies globally, it still finds itself in a perpetual state of uncertainty. The last four years have been a particular strain on its environment, its economies and its people. Middle Eastern entrepreneurs however have not only shown resilience, creativity and innovation throughout this period of transition, but they have proven that, with dedication and forward looking policies, it is possible to not only survive but to create shared value that looks far into the future. Lebanon, in spite of its chronic political and economic instability, is stepping forward in the Middle East by actively promoting and engaging in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). In times of uncertainty, businesses must focus on a wider concept of profit. The private sector has an immensely important role to play in contributing to stability and development in post-conflict areas CSR LEBANON 17 such as Lebanon.

The event was attended by more than 45 leaders from the business community from a wide variety of sectors and business industries, associations, civil society organizations, government entities, international organizations, academia, and the media. COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE CSR LEBANON 19 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE “Congratulations on the very considerable success of the conference. Having organized various events myself, I know just how much hard work has to go into such conferences. You did exceptionally well to get so many speakers from outside Lebanon.

Mr. Georg Kell, Executive Director of the UNGC CSR LEBANON 23 UN Global Compact First Ever Participant Awareness Workshop in Lebanon Towards Launching the UNGC Local Network in Lebanon As a result of the dedication in raising awareness on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) across Lebanon and promoting responsible business over the last 5 years, Mr. Khaled Kassar, Founder & CEO of CSR LEBANON, was officially appointed in early 2013 by the UN Global Compact (UNGC) as the focal point-of-contact in Lebanon to launch the Global Compact Local Network and to promote the work of the Global Compact in a country context. The Global Compact Local Network (GCLN) is a group of UN Global Compact participants within the same country who come together to advance these universal principles at the local level by rooting the GC within different national, cultural and language contexts. In light of this, CSR LEBANON hosted a UNGC participant workshop on September 30th, 2014, in Gefinor Rotana Hotel. It was attended by over 45 participants representing 24 private sector corporations. It aimed at promoting the understanding of the UNGC as a global corporate sustainability learning platform, the various global engagement opportunities available to participants and their alignment with UN goals and issues, and the basic reporting requirements. It also aimed at initiating dialogue between participants on value proposition and creation of a formal Network in Lebanon. Through the workshop, CSR LEBANON launched the first call for Lebanese corporations to join the UN Global Compact Local Network steering committee. It began with welcoming remarks from Global Compact Appointed Contact Person, and Founder and CEO of CSR LEBANON, Mr. Khaled Kassar, along with Relationship Manager-MENA and Europe of UNGC, Ms. COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE Alexandra Tarazi. It was then followed by a “tour de table” where participants introduced themselves and explained in a few words what Corporate Sustainability means to their business. Afterwards, Mrs. Alexandra Tarazi and Ms. Ghada Hassan, Managing Director of CSR LEBANON, introduced the UNGC and engagement opportunities. Then, COP reporting requirements were introduced, and were followed by a dialogue between participants on Value Proposition of Global Compact Network in Lebanon. Finally, it concluded with discussing the steps needed to create a Formal Local Network, and with a Q&A session.

Students were mainly introduced to the concept of CSR, the role of the academic sector in the field, as well as to social entrepreneurship and offered opportunities. CSR LEBANON is also continuously and voluntarily assisting senior education students from various universities in successfully completing their MBA thesis tackling the topic of CSR, dedicating time and providing advice, contacts, resources, and mentorship. CSR LEBANON 29 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE NGO Exhibition: Connecting with Potential Funders Civil society organizations, or non-governmental organizations (NGOs), have a critical role to play in the advancement of universal values around human rights, the environment, labour standards and anticorruption. As global market integration has advanced, their role has gained particular importance in aligning economic activities with social and environmental priorities. NGOs participate vitally in the international system. They contribute valuable information and ideas, advocate effectively for positive change, provide essential operational capacity in emergencies and development efforts, and generally increase the accountability and legitimacy of the global governance process. CSR LEBANON organized a large scale not-for-profit exhibition that brought together NGOs, foundations and social enterprises from across Lebanon to share learning and best practices and engage with the private sector notably banks and funders. The exhibition provided great outreach for CSOs and a platform to present innovative initiatives as well as social and environmental models. The exhibition aimed to initiate efficient connections among stakeholders towards making a real difference, and has been translated into several partnerships with and support to many participating NGOs. CSR LEBANON 31 COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE Responsible Business Quarterly ReviewTM Magazine The first and only specialized CSR Magazine in the Middle East Responsible BusinessTM Quarterly Review is a unique media platform covering the latest CSR and sustainability trends, initiatives, stories, case studies, reports and expert viewpoints.

Areas of coverage Mainly Lebanon, the UAE, Qatar, KSA, Jordan and the United Kingdom Third Year of Responsible Business Your Ultimate Source for Corporate Social Responsibility Knowledge COMMUNICATING THE CSR MESSAGE CSR LEBANON Consulting Services CSR LEBANON provides leading consultancy services in the CSR field, helping corporations do business in a responsible and sustainable way. Our consultancy services include: Setting CSR frameworks, policies and strategies. Developing innovative CSR projects closely related to the company’s core business In-house training Establishing CSR departments and providing the necessary education and training CSR preliminary assessment Encouraging stakeholder engagement, including stakeholder mapping and dialogue planning Developing and communicating CSR reports and providing quality assurance Consultancy services are still at a very early stage due to the weak market readiness to integrate strategic CSR into businesses especially in Lebanon. Due to the instability of the political and economic environment in the country, businesses mostly operate within a short term spectrum and restrain from investing in long-term strategies and programs. CSR LEBANON expects to be more active in the consultancy area within the next five years. This will be mainly due to the fulfillment of our National Program for raising awareness about CSR which includes intensive conferences and educational workshops in collaboration with business schools and aimed at eliminating misconceptions heavily existing in this field. Philanthropic and marketing perceptions of CSR as well as the disengagement of senior leadership are among the main challenges encountered in driving integrated CSR forward. COMMITTING TO THE 10 PRINCIPLES OF THE UNGC COMMITTING TO THE 10 PRINCIPLES The following section outlines our approach to the UNGC and summarizes how we are seeking to support the ten principles. Method CSR LEBANON undertook a self-assessment at the end of the reporting period using the UNGC Self-Assessment Tool to evaluate our progress to date. This was undertaken with input from the editorial and management team. Included in our evaluation was an analysis of our supply chain which is described below. Follow-up actions were identified which will be implemented in 2015 and are listed at the end of this section. Our Supply Chain In assessing our supply chain, we identified the magazine as the main product we produce therefore having the most significant impact. Where other suppliers opt for single purchases such as stationery items, we have long-term extensive relationships with the companies procuring them. Our utility requirements (water, electricity and sewage) are met by the government and/or the management of our building and are largely outside of our control. Production of the magazine is undertaken by Salim Dabbous Printing Company Sarl, a Lebanese printing press. The paper used in the magazine is 100% recycled Oikos (FSC certified) and is sourced by CSR LEBANON directly from Nahhal Paper Co. in Lebanon. Such paper quality is unfortunately not available locally nor through regional suppliers. Following production, distribution is undertaken by Messageries du Moyen-Orient de la Presse et du Livre S.A.L. The magazine is also distributed in other Middle Eastern countries, especially in the United Arab Emirates, again using a distribution agent (Abu Dhabi Media Company – Tawzea, in the UAE). Using distribution agents allows the magazine to be distributed alongside other publications to the same vendors, which reduces the carbon footprint of the magazine as well as the cost. Courier delivery is used for smaller magazine distributions, for example to particular companies, and is undertaken by Aramex (www.aramex.com), a large distribution company in the Middle East with an established track record in CSR and sustainability.

CSR LEBANON 45 Comment: Although this means an opportunity cost in terms of funding, CSR LEBANON’s commitment to transparency led the company to be established as a for-profit company rather than an NGO for two reasons: 1. The generally poor reputation of many national NGOs in the country. 2. Inexistence of a relevant legal status in the Lebanese laws for social enterprises. Follow-Up The action points identified to improve our compliance with the Global Compact for 2015 are as follows: 1. Activate a Health and Safety policy for the workplace 2. Activate a Grievance policy for the workplace 3. Activate a policy on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining 4. Ensure pregnancy and adoption/childcare leave is included in standard employment contract 5. Activate an environmental policy including a strategy to monitor recycling performance in the workplace and advance lobbying among neighboring corporations 6. Develop an arrangement, contractual or otherwise, with major suppliers which will support our compliance with the UNGC ten principles (if applicable in Lebanon) 7. Assess feasibility of monitoring indirect outcomes of awareness-raising activities such as relevant external events and press coverage of CSR /sustainability issues in other news publications 8. Actively promote the adoption of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and the Business for Peace Guidance among Lebanese corporations and work closely with public and private sector authorities in line with our mandate to establish a Local Network.
