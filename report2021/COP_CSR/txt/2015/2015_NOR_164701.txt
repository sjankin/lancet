The fair value of interest rate swaps, as well as combined interest rate and currency swaps, is determined by discounting expected future cash flows to current value through use of observed market interest rates and quoted exchange rates from ECB. The valuation of forward currency exchange contracts is based on quoted exchange rates, from which the forward exchange rate is extrapolated. Estimated present value is subjected to a test of reasonableness against calculations made by the counterparties to the contracts. The interest rate swaps, including the interest portion of combined interest rate and currency swaps, are part of risk management and are accounted for as hedging or at the lowest value principle, depending on whether the requirements for hedge accounting are achieved. The fair value of interest rate swaps designated as hedging (fair value) totalled NOK -6 million at 31 December 2014, while the interest rate swaps at the lowest value principle amounted to NOK -2616 million. Ineffectiveness on fair value hedges in 2014 is recognised as a net loss in the amount of NOK 4 million. The hedges expire in 2015-2022. Note 21 Fees paid to external auditors Deloitte AS is the Statkraft Group’s auditor. The total fees paid for auditing and other services for Statkraft AS (excluding VAT) for 2014 were as follows: NOK thousand 2014 2013 Statutory auditing 2 569 3 188 Other attestation services 855 459 Tax consultancy services 601 713 Other services 1) 3 421 2 004 Total 7 446 6 364 1) The main items in the fees for other services in 2014 are related to quality and control procedures associated with the restructuring of the SN Power Group and the attestation of the sustainability report. 102 STATKRAFT ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 22 Obligations and guarantees Statkraft AS has guarantees and off-balance-sheet obligations totalling NOK 30 005 million.

In 2014 Statkraft AS has transferred its shares in Statkraft Värme AB, Statkraft France SAS, Statkraft Suomi OY, Statkraft Vind AB and SN Power AS to Statkraft Asset Holding AS as capital contribution of NOK 5082 million. In addition the shares in Statkraft Sverige AB have been sold to Statkraft Asset Holding at a price of NOK 11 016 million. The sale has been offset by converting the receivables arisen of NOK 2766 million to equity in Statkraft Asset Holding AS. The remaining receivables of NOK 8250 million were converted to long-term interest-bearing receivables. The interest rate on the receivables is equivalent to a six-month NIBOR + 0.9475%. The value of the shares in Statkraft Asset Holding AS has been reduced with NOK 4963 million, equivalent to the difference between the sales price and the booked value of the shares of Statkraft Sverige AB. The subsidiary Statkraft Treasury Centre SA has reduced its share capital by NOK 8956 million. The amount has been paid to Statkraft AS, and the cost price of the shares in Statkraft Treasury Centre SA has been reduced correspondingly.

STATKRAFT AS 6) Statkraft’s share. The GHG-protocol (from the World Business Council for Sustainabile Development and World Resources Institute) divides greenhouse gas emissions into three types. Type 1 emissions are direct emissions from own activitites. Type 2 emissions are indirect emissions from purchased electricity and district heating, while type 3 emissions are other indirect emissions. All the emissions in the table above are type 1, except for business travel, which falls under type 3. The electricity consumption in Statkraft is guaranteed renewable, resulting in zero type 2 emissions. For 2014, the Group’s type 1 emissions totalled 458 500 tonnes, while the type 3 emissions totalled 2400 tonnes. Corresponding figures for 2014 will be accounted for in the 2015 report.

In brief, this means that we will deliver electricity based on environment-friendly sources responsibility of energy, use sustainable, safe and efficient production methods and report 2014 behave in a responsible and ethical manner in the market. This part of the annual report presents Statkraft’s work, management system and performance in the area of corporate responsibility for 2014, describing challenges and activities within areas such as environment, health and safety, human rights, labour issues and anti-corruption. Corporate Our ambition is to be an industry leader in corporate responsibility. Our plants and projects shall create added value for local communities where we are active, and responsibility we aim to minimise the negative effects of our activities. in Statkraft In order to succeed, we must work in a structured and systematic manner on all issues relating to corporate responsibility and integrate this work in all relevant processes in the company, such as purchasing, acquisitions, project development and plant operation. Our corporate responsibility work is founded on internationally recognised initiatives and standards such as the UN Global Compact and IFC’s Performance Standards on Environmental & Social Sustainability. Statkraft’s fundamental principles for sustainable, ethical and socially responsible behaviour are described in Statkraft’s code of conduct. The code of conduct applies to all companies and employees in the Statkraft Group. Further follow-up of Statkraft’s corporate responsibility is an integrated part of Statkraft’s management system. The management system facilitates a structured and uniform handling of the Group’s corporate responsibility, and the system is regularly evaluated to tailor it to new environments, surroundings and challenges. The construction of the Devoll Hydropower Project in Albania is underway and now has more than 30 employees engaged in environmental and social issues. The picture shows the construction of the Banjë dam with the associated access road. Climate and the environment Statkraft’s environmental ambition is to offer renewable, sustainable and robust climate energy solutions. Close to 99% of the Group’s power and district heating production in 2014 was based on renewable energy sources, and new investments in the Group are now exclusively made within renewable energy. However, renewable power generation also affects the environment. Environmental impact assessments are included in all relevant business activities, and our goal is always to find environmentally responsible solutions. Statkraft established a climate research programme in 2013. The climate programme includes obtaining updated climate forecasts and facilitating unified handling of climate challenges in the Group. Health and safety In Statkraft, health and safety has the highest priority, everywhere and always. The goal is zero work-related injuries. In an effort to reach this goal, the Group works systematically to establish a safety culture based on transparency and a desire to continuously improve as regards planning and executing activities in a safe manner. The Group’s management and follow-up of health and safety are based on the requirements in the OHSAS 18001 standard and international good practice. All accidents and near-misses with a serious damage potential are investigated in a structured manner, with the intention to share experience across the organisation. Security Statkraft is goal-oriented in conditions relating to security, preparedness and crisis management. In Statkraft, the umbrella term ‘security’ encompasses four areas; personnel security, physical security, IT system security and information security. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 124 In 2014, we identified improvement areas and measures which will ensure that Statkraft is on a par with good international practice as regards various security topics. Human rights Statkraft is present in parts of the world where human rights conformance can be difficult, and this is something the Group takes seriously. The UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights have been taken into consideration in Statkraft’s management system and project management tools. Ethics and anti-corruption Statkraft has committed to a high ethical standard and business culture, with zero tolerance for corruption. Statkraft is present in an increasing number of markets exposed to corruption. We therefore greatly emphasise safeguarding a good internal business culture and developing robust anti-corruption measures. A new phase of Statkraft’s anti-corruption programme was approved and initiated in 2014. This program e.g. includes risk assessment and a mapping of needs in each business area. Social impact As a power producer, we have a very long-term perspective, which emphasises the need to develop sustainable solutions. We will succeed best by maintaining an open dialogue with local communities and other stakeholders, and we facilitate such dialogue and interaction in all project development and operations.

Statkraft has group-wide requirements and guidelines for environmental management, which e.g. concern mapping of environmental risk and environmental impact and establishing specific targets and action plans. Statkraft’s follow-up of health and safety is based on the principles in OHSAS 18001. Statkraft has group-wide requirements and guidelines for multiple topics, e.g. investigation of serious incidents, planning and implementing work with a risk potential, as well as incident reporting and follow-up. Corporate responsibility throughout the organisation Corporate responsibility is a line responsibility in Statkraft. This means that each individual unit has an independent responsibility to conduct activities in a responsible manner and that follow-up of topics such as health and safety, anti-corruption, human rights and environmental impact are incorporated in relevant processes, projects and tasks in each individual unit. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 126 At Group level, Statkraft has a dedicated staff to follow up the company’s work and performance as regards corporate responsibility on an overall level. This staff has an advisory role vis-à-vis the business units and ensures that corporate social responsibility is properly discharged in the Group’s management and reporting system. Corporate responsibility in development projects Statkraft has a set process for execution of major development projects, mergers and acquisitions which ensures a unified approach to, e.g., corporate responsibility from an early phase and through stepwise decision processes. The model’s basic principle is that each main decision must be accompanied by documented information on a number of stipulated topics, including corporate responsibility, as part of the decision basis. Emergency preparedness Emergency preparedness plans have been prepared for all operative units in the Group and focus especially on protecting life and health, reducing negative environmental impact and securing the company’s assets. Emergency drills are held regularly on different levels in the organisation so that unexpected, serious situations will be handled in a suitable and efficient manner. Performance follow-up Statkraft’s Group scorecard includes KPIs for the environment, health and safety areas and the scorecard results are regularly reviewed by the Group management and the board. In addition, relevant results and measures within all topics associated with corporate responsibility are discussed in regular Business Reviews (meetings between the President and CEO and the business/staff unit). In its work, the Group Audit considers to what extent the requirements and guidelines for discharging corporate responsibility have been implemented and adhered to in the organisation. This takes place through focused audits and as part of more wide-ranging efforts. In 2014, no serious noncompliances were registered in connection with corporate responsibility. Statkraft has established a Group-wide system for registration and follow-up of non-compliances and potential improvements. The system facilitates structured handling of measures and deadlines, analysis of causal links and learning across the organisation. Supplier follow-up Statkraft sets clear requirements for all suppliers and follows up risk topics throughout the procurement process. Statkraft’s supplier code of conduct Statkraft has developed a version of Statkraft’s code of conduct which is especially aimed at Group’s suppliers. This document describes the Group’s requirements for suppliers as regards protection of the environment, human rights, labour rights and labour standards, health and safety and anti-corruption. Statkraft’s suppliers are informed of our code of conduct and other relevant requirements during the procurement processes and contract signing. Follow-up of suppliers Statkraft has implemented a risk-based tool that identifies and follows up risk topics throughout the procurement process. This tool makes it possible to identify risk areas such as corruption, safety issues or child labour at an early stage, and the follow-up is focused on high-risk areas. In addition Statkraft will conduct announced visits and unannounced inspections linked to particularly important and vulnerable deliveries. Such visits and audits may comprise multiple units in the supplier chain. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 127 Stakeholder dialogue Statkraft wants to communicate in an open and active manner with everyone affected by our activities. Important partners in this dialogue include the owner, elected officials on all levels, employees, local populations, customers, suppliers, local and regional authorities, voluntary organisations and the media. Dialogue with local communities and host municipalities Statkraft emphasises a direct and predictable dialogue with all host municipalities. In Norway, annual meetings are held with all host municipalities, where Statkraft provides information about ongoing and coming activities, opening up for discussion about topics important for the individual municipality. It is particularly important to provide information and ensure transparency in the early stages of development projects. In line with national licensing processes and international guidelines, Statkraft holds open meetings and hearings, providing information about development plans and topics relevant for those affected by the project. Such topics may include expropriation, future job opportunities and environmental impacts resulting from the project. Dialogue with policymakers and voluntary organisations Statkraft participates in several national and international forums for the purpose of discussing and influencing energy policy. These forums include Energy Norway, Eurelectric, Word Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the International Hydropower Association (IHA). Statkraft also cooperates with voluntary organisations and has entered into cooperation agreements with the environmental organisations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, Bellona and WWF, in addition to a conference partnership with Zero. Competence and training Good corporate responsibility expertise among managers and employees is an important factor for Statkraft to achieve its goals. Relevant corporate responsibility topics have been incorporated in training programmes for both new employees and managers. Introductions are given, both as regards overall requirements and individual responsibilities, and more focused training in safety requirements in the workplace, anti-corruption work and environmental and social impact as a result of Statkraft’s activities. The projects sets a particular focus on health and safety training, and Statkraft has developed web-based courses that are available, and in some cases mandatory, for both employees and contractors. Efforts are particularly directed towards raising expertise in and understanding of anticorruption work throughout the organisation. Anti-corruption manuals and e-learning tools are available and tailored dilemma training sessions are held when needed. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 128 Statkraft’s Corporate Statkraft annually reports the most important challenges facing the Group, as well as corporate responsibility measures and performance. Responsibility reporting The report is based on GRI’s recommendations Statkraft’s corporate social responsibility reporting is based on the recommendations of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). GRI’s recommendations include both indicators for several topic areas, as well as ten reporting principles which e.g. concern identifying important topics and implementing the actual reporting process. Statkraft systematically gathers information in order to present an annual status and most important results for areas such as climate and the environment, health and safety, security, anti-corruption work and follow-up of human rights. All relevant business units report on both quantitative and qualitative indicators. We believe these indicators capture the most important aspects as regards corporate responsibility in the Group, while also taking into account reporting requirements and expectations from our stakeholders. Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting describes the most important topics and results on the Group level. More information on special topics and individual projects can be found on Statkraft’s website. Verification of corporate responsibility information Statkraft’s external auditor verifies the Group’s corporate responsibility reporting. The auditor’s work is based on the ISAE 3000 assurance standard, and the conclusion for the work is set out in the auditor’s statement. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 129 Environmental Statkraft offers renewable and sustainable energy solutions, which is how we help meet one of the greatest challenges of our day: global warming. impact At the same time, all power production is associated with different forms of interventions in nature. Systematic environmental management in line with good international practice will minimise and compensate for the negative environmental impact of the Group’s activities. Statkraft offers renewable Statkraft is Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy, and in 2014, over 99% of the company’s power production was based on renewable energy sources. and sustainable energy solutions Statkraft’s environmental ambition states that we will support a global transition towards a low-carbon economy by offering renewable and sustainable energy solutions. In addition, all activities shall be planned and implemented in line with good international practice. Environment-friendly portfolio Development and operation of hydropower plants facilitate multiple uses of watercourses and regulation plants, Examples of such use include irrigation, water supply, transport and recreation. In addition, flood control using reservoirs is an important safety measure in many areas. Such use of our installations will in all probability be even more important in the future when we face the consequences of the climate changes. Wind power is a renewable technology with few environmental effects and almost no emissions. The tendency is towards larger turbines, higher towers and fewer turbines in each wind farm. This is considered to be a positive development as regards environmental effects. Power generation and district heating (Statkraft’s share) The Group’s non-renewable energy production includes gas-fired power and a small part of the TWh 70 district heating production. 60 50 Gas power is by many considered a transitional technology. The technology generates carbon 40 emissions, but the emissions are substantially lower than for coal-based power plants. 30 Statkraft’s gas power plants in Germany operate only as peak load producers and, like 20 hydropower, therefore contribute to flexibility in the European energy markets. Knapsack I and 10 II are two of Europe’s most modern and efficient gas-fired power plants, but due to high gas 0 prices, low carbon prices and large growth in inflexible power production (solar and wind power), 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Statkraft’s gas power production has been significantly reduced in recent years. Hydropower Wind power Gas power District heating Environmental Environmental management is an integrated part of Statkraft’s management system and covers all business units and activities. The environmental management in management system shall ensure a systematic approach to the environmental Statkraft work, with key activities being identification of environmental risk, establishment of goals and action plans, implementation of measures and follow-up of results. Statkraft’s environmental management system has been designed in accordance with ISO 14001:2004. Statkraft’s contractors are also subject to the Group’s environmental requirements, and these are therefore incorporated in all contracts where relevant. The Group’s development projects are planned and implemented in line with good international practice and the work is based on the IFCs Performance Standards on Environmental & Social Sustainability. In accordance with these standards, Statkraft sets requirements relating to comprehensive impact analyses and environmental follow-up plans which are updated throughout the project process. These documents are published on the projects’ websites and thereby made available to external stakeholders. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 130 External assessment of environmental performance Statkraft’s environment KPI on the Group’s score card has, since 2012, consisted of an environmental assessment prepared by an external rating agency (oekom research AG). The assessment is based on a broad set of criteria covering environmental management, power production and energy efficiency, and provides an understanding of how the world around us rates our efforts and in which areas we should aim to improve. The use of a rating agency also makes it possible to compare with other companies, both in our own and other industries. The 2014 assessment resulted in the rating B, which corresponds to good international practice in the oekom Corporate Rating. IHA’s Sustainability Assessment Protocol The International Hydropower Association (IHA) has developed a tool for considering sustainability in hydropower projects (IHA Sustainability Assessment Protocol). The most recent version of the protocol was launched in 2010. Statkraft has participated actively in the testing of the sustainability protocol. In 2012, a sustainability assessment was made of Jostedal power plant in accordance with the protocol’s requirements. This assessment has been approved as an official assessment and published on IHA’s website. The protocol has also been tested in a development project in Albania, Devoll Hydropower Project, where a preliminary assessment has been made, based on the requirements and scope of the protocol. Cooperation agreements Statkraft has entered into strategic partnership agreements with the three environmental organisations Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, Bellona and WWF. The overall purpose of the agreements is to benefit from each other’s expertise and develop the best energy solutions. Environmental activities Statkraft’s core business areas are hydropower and wind power. Neither of these technologies generates significant emissions or discharges, but both cause in Statkraft interventions in ecosystems and the landscape. The objective is always to make interventions as gentle as possible, and adapt them to local conditions. Statkraft is involved in many activities which will reduce the environmental impact of our activities. Hydropower and the environment Rivers and river systems are important, both as elements of the landscape and as ecosystems. Watercourses play an important role in both droughts and floods, and also have a multi-purpose value for people in the form of recreation, transport and as water supply to households, industry and agriculture. The development and operation of hydropower plants must therefore take into account many interests. Statkraft’s goal in all activities is to achieve sustainable water management, and our environmental efforts in relation to river systems and fish are comprehensive. Examples Planting of eyed eggs take place by releasing salmon eyed of such efforts include environmentally adapted operation of the power plants, laying down eggs into boxes filled with fist-sized rocks. suitable spawning and smolt growth substrate, fish restocking, egg planting, construction of fish ladders and improvement of thresholds and migration barriers. The overall objective for this work is to achieve sustainable and self-recruiting fish populations. Many of these measures are imposed by licence, but Statkraft also implements voluntary measures, often in close cooperation with landowners and local organisations. Statkraft operates two out of three Norwegian gene banks for salmon, nine fish cultivation facilities and is a large producer of stocking fish and fish eggs in Norway and Sweden. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 131 We carry out comprehensive studies of affected river systems. In Norway, the main focus is on salmon and trout, while Sweden and Germany have seen an increasing focus on conserving eel populations. Eel are very vulnerable to turbine injuries when migrating from regulated rivers, and Statkraft is involved in several projects and has implemented various solutions to meet this challenge. In Sweden, eel are now moved downstream of power plants manually, while in Germany a system has been developed to control turbines and stop them when the eel migrate. In Norway, the licence terms for many power plants are now under revision, aiming to update the environmental terms to current standards. Selbusjøen received renewed licence terms in 2014, whereas reviews are ongoing in the Tokke, Vinje, Røssåga, Surna/Trollheim, Altavatn, In Germany, Statkraft has installed a turbine control systems to increase survival rates for migrating silver eel. Statkraft Aura, Bævra and Rana river systems. has eight run-of-river power plants in the Weser River and all are integrated in the turbine control system. The system satisfied the requirements both from the EU’s Eel Regulation The EU’s Water Framework Directive is a set of regulations developed to ensure comprehensive (2007) and Water Framework Directive (2000). The system management of European water resources based on the ecosystems. In Norway, these is based on a warning system for migrating eel, MIGROMAT, developed by the Institute for Applied Ecology (IFOE). After regulations have been incorporated into the Framework for water management (the Water three seasons of testing the turbine control system, Statkraft Regulations). Statkraft is working closely with the authorities to implement the Water Regulations can point to good results. and to find sound environmental solutions in the river systems where we have activities. In order to be better prepared for the challenges resulting from the term reviews and implementation of the Water Framework Directive, Statkraft has performed a comprehensive survey our greatest environmental challenges. The survey will form the basis for further research and action plans. The survey showed that the most important environmental challenges going forward will be in relation to minimum water flow and fragmentation of habitats, biological diversity and sedimentation. Wind power and the environment Both onshore and offshore, Statkraft’s wind power developments are facing environmental challenges. Birds are a recurring topic, both due to the risk of birds colliding with the turbines, and because wind farms can drive certain bird species away from their natural habitats or form barriers to important migration routes. Establishing wind farms with the associated infrastructure can influence living conditions for plants and animals, particularly in the construction phase. It is therefore important to find solutions that are well adapted to the individual location, and to avoid construction activity The wind farm on Smøla has led to increased mortality for in particularly vulnerable periods. Noise and landscape aesthetics are also topics that are white-tailed eagles, and only a few eagle couples now breed inside the wind farm. However, this has not resulted in a carefully considered when establishing new wind farms. noticeable decline in the number of white-tailed eagles in the area. Photo: Bjørn Iuell Offshore, the impact on the marine environment is a particularly challenging topic, not least as there is currently little knowledge about the consequences for sea mammals, fish and benthic fauna. There are a lot of indications that negative effects mainly in relate to the construction phase, and that offshore wind farms may also benefit the environment in the longer term. A wind farm resting on the seabed can e.g. provide shelter for fish fry and create good growth areas for fish and other organisms. Since 2005, Statkraft has been involved in R&D activities at the Smøla wind farm to look into how white-tailed eagles and the local variety of willow ptarmigan are affected by the wind farm, and specifically what can be done to avoid collisions between birds and turbines. The wind farm on Smøla has led to increased mortality for white-tailed eagles, and only a few eagle couples now breed inside the wind farm. However, this has not resulted in a noticeable decline in the In 2013, trials started at Smøla wind farm to make the wind turbines more visible to birds through use of lights or contrast number of white-tailed eagles in the area. paint. The goal is to reduce the risk of bird collisions. The trials are a collaboration with Statoil, Vattenfall, Trønder EnergiKraft, NVE, the Research Council of Norway and Energy In 2014, a doctotal thesis was presented which concluded that although Statkraft’s activities Norway, and are carried out by the Norwegian Institute for in Smøla have had a effect on the white-tailed eagles reproductive success whitin and in close Nature Research. Photo: Espen Lie Dahl proximity to the wind farm, the overall population of white-tailed eagles in the area is still robust and growing. Population studies of white-tailed eagles in the Smøla area indicate that most of the couples which previously bred inside the wind farm area have now found new territories away from the wind farm. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 132 The research that Statkraft and several partner organisations are conducting in Smøla includes using contrast paint and UV-light on the turbines and rotor blades to increase visibility and thereby reducing the risk of collisions between the birds and the turbines. This is the only project in the world where scientific tests of this kind has been performed in full scale. The results of the project are expected in 2016. The research on birds and wind power in Smøla has been ongoing for nearly ten years, resulting in a significant amount of new knowledge about the interaction between eagles and wind power. The knowledge that the research has generated is useful, not only to Statkraft, but also for other operators of onand offshore windpower. In connection with the planning and construction of offshore Other technologies and the environment wind farms, considerable resources have been spent to look into possible environmental effects on fish, marine birds and Statkraft is also involved in activities using other technologies, primarily production of gas marine mammals, such as seals and porpoises. power (Germany), production of biopower (Germany), production of district heating (Norway and Photo: Bjørn Iuell Sweden), grid distribution (Norway) and some gas distribution (Norway through Skagerak Energi). Gas power results in carbon and NOx emissions, and discharge of cooling water. NOx can contribute to overfertilisation, while discharge of cooling water can impact biodiversity in nearby river systems. Statkraft’s gas power plants are some of Europe’s most modern power plants, with high efficiency, good treatment facilities and low emission and discharge risk. They are located in industrial areas where the additional impact from our plants has little environmental impact. OVERVIEW OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN STATKRAFT’S GAS POWER PLANTS Norway: Kårstø 58-59% Germany: Herdecke 59% Knapsack I 58% Knapsack II 59% Emden 53% Robert Frank 43% The operation of district heating plants and biopower plants generates NOx emissions, and district heating plants also emit SOx, which can contribute to acidification of river systems. The amount of SOx emitted varies with the energy source used. Emission and discharge figures are carefully followed up to ensure that the plants comply with their licences. For district heating plants that use waste as fuel, there may also be challenges in the form of odours, and the activity generates large volumes of hazardous waste. Environmental challenges in connection with grid activities are primarily related to radiation from power lines and landscape impact, which in turn can change visual qualities and the opportunities for recreational activities in the area. For gas distribution, the risk lies primarily in gas leakages. This distribution is subject to detailed guidelines and controls covering environmental, health and safety risks. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 133 Statkraft and the climate Statkraft offers clean and sustainable energy solutions and in this manner supports a global transition to a low-carbon economy. Climate change and global warming are among the greatest challenges of our day, and the UN climate panel’s most recent report from 2013 confirm that the global climate changes are anthropogenic. The IPCC has previously pointed out that increased use of renewable energy may be the single most important measure against climate change. Statkraft’s Climate Advisory Panel Statkraft’s activities have a very long perspective and climate change will influence both operations and business opportunities significantly, e.g. through influencing energy sources (precipitation, run-off and wind) and through changes in the political framework. In order to meet the challenges caused by climate change, Statkraft has established an internal, cross-disciplinary workgroup, Statkraft’s Climate Advisory Panel (CAP). The Climate Advisory Panel’s main mission is to coordinate the Group’s efforts in relation to climate issues, and raise the Group’s understanding of climate issues. The picture shows the extent of the flooding in Rena in Norway on 23 May 2013. Based on information from international processes and key climate issue forums, as well as internal analyses of the climate situation, Statkraft has chosen a specific climate scenario as a starting point for the Group’s long-term strategy work. In some locations, climate change will result in more water, in other locations less. Statkraft can contribute to dampening the effects of climate change by using its own installations for e.g. flood control. In dry countries, reservoirs can also be used for irrigation and water supply. Corporate Management adapted a climate policy statement in 2014 which states that Statkraft’s most important contribution in relation to climate change is contributing to the transition towards a low-carbon society and the development of a climate resilient economy. Statkraft’s most important contribution is to – in a sustainable manner – produce renewable and flexible energy which can facilitate more variable energy sources (solar and wind). Statkraft’s climate assessments are to be based on research, in-depth analysis and scientific evidence. Central to this is the IPCC assessments and the UN climate convention. Statkraft’s climate programme Statkraft’s assessments and adaptations in relation to climate changes shall be based on international expertise and recognised research results. On this background, Statkraft has established a research programme whichfocuses on the development of business-specific climate knowledge and will contribute to adapt the global climate models to planning and operation. The climate programme works closely with Statkraft’s Climate Advisory Panel and has two main objectives: ➔➔ understanding the physical impact of climate change and recommend possible adaptations ➔➔ contributing to development of scientific methods which can be used to consider how climate change will affect us commercially The program will run over several years and has a budget of NOK 10 million per year. Climate Round Table In 2014, Statkraft hosted the second Climate Round Table with selected participants from commerce and industry, key international climate researchers and – advisors and NGOs. This year’s Round Table addressed topics related to drivers of economic growth and the role of business in the transition towards a low-carbon society. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 134 Greenhouse gas emissions Statkraft’s emissions of greenhouse gases Tonnes CO2 equivalents 2 000 000 Most of Statkraft’s portfolio is more or less emission-free hydropower and wind power production, and the Group’s emissions of greenhouse gases are therefore relatively low. 1 500 000 The majority of the Group’s total emissions of greenhouse gases comes from the gas power plants in Germany. For Statkraft’s consolidated power production emissions of CO2 equivalents 1 000 000 amounted to 383 700 million tonnes, corresponding to a relative emission of CO2 equivalents 500 000 of 8 kg/MWh in 2013. Emission figures for 2014 will be reported in next year’s report. 0 The Group buys ordinary carbon quotas in the international carbon quota market to compensate 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 for greenhouse gas emissions from that part of the business that is not subject to mandatory Gas power Fuel consumption District heating plants Business travel quota schemes. This applies to emissions related to fuel consumption, business travel and any Accidental emissions of SF5 and halon accidental emissions of the greenhouse gases halon and SF6. In 2014, the emissions from these sources amounted to 40 960 tonnes of CO2 equivalents. Emission quota and green energy trading Statkraft actively sells certified electricity from renewable sources to distribution companies that want to or are required to supply their customers with green electricity. Statkraft sources and markets these certificates under Europe-wide schemes as well as national schemes in the UK, Italy, Poland and in Norway/Sweden. Statkraft is also engaged in trading emissions worldwide. We actively trade the major carbon currencies and deal with compliance companies looking to satisfy their obligations under the European Emission Trading System (EU ETS). With new carbon markets developing worldwide, we increase focus on our international activities. Consumption, emissions, Statkraft’s activities do not cause waste production, emissions or discharges to any significant degree. Data for the Group’s energy consumption, emissions discharges and waste and discharges, waste volumes and environmental incidents are reported in the corporate responsibility statement. Electricity consumption In 2014, electricity consumption in Statkraft was 899 GWh, of which 74% was used for pumped-storage hydropower. Electricity use in the Group is certified as renewable in accordance with RECS. A major energy efficiency project has been ongoing at Statkraft’s Norwegian hydropower plants since 2010. The purpose of the project is to reduce internal energy consumption, primarily through installation of control systems for pumps, ventilation, heating and lights. The project is now in the final phase, and the preliminary results from the participating hydropower plants indicate a reduction in electricity consumption of between 33 and 38%. A different energy efficiency measure has been implemented in Germany. During the construction of Knapsack II, provisions were made for transfer of steam from Knapsack I. Normally, electric boilers are used when starting up gas power plants, but with the transfer of steam between the two plants, the use of electric boilers can be reduced substantially. Local pollution Statkraft faces few challenges as regards local pollution. The greatest environmental risk is associated with oil spills from vehicles, construction equipment and production equipment. New routines have been introduced for registration of equipment containing oil, and use of bio oils and the switch to equipment with water-lubricated bearings also help reduce the risk of oil spills. There were no oil spills with permanent damage to the external environment in 2014. There can be local challenges associated with noise and dust in connection with transport and construction, and we have also experienced challenges with odours and ash emissions from the district heating plants. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 135 Statkraft’s new gas power plant in Germany, Knapsack II, is built in an area previously polluted by chemical industry. In connection with the development, a rehabilitation programme for polluted ground has been established in cooperation with the authorities and other expertise. The programme will address environmental, health and safety risks. Waste handling Statkraft’s operations generated about 60 400 tonnes of hazardous waste in 2014. More than 97 per cent of this was residual products from the biomass plant in Germany and the district heating plant in Trondheim, which mainly uses waste as energy source. In addition, 7 700 tonnes of other waste was generated. Statkraft goal is to separate as much as possible of the generated waste at source, and 74% of the waste (hazardous waste not included) was source separated in 2014. Environmental incidents Environmental incidents are recorded and followed up systematically throughout the Group and reported regularly to the management and board of directors. No serious environmental incidents have been registered since 2008. In 2014, 159 minor environmental incidents with little or no impact on the environment were reported. Most of them concerned short-term breaches of the river management regulations for hydropower plants and minor oil spills. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 136 Health and safety Safety is our top priority in Statkraft and our objective is zero injuries for both our own employees, contractor personnel, suppliers, partners and third parties. The desired safety culture shall permeate the entire organisation and be characterised by transparency and a desire to learn both from our own mistakes and from successful improvement measures. Accidents Unfortunately, there were two fatal work-related accidents in 2014 in connection with Statkraft’s activities. Both accidents took place in development projects, one in Albania and one in Panama. In total, 106 lost-time injuries and 170 injuries overall were recorded among the Group’s employees and contractors in 2014. This corresponds to an injury frequency rate (TRI) of 5.5 and lost time injury rate (LTI) of 3.4. Fatalities Fatal accidents Number 10 A total of four fatalities occurred in two work-related fatal accidents in Statkraft in 2014. 9 8 7 One of the accidents took place in the Devoll project in Albania, which is wholly owned by 6 Statkraft. In this accident, there were three fatalities following a rockslide in the vicinity of 5 Moglice in the Devoll valley. The fatalities were employees in a rockfall protection company that 4 3 was securing the rock face for one of Statkraft’s road contractors. The main conclusion from 2 the investigation is that challenging weather and precipitation conditions had substantially 1 0 increased the risk of a slide, and that this was not sufficiently considered when executing the 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 work. The practice for executing this type of work has been changed after the accident. Contractors, subsidiaries Contractors, associates Third parties, subsidiaries Third parties, associates Employees, subsidiaries The other accident took place in the Bajo Frio project in Panama, where Statkraft has an indirect ownership interest of 25%. In this accident, a barrel came loose from a mobile crane and struck multiple people who were under the crane. There was one fatality and one serious injury. The accident investigation uncovered multiple breaches of the project’s requirements and guidelines and several improvement measures have been implemented.

Accidental TRI emissions of SF5 and halon – contractors The trend as regards the injury frequency rate is in the right direction, but there is still room for improvement toward reaching the goal of zero injuries. Especially in larger development projects, there is a strong focus on establishing a good safety culture. The tools used to achieve this are clear requirements for expertise throughout all projects and close follow-up of safety in the workplace. Hazardous conditions and near misses All accidents, near-misses and unsafe conditions are registered in a joint follow-up and analysis tool. More than 10 000 incidents were registered in 2014. Both near-misses and unsafe conditions are followed up in the same manner as actual accident situations, and conditions which recur or could have had serious consequences are subjected to analysis and follow-up in order to identify the chain of causation. This allows us to elevate expertise concerning work situations with a risk potential, which makes us better equipped for good planning and preventive measures that can reduce the risk of accidents. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 137 Preventitive health Follow-up of health and safety is a line responsibility in Statkraft. This means that each unit has an independent responsibility for efforts and follow-up relating to and saftey work the health and safety performance. Clear requirements and guidelines, health and safety awareness in all situations and close follow-up in both operating and project activities are important elements of the effort to achieve good health and safety performance. Statkraft’s safety culture Statkraft’s goal is zero work-related injuries. This is a logical, yet ambitious goal. In order to reach this goal, Statkraft is working systematically to establish a safety culture based on transparency and a desire to learn, both from own mistakes and from good planning and successful improvement measures. The identification and assessment of safety risks before all activities is a fundamental requirement, and work must be planned to ensure safe execution. All accidents, near-misses and hazardous conditions are therefore recorded and followed up in a consistent and structured manner, and sharing of lessons learned and experiences across the organisation is encouraged. Statkraft’s management and follow-up of health and safety work are based on the requirements in the OHSAS 18001 standard and international good practice, and the same requirements apply in all activities. The injury frequency for our own employees and contractors in both regular operations and projects is included as an indicator in the Group’s score card, which is followed up monthly by the Group management and Statkraft’s board of directors. Health and safety expertise All Statkraft employees are given training in safety risk and working environment, adapted to their individual working situation. Health and safety is part of the introduction programme for new employees, as well as the Group’s management programmes. In addition, there is a basic, web-based course on Statkraft’s safety culture and work, which is available to all employees. There is furthermore a more extensive web-based health and safety course aimed at operative operation and project activities which e.g. reviews the identification of safety hazards, working at heights, handling mobile installations, traffic safety, electrical installations, planning and Example from Statkraft’s web-based health and safety course. coordination of safety work and emergency preparedness work. Statkraft’s project manager programme has a module which covers planning and coordination of health and safety work. This is a more extensive programme which consists of both classroom instruction and web-based training. Training is also given in specific health and safety topics as required. Examples of such topics include investigation of serious incidents, operation of electrical installations and first aid courses. Networks and industry associations Statkraft is a member of several national and international networks and industry associations which follow up health and safety issues in different ways. These are important arenas where people can exchange experiences and continuously acquire updated knowledge and information about health and safety in the energy industry. Examples of such networks and associations include: ➔➔ Energy Norway: Energy Norway is an industry association representing about 270 Norwegian companies engaged in generation, distribution and trading of electricity. Energy Norway works actively to improve the health and safety work in the Norwegian energy industry. ➔➔ British Wind Energy Association (BWEA): BWEA is the leading industry association for wind power in the UK and works to develop industry guidelines for health and safety. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 138 ➔➔ International Hydropower Association (IHA): IHA is an international organisation promoting the role of hydropower in establishing sustainable energy solutions. IHA has developed the IHA Sustainability Guidelines, which is a framework to monitor the degree of sustainability for hydropower plants, including the health and safety aspect. ➔➔ G9 Offshore Wind Health and Safety Association: Statkraft is one of nine companies which established G9 in 2012 and which will promote health and safety for offshore wind power. Statkraft is a board member and also participates actively in the working groups Working at Heights, Marine Operations and Lifting Operations. ➔➔ National Safety Council of India (through SN Power): The National Safety Council has been established by the Indian government with a mission to promote health and safety work at the national level in India. Focus on health and safety Statkraft works in a goal-oriented manner to clarify requirements and maintain close follow-up of health and safety work. In the following we will present a few examples of such follow-up and improvement activities in 2014. ➔➔ The Cetin HSE Academy was established in 2014 in connection with the Cetin development project in Turkey. The Cetin HSE Academy is a facility where everyone scheduled to work in the project will be provided with safety training in line with their area of responsibility. One important purpose of this facility is to raise awareness concerning health and safety work. Training will also be provided to better handle situations with a risk potential. There will be an opportunity to train for a long list of risk activities, such as working at heights, blasting work, scaffolding work, work on live electrical installations and tunnel work. This facility is a milestone as regards preventive safety work. ➔➔ An extensive improvement program, Optimum, is under way in the Power Generation business area. This program has addressed health and safety as one of several important improvement areas. Continuous learning, simplification and cooperation across technical disciplines, as well as increased focus on energy control and improved control over highrisk activities, are some of the measures identified for improving results and securing a sustainable corporate culture within these areas.

Statkraft is a board member and also chairs the working group that is developing guidelines for working at heights in such projects. Statkraft is also participating actively in working groups for marine operations and lifting operations. “GP Good Practice Guidelines” were published in December 2014. Work of this nature is important in order to reduce risk at heights as much as possible, and to incorporate new expertise in further project development. Investigation of serious incidents All accidents, near-misses and unsafe conditions are registered in a group-wide follow-up and analysis tool. This tool allows us to analyse and efficiently follow up incidents. Serious incidents with, or with a potential for, serious consequences are investigated according to a fixed procedure in order to fully understand the course of events. The investigation is summarised in a report which describes the detailed course of events, causal links and implemented short and long-term measures. The investigation report is followed up by the responsible unit, as well as the relevant boards. A brief version of the investigation report is made available throughout the organisation to enable us to learn from mistakes and avoid recurrences. Absence due to illness Absence due to illness in Statkraft has been stable, and was 2.8% 2014, which is within the goal of an absence due to illness rate lower than 3.5%. All Norwegian companies in the Group have entered into Inclusive Workplace (IA) agreements, with active follow-up of absence and adaptation of the work as needed by the employee. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 139 Security Statkraft works systematically in relation to security and emergency preparedness and aims to comply with international best practice. The handling of security issues is based on recognised principles. Statkraft takes a comprehensive approach to security topics, and in 2014 we identified improvement areas and measures which will ensure secure that Statkraft is on a par with good international practice. In Statkraft, the area of security encompasses personnel security, physical security, IT system security and information security. In a critical situation, these areas will be handled together by a coordinating staff function, while the daily follow-up is handled in the line. The Group’s guidelines for securing personnel and assets are based on national guidelines and internationally recognised principles: ➔➔ Guidelines and recommendations from the Norwegian National Security Authority, the Police and Norwegian Armed Forces ➔➔ The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights ➔➔ The UN Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials ➔➔ The UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials Risk assessment The security situation, as regards e.g. political instability, terrorism, sabotage and organised crime, is assessed continually in all areas where Statkraft has a presence. Such assessments are made both at the corporate level and by the individual unit. Measures will be considered upon changes in the security situation, e.g. reinforced security routines and travel restrictions. Demonstration against hydropower project in India. Emergency preparedness All business units, country offices and operative units in Statkraft have established emergency preparedness plans in order to handle emergencies in a structured and systematic manner. In addition, there is an overall Group emergency preparedness plan describing procedures for notification, interaction, information sharing and communication in a crisis. The emergency preparedness plans are regularly revised, and regular drills are held on small and large scales. Securing Statkraft’s assets All of Statkraft’s buildings, plants and infrastructure are secured against unauthorised access. The purpose of this is to secure the Group’s assets against external threats and vandalism, but also to protect third parties against any safety risks in connection with the Group’s installations.

Business development, long-term expertise building and focused R&D programmes are all key aspects of this work. R&D climate programme established Through targeted R&D programmes, we want to strengthen our competitive advantage and develop new business models. Multi-year R&D programmes have been established, closely linked to the Group’s strategic focus areas, hydropower, wind power and bio-energy. Statkraft has also established a dedicated climate R&D programme that will e.g. focus on developing business-specific climate knowledge and contributing toward ensuring that the global climate models are adapted to planning and operations. Examples of innovation projects in 2014: ➔➔ Bio-energy: Liquid biofuel is a research activity addressing the business opportunities in the bio-energy market. This project is assessing the possibility of producing liquid fuel for road transport based on forest resources. ➔➔ R&D Climate: Climate change has already led to increased temperatures and altered precipitation levels. This trend will continue to affect hydrological conditions where Statkraft has development interests. The effect of climate change on future access to water is therefore the topic of multiple research projects in Statkraft. There are vast differences from region to region and a good analysis requires models both for climate and hydrology, in The Bucket Foundation is lowered into the sea at Doggerbank addition to good basic data. ➔➔ Wind power: In 2014, Statkraft was granted a license to install a test turbine for offshore wind on Smøla. This turbine will be used to test, qualify and harvest operational experience that may be relevant in future offshore wind power projects and will have an installed capacity of up to 8 megawatts (MW). Annual production from the turbine is calculated at just above 20 GWh. The turbine will be included in the ongoing study and research work linked to birds and wind power that is under way at the existing wind farm on Smøla. Stakeholder engagement Many people, organisations and local communities are directly or indirectly affected by Statkraft’s activities. We shall show respect for the local communities, societies and cultures in which we are present in all dialogue with stakeholders. We want to build trust in our company by engaging in open dialogue with stakeholders. Active and long term involvement As a power producer with long term perspectives, it is in the interest of both Statkraft and our stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions. Success in this regard can best be achieved in open dialogue and interaction with those affected by the company’s activities. Important partners in this dialogue include the Owner, elected officials, villages physically affected by a projects presence, employees, customers, suppliers, local and regional authorities, voluntary organisations and the media. Disclosure of relevant project information helps affected communities understand the risks, impacts and opportunities of the project. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 143 Collaboration with NGOs Many people, organisations and local communities are directly or indirectly affected by Statkraft’s activities.

We want to build trust in our company by engaging in open dialogue with stakeholders. Statkraft entered into formal partnership agreements with WWF Norway, Bellona, the Norwegian Society for the Preservation of Nature and the Norwegian Red Cross in 2012. Statkraft also has a conference partnership with Zero. Partnership with WWF in Turkey and Albania Through the main partnership agreement with WWF Norway, Statkraft has continued its collaboration with WWF locally in Turkey and with WWF International in Albania. The purpose of this collaboration is to further develop hydropower as a sustainable renewable energy source. The project “sustainable hydropower production in Turkey” aims to increase knowledge about different methods of inducing an environmentally tailored rate of water flow in regulated river systems. This project also aims to promote this knowledge vis-à-vis various stakeholders in Turkey and partake in future discussions concerning new guidelines for environmentally tailored rates of water flow in Turkey. The project was established in 2013 and continued in 2014. In Albania, Statkraft collaborates with WWF International and WWF Norway in testing the IHA’s (International Hydropower Association’s) Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol. The protocol was tested in 2013. In 2014, a dialogue process was conducted in order to facilitate continuation of the project. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 144 Corporate As a power producer Statkraft is involved in several development projects in different parts of the world. Most of these are in emerging markets, but responsibility in there are also substantial developments in Northern Europe for different development projects technologies. In the following sections we present examples of how we have addressed corporate responsibility in 2014. Devoll Hydropower Project The Devoll Hydropower Project (Devoll HPP) in Albania consists of a cascade of hydropower plants along the Devoll River with a planned installed capacity of 256 – Hydropower in Albania MW. Production is estimated at 729 GWh/year. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 256 MW ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction Corporate responsibility challenges and measures Security has, from the very beginning, figured prominently in the Devoll-project. The size of the project, with over 2000 people working in the construction phase whereof many unskilled as well as challenging terrain, means that the security risks are numerous and encompassed a variety of disciplines. Strict security requirements have therefore been put in place, and solid security expertise is emphasized on all levels. Everyone involved in the project is given both general and, if required, more targeted safety training. Safety inspections are conducted regularly. Unfortunately there was nevertheless a fatal accident in 2014. Three people were killed when they were hit by a landslide whilst securing the access road to one of the units. Village consultation in Dushk. The Devoll HPP currently has a team of approximately 30 on-site employees and consultants involved in managing environment and social affairs. The project prepared an Environmental and Social Management Plan in 2013 comprising all environmental and social mitigation measures and providing a general framework for resettlement, livelihood restoration, social development and environmental management as well as monitoring indicators. This plan is implemented through detailed Annual Implementation Plans. The main social impacts relate to the loss of agricultural and horticultural land, and the loss of livelihood associated with this impact, and roads. The project carried out a range of initiatives in 2014 to compensate for these anticipated losses. The overall goal is to mitigate ahead of impacts, pre-empting any economic difficulties that could be faced by the local population at the time of inundation. The main initiative is the implementation of the Livelihood Support and Development Program. Improved systems for waste management is a central part of the on-going work. The program provides various agricultural and livelihood inputs and technical assistance to households directly affected by the project. The focus is on providing in-kind support and technical assistance, for example, in the form of veterinarian services, fruit pruning, etc. In addition to the support provided for each household directly impacted by the project, village level solutions were also implemented based on community requests for two of the villages affected by Banjë HPP. The village of Shushice e Vogel has been supported with the construction and rehabilitation of an irrigation scheme (300 ha command area). The village of Mazrek has received support in the form of improved road access. In order to identify impacts on physical assets and income sources, Statkraft has complied a comprehensive inventory and socioeconomic survey for the hydropower project in the upper part of the valley. The main environmental impacts of the Devoll HPP relate to the changes in the hydrology of the Devoll River and the creation of reservoirs. Water quality, currently being monitored on a regular basis, will be the focus of environmental mitigation efforts going forward, including improved urban waste management and sewage treatment for Gramsh town which is located at the tail end of the Banjë reservoir. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 145 Statkraft is working closely with local government in order to establish a clear hand-over procedure and exit strategy for the sewage and waste water facilities, as well as ensure maintenance of the plant after the construction phase is completed. Statkraft is committed to compensating for loss of natural resources due to inundation. Areas for reforestation have been identified. Approximately 250ha will be reforested in the Banjë area in 2015. Hydrology, sediment, meteorology and water sampling have been performed throughout the year. The established time series will be used in the up-coming planning and transition into operation phase and future market forecasts. In addition, the collected data are used as part of a Statkraft-wide Research and Development Program on developing future sediment handling strategies. The R&D program aims to develop new technologies and methods for improving the accuracy and predictions of sediment amounts and characteristics. Kargı Hydropower Project Located in central Turkey, the Kargı Hydropower Project (Kargı HPP) is currently under its final stages of construction. Upon completion the plant will have an – Hydropower in Turkey installed capacity of 102 MW. Kargı HPP will have an annual maximum delivery of 470 GWh. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 102 MW (from two hydropower plants) ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction. Scheduled to start operation in April 2015 Around 300 people are currently working on the plant construction. Corporate responsibility challenges and measures In 2014, Kargı HPP continued to carry out a close dialogue with its stakeholders through individual and community level consultations at the Osmançik community relations office and throughout project affected villages. Providing a consistent message and being visible to project affected people greatly contribute to maintaining trust and cooperation. Information sharing about project developments and facilitation of ongoing legal processes for land access and promotion of new livelihood initiatives continued to be the main content of the dialogue for communities impacted by inundation of fields upstream of the dam. In downstream One of the local bee farmers is looking after his bees. areas, the focus has been on ensuring irrigation systems are improved and rice production can continue during operation. In 2014 the project’s livelihood restoration initiative emphasized support of apiculture. Currently a total of 17 bee farmers are receiving support for the managing their 258 beehives. Additional activities carried out by the corporate responsibility unit in Kargi include renovation of a school in Osmançik and improvement of drinking water facilities at one affected village. In preparation for operation in 2015 an Environmental and Social Management Plan for Operation is being developed. The plan provides a framework to mitigate and control environmental and social impacts resulting from planned operation. Cheves Hydropower Project In 2011, SN Power started construction of Cheves hydropower plant (Cheves HPP) in Peru, the company’s ninth hydropower plant in the country. As part of the 2014 – Hydropower in Peru “Magnet process” all SN Power Peru’s assets were transferred to Statkraft. ➔➔ Ownership: Statkraft 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 168 MW ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction, scheduled to start operation in 2015 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 146 Corporate responsibility challenges and measures The main corporate responsibility focus for the project has been to ensure a social license to operate by maintaining good relations with local government and surrounding communities. In 2014, Statkraft established a cooperation framework with the communities directly influenced by the project. This includes agreements with the Huacho and Andajes communities which were previously opposed to the project. Moreover, 10 sustainable rural development projects were successfully implemented this year, which benefited approximately 2500 villagers. This includes projects aimed at improving the production and management Local fruit farmer inspecting his crop. capabilities of fruit producers in the Huara River Basin. In compliance with IFC performance standards, an Environmental Flow Management Plan was completed for the operation phase. The plan outlines all the monitoring and mitigation plans for water quality and environmental monitoring, and was approved by the IFC in September 2014. An Emergency Preparedness Plan, incuding an early warning system, was completed for the Checras dam. Safety drills were performed as part of training initiatives aimed at the surrounding villages. Çetin Hydropower Project In 2014, Statkraft continued construction of the Çetin hydropower plant (Çetin HPP), the company’s third hydropower project in Turkey. – Hydropower in Turkey With a total output of 517 MW, Çetin HPP will be Statkraft’s largest hydropower plant outside of Norway and will have an annual maximum delivery of 1.4 TWh. ➔➔ Ownership: SN Power 100% ➔➔ Capacity: 517 MW (from two hydropower plants) ➔➔ Development phase: Under construction At most, close to 1500 people will be working on the plant during the construction period. Corporate responsibility challenges and measures In 2014 developing local infrastructure and providing consistent information to the project affected villages were key priorities. The project also finalized an entitlement matrix, providing a clear and consistent approach to stakeholder management and compensation. Village Consultations Providing a consistent message and being accessible for project affected people remain as key success factors. In addition to operating community relations offices at the project site and at Local village consultation taking place at Mukhtar village. Pervari district center, local village consultations continue for project construction areas and for the future reservoir. The purpose of such consultations is to disseminate information about the project and its impacts, to explain entitlements and compensation, and to present recruitment procedures and grievance mechanisms. A crucial aspect of the consultation meetings is that information is shared in a consistent manner to all stakeholders. Consultations were initiated towards the end of 2014 as the new contractor was mobilizing. Establishment of good relations with the local population is also considered an important part of Statkraft’s approach to security. Infrastructure Improvements Through improvements in local infrastructure and services, Statkraft is contributing to regional development in project affected areas. In 2014 such activities included village road construction, irrigation piping and restoration of several water sources for animals. Irrigation work close to the Cetin plant. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 147 Human rights Statkraft is present in parts of the world where human rights conformance can be challenging. This is something the Group takes seriously. Our commitment Our duty to actively promote respect for human rights and labour rights is clearly described in the company’s basic principle document, Statkraft’s Code of Conduct. The guidelines in the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights have been taken into consideration in Statkraft’s management system and project management tools. Ongoing dispute concerning development of wind power in Sweden In 2012, a complaint was lodged against Statkraft before the OECD’s Norwegian and Swedish contact points for multinational companies in connection with the development of wind power in Jämtland and Västernorrland counties in Sweden. Statkraft owns 60% of the company building the wind farm Statkraft SCA Vind AB. Jijnjevaerie Sami Cooperative claims it has not been sufficiently consulted on the parts of the project that affect the Cooperative’s reindeer herding, and that Statkraft is therefore in violation of the principles in the guidelines. The Sami Cooperative has therefore requested that the contact points facilitate a dialogue with Statkraft. Multiple Swedish courts have approved the project and project execution, including the consultations with parties affected by the project, which have been ongoing since 2007. The contact points carried out mediation between Jijnevaerie Sami Cooperative and Statkraft in 2014. This mediation was concluded without agreement.

Expertise development is followed up through appraisal interviews, and employees are, in addition to courses and further education, encouraged to seek internal rotation. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 149 Employee survey An annual employee survey is held in Statkraft where all employees are asked to evaluate the Group’s organisation and management. The survey covered topics such as leadership, cooperation, working conditions and personal development. The purpose of the survey was to compare ourselves with other companies in the industry and make Statkraft a better place to work. As in previous years, the results of the 2014 survey were very good. As regards the indicator “Job satisfaction”, Statkraft’s score was 74, well above the Norwegian industry index (70). Cooperation with trade unions Statkraft aims for a close and structured cooperation with all represented trade unions. In addition, Statkraft has established a European works council (Statkraft European Works Council, SEWC), with employee representatives from Norway, Sweden, Germany and the UK. SEWC is an important cooperation forum for coordinating and implementing principles and guidelines as regards labour issues and labour rights in Statkraft.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 150 Corporate Statkraft’s corporate responsibility statement presents the results for health, safety and environment, employees, ethics and contributions to responsibility society. statement Scope of statement Statkraft reports relevant topics associated with corporate responsibility regularly. The reporting mainly follows the Group’s accounting principles for treatment of subsidiaries, partly-owned power plants and associated companies. This means that data are collected from all companies where Statkraft is the majority owner and included in the statement in their entirety. However, data relating to health and safety are collected from all companies where Statkraft owns 20% or more. The presented data should cover the entire Group, but this has not been possible for some indicators. Where this is the case, the issue is explained in the associated note in the accounts. The notes also clarify some terms, explain major changes and describe any changes in calculation methods.

Since 2002, Statkraft has issued systematic information in its annual report about strategy and performance in connection with corporate responsibility. From 2004, the reporting has been based on GRI’s guidelines and from 2010, on GRI’s guidelines prepared specifically for the energy industry. About GRI GRI develops industry-adapted guidelines for corporate reporting of sustainability and corporate responsibility. The guidelines define both reporting principles and general and industry-specific indicators. GRI develops reporting tools Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent organisation which, since it was established in 1997, has worked to create a more standardised format for corporate responsibility and sustainability reporting. The most recent main version of GRI’s sustainability reporting guidelines (G4) was published in 2013, but the last version (G3) can also be used in a transitional period (up to 1 January 2016). In 2009, the guidelines prepared especially for the energy industry (Electric Utilities Sector Supplement) were approved. GRI G3 defines ten reporting principles. Four of these deal with establishing the scope and content of the report, while the other six address the quality of the information presented. GRI G3 covers both general and industry-specific indicators, divided between core and supplementary indicators, for enterprise profile, economy, environment, working conditions, human rights, corporate citizenship and product responsibility. For all areas, companies must describe the governance and follow-up mechanisms that have been implemented. Different reporting levels GRI G 3 has three corporate reporting levels – A, B and C – where A is the highest level. In addition, the reporting level is marked with a ”+” if the reporting has been verified by an external third party. Statkraft’s GRI Index Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting is based on guidance and recommendations given in the GRI’s Energy Utilities Sector Supplement. Statkraft’s corporate responsibility reporting has been verified by an external auditor. The auditor’s conclusion is presented in the Auditor’s report: “Statkraft applies a reporting practice for its corporate responsibility reporting aligned with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (version 3.1) reporting principles and the reporting fulfills application level B+ according to the GRI guidelines.” Explanations Reported = The indicator is reported.
