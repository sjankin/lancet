UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 UN GLOBAL COMPACT – COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER KJAER GROUP A/S is committed to the principles articulated in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), which we joined in November 2003. In 2007, KJAER GROUP A/S further confirmed our support for a cleaner environment by joining UN’s environmental initiative, Caring for the Climate. The UN’s principles for sustainability (the UN Global Compact) are an important point of reference for all activities and incorporated in the company’s governance framework: The KJAER GROUP Way of Management (KWOM). The KJAER GROUP Way of Management was introduced in 2008, and hereby the principles of the “Triple Bottom Line” whereby social and environmental targets and results are pursued in the same way as financial targets. While we constantly adapt our business to meet the market’s needs, the “Triple Bottom Line” ensures that we only promote responsible business practices. Back in 2012, we began to pursue ISO 9001Quality Management, ISO 14001 Environmental and OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health & Safety Management Certification. 2014 marked an exciting milestone in the process as MOTORCARE Kampala and the MOTORCARE Branches in Maputo, Beira, Inhambane and Nampula successfully completed certification. Complete certification of all branches in Mozambique and Uganda is scheduled for 2015. The benefits for the employees in reducing risk and creating a healthy work environment have become more & more visible while, of course, supporting the principles of the Global Compact Principles. Further, the reduction of negative effects and impacts on environment (pollution prevention; reduction of waste) will be of inspiration for other businesses and we will by example advocate a precautionary approach to environmental management in the societies we operate in. The HiPO (High Performance Organization) survey measures areas that are essential drivers for developing the organization and the people and therefore closely connected with the Group’s activities in the area of CSR and the UN Global Compact commitment. On behalf of KJAER GROUP’s employees, I reaffirm our commitment to compliance with the 10 Principles of the Global Compact, which will continue to be an important guidance for KJAER GROUP in the process of maintaining positive and honest business practices. We hope you will find this Communication on Progress informative and I invite you to view the KJAER GROUP website www.kjaergroup.com and the Annual Report. Per S.
