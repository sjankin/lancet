Axiam is against corruption and is aware that this can present itself in many forms, such as extortion, bribery, inappropriate favors, hospitality or gifts. New Zealand does not have any one single agency tasked with fighting corruption. Unlike many other countries it has not seen the need to create an Independent Commission Against Corruption. Rather it has a number of agencies that focus on the different elements in the fight against corruption. Some of these agencies have their focus on the more positive task of reinforcing values to ensure that New Zealand maintains a corruption free environment; others focus on the enforcement of the laws and the rules. The two main law enforcement agencies responsible for anti-corruption investigations and prosecutions are the New Zealand Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the New Zealand Police.(Mr. David Bradshaw, Anti-Corruption–A New Zealand Perspective, SFO, New Zealand).
