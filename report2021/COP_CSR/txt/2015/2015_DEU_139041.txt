We have exceeded our goal of generating operational net profit of EUR 225 to 250 million. At EUR 252 million, the figure is higher than our forecast. An important perform­ ance indicator for us is net cash provided by operating activities (operational cash flow) which improved sharply from 281 million to 756 million. The improved operational cash flow shows that HOCHTIEF has systematically reduced risks in day-today business operations and gained better control of Marcelino Fernández Verdes, bidding and work processes. A look at our other busiChairman of the Executive ness data also offers clear proof that we are on the Board right track with this strategy.

Essen, February 24, 2015 For 2015, the Group expects an operating Group net profit in the range of EUR 220-260 million. In this reporting year, we opted to publish our first combined Group Report by merging the content of our Annual Report and our Sustainability Report in order to document HOCHTIEF’s environmental, economic, and social performance in the 2014. The interplay between these three aspects of our performance creates even Marcelino Fernández Verdes greater transparency in our reporting and gives you a 360-degree view of our Company. Our activities as a global construction group have an impact on people and nature alike. We aim to manage this impact in order to maximize the benefits for society and the environment while keeping the negative effects to a minimum. HOCHTIEF’s goal is to help ensure safety and quality of life for this and future generations and to preserve our natural habitat. Our sustainability performance and transparent reporting were recognized again in the 2014 reporting year—including being listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the ninth year running.

Group Report 2014 27 Sustainability at HOCHTIEF Focus Area Resource Protection Duralie Coal Mine in Australia Bringing back indigenous flora Group Management Report YOUR OUR MINE REPLENISHMENT Economy: Thiess operates the open pit Duralie mine, situated some 190 kilometers north of Sydney. It yields around two million metric tons of coal each year, and will be run by our Australian subsidiary until June 2016. Ecology: When it comes to sustainability, there are three key issues for the Duralie management team: protecting surface waters, avoiding dust, and preventing noise.

The causeway upgrade is a 4.5 kilometer-long project between the Great North Road Interchange and the Te Atatu Interchange, and is a key component in completing the Western Ring Route road of national significance project. The existing six-lane causeway will be widened to provide additional lanes in both directions. Group Management Report Ecology: The causeway will be raised to prevent flooding during extreme tidal conditions, and stormwater will be treated to a higher standard before it is discharged into the Waitemata Harbour. The causeway runs besides the Motu Manawa – Pollen Island Marine Reserve. Design data has been gathered during the causeway trial to ensure that the Causeway Upgrade will have as little impact on the Marine Reserve as possible. Community: The causeway will improve traffic flow and travel times, including quicker bus trips and improved pedestrian and cyclist access across the motorway. 34 Group Report 2014 Strategy HOCHTIEF has been active in its core line of business ing and infrastructure construction projects.

By contrast, deferred taxes for 2014 comprised tax income of EUR 209 million, compared with a tax expense of EUR 137 million in the prior year.

As part of best practice solutions, optimized standards for project controls and methods of execution are currently being implemented Group-wide. Notably in large-scale projects, we have significantly improved risk transparency Group Management Report in all project phases. On the whole, this more entrepreneurial approach will allow risks to be identified and eliminated earlier, or managed better, in order to lower earnings volatility and increase returns on a lasting basis. The Group’s overall risk significantly improved in 2014 compared with the prior year. All divisions contributed to this positive change. We aim to continue improving our risk situation going forward. From today’s perspective, there are no risks that might cast doubt on the HOCHTIEF Group’s ability to continue as a going concern based on the probability of occurrence and impact of the risks described. We continue to assess the Group’s risk-bearing capacity as sound based on our good financial position and results of operations.

Group Report 2014 173 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Accounting policies General information The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with supplementary provisions of German commercial law applicable under Section 315a (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The same accounting policies applied in the prior year. Alongside the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Financial Statements also include a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Segment reporting is provided in these Notes. For purposes of clarity, a number of items are combined in the Balance Sheet and in the Statement of Earnings. These items are broken down into their constituents and commented on elsewhere in these Notes. The Statement of Earnings is presented using the nature of expense method of analysis. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros. As an independent listed group, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen, Germany, publishes its own consolidated financial statements, which are also included in the consolidated financial statements of ACS Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., Madrid, Spain (ACS). The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the 2014 fiscal year, comprising the reporting period from January 1 to December 31, 2014. The Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft released the financial statements for publication on February 24, 2015. They will be approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 25, 2015. Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and all significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries in which it directly or indirectly holds the majority of voting rights. This generally goes hand in hand with a majority shareholding. Three companies are consolidated by virtue of contractual arrangements. Significant Consolidated Financial Statements associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method. Companies in which HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft holds a majority of voting rights but over which it exercises joint control by contractual arrangement with other owners are likewise accounted for using the equity method unless classified as joint operations. and Notes Holdings in subsidiaries or associated companies or jointly controlled entities deemed to be of minor overall significance from a Group perspective are not consolidated and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. The list of subsidiaries, associates, and other equity interests held by the HOCHTIEF Group (pursuant to Section 313 (2) 1-4 of the German Commercial Code) is published in the electronic Bundesanzeiger (Federal Official Gazette). The main consolidated subsidiaries, equity-method investments, and joint operations are listed on pages 254–255. A number of the subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements make partial use of the exempting provisions in either Section 264 (3) or Section 264b of the German Commercial Code. A list of the companies that make use of these exemptions is included on page 253. 174 Group Report 2014 The Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2014 include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and a total of 58 German, 412 foreign consolidated companies and, as in the prior year, five special-purpose funds. The number of consolidated companies showed a decrease of 13 over the previous year. Two German and 45 foreign companies were consolidated for the first time in 2014. The additions are mainly in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (30), the HOCHTIEF Europe division (8), and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (7). The majority are project companies. Eighteen domestic and 42 foreign companies have been removed from the consolidated group. Most of the companies removed from the consolidated group were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (37) and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (21). Those in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division mainly relate to the disposal of John Holland Group as well as the Thiess and Leighton Contractors service business. Those in the HOCHTIEF Europe division primarily relate to the sale of shares in residential developer formart. An entity is generally added to or removed from the consolidated group at the time the equity stake in the entity is acquired or disposed of. Sixty-one affiliated companies of minor overall significance to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were not consolidated in the year under review. Their combined sales represented less than 1% of consolidated sales. Nineteen domestic and 174 foreign associates were accounted for using the equity method. This number showed a decrease of 93, with 29 companies added and 122 removed. The additions are mainly in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (19) and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (7). The companies removed from the consolidated group were mostly accounted for by the reclassification of 74 equity-method jointly controlled entities as joint operations in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. Due to their minor overall significance, a further 21 companies were not accounted for using the equity method. Fifty-six joint operations in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements on a proportionate basis. Following the reclassification of 74 equity-method jointly controlled entities, 27 entities were added and 45 removed in the reporting year. A total of EUR 98,732 thousand was expended in 2013 under asset deals and for purchases of companies con­ solidated for the first time; for EUR 19,797 thousand, the expenditure was made in cash. Business combinations in 2013 affected Group earnings and the balance sheet as follows: (EUR thousand) 2013 Non-current assets 71,000 Current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents 254,622 Consolidated Financial Statements Cash and cash equivalents 5,216 Assets 330,838 Provisions 21,716 Other liabilities 268,002 Liabilities 289,718 and Notes Sales 128,695 Profit before taxes (63,289) Group Report 2014 175 A total of EUR 187,396 thousand in goodwill was recognized on acquisitions in 2014. Consolidation policies The financial statements of domestic and international companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting principles. All business combinations (acquisitions) are accounted for using the acquisition method. Business combinations are measured at the acquisition date by allocating the consideration given to the acquired subsidiary’s net assets measured at fair value. Transaction costs arising in connection with such acquisitions are recognized directly as expense. All assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of an acquired subsidiary that satisfy the recognition criteria are measured at full fair value regardless of any minority interest. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the accounting entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Any goodwill then left is recognized as an asset. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. Negative goodwill arising on initial measurement is recognized immediately in income. On divestment, a pro rata share of the divesting division’s goodwill is taken into ­account when measuring disposal proceeds. Goodwill increased by EUR 53,473 thousand in the year under review, from EUR 613,204 thousand to EUR 666,677 thousand. Income, expenses, receivables, and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Unrealized intercompany profits and losses are eliminated unless they are of minor significance. Any impairment losses recognized for consolidated companies in their separate financial statements are reversed. The same policies apply for equity-method investments. These include the Group’s associates and jointly controlled entities. Any goodwill increases the carrying amount of an investment. Like other goodwill, goodwill on equity-method investments is not amortized. Reductions in carrying amount due to impairment are reported in the share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and jointly controlled entities. The financial statements of all equity-method investments are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting and valuation principles. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 176 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets held for sale (disposal group) In view of the intention to sell, mining assets of PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia (HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division) are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 as assets held for sale. The assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the Balance Sheet. The table below shows the major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale. As of December 31, 2013 a cumulative amount of minus EUR 1,914 thousand was recognized in other comprehensive income. (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 150,994 130,896 Financial assets – 132,307 Other assets 20,585 70,570 Total assets 171,579 333,773 Liabilities 63,263 68,116 The stake in aurelis Real Estate GmbH & Co, KG in the HOCHTIEF Europe division was sold in 2014. A breakeven amount was recognized on deconsolidation. The sale proceeds were settled entirely in cash. Discontinued operations In accordance with its strategic alignment, HOCHTIEF Group company Leighton Holdings entered into binding agreements for the sale of John Holland Group as well as Thiess Services and Leighton Contractors Services in December 2014. John Holland Group On December 12, 2014, Leighton Holdings signed an agreement for the 100% sale of its subsidiary John Holland Group, Melbourne, Australia (JHG) to CCCC International Holding Limited, Beijing, China. The EUR 491,665 thousand proceeds on the sale, combined with amounts recognized on remeasurement (EUR 726 thousand), significantly exceeds the carrying amount of EUR 204,749 thousand, resulting in a disposal gain of EUR 287,642 thousand. In the period January 1, 2014 to December 12, 2014, the discontinued operations accounted for sales of EUR 2,168,544 thousand and profit after taxes—excluding the actual disposal gain—of EUR 24,798 thousand. Thiess Services and Leighton Contractors Services On December 17, 2014, Leighton Holdings announced the signing of an agreement for the sale of 50% of its activities in Thiess Services, Brisbane, Australia, and Leighton Contractors Services, Sydney, Australia, (Services) with the establishment of a joint venture with subsidiaries of Apollo Global Management, LLC. The purchase price reConsolidated Financial Statements ceivable amounts to EUR 430,120 thousand. Taking into account the remeasurement of the remaining shares at fair value (EUR 154,373 thousand) and amounts recognized on remeasurement (EUR 5,072 thousand) as well as a carrying amount of EUR 216,218 thousand, the outcome was a gain of EUR 373,347 thousand. From January 1, 2014 to December 17, 2014, the discontinued Services operations accounted for sales of EUR 1,520,223 thousand and Notes and profit after taxes of EUR 104,223 thousand excluding the disposal gain. Group Report 2014 177 The table below shows the main figures for the discontinued operations of John Holland Group and of Thiess Services and Leighton Contractors Services. The prior-year figures are compiled on a like-for-like basis, taking into account the June 2013 sale by Leighton Holdings of interests in the telecommunications sector as part of the Services activities.

Exchange gains or losses up to the reporting date on the measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets or liabilities are included in other operating income or other operating expenses at the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Currency translation differences relating to a net investment in a foreign company are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income until the company is sold. This includes foreign currency receivables from fully consolidated Group com178 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements panies for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which therefore resemble equity. Financial statements of foreign companies are translated by applying the functional currency approach. As all companies outside the euro area operate autonomously in their own national currencies, their balance sheet items are translated into euros using the average exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date in accordance with official requirements. The same method is used to translate the shareholders’ equity of equity-method foreign associates following equity-method adjustment. Differences from the previous year’s translated amount are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on sale of the equity interest. Goodwill of commercially independent foreign Group entities is translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated into euros using the annual average exchange rate. Accounting policies Intangible assets are reported at amortized cost. All intangible assets have a finite useful life with the exception of company names recognized as assets on initial consolidation and excepting goodwill. Intangible assets include concessions and other licenses with useful lives of up to 30 years. These are amortized according to the pattern of consumption of economic benefits. They also include future earnings from additions to the order backlog arising from business acquisitions; these are amortized over the period in which the corresponding work is billed. Intangible assets further encompass software for commercial and engineering applications, which is amortized on a straightline basis over three to five years, and entitlements to various financing arrangements with banks amortized over terms of up to 98 months in accordance with the term of the arrangement. Estimated useful lives and amortization methods are reviewed annually. Company names and goodwill are not amortized. They are tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that they may be impaired. The company names recognized as intangible assets in the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific divisions are recognized with an indefinite useful life as they do not have a product life cycle and are not subject to technical, technological, or commercial depletion or any other restriction. Capitalized development costs in the HOCHTIEF Group are reported in intangible assets as licenses and amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Property, plant and equipment is stated at depreciated cost. Only amounts directly attributable to an item of property, plant or equipment are included in its cost. Borrowing costs are included in cost in the case of qualifying assets. Property, plant and equipment is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis except in the contract minConsolidated Financial Statements ing business, where depreciation is mostly recognized on an activity basis. Items of property, plant, machinery and equipment typically encountered in the HOCHTIEF Group are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following uniform useful lives: and Notes No. of years Buildings and investment properties 20–50 Technical equipment and machinery; ­transportation equipment 3–10 Other equipment and office equipment 3–8 Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. Group Report 2014 179 Items of property, plant and equipment on finance leases are recognized at fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or over a shorter contract term if applicable. Investment properties are stated at amortized cost. Transaction costs are included on initial measurement. The fair values of investment properties are disclosed in the Notes. They are assessed using internationally accepted valuation methods, such as taking comparable properties as a guide to current market prices or by applying the discounted cash flow method. Like property, plant and equipment, investment properties are normally depreciated using the straight-line method. Impairment losses are recognized for intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, or investment properties if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is normally defined as net selling price or value in use, whichever is higher. Impairment testing may require assets and in some cases liabilities to be grouped into cash-generating units. For goodwill, impairment testing is performed on cash-generating units corresponding to the HOCHTIEF divisions that feature in segmental reporting. For any asset that is part of an independent cash-generating unit, impairment is determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit falls below its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill belonging to the unit and then to the unit’s other assets, normally pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. Except in the case of goodwill, impairment charges are reversed (up to a maximum of amortized cost) when the impairment ceases to exist. A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control. The parties to a joint arrangement classify it as a joint operation or a joint venture depending on their respective rights and obligations. In a joint operation, the parties have direct rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Each party recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, together with its share of such items held or incurred jointly, relative to the HOCHTIEF Group’s rights and obligations. In a joint venture, where the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the parties each account for their interests in the joint venture using the equity method. Equity-method investments are stated at cost, comprising the acquired equity interest in an associate or jointly controlled entity plus any goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually to recognize the Group’s share of after-tax profits or losses, any dividends, and other changes in equity. The full carrying amount is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of an equity-method investment is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the Consolidated Financial Statements difference. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss. All other financial assets, comprising interests in non-consolidated subsidiaries, other participating interests, and non-current securities, are classed as held for sale and are measured at fair value where a fair value can be reliably and Notes estimated. In the case of publicly listed financial assets, fair value is determined as the market price. If there is no active market, fair value is calculated using the most recent market transactions or a valuation method such as the discounted cash flow method. In cases where fair value cannot be measured reliably, financial assets are reported at cost (less any impairments). Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date. Unrealized gains or losses are accounted for, after adjusting for deferred taxation, in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal of the asset. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. 180 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Receivables and other assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). An impairment loss is recognized if there is any objective material evidence that a financial asset may be impaired. Such evidence for impairment includes, for example, downgrading of a debtor’s credit rating and related interruptions in payment or potential insolvency. Impairment losses are recognized according to actual credit risk. “Receivables” comprise financial receivables, trade receivables, and other receivables. Sales are shown net of VAT and other taxes and expected reductions such as trade discounts and rebates. Sales of goods are recognized when: • The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer • The HOCHTIEF Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold • The amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably • It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the HOCHTIEF Group. Revenue from transactions involving the rendering of services is recognized by reference to the stage of completion. Revenue under construction contracts is recognized as described below. Long-term loans are stated at amortized cost. Loans yielding interest at normal market rates are reported at face value, and non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing loans are discounted to present value. Discounting is always done using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Construction contracts are reported using the percentage of completion (POC) method*. Cumulative work done *See glossary on page 266. to date, including the Group’s share of net profit, is reported under sales on a pro rata basis according to the percentage completed. The percentage of completion is measured by reference to the stage of completion; that is, as the ratio of performance delivered up to the end of the reporting period to total contract performance. Construction contracts are reported in trade receivables and trade payables, as “Gross amount due from/to customers for/ from contract work (POC).” If cumulative work done to date (contract costs plus contract net profit) of contracts in progress exceeds progress payments received, the difference is recognized as an asset and included in amounts due from customers for contract work. If the net amount after deduction of progress payments received is negative, the difference is recognized as a liability and included in amounts due to customers from contract work. Anticipated losses on specific contracts are accounted for on the basis of the identifiable risks. Construction contracts handled by construction joint ventures are also accounted for using the POC method. Trade receivables from construction joint ventures include pro rata entitlements to contract net profit. Anticipated losses are immediately recognized in full in contract net profit. Contract income on construction contracts undertaken by the Group independently or in construction joint ventures is recognized in accordance with IAS 11 as the income stipulated in the Consolidated Financial Statements contract plus any claims and variation orders. Construction contract receivables are realized as part of the HOCHTIEF Group’s operating cycle. In accordance with IAS 1, they are therefore included in current assets even though they are not expected to be realized within twelve months of the balance sheet date. and Notes The POC method is used primarily in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining. Group Report 2014 181 Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the IFRS accounts and the tax base of individual Group companies or as a result of consolidation are recognized as separate assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax refund entitlements resulting from the anticipated use of existing tax loss carryforwards in subsequent fiscal years provided it is sufficiently certain that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset within each company or group. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of tax rates applying or expected to apply in each country when they are realized. For domestic operations, as in the prior year, a tax rate of 31.5% is assumed taking account of corporate income tax plus the German “solidarity surcharge” and the average rate of municipal trade tax faced by Group companies. For all other purposes, deferred taxes are measured on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the reporting date. Inventories are initially stated at cost of purchase or production. Production cost includes costs directly related to the units of production plus an appropriate allocation of materials and production overhead, including productionrelated depreciation charges. Borrowing costs for inventories that are qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost. Most materials and supplies are measured on a FIFO or moving-average basis. Inventories are written down to net realizable value if their recoverable amount is less than their carrying amount at the reporting date. If the recoverable amount of inventories subsequently increases, the resulting gain must be recognized. This is done by reducing materials expense. All marketable securities are classed as held for sale and measured at fair value. They mainly comprise securities held in special-purpose and general investment funds as well as fixed-income securities with a residual term of more than three months at the time of acquisition and where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity. Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date and includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the securities. Unrealized gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash, cash balances at banks, and marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition that are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Discontinued operations along with non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities are meas­ ured in accordance with IFRS 5 and presented separately in the current section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To be classed as assets held for sale, assets must be available for immediate sale and their sale must be highly probable. Assets held for sale can be individual non-current assets, groups of assets held for sale (disposal groups), Consolidated Financial Statements or discontinued operations. A component of an entity is a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a major line of business or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Liabilities disposed of with assets in a single transaction are part of a disposal group or discontinued operation. and Notes Non-current assets held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortized, and are measured at their carrying amount or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever is lower. Gains or losses arising on the measurement of individual assets held for sale or of disposal groups are reported in the Statement of Earnings under results from continuing operations until their ultimate disposal. Conversely, gains or losses arising on the measurement of discontinued operations at fair value less costs to sell, profits or losses of discontinued operations, and gains or losses on their disposal are presented separately in the Statement of Earnings under results from discontinued operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations are presented in the Notes. In all other respects, the information in the Notes relates to continuing operations unless direct reference is made to discontinued operations. Prior-year information has been restated accordingly. 182 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Share-based payment transactions are measured in accordance with IFRS 2, Stock option plans are accounted for Group-wide as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Provisions for obligations under the Long-term Incentive Plans, the Top Executive Retention Plans, and the Retention Stock Award Plans are recognized in the amount of the expected expense that is or was spread over the stipulated waiting period. The fair value of stock options is measured using generally accepted financial models, the value of the plans being determined with the Black/Scholes option pricing model. The specific problem of valuing the plans in question is solved using binomial tree methods. The computations are performed by an outside appraiser. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for current and future benefit payments to active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension benefits, partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. The individual benefit obligations vary from one country to another and are determined for the most part by length of service and pay scales. The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are likewise included in pension provisions due to their pension-like nature. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are computed by the projected unit credit method. This determines the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already known at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner Group, in healthcare costs. The computation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting principles. Plan assets as defined in IAS 19 are shown separately as deductions from pension obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in investment funds purchased under deferred compensation arrangements, and qualifying insurance policies in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of plan assets is greater than the present value of employee benefits, the difference is reported—subject to the limit in IAS 19—under other non-current assets. Remeasurements of defined benefit plans are recognized directly in other comprehensive income in the period during which they arise. The current service cost is reported under personnel costs. The net interest component, comprising the interest element of the increase in pension obligations less expected returns on plan assets (each calculated using the discount rate for the pension obligations), is reported in net investment and interest income. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2014 183 Tax provisions comprise current tax obligations. Income tax provisions are offset against tax refund entitlements if they relate to the same tax jurisdiction and are congruent in nature and reporting period. Other provisions account for all identifiable obligations as of the reporting date that result from past business transactions or events but are uncertain in their amount and/or settlement date. Provisions are stated at the estimated settlement amount, i.e. after making allowance for price and cost increases, and are not offset against any rights to reimbursement. For obligations with a settlement probability exceeding 50%, the provision amount is calculated on the basis of the most likely settlement outcome. A provision can only be recognized on the basis of a legal or constructive obligation toward third parties. Long-term provisions are stated at the present value of the estimated settlement amount as of the reporting date and are reported under non-current liabilities. Liabilities are reported at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). Finance lease liabilities are initially recognized at fair value at the inception of the lease or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value regardless of their purpose and reported under other receivables and other assets or other liabilities. Initial measurement is as of the settlement date. All derivative financial instruments are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. The recognition of changes in fair value depends on the purpose for which a derivative is held. Derivatives are only ever used in the HOCHTIEF Group for hedging purposes. Hedges are structured for maximum effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from a hedged item, as with the hedging of variable rate loans to counter variations in payment amounts due to interest rate changes. Unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in equity, taking account of deferred taxes. The portion of the changes in value initially recognized in equity is reclassified to income or expense as soon as the hedged item is recognized in income or expense. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are reclassified to income or expense in the period when the financial asset or financial liability affects income. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a nonfinancial asset or liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are taken out of equity and subtracted from or added to the initial cost of the asset or liability. In the cases described, only the portion of changes in value that are determined to be effective for hedging purposes are recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized directly as income or expense. In the HOCHTIEF Group, only cash flow hedges are currently recognized. Derivatives are also used for economic hedging purposes where no hedge accounting is applied. In such cases, changes in fair value are recognized in income or expense. Contingencies, commitments, and other obligations are possible or current obligations, based on past transConsolidated Financial Statements actions, that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources. They are disclosed separately and are not included in the Balance Sheet unless assumed in the course of a business combination. The amounts stated for contingent liabilities reflect the extent of the liabilities as of the reporting date. and Notes 184 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies primarily relate to the following ­issues: • Leases must be assessed to determine whether the substantial risks and rewards of beneficial ownership transfer to the lessee. • Securities may be grouped in different categories. • Assets earmarked for sale must be assessed to confirm that they are available for immediate sale and their sale is highly probable. If the result of this assessment is positive, they and any liabilities to be disposed of in the same transaction must be reported and accounted for as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale. • It is necessary to determine whether construction revenue is accounted for under IAS 11 or IAS 18. The decision made by the HOCHTIEF Group for general application in each instance is set out under Accounting Policies in these Notes. Preparation of the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures of contingencies, commitments, and other obligations, The main estimates and assumptions relate to the following: • Assessing projects on a percentage of completion basis, in particular with regard to accounting for change orders, the timing of profit recognition, and the amount of profit recognized. • Estimating the economic life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and of investment properties. • Accounting for provisions. • Testing goodwill and other assets for impairment. • Testing deferred tax assets for impairment. All estimates and assumptions are based on current circumstances and appraisals. Forward-looking estimates and assumptions made as of the balance sheet date with a view to future business performance take account of circumstances prevailing on preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and future trends considered realistic for the global and industry environment. Actual amounts can vary from the estimated amounts due to changes in the operating environment that are at variance with the assumptions and lie beyond management control. If such changes occur, the assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of affected assets and liabilities are revised accordingly. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2014 185 New accounting pronouncements Adoption by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of amendments to IFRS pronouncements and of new IFRS pronouncements has resulted in changes to accounting policies in those instances where the pronouncements have been adopted by the EU and their application is mandatory for the reporting period January 1 to December 31, 2014. Changes in IFRS affecting the HOCHTIEF Group are as follows: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, in conjunction with Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures as well as Amendments since made to IFRS 10, IFRS 11, and IFRS 12: IFRS 10 replaces the previous control approach in IAS 27 and SIC-12 with a uniform approach applicable to all business combinations. The rules for separate financial statements remain in IAS 27. The new control approach has three elements: • Power over the investee • Variable returns • Ability to use the power over the investee to affect the amount of the variable returns. IFRS 11 replaces IAS 31 and abolishes proportionate consolidation. The core principle of IFRS 11 is the rule that a party to a joint arrangement classifies the arrangement either as a joint operation or a joint venture by assessing its rights and obligations arising from the arrangement. With a joint operation, each party accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses relating to its interest in the joint operation, together with its share of such items held or incurred jointly, in accordance with the applicable IFRSs. With a joint venture, each party accounts for its investment in the joint venture using the equity method in accordance with the amended IAS 28. IFRS 12 brings together the revised disclosures under IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27, and IAS 28 in a separate stand­ ard. The amended standards all apply for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. They were endorsed by the EU in December 2012 and April 2013. First-time application of IFRS 11 resulted in reclassifications of equitymethod jointly controlled entities to joint operations, primarily concerning the following companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division: Name Domicile Activities Shareholding (%) Consolidated Financial Statements Thiess Balfour Beatty Australia Construction 67 Baulderstone Leighton Joint Venture (Regional Rail Link Pack E) Australia Construction 50 GHD & John Holland Joint Venture (Perth City Link Rail Alliance) Australia Construction 85 SA Health Partnership (New Royal Adelaide Hospital) Australia Construction 50 and Notes Leighton-Gammon Joint Venture – H2561 Hong Kong Construction 50 Leighton Fulton Hogan Joint Venture (Sapphire to Woolgoolga) Australia Construction 50 Abigroup Contractors Pty Ltd & Coleman Rail Pty Ltd & John Holland Pty Australia Construction 40 Ltd (Integrate Rail JV) Thiess Degremont Joint Venture Australia Construction 65 Silcar Thiess Services Joint Venture Australia Service 50 N.V.

First-time application of IFRS 12 resulted in additional disclosures in the Notes.

Report 2014 189 The remaining IFRS pronouncements applicable in the fiscal year had no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements: • Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: Investment Entities • A mendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation: Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities • Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting • IFRIC 21 Levies Other new accounting pronouncements issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) take the form of standards and interpretations that affect the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements but do not have to be applied for the 2014 fiscal year and in some cases have not yet been endorsed by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: After publishing the three phases of the new standard over the last few years, the IASB published the final version of IFRS 9 in July 2014. The new standard notably introduces major changes relat­ ing to the classification and measurement of financial assets, with classification to be based on the type of business model and on contractual cash flows. In the same connection, impairment assessment is extended from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. A new hedge accounting model is also introduced that aims to bring hedge accounting more closely into line with the risk management activities of the entity. The complete overhaul of IAS 39 with the publication of IFRS 9 results in additional disclosures. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Initial application is retrospective, although transitional provisions apply. Earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. On current assessment, the new standard will result in a reclassification of financial assets in the HOCHTIEF Group. The new rules on financial liabilities will probably have no material effect on the HOCHTIEF Group. Further implications of IFRS 9 and its additional provisions cannot be assessed until final endorsement by the EU. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The IASB issued this new standard in May 2014 with the objective of bringing together in one standard the rules on revenue recognition previously contained in various different standards and interpretations. IFRS 15 applies across all sectors to revenue from all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other IFRSs, such as leases, insurance contracts, and financial instruments. Revenue recognition is carried out with regard to both timing and amount by applying the following five Consolidated Financial Statements steps: (1) Identify the contracts with a customer (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract (3) Determine the transaction price and Notes (4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation Alongside this five-step model, IFRS 15 includes an array of further provisions, such as on contract modifications and additional notes disclosures. The revised IFRS 15 applies for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017; earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. With regard to the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements, it is assumed on current assessment that the new standard will lead to changes in revenue recognition and additional notes disclosures. The effects of IFRS 15 cannot be finally assessed until final endorsement by the EU. 190 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: In “Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture” published in September 2014, the IASB clarifies that recognition of a gain or loss on the sale or contribution of assets depends on whether the assets constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3. When a transaction involves a business, the investor recognizes a full gain or loss. When a transaction involves the sale of assets that do not constitute a business, a partial gain or loss is recognized. The amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 apply for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016; earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. On current assessment, the amendments will have no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements. Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: In “Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations” published in May 2014, the IASB clarifies that the acquisition of an initial or additional interest in a joint operation when the operation constitutes a business as defined in IFRS 3 should be accounted for using the principles related to business combinations in IFRS 3 and other standards with the exception of those principles that conflict with the guidance in IFRS 11. On the acquisition of additional interests in a joint operation, previously held interests are not remeasured. The amendments to IFRS 11 do not apply if the parties sharing joint control are under the common control of the same ultimate controlling party. The amendments apply for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of its annual improvements process, the IASB published two omnibus standards in December 2013 (Annual Improvements Cycles 2010-2012 and 2011-2013) and another in September 2014 (Annual Improvements Cycle 2012-2014). This involved small but necessary changes to various standards. The Annual Improvements Cycles 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 apply for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2014, the Annual Improvements Cycle 2012-2014 for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The EU has so far endorsed the Annual Improvements Cycles 2010-2012 and 2011-2013. On current assessment, the changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the financial position and financial performance of the HOCHTIEF Group. The remaining IFRS pronouncements issued by the IASB have no major relevance to the HOCHTIEF Group and are therefore not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements: • IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts • Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception • Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure Initiative • A mendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets: Clarification of Consolidated Financial Statements Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation • Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants • Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions • Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2014 191 Explanatory Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings 1.

Likewise as in the prior year, there were no impairment charges on intangible assets in the reporting year. 198 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Intangible assets include EUR 54,457 thousand (2013: EUR 50,017 thousand) for company names recognized on initial consolidation, accounted for by EUR 38,272 thousand (2013: EUR 34,456 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Americas division and EUR 16,185 thousand (2013: EUR 15,561 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. The changes compared with the prior year relate to currency adjustments. The company names are not subject to systematic amortization, but are tested for impairment annually and if there is any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with IAS 36 as described below for goodwill. As in the prior year, no impairment was identified in the year under review. Goodwill recognized for consolidated companies on initial consolidation is allocated to cash-generating units at segment level for the purposes of impairment testing as described in the following. The cash-generating units correspond to the divisions used in segment reporting. Annual impairment testing of goodwill at segment (division) level is performed at HOCHTIEF in the fourth quarter of each year. In impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a division is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units is measured separately for each unit as value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from a cash-generating unit. It is determined from an internal Group perspective using the discounted cash flow method. This is carried out on the basis of cash flow budgets derived from the three-year budget for the detailed planning horizon as approved by the Executive Board and current at the time of impairment testing. The forecasts incorporate past experience and expected future market developments Cash flows are assumed to remain constant in subsequent years. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used for cost of capital data. Value in use is first meas­ ured on an after-tax basis by discounting the cash flows with an after-tax WACC determined separately for each cash-generating unit. The pretax discount rate is then found by iteration for the purposes of the Notes disclosures. The discount rates used for cash-generating units in impairment testing are between 10.4 and 12.2% before tax (2013: between 10.1 and 11.8%). The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific cash-generating unit is measured as fair value based on Leighton Holdings’ market capitalization. As in the prior year, comparison of the divisions’ recoverable amounts with their carrying amounts has not revealed any impairment of goodwill. Changes in goodwill by division in 2014 were as follows: Consolidated Financial Statements Jan. 1, Currency Consolidation Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2014* adjustments changes 2014 *restated HOCHTIEF Americas 259,836 30,992 – 290,828 and Notes HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific 307,610 30,157 (2,268) 335,499 HOCHTIEF Europe 45,758 – (5,408) 40,350 613,204 61,149 (7,676) 666,677 The changes in goodwill within the consolidation changes in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division mainly relate to the discontinued operations and those in the HOCHTIEF Europe division to the sale of shares in residential ­developer formart.

This plan is likewise based on stock awards and consists of three tranches. The first tranche was granted in July 2008, the second in July 2009, and the third in July 2010. The total term of the plan is ten years. The waiting period after the granting of each tranche is three years. The ­exercise period is between five and seven years, depending on the tranche. The conditions stipulate that, after the waiting period, entitled individuals receive for each stock award either a HOCHTIEF share or, at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion, a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date.

Alongside grants of stock appreciation rights (SARs), LTIP 2009 also provided for grants of stock awards. The SARs could only be exercised if, for at least ten consecutive stock market trading days before the exercise date, the ten-day average (arithmetic mean) stock market closing price of HOCHTIEF stock was higher relative to the issue price compared with the ten-day average closing level of the MDAX index relative to the index base (relative performance threshold) and, additionally, return on net assets (RONA) in the then most recently approved set of consolidated financial statements was at least 10% (absolute performance threshold). The relative performance threshold was waived if the average stock market price of HOCHTIEF stock exceeded the issue price by at least 10% on ten consecutive stock market trading days after the end of the waiting period. Provided that the targets were met, the SARs could be exercised at any time after a two-year waiting period except during a short period before publication of any business results. When SARs were exercised, the issuing entity paid out the difference between the then current stock price and the issue price. The difference was capped at 50% of the issue price. The LTIP conditions for stock awards stipulated that for each stock award exercised within a two-year exercise period following a three-year waiting period, entitled individuals received at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion either a HOCHTIEF share or a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The maximum gain was set to EUR 40.10 per stock award. The plan was exercised in full.

The gain is limited to EUR 25.27 per SAR and EUR 75.81 per stock award. Long-term Incentive Plan 2013 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2013 (LTIP 2013) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2013 and is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2012 in only one point: The number of SARs that can be exercised depends on attainment of the planned value range for adjusted free cash flow. This value range is set in the business plan for each exercise year. The gain is limited to EUR 24.61 per SAR and EUR 73.83 per stock award. Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 (LTIP 2014) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2014 and is open to Executive Board members.

Other information Return on net assets (RONA) Return on net assets (RONA) indicates how well HOCHTIEF’s assets are performing as an investment and thus measures the profitability of the HOCHTIEF Group. RONA measures return as a percentage of net assets. For this purpose, return is defined as operational earnings (EBITA, shown in the Operational Statement of Earnings) plus interest income from the Group’s financial assets. The net assets figure reflects the total capital commitment from which returns are to be generated. Consolidated Financial Statements *restated The HOCHTIEF Group generated a return on net assets (RONA) of 20.3% in 2014 (2013: 15.6%*). RONA thus ­increased/decreased by 4.7 percentage points compared with the prior year. and Notes 214 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The conditions of all plans stipulate that on the exercise of SARs or stock awards—and the fulfillment of all other requisite criteria—HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft normally has the option of delivering HOCHTIEF shares instead of paying out the gain in cash.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations Defined benefit plans Under defined benefit plans, the Company’s obligation is to provide agreed benefits to current and former emplo­y­ ees. The main pension obligations in Germany consist of direct commitments under the current 2000+ pension Consolidated Financial Statements plan and deferred compensation plans. The 2000+ plan in force since January 1, 2000 consists of a basic pension in the form of a modular defined contribution plan and a supplementary pension linked to company performance. The size of the basic pension component depends on employee income and age (resulting in an annuity conversion factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by HOCHTIEF every three years. The size of the supplemenand Notes tary pension component depends on growth in IFRS-basis profit after taxes. The basic pension can be supplemented in this way by up to 20%. The pension amount at retirement is the sum total of the pension components vested each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary pension arrangements are in existence for executive staff, although except at Executive Board level such arrangements have no longer been offered since 1995. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension, and in almost all cases are granted as a lifelong annuity. Group Report 2014 215 Up to December 31, 2013, employees in Germany additionally had the option of deferred compensation in a company pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension amount is based on the present value of acquired fund units at retirement, subject to a minimum of the deferred compensation amount plus an increment that is guaranteed by HOCHTIEF and ranges from 3.50% down to 1.75% p.a. There is a choice at retirement between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five or six years. Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit plans at Turner in the USA and HOCHTIEF UK in the United Kingdom. The plan at Turner was frozen as of December 31, 2003, and no new entitlements can be earned under it. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. There is a choice at retirement between a lifelong annuity and a lump sum payment. Commitments at Turner also include post-employment benefits in the form of medical care for pensioners. HOCHTIEF UK has a length-of-service, final salary pension plan. For each year of service, 1/75th of the eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. Defined benefit obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are made up as follows: Dec. 31, 2014 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 144,137 87,107 11,212 Final salary [19,613] – [11,212] Not final salary [124,524] [87,107] – Vested benefits 171,419 44,594 15,110 Current benefit payments 521,605 100,762 15,069 Similar obligations 91 48,827 – Total 837,252 281,290 41,391 Duration in years (weighted) 14.8 8.3 20.0 Dec. 31, 2013 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 131,025 76,456 8,495 Final salary [16,973] – [8,495] Not final salary [114,052] [76,456] – Vested benefits 129,228 48,555 12,012 Current benefit payments 459,716 77,728 12,943 Similar obligations 82 38,909 – Total 720,051 241,648 33,450 Consolidated Financial Statements Duration in years (weighted) 13.1 8.1 22.0 and Notes 216 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Plan assets There are no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic pension obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA). The transferred assets are administered in trust by HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e. V. and serve exclusively to fund domestic pension obligations. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in accordance with investment principles set out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. The investment guidelines and decisions are based on the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM) study compiled by outside specialists at regular intervals of three to five years. This uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the development of the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a very long forward horizon and in numerous combinations. Based on the ALM study, a range of criteria are then applied to determine the optimum asset allocation in order to ensure that pension liabilities can be met in the long term. To assure an optimum conservative risk structure, we have also established risk overlay management using the services of a professional external overlay manager who is given a fixed annual risk budget and works fully autonomously in a clearly structured risk overlay management process. HOCHTIEF aims to ensure full funding of pension obligations and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current service cost annually or at least on a timely basis. The companies pay in additional amounts from time to time in the event of any shortfall. Pension commitments in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied in the statutory pension insurance scheme are additionally covered using pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities from deferred employee compensation are funded by the purchase of retail fund units. Funding of the obligations served by HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e.V. as of December 31, 2014 is about 60% (2013: 71%); the figure for Germany as a whole is about 64% (2013: 75%). It should be noted in this connection that the size of pension obligations has increased significantly in recent years due to the low level of market interest rates and that the funding ratio will significantly increase again when interest rates recover. The frozen defined benefit obligations in the Turner Group are likewise managed in a pension fund. Plan assets are administered in trust by BNY Mellon and serve exclusively to fund the plan. The trust’s independence is reviewed annually and attested to by auditors. Investment decisions are not made by the trust but by a special committee. The investment of plan assets is based on a regularly compiled ALM study. The investment objectives are to maximize the funding ratio and reduce volatility in the funding ratio. With the pension obligations fully funded, high-risk investments in equities are to be reduced in favor of fixed-interest bonds. These ideally perform in line with plan liabilities, thus ensuring full funding. There is no statutory minimum funding requirement, but low funding levels result in higher contributions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and limits to lump-sum payments, hence maximum funding is aimed for. The funding of obligations covered by plan assets at Turner as of December 31, 2014 is about 91% (2013: 96%); funding at Turner overall is about 75% (2013: 80%). Funding of plan assets at HOCHTIEF UK is likewise on a trust basis. Statutory minimum funding requirements apply. If funding is insufficient to make up a fund­ing shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is drawn up. Plan funding is reviewed at least once every three Consolidated Financial Statements years. Funding of pension obligations at HOCHTIEF UK is about 81% (2013: 86%). and Notes Group Report 2014 217 Defined benefit obligations are covered by plan assets as follows: Coverage of defined benefit obligations by plan assets Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 Defined benefit Plan assets Defined benefit Plan assets (EUR thousand) obligations obligations Uncovered by plan assets 50,159 – 44,707 – Partially covered by plan assets 1,039,671 711,133 894,256 696,492 Incompletely covered by plan assets 1,089,830 711,133 938,963 696,492 Fully covered by plan assets 70,103 71,559 56,186 66,482 Total 1,159,933 782,692 995,149 762,974 Actuarial assumptions The size of pension provisions is determined on an actuarial basis. This necessarily involves estimates. Specifically, the actuarial assumptions used are as follows: 2014 2013 (Percent) Germany USA UK Germany USA UK * weighted average Discount factor* 2.00 3.85 4.00 3.50 4.65 4.60 Salary increases 3.00 – 2.15 3.25 – 2.20 Pension increases 1.75 – 4.48 2.00 – 4.52 Health cost increases – 5.00 – – 5.00 – The discount factors are derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking into account the company-specific duration of pension liabilities. Salary and pension increases ceased to be taken into account in the USA (Turner Group) in 2004 due to the changeover in pension arrangements. Mortality assumptions are based on published country-specific statistics and experience. Domestically, they are determined using the Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck 2005 G tables. Turner uses the RP 2014 separate annuitant/non-annuitant no collar tables with generational improvement using scale MP-2014 as published by the Society of Actuaries (SOA); HOCHTIEF UK uses the S2PxA CMI_2013 [1.25%] males [1.00%] females year of birth mortality tables.

Before deferred taxes, the cumulative amount of actuarial losses is EUR 471,587 thousand (2013: EUR 313,815 thousand). The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are included in pension provisions due to their pension-like nature. The defined benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 came to EUR 48,827 thousand (2013: EUR 38,909 thousand). Healthcare costs accounted for EUR 1,416 thousand (2013: EUR 1,838 thousand) of the current service cost and EUR 2,004 thousand (2013: EUR 1,614 thousand) of the interest expense. Sensitivity analysis Pension obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are subject to various risks. The main risks result from general changes in interest and inflation rates; there is no unusual risk inherent in the pension obligations. One major risk is interest rate risk. For defined benefit plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits using a table of fixed interest rates, independent of the current market interest rate. HOCHTIEF thus bears the risk of general capital market interest rate changes with regard to the determination of benefits. Pension obligations have increased significantly in recent years due to the generally low level of capital market interest rates. The correspondingly large impact is due to the relatively long term of the obligations. There is also inflation risk. By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised level with the inflation rate at least every three years. German company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at a fixed 1% p.a., hence there is only minor inflation risk in the pension phase. Turner plans are free from inflation risk as the main defined benefit plan was frozen and no more adjustments to the company pension are made. In addition, there is longevity risk. The granting of lifelong pensions means that HOCHTIEF bears the risk of pen­ sioners living longer than actuarial calculations predict. This risk normally cancels out collectively across all pen­ sion plan members and only comes into play if general longevity is longer than expected. The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial assumptions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

It has no obligation to pay further contributions. There are defined contribution plans at Turner, Flatiron, and E.E. Cruz in the USA as well as at Leighton in Australia. Depending on length of service and salary level, Turner pays between 3% and 6% of an employee’s salary into an external fund. In addition, Turner employees have an option to pay up to 25% of their salaries into an investment fund as part of a 401 (k) plan. Turner matches the first 5% of the deferred compensation by up to 100% depending on length of service. All employees can join the plan immediately, and are vested in the company’s contributions after three years’ service. Tax relief is granted on payments into the fund; the investment risk is borne by employees. The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are likewise 401 (k) plans. All non-union employees are entitled. Flatiron pays a contribution in the amount of 6.0% of the wage or salary, while E.E. Cruz doubles one-third of employee contributions, in each case up to the statutory maximum. In Australia, since July 1, 2014 Leighton has paid 9.50% (previously 9.25%) of the wage and salary total into the statutory pension (superannuation) scheme. The contribution rate is expected to rise incrementally up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of investment funds and bear the investment risk. They are able to pay top-up contributions on a voluntary basis. Tax relief is granted on top-up contributions. EUR 182,071 thousand was paid into defined contribution plans in 2014 (2013: EUR 201,972 thousand*), mostly in *restated the Leighton Group (EUR 148,689 thousand; 2013: EUR 169,061 thousand*) and the Turner Group (EUR 30,731 thousand; 2013: EUR 29,572 thousand). An additional EUR 66,366 thousand was paid into state pension schemes in 2014 (2013: EUR 86,617 thousand). Costs of defined contribution plans are reported as part of personnel expenses. 28.

The personnel-related provisions primarily consist of provisions for stock option schemes, long-service awards, leave entitlements, termination benefits, and early retirement arrangements. The size of provisions for insurance claims is computed annually by an actuary. Items covered by sundry other provisions include contract administration, contract costs incurred subsequent to invoicing, investment risk, preparation of annual financial statements, payments for damages, and other uncertain liabilities.

The bond is repayable in three installments in 2015, 2017, and 2020. The installments each carry a different rate of interest ranging from 4.51 to 5.78%. The bonds or notes issued item for the prior year also included EUR 181,538 thousand for a further bond issued by Leighton Holdings in 2009 that was repaid in full in the year under review. In 2008, Leighton Holdings issued a U.S. dollar private placement with a principal amount of USD 280,000 thousand. The two remaining tranches are repayable in 2015 and 2018. The installments each carry a different rate of interest ranging from 7.19 to 7.66%. The carrying amount of the U.S. dollar private placement at December 31, 2014 is EUR 140,698 thousand (2013: EUR 121,760 thousand). Finally, bonds or notes issued contain EUR 34,736 thousand (2013: EUR 91,137 thousand) under four further Leighton Holdings notes issues, some with a variable coupon. Amounts due to banks include a EUR 50,000 thousand portion of a bilateral promissory note loan arranged on December 13, 2012. The loan has an initial term of four years and has a fixed interest rate. A liability of EUR 44,500 thousand previously included in this item and resulting from a EUR 120,600 thousand promissory note loan issue placed in the market on November 25, 2011 was repaid ahead of time as of May 26, 2014. A further EUR 240,000 thousand promissory note loan issue put out by HOCHTIEF in 2010 and consisting of two tranches, for EUR 59,500 thousand and EUR 180,500 thousand respectively, was likewise repaid ahead of time as of May 26, 2014. Repayment of four promissory note loans taken out in 2009 for a total of EUR 300,000 thousand and with terms of three and five years split halfway with part-fixed, part-variable interest was completed on schedule at the end of the loan terms with a remaining amount of EUR 30,000 thousand paid as of May 26, 2014. Of the two promissory note loans taken out in 2008, one loan with an initial term of seven years remains included in this item. The loan is for a nominal amount of EUR 39,000 thousand and carries a coupon equal to six-month EURIBOR plus an appropriate lending margin. An international banking syndicate provided HOCHTIEF on market terms with a credit facility with a term to April 30, 2019 comprising a EUR 1.5 billion guarantee tranche and a EUR 500,000 thousand cash tranche. The cash tranche is undrawn at the balance sheet date (2013: undrawn). EUR 946,146 thousand (2013: EUR 117,981 thousand) of amounts due to banks concerns borrowings by Leighton Holdings. Amounts due to banks at the balance sheet date comprise EUR 1,018,922 thousand (2013: EUR 208,065 thousand) subject to variable rates of interest and EUR 125,503 thousand (2013: EUR 589,634 thousand) subject to fixed Consolidated Financial Statements rates of interest. The average interest rate on the variable-interest portion stood at 2.31% (2013: 2.27%). The average interest rate on the fixed-interest portion was 3.72% (2013: 3.78%). As in the prior year, the average term was one-and-a-half years. and Notes Trade payables due to companies accounted for using the equity method were EUR 23,307 thousand (2013: EUR 30,024 thousand). This mainly related to obligations to make payments into capital in connection with project companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. The EUR 198,288 thousand (2013: EUR 272,288 thousand) in lease liabilities mainly relates to plant and equipment under finance leases at Leighton Holdings.

Current income tax liabilities The EUR 10,682 thousand (2013: EUR 15,402 thousand) in current income tax liabilities comprises amounts payable to domestic and foreign revenue authorities. Other disclosures 33. Undiluted and diluted earnings per share Undiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the consolidated net profit attributable to the Company’s stock by the average number of shares in circulation. This indicator can become diluted as a result of potential shares (mainly stock options and convertible bonds). HOCHTIEF’s share-based payment arrangements do not have a dilutive effect on earnings. Consequently, diluted and undiluted earnings per share are identical. 2014 2013 Consolidated net profit—continuing operations (EUR thousand) (122,439) 70,651 Consolidated net profit—discontinued operations (EUR thousand) 374,126 100,545 Total consolidated net profit (EUR thousand) 251,687 171,196 Number of shares in circulation in thousands (weighted average) 69,124 72,105 Consolidated net profit per share—continuing operations (EUR) (1.77) 0.98 Consolidated net profit per share—discontinued operations (EUR) 5.41 1.39 Total earnings per share (EUR) 3.64 2.37 Dividend per share (EUR) 1.50 Proposed dividend per share (EUR) 1.90 The number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was 68,466 thousand. The number as of December 31, 2013 was 69,309 thousand and is equal to the number of shares outstanding at the beginning of the period, as of January 1, 2014 (January 1, 2013: 73,613 thousand). 34. Reporting on financial instruments Financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual claims and obligations relating to exchanges and transfers of financial assets. Financial instruments can be derivative or non-derivative. Consolidated Financial Statements Non-derivative financial assets mostly comprise cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and other financial assets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The fair values of available-for-sale financial assets are established with reference to market prices or, in the absence of such prices, are determined using and Notes accepted valuation methods. Non-derivative financial liabilities are mostly current liabilities measured at amortized cost. According to their fair value, derivative financial instruments are reported either in other receivables and other assets or in other liabilities. Derivatives are used in the HOCHTIEF Group exclusively for hedging existing transactions and in asset management.* *See glossary on page 265. Group Report 2014 227 Holdings of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are carried on the Balance Sheet; the maximum risk of loss or default is equal to total financial assets. Any such risk identified in respect of financial assets is accounted for with an impairment loss. Risk management All financial activities in the HOCHTIEF Group are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial framework directive. This is fleshed out by individual, function-specific operating directives on issues such as currency and collateral management. These directives lay down principles for dealing with the various classes of financial risk. Trading, control, and settlement activities are divided within Corporate Finance between front, middle, and back offices. This ensures effective operational risk management in that monitoring and settlement of front office external trading activities are performed by a separate and independent back office. All external trading actions are also subject to at least dual control. Internal authorizations to give instructions are strictly limited in number and monetary amount, and are reassessed at least once a year and adjusted as necessary. Management of liquidity risk HOCHTIEF uses predominantly centralized liquidity structures—in particular cash pooling—to pool liquidity at Group level, among other things to avoid liquidity bottlenecks at the level of individual entities. The central liquidity position is calculated at regular monthly intervals and budgeted in a bottom-up process over a rolling 18-month period. Liquidity budgets are supplemented with monthly stress testing. Liquidity budgets are used by HOCHTIEF in active management of the securities portfolio and loans portfolio. Issuance of a third corporate bond with a principal amount of EUR 500,000 thousand and a five-year term to maturity in May 2014 enabled the Group once again to spread borrowing over a larger range of national and international lenders and further extend the maturity profile of the debt portfolio. The tables below show maximum payments. The tables show the worst-case scenario for HOCHTIEF, i.e. the earliest possible contractual payment date in each case. Creditors’ rights of termination are taken into account. Foreign currency items are translated using the closing rate as of the balance sheet date. Interest payments on variable rate items are translated uniformly using the last interest rate fixed prior to the balance sheet date. Both primary and derivative financial instruments (for example, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps) are taken into account. Credit facilities granted but not yet drawn in their full amount are also included, as are financial guarantees given by the Group. The maximum payments shown in the following tables (worst case scenario) are offset by contractually fixed receipts Consolidated Financial Statements in the same periods that are not shown here (for example, from trade receivables). These cover most of the cash outflows shown.

The following table shows the main liquidity instruments: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, 2014 2013 (EUR thousand) (restated) Cash in hand and on deposit 2,291,978 1,842,178 Marketable securities 812,585 1,162,121 Undrawn revolving credit facilities 2,027,911 1,961,306 5,132,474 4,965,605 The revolving credit facilities include a credit facility tranche with a facility amount of EUR 500,000 thousand under the syndicated guarantee and credit facility that was extended ahead of term in April 2014 to April 30, 2019. As in the prior year, the credit facility was undrawn as of December 31, 2014. HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft also has short-term, bilateral, revolving money market facilities with a total facility amount of EUR 259,349 thousand (2013: EUR 336,636 thousand); as in the prior year, these are undrawn as of the balance sheet date. Some of the facilities are subject to creditors’ rights of termination in connection with a financial covenant, which is continuously monitored as part of corporate planning. In light of the broad international syndication in each instance and the successful extension of the credit and guarantee facilities in April 2014, there is no refinancing risk with regard to long-term guarantee and credit facilities. As a further precautionary measure, there is appropriate scope for raising additional capital under resolutions adopted at the 2011 Annual General Meeting. HOCHTIEF also has sufficient revolving guarantee facilities, which play an important role for the Group. The guarantee facilities have a total size of EUR 12.90 billion (2013: EUR 11.86 billion) and are 66% drawn (2013: 67%). Management of currency risk HOCHTIEF is exposed to currency risk (in the form of transaction risk) from receivables, liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, securities, and pending transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group Consolidated Financial Statements company concerned in each case. Currency derivatives, mainly forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge against fluctuations in these payments or items caused by exchange rates. HOCHTIEF normally hedges all currency risk. and Notes Hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the Leighton Group—are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Binding guidelines clarify their use and separate controls and responsibilities for all Group companies. Currency derivatives are normally only used to hedge risk. Any form of speculation is ruled out under a binding, Group-wide risk directive. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. Group Report 2014 229 The following table shows the fair values of currency derivatives: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2014 2013 Assets Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedges) 1,612 8,199 for hedging purposes (but not hedge accounted) 1,987 4,132 3,599 12,331 Liabilities and ­sharehold­ers’ equity Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedges) 1,902 3,470 for hedging purposes (but not hedge accounted) 746 1,380 2,648 4,850 The maximum residual term of currency derivatives in cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2014 is 13 months (2013: 35 months). As of December 31, 2014, the maximum residual term of currency derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied is 25 months (2013: 11 months). Where hedge accounting is used, unrealized gains and losses on hedges are initially recognized in other comprehensive income, taking into account deferred tax. Gains and losses are not realized until a hedged item affects income. Derivatives are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. When interpreting positive or negative fair value changes relating to derivatives, it is important to remember that they balance hedged items whose values move in the opposite direction. A net EUR 5,019 thousand was charged to equity in 2014 (2013: EUR 9,301 thousand credited) for market value changes on the above derivatives in cash flow hedges. Where hedge accounting is not applied, all unrealized gains and losses on the hedged item are recognized immediately in profit or loss; in 2013 this related to a net loss of EUR 1,511 thousand (2013: net gain of EUR 4,256 thousand). The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact on HOCHTIEF Group equity and profit that would result from a 10% fluctuation in foreign currencies relative to each Group company’s functional currency. The analysis is based on holdings as of the balance sheet date.

Two approaches are used to minimize this risk. Firstly, the Company uses natural hedging, meaning that it eliminates contrary interest rate risk from primary financial instruments on the asset and liabilities side. The second method is to use interest rate derivatives. These generally take the form of interest rate swaps used in accordance with the Group annual finan­cing strategy to manage cash flow risk from changes in interest rates for variable-rate financial items. As with currency derivatives, hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the Leighton Group— are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. There are also parallel regulations and guidelines, and Consolidated Financial Statements derivatives are used solely for hedging (i.e. not speculatively) as a matter of principle. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are generally banks with a top credit rating. and Notes Group Report 2014 231 The following table shows the fair values of interest rate derivatives: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2014 2013 Assets Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedges) – – for hedging purposes (but not cash flow hedge accounted) – – Interest rate futures not for hedging purposes (for asset management structuring) 190 250 190 250 Liabilities and ­sharehold­ers’ equity Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedges) 450 10,777 for hedging purposes (but not cash flow hedge accounted) 2,461 4,724 Interest rate futures not for hedging purposes (for asset management structuring) 65 294 2,976 15,795 The maximum residual term of interest rate swaps both in cash flow hedges and otherwise as of December 31, 2014 is 31 months (2013: 43 months). The interest rate futures have a maximum residual term of 363 months (2013: 36 months). EUR 10,327 thousand was credited to equity in 2014 (2013: EUR 15,880 thousand) for market value changes on interest rate derivatives in cash flow hedges. As in the prior year, this included EUR 1,190 thousand reclassified to profit or loss. There was no hedge ineffectiveness. A net EUR 2,432 thousand was recognized in profit or loss (2013: EUR 2,705 thousand) for market value changes on the remaining interest rate derivatives. The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact that a 1% fluctuation in the respective market interest rate would have had on equity and on profit or loss. The analysis is based on holdings as of the balance sheet date.

Other price risk stems from participating interests that are classified as available for sale to the extent that they are measured at fair value. Such items are shown in the following table. Participating interests measured at amortized cost because their fair value cannot be reliably measured are not included.

Continuous monitoring and analysis of the markets make it possible to marshal investments at short notice. This allows the Company to detect negative developments on the capital market at an early stage and take appropriate action. Derivatives are only used to control price risk in exceptional instances. To hedge our share-based compensation plans, stock-based derivatives were entered into with a maximum residual term of 51 months as of December 31, 2014 (2013: 63 months). These derivatives are not subject to hedge accounting, but are deployed as a natural hedge. Gains and losses in the fair value of these derivatives are contained in personnel costs. The following table shows the fair values of equity options, stock forward contracts, and index-based options: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2014 2013 Assets Equity options and stock forward contracts for hedging purposes (but not hedge accounted) 7,623 14,906 Index-based options, not for hedging purposes – – 7,623 14,906 Liabilities and sharehold­ers’ equity Forward purchase contracts for hedging purposes (cash flow hedges) – – Equity options and stock forward contracts for hedging purposes (but not hedge accounted) 242 712 Options written, not for hedging purposes – 5,945 242 6,657 As in the prior year, no market value changes on the above forward contracts in cash flow hedges were recognized in Consolidated Financial Statements equity in the year under review.

HOCHTIEF performs risk management for operations by continuously monitoring trade receivables at divisional level. If a specific credit risk is detected, it is countered by recognizing an individual impairment. The HOCHTIEF Group has given third parties financial guarantees in respect of companies accounted for using the equity method. Financial guarantees are only given in respect of companies with top credit standing, restricting to a minimum the probability of the guarantees being drawn upon. Loan commitments are only given to companies accounted for using the equity method. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 234 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The maximum credit risk exposure of financial assets is equivalent to their carrying amounts in the Balance Sheet. The actual credit risk exposure is lower, however, due to collateral given in favor of the HOCHTIEF Group. The maximum risk exposure on financial guarantees given by HOCHTIEF is the maximum amount to be paid by HOCHTIEF. The maximum credit risk for loan commitments is the amount of the commitment. The maximum credit risk from financial guarantees and loan commitments amounted to EUR 195,944 thousand as of December 31, 2014 (2013: EUR 69,237 thousand). The probability of the financial guarantees and loan commitments being drawn upon is very small as of the reporting date. HOCHTIEF accepts collateral to secure contract performance by subcontractors, subcontractors’ warranty obligations, and claims to remuneration. Such collateral includes guarantees relating to warranty obligations, contract performance, advance payments, and receivables. Acceptance of collateral is governed by a HOCHTIEF directive. Among other things, this covers the contractual drafting, implementation, and management of all agreements. The detailed rules vary according to factors such as the country jurisdiction and applicable case law. In the case of credit risk, HOCHTIEF examines the credit rating of the party providing the collateral for all guarantees accepted. HOCHTIEF uses external specialists (for example, rating agencies) to assess credit ratings where possible. The fair values of accepted collateral are not disclosed as they often cannot be measured reliably. The following table shows unimpaired financial assets that are past due: Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 Up to 30 31 to 60 61 to 90 Over 90 Up to 30 31 to 60 61 to 90 Over 90 (EUR thousand) days days days days days days days days Trade receivables 155,438 24,778 19,577 99,334 113,127 33,495 14,362 105,669 Current financial ­receivables 3 144 – 7,528 – 455 274 11,347 Other current receivables and other current financial assets 29 33 – 111 29 – – – 155,470 24,955 19,577 106,973 113,156 33,950 14,636 117,016 The age structure of financial assets that are past due is shaped by industry-specific factors. Receipt of payment depends on acceptance (inspection) and invoice checking, which can often take a relatively long time, especially for large-scale projects. Most of the unimpaired financial assets that are past due are from public-sector clients and industrial companies with top credit ratings.

Capital risk management The HOCHTIEF Group manages capital with the aim of ensuring that all Group companies can continue to operate Consolidated Financial Statements as a going concern. The Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible by optimizing the balance between equity and debt as the need arises. These measures primarily serve to secure the best possible credit standing as well as to maximize shareholder earnings. and Notes The Group’s capital structure consists of the Balance Sheet items comprising net debt (current and non-current liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders’ equity. The Risk Management Steering Committee assesses and examines the Group’s capital structure at regular intervals, taking into account the risk-adjusted cost of capital. The overall capital risk management strategy did not change in 2014 compared with the prior year. 236 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Additional information on financial instruments The table overleaf shows carrying amounts and fair values for each class of financial instrument and carrying amounts for each IAS 39 category as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013: Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2014 237 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2014 Carrying amount by category Not belonging to any category 2013 Carrying amount by category Not belonging to any category Financial assets Financial liabilities (restated) Financial assets Financial liabilities Available for Held for Loans and Held for At amortized Hedge Not covered by Total carryTotal fair Available for Held for Loans and Held for At amortized Hedge Not covered by Total carryTotal fair sale trading receivables trading cost account­ing and IFRS 7 ing amounts value sale trading receivables trading cost accounting and IFRS 7 ing amounts value finance leases Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, finance leases Dec. 31, 2013 Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2014 (EUR thousand) 2013 Assets Assets Other financial assets Other financial assets At fair value 118,732 – – – – – – 118,732 118,732 At fair value 60,371 – – – – – – 60,371 60,371 At amortized cost 10,642 – – – – – – 10,642 N/A At amortized cost 14,897 – – – – – – 14,897 N/A 129,374 – – – – – – 129,374 118,732 75,268 – – – – – – 75,268 60,371 Financial receivables Financial receivables Non-current – – 631,479 – – – – 631,479 631,479 Non-current – – 526,730 – – – – 526,730 526,730 Current – – 77,474 – – – – 77,474 77,474 Current – – 126,934 – – – – 126,934 126,934 Trade receivables – – 2,712,693 – – – 2,353,481 5,066,174 5,066,174 Trade receivables – – 2,336,376 – – – 3,646,703 5,983,079 5,983,079 Other receivables and Other receivables and other financial assets other financial assets Non-current Non-current At fair value – 6,392 – – – 22 – 6,414 6,414 At fair value – 14,948 – – – 558 – 15,506 15,506 At amortized cost – – 1 – – – – 1 1 At amortized cost – – 1 – – – – 1 1 Not covered by IFRS 7 – – – – – – 68,415 68,415 68,415 Not covered by IFRS 7 – – – – – – 78,324 78,324 78,324 – 6,392 1 – – 22 68,415 74,830 74,830 – 14,948 1 – – 558 78,324 93,831 93,831 Current Current At fair value – 3,408 – – – 1,590 – 4,998 4,998 At fair value – 4,340 – – – 7,641 – 11,981 11,981 At amortized cost – – 108,574 – – – – 108,574 108,574 At amortized cost – – 76,206 – – – – 76,206 76,206 Not covered by IFRS 7 – – – – – – 85,473 85,473 85,473 Not covered by IFRS 7 – – – – – – 110,489 110,489 110,489 – 3,408 108,574 – – 1,590 85,473 199,045 199,045 – 4,340 76,206 – – 7,641 110,489 198,676 198,676 Receivables from the sale Receivables from the sale of discontinued operaof discontinued operations – – 1,108,112 – – – – 1,108,112 1,108,112 tions – – – – – – – – – Securities 741,535 – – – – – – 741,535 741,535 Securities 1,123,258 – – – – – – 1,123,258 1,123,258 Cash and cash equivalents – – 2,585,359 – – – – 2,585,359 2,585,359 Cash and cash equivalents – – 2,190,132 – – – – 2,190,132 2,190,132 Liabilities and Liabilities and ­s hareholders’ equity ­s hareholders’ equity Financial liabilities Financial liabilities Non-current – – – – 2,940,778 132,693 – 3,073,471 3,238,759 Non-current – – – – 2,525,293 174,942 – 2,700,235 2,784,768 Current – – – – 916,779 65,595 – 982,374 982,374 Current – – – – 629,440 97,346 – 726,786 726,786 Trade payables – – – – 4,692,790 – 820,635 5,513,425 5,513,425 Trade payables – – – – 5,656,851 – 191,531 5,848,382 5,848,382 Other liabilities Other liabilities Non-current Non-current At fair value – – – 756 – 593 – 1,349 1,349 At fair value – – – 3,020 – 5,087 – 8,107 8,107 Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements At amortized cost – – – – 73 – – 73 73 At amortized cost – – – – – – – – – Not covered by IFRS 7 – – – – – – 31,768 31,768 31,768 Not covered by IFRS 7 – – – – – – 34,541 34,541 34,541 – – – 756 73 593 31,768 33,190 33,190 – – – 3,020 – 5,087 34,541 42,648 42,648 Current Current At fair value – – – 2,758 – 1,759 – 4,517 4,517 At fair value – – – 10,035 – 9,160 – 19,195 19,195 and Notes and Notes At amortized cost – – – – 122,865 – – 122,865 122,865 At amortized cost – – – – 135,268 – – 135,268 135,268 Not covered by IFRS 7 – – – – – – 272,271 272,271 272,271 Not covered by IFRS 7 – – – – – – 306,382 306,382 306,382 – – – 2,758 122,865 1,759 272,271 399,653 399,653 – – – 10,035 135,268 9,160 306,382 460,845 460,845 238 Group Report 2014 Group Report 2014 239 Because current financial instruments have short residual terms and are measured at market value, their carrying amounts correspond to market value as of the balance sheet date. Non-current securities in the available-for-sale category are measured at fair value through equity and, as such, their carrying amounts also correspond to fair value. Shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests are measured at fair value if fair value can be reliably determined. Otherwise, such items are measured at cost in the available-for-sale category. In the disclosures on the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). For non-financial assets, fair value is measured assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. A three-level hierarchy is applied that reflects the observability of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e.g. quoted securities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); e.g. interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. Level 3: No relevant observable inputs available, hence unobservable inputs are determined as an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability; e.g. investments measured at fair value determined by business valuation.

The fair value of investments in unlisted entities and of debt instruments not traded in an active market is measured using the discounted cash flow method. Any discounting is done using current market interest rates. 240 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Reconciliation of beginning to ending balances for Level 3 measurements of financial instrument fair values Balance as Currency Gains/(losses) Other Balance as of Jan. 1, ­adjustments recognized in profit changes of Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2014 or loss 2014 Other financial assets 59,098 2,272 (68) 13,388 74,690 Other liabilities Non-current – – – – – Current 5,945 – – (5,945) – Balance as Currency Gains/(losses) Other Balance as of Jan. 1, ­adjustments recognized in profit changes of Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2013 or loss 2013 Other financial assets 75,073 (12,900) (13,307) 10,232 59,098 Other liabilities Non-current – – – – – Current – – (5,945) – 5,945 The EUR 68 thousand in losses recognized in profit or loss are included in net income from other participating interests.

segmental data Intersegment sales represent revenue generated between divisions. They are transacted on an arm’s length basis. External sales mainly comprise revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining, in the amount of EUR 18,448,153 thousand (2013: EUR 18,649,776 thousand). The sum of external sales and intersegment sales gives total sales revenue for each division. The share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and jointly controlled entities comprises income and expenses, including impairment losses relating to companies accounted for using the equity method. Depreciation and amortization relate to intangible assets with finite useful lives, property, plant and equipment, and investment properties. The impairment losses relate to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, and financial assets. Purchases comprise additions to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, equitymethod investments (excluding equity-method adjustments), subsidiaries, and other participating interests. Total assets are equivalent to the divisions’ totals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gross debt equals total assets minus consolidated shareholders’ equity. Operational earnings (EBITA) are derived from earnings from operating activities as follows: 2014 2013 (EUR thousand) (restated) Earnings from operating activities (75,332) 585,905 + Net income from participat­ing interests 118,488 210,364 – Non-operating earnings (+) 515,568 (+) 105,049 Operational earnings (EBITA) 558,724 901,318 The derivation of operational earnings from earnings from operating activities is based on the following considera­ tions: Net income from participating interests contains all income and expense from equity stakes held for operational Consolidated Financial Statements purposes and is thus an integral part of the Group’s operational earnings. Income and expenses classified as exceptional items for business management purposes or resulting from exceptional transactions hinder analysis of ordinary operations and should be attributed to non-operational earnings. and Notes Consolidated earnings from operating activities were adjusted in the year under review by non-operational earnings of EUR 515,568 thousand (2013: EUR 105,049 thousand). The non-operational earnings item in the year under review relates to an accounting provision to cover credit risk on project receivables in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division along with restructuring expenses. 37. Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows classifies cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities. Exchange rate effects are eliminated and their influence on the cash position is disclosed separately. Changes in cash and cash equivalents due to acquisitions and disposals of consolidated companies are shown separately under cash used in or provided by investing activities. The EUR 309,079 thousand decrease (2013: EUR 16,720 thousand) in cash and cash equivalents due to consolidation changes consists in its entirety of cash and cash equivalents disposed of in divestments. The prior-year figure was the balance of EUR 21,936 thousand in cash and cash equivalents disposed of in divestments and EUR 5,216 thousand in cash and cash equivalents from acquisitions. 248 Group Report 2014 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The EUR 2,585,359 thousand (2013: EUR 2,190,132 thousand) year-end total for cash and cash equivalents shown on the cash flow statement matches the cash and cash equivalents item on the balance sheet. The total comprises EUR 1,574 thousand (2013: EUR 1,988 thousand) in petty cash, EUR 2,316,922 thousand (2013: EUR 1,905,743 thousand) in cash balances at banks, and EUR 266,863 thousand (2013: EUR 282,401 thousand) in marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents to the value of EUR 26,518 thousand are subject to restrictions (2013: EUR 65,553 thousand). Net cash provided by operating activities represented a cash inflow of EUR 756,033 thousand. The balance of cash flows relating to capital expenditure and asset disposals/divestments resulted in EUR 178,595 thousand in net cash used in investing activities. The increase in the equity interest in Leighton Holdings, purchases of treasury stock, and dividend payments made up the main factors in the cash outflow of EUR 375,809 thousand comprising net cash used in financing activities. Including exchange rate changes, cash and cash equivalents increased overall by EUR 395,227 thousand. All non-cash income and expense and all income from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation is eliminated in net cash provided by or used for operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities included: • Interest income of EUR 57,272 thousand (2013: EUR 46,119 thousand), • Interest expenses of EUR 284,606 thousand (2013: EUR 312,629 thousand), • Income tax paid amounting to EUR 81,792 thousand (2013: EUR 120,562 thousand). After deducting the non-cash component of income from equity-accounted interests, net income received (as dividends) from such interests was EUR 106,844 thousand (2013: EUR 195,557 thousand). Divestments relate to the deconsolidation of fully consolidated subsidiaries. This reduced non-current assets by EUR 342,708 thousand (2013: EUR 1,953,357 thousand) and current assets by EUR 1,665,507 thousand (2013: EUR 334,661 thousand). Non-current liabilities decreased by EUR 60,192 thousand (2013: EUR 32,837 thousand) and current liabilities by EUR 1,352,758 thousand (2013: EUR 324,588 thousand). As of the balance sheet date, EUR 145,350 thousand (2013: EUR 2,131,612 thousand) of the EUR 1,067,124 thousand (2013: EUR 2,131,612 thousand) sale proceeds were settled in the form of cash and cash equivalents. Dividends of EUR 103,964 thousand (2013: EUR 73,613 thousand) were paid to HOCHTIEF’s shareholders in the year under review. Dividends paid to minority shareholders totaled EUR 108,120 thousand (2013: 357,608 thousand). The prior-year figure included large cash outflows in connection with the sale of the airport business. Consolidated Financial Statements Debt repayments came to EUR 1,147,210 thousand (2013: EUR 2,757,684 thousand), compared with EUR 1,650,551 thousand (2013: EUR 2,617,671 thousand) in new borrowing. and Notes Financial assets and financial liabilities are made up as follows: Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 (EUR thousand) (restated) Cash and cash equivalents 2,585,359 2,190,132 Receivables from the sale of discontinued operations 1,108,112 – Marketable securities 741,535 1,123,258 Non-current securities – 260 Total financial assets 4,435,006 3,313,650 Bonds or notes issued, and amounts due to banks 3,815,963 3,080,922 Lease liabilities 198,288 272,288 Financial liabilities 4,014,251 3,353,210 Net financial assets (+)/Net financial liabilities (-) including receivables from the sale of discontinued operations 420,755 (39,560) Group Report 2014 249 The total financial assets of EUR 4,435,006 thousand include, under receivables from the sale of discontinued operations, EUR 1,108,112 thousand in sale proceeds under the binding agreements for the sale of John Holland and of the Services business at Thiess and Leighton Contractors. The cash inflow from these transactions is expected in the near future. Financial assets are subject to certain restrictions on their use. Other than by financial liabilities, financial assets are offset by advance payments from clients, cash call commitments on financial assets, and order exposure from awarded capital expenditure projects. Advance payments from clients came to EUR 813,320 thousand (2013: EUR 173,393 thousand) and serve to fund contract costs. Cash call commitments on financial assets totaled EUR 19,068 thousand (2013: EUR 36,817 thousand), relating in the amount of EUR 13,059 thousand (2013: EUR 14,676 thousand) to PPP project companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division and EUR 6,009 thousand (2013: EUR 22,141 thousand) to jointly controlled entities in the HOCHTIEF Europe division.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable in the EU, and the regulations under German commercial law as complementarily applicable under § 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) is the responsibility of the Company’s Executive Board. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the group management report based on our audit. We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 German Commercial Code (HGB) in compliance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting regulations and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and evaluations of possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of the companies included in consolidation, the determination of the companies to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the Executive Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit has not led to any reservations. In our opinion, which is based on the results of our audit, the consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, comply with the IFRS, as applicable in the EU, and the regulations under German commercial law as complementarily applicable under § 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and conConsolidated Financial Statements vey a true and fair view of the Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations in accordance with these regulations. The group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, conveys, in the aggregate, a true and fair view of the Company’s and Group’s position and suitably presents the risks and opportunities of future development. and Notes Düsseldorf, February 25, 2015 Deloitte & Touche GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Schlereth) (Bedenbecker) Wirtschaftsprüfer (German Public Auditor) Wirtschaftsprüfer (German Public Auditor) Group Report 2014 257 Sustainability at HOCHTIEF Focus Area Corporate Citizenship Bridges boost quality of life in Rwanda In harmony with people and nature MY OUR COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTION Economy: Economic growth and trade are dependent on access to markets. The right infrastructure provides that access. We partnered with the non-profit organization Bridges to Prosperity again in 2014 and helped people in Rwanda, this time in the Ngororero district, gain better access to schools, markets, and medical facilities. The new 54-meter-long footbridge over the Kiromozi River is used by some 350 locals every day. Ecology: Our team used mostly regionally-sourced materials and simple tools to build the bridge. They were careful to preserve the natural surroundings and leave the river’s flow undisturbed. Community: Ten HOCHTIEF employees worked with villagers to complete the bridge. This taught the locals bridge-building skills they can now use and share with others. The HOCHTIEF group also learned a lot Further Information Further Information about Rwandan culture.
