To resolve these issues, it will be important to develop mechanisms for supplying lumber from tree promoting wood biomass, issues thinning in a way that leads to good forestry policy and to establish a supply chain. If we can do that, I affecting wood biomass, and Takuma’s believe we will be able to properly maintain forests that have been neglected and to rebuild both forests role in the future. and the forestry industry. At the same time, wood biomass generating plants are being built nationwide in Mr. Kumazaki: Back at the beginning of the 1990s, response to the introduction of FIT. If use of wood biomass as an energy source continues to grow, we will Japanese facilities such as lumber plants see those plants competing for raw materials with companies that manufacture products such as paper Stakeholder were paying ¥10,000 to ¥20,000 per pulp and wood boards. It is desirable that the industry develop with a good balance between use of wood Dialog ton to dispose of wood chips from biomass resources for energy and other use for material manufacturing. lumber manufacture. Around the Mr. Matsuhashi: Takuma has delivered numerous wood biomass boilers to private industry. We’re seeing more inquiries as a same time, Sweden was already using result of FIT. As part of our new three-year Medium-Term Management Plan, which began this April, we’re wood chips as an important boiler planning to develop larger, more efficient plants as well as plants with a generating capacity of less than fuel, and I became acutely aware of 2,000 kW using wood biomass from sources such as thinned lumber. We’re hoping to create long-term the importance of using this resource relationships with customers that include regular maintenance service. In this regard, we would love to as a source of energy. Later, there hear more about your expectations toward Takuma as well as any advice you might have. were new developments in this area in Mr. Kumazaki: Going forward, I suspect that small facilities will be the rule, rather than large ones. However, a facility with Austria and Germany, somewhat later a capacity of less than 2,000 kW running on wood biomass from thinned lumber will require a system that than they had occurred in Northern excels at supplying heat and electricity. It would be difficult for such a facility to operate profitably just Europe. As the price of lumber for from about 2,000 kW of electricity generation. I think it would be important for such a facility to incorpoconstruction use fell worldwide and rate innovations that enable it to make effective use of heat as well. In Europe, plants with generating made it more challenging for lumber capacities ranging from several hundreds of kilowatts to 1,000 kW use ORC∗. I would expect facilities with plants to operate, companies in a generating capacity of about 2,000 kW to incorporate either ORC or a system that enables them to Austria and Germany discovered a way accommodate a broad range of biomass fuel. to use waste lumber left over from those plants in an effective manner. It became standard practice at Mr. Matsuhashi: Takuma Group company Nippon Thermoener Co., Ltd., sells pellet boilers, which it has delivered to a number large lumber plants to incinerate bark in order to generate electricity and to use wood chips and planer of customers. Going forward, we plan to supply products that satisfy customers through a Group-wide chips in order to manufacture pellets. Drying the raw materials is an essential step in manufacturing pellets, effort, with Takuma offering large boilers and Nippon Thermoener offering general-purpose boilers. and waste heat from the incineration of bark in order to generate electricity was used as the heat source Mr. Kumazaki: Pellets lend themselves to storage as a fuel. Takuma should be able to accommodate the wishes of various for the drying process. In this way, “cascading use,” a term that refers to the thorough, waste-free use of regions and customers thanks to the wide range of boilers it offers and its delivery track record. the entire log at lumber plants, made a dramatic contribution to these plants’ bottom line. Incidentally, this approach to cascading use had not been implemented at Japanese lumber plants at the time. Due to ∗ ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle): A system that evaporates a macromolecular organic media instead of water vapor to generate electricity using a turbine. the facilities’ small size, they were unable to install wood chip boilers for drying lumber and instead used fuel oil for that purpose. Consequently, wood waste such as bark with low utilization value was being disposed of as industrial waste until extremely recently. With the soaring cost of crude oil in recent years, Response from Takuma there has been a move to switch from fuel oil boilers to wood fuel boilers. However, it was extremely unusual for operators to incorporate a power generation system. There are about 20 million square meters of unutilized thinned lumber that could be used as wood biomass in Japan Mr. Matsuhashi: With the introduction of FIT, all that changed in an instant. (according to the Forestry Agency’s website), but the quality and quantity of such unutilized lumber varies greatly by Mr. Kumazaki: FIT makes it an extremely good idea to use lumber from tree thinning as a renewable energy resource, and region. Takuma has a history of delivering a broad range of wood biomass power boilers, and we have a track record I believe we must make skillful use of such lumber. However, a boost in purchase prices due to FIT of supplying optimal systems to our customers. Going forward, we will work to help resolve social issues while doesn’t mean that such lumber will be magically supplied from our mountain forests.

Shigeki Kobatake General Manager, CSR Department Mr. Takaoka: My expectations concern heat recovery for sewage sludge. While working together on the B-DASH Mr. Shishida: In FY2013, Takuma participated in a joint Project, I realized that if research group carrying out the Demonstate-of-the-art technolstration Study of Power Generation System ogy from not only sludge with Sewage Sludge Incineration as part dehydration, but also other of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, processes could be incorTransport and Tourism’s Breakthrough by porated into the system, it Dynamic Approach in Sewage High Techwould be possible to incinnology Project (B-DASH Project∗).

Consequently, my hope is that sludge will be used in the future. Takuma will shepherd this technology into widespread use. Concerning the significance of combining the Mr. Takaoka: Sewage sludge is a type of biomass, and technology with waste treatment, the fact that you’ve established your stoker furnaces in a solid position in it can be considered both a waste waste treatment means that if you combine those products with dehydration for sewage sludge, both techproduct and a resource.

What are your thoughts? sewage sludge that is output by the Mr. Takaoka: I agree. We generate about 40 million tons of municipal waste every year and about 10 million tons of sewage process used to purify sewage as a Stakeholder sludge, even after a typical amount of dehydration (removing 80% of moisture). Sewage sludge accounts for resource that has been accumulated in one-fourth of municipal waste, making it a waste product that is generated in extremely high volume. HowDialog our cities. If sewage sludge can be ever, because sewage sludge is comparatively easy to collect, as I mentioned earlier, I believe that we should effectively used as a biomass resource, it make effective use of it. Experts predict Japan’s population will decline in the future, which means that we can serve as a source of energy. must create efficient mechanisms if we are to ensure the continuity of society. I believe that we have to think Mr. Shishida: The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transabout pursuing solutions that deliver efficiency, consolidation, and compound effectiveness when we port and Tourism has issued a series of consider the overall direction for society.

However, excessive reliance on that Japanese government seems to be moving approach may require auxiliary fuel when incinerating leftover residues. In addition, when considering how to toward promoting this type of use. To combine waste and sewage sludge treatment, we must bear in mind the fact that the optimal treatment date, there have been two methods of approach depends on the properties of the waste in question. If we also think about other types of infrastrucconverting sewage sludge into a source of ture according to the characteristics of each region, I think we’ll be able to create good systems. energy: methane fermentation and fuel conversion. Working with you, we developed a third approach: incinerMr. Kobatake: Would you share your thoughts on how to use the ash that remains after incineration? ating sewage sludge to generate electricity. What are your expectations with regard to this new approach? Mr. Takaoka: Sewage sludge contains large amounts of phosphorus, and I think it’s important to recover that element. Mr. Takaoka: Since sewage sludge is a biomass resource, it has the property of being carbon neutral. In short, since the CO2 Phosphorus is essential in the production of food, but Japan has to import most of its supply. There are also that is released when sewage sludge is burned does not count toward global warming, this is a major benefit concerns about phosphorus depletion. Recovery technologies are being used in some facilities in Japan, but in the conversion of sludge into energy. Methane fermentation is a good technology, but organic materials they have not been adopted widely due to cost issues. Phosphorus is a resource, so I think we have to use it remain after fermentation, necessitating additional treatment. As fuel conversion works in Japan, sewage effectively. Fifteen years have passed since the enactment of the Basic Act on Establishing a Sound Materialsludge is transported to coal-fired power plants and cement plants, which use it in a comparatively efficient Cycle Society.

Sewage treatment plants generally consume energy, and experts believe they account for 0.8% to 1% of Japan’s total power consumption. In light of these plants’ energy consumption, I see the ability of this technology to create power Response from Takuma as extremely significant.

As a result, I gained an understanding of Takuma’s deep commitment as a company to eliminating accidents. Like other companies, we are working to eliminate accidents, and we’ve been able to achieve record safety over the last several years as a result. This accomplishment is the fruit of our worksite representatives’ and employees’ hard work. I am grateful for the realization that the training gave me that our head office had not been following up adequately on operations in the field. I’ve taken what I learned back to my company, where I look forward to putting it to good use in future activities.
