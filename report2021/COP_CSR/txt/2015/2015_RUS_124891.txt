What will the first area of emphasis be? In my opinion, it is very important that employees sense the cohesion of the team, which is achieved when each understands that they are united by the common mission and common vision of the Corporation companies’ goals, and that the achievement of these goals will help make our world better. All of our activities, including investments in social projects, are aimed at fulfilling our chosen mission of social entrepreneurship. In 2013, we thoroughly developed areas of social investment along with our strategic partners. In each of the companies that help us implement our charitable and voluntary programmes, portfolios were focused on the Corporation’s strategic priority — the development of valuebased social entrepreneurship. Our financial businesses placed an emphasis on the development of socially conscious products.

Increased efficiency will allow the Bank to reduce its total expenses to less than RUB 17.5 billion by 2015 and take a leading position by efficiency – even matching the efficiency levels of European banks, based on these indicators. In the corporate banking business, the focus should be on servicing medium-sized business, especially in the regions. Retail business is our driving force, which should be developed by implementing new technologies. For this reason, it is important to establish an effective and multichannel interaction with customers, including through the development of e-business, by proactively offering financial services to customers based on our understanding of their needs. We need to adjust our banking sales channels and establish offices in order to proactively offer customers access to all the products and services of FC operating companies. Overall, increased efficiency RUB will enable the Bank to reduce 17.5 billion its total expenses to less than RUB 17.5 billion by 2015 and take a leading position by efficiency. Airat Gaskarov Deputy Chairman of the Management Board of URALSIB Bank 55 Social investments Environmental policy Long-term wealth management Rebranding Private Bank was a bold and responsible step. How would you describe the Company’s new market position? This year we switched from the “Exclusive Service” concept to one of “First Russian Private Bank in an International Format”. It resulted in the change of the Bank’s name from URALSIB |Bank 121 to URALSIB | Private Bank, as well as a change of its logo, slogan and corporate identity. We must move with the times. One of the precursors for these changes was the shift in generations of owners of large capital in Russia and, hence, the formation of a new target clientele for private banking. Olga Degtyareva Chief Executive Officer of URALSIB | Private Bank integrated 56 report | 2013 Corporate governance Events and awards Appendices Financial corporation URALSIB At URALSIB | Private Bank, we define the new generation of strategies, we offer a wide range of investment instruments, capital owners as “analysts”.

This is mainly due to the to successfully manage family capital. In my opinion, this beneficial deposit rates that private banks in Russia offer in approach will define the Russian private banking agenda comparison to Western banks. for the next few years. Moreover, the former generation of capital owners have mostly strived to keep their capital. Those customers, certainly, were interested in the options of keeping and increasing their capital, but they were also ready to discuss investment ideas – as the government bonds of developed countries, and structured notes with capital protection – that allowed them to build income without increasing their portfolio risk level. The new generation owners are usually ready to accept a larger degree of risk in investing — and we are ready to offer both balanced and aggressive strategies.

Despite the constantly changing market situation, one of our areas of development focus will also be around complex products offered to customers who prefer highquality broker services with a personal account manager, entailing the development of a personal strategy and the optimisation of investment opportunities. What are your forecasts for the near future? The Russian stock market will, most likely, remain under the influence of negative factors relating to both general prospects for the Russian economy and continuing capital outflow from Russia. Under these conditions, our attention will be focused on a narrow market segment — oil and gas companies and companies related with final consumption whose cash flows are less influenced by the slowdown of the economic growth; promising a reasonable dividend yield to investors. The limited prospects of the stock market overlap with considerably decreased rates of rerun in the debt market. That is why one should not expect high income from the Russian financial markets in the near future. Mark Temkin Chief Executive Officer of URALSIB | Capital 63 Social investments Environmental policy Anticipating customers’ expectations What were the most important 2013 events for your Company? 2013 was not bad for us: there was no serious downfall in the leasing market. At the same time, the large transaction sector has been through a difficult time, because it is linked to government transactions in investment projects and traditionally depends on the policy of state-owned banks. Will the tendency towards an increase in the number of large transactions continue in 2014? It is more than likely that development of this segment will depend on state support programmes for certain companies in the form of the purchase of equipment, aircraft, rail cars, ships and other property. If there is enough money in the budget, or sufficient lobbying for the realisation of these programmes, large transactions will remain at the 2013 level. Failing that, we will see a considerable decrease in the number of large transactions in the most significant industries.

In most cases, we must understand and anticipate what will be ordered and work with the supplier to create the relevant purchasing and pricing policies. This is necessary because pricing competition results in decreased profits, so profit becomes possible only on other components of the transaction: the incoming purchase price and additional services. In this way, operational leasing will become widespread. 65 Strategy About the Company Economic efficiency Social investments Environmental policy From common interests to effective customer policy Insurance Group URALSIB has been increasing sales and to increase control over expenses.

First of all, the centralisation and unification of processes in the Bank’s credit factory were carried out. Our specialists put into operation a unified, centralised module of decision making which takes into account all aspects of customer risks. Thanks to more effective automated data verification and making objective decisions on credit applications, the number of people involved in the assessment process was considerably reduced. In addition to the decision-making module modernisation, we updated the system of registering changes in the formation of delayed payments and reserves. Now, the model takes into account many critical parameters: the specifics of current and planned disbursements of credit products, the credit quality of the portfolio, and its behaviour in stressful economic situations. Such a comprehensive approach will enable us to substantially increase the efficiency of our debt collection activities.
