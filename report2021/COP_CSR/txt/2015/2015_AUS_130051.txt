For example, we employ over 50 women in various roles across ten countries, which we believe is significantly higher than industry norms. We also have a number of women in our Senior Management team, who provide a central role in the strategy and decision making process. For example, the recruitment process for aviation positions is based on skills, qualifications, experience on aircraft type and security clearance/assessment. The process is therefore performance based and is blind to issues of gender, sexuality, race, religious beliefs etc. THE ENVIRONMENT Unity Community Relations Policy PRINCIPLE 7 Unity maintains an Environmental Policy Businesses Unity is well aware of the impact that the that provides guidance for our should support companies activities may have on local programmes and projects.

Each manager must submit a quarterly report each year outlining how they have sought to implement this programme and how successful this has been. This process also highlights shortfalls and areas for improvement. Guidelines for Corporate Social Responsibility targets are formulated at Board level with the input of the CSR-WG and circulated accordingly. The CSR-WG also releases a quarterly questionnaire to all personnel to assist us in measuring our success against our overall CSR target. All personnel are welcome to join the CSR-WG. The results of our quantitative/qualitative assessment is communicated to all stakeholders annually so that the organisation and other interested parties can track our performance. This enables us to foster a corporate environment of transparency and accountability. Unity Resources Group Pte Ltd Tel: +971 4 705 9000 Fax: +971 4 705 9001 Suite 504 Festival Tower P.O.
