Institution / Govt. Agency Nos. of Audits/Inspections during No. of Audits/Inspections during 2013 2014 Over 8 Inspections State Pollution Control Board Approx. 08 to 10 inspections Over 3 Inspections MOEF 3 4 inspections DG MS 8 inspections 13 Inspections 9 Audits OISD 11 Audits 2. Ensure that the organization is not complicit in human rights abuses We at OIL believe that employees are not to be subjected to forced or compulsory labour which is also a fundamental provision of the principle of human rights. The same is also in accordance with UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is subject to ILO Core Conventions 29 & 105. We prohibit the deployment of forced labour across our entire operations. For the current reporting period we did not have a single operation or any significant suppliers exposed to the risk of forced or compulsory labour. 3. Upholding the freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective Bargaining Collective bargaining is the protection of the right of workers to organize collectively in organizations of their own choice. We uphold and support the freedom of association of our employees by recognizing and encouraging the right to collective bargaining. The employees’ union engages with the management through structured as well as informal mechanisms. We also keep a close eye on the operations in which the freedom of association might be at risk. For the last three years we have not been able to identify a single such instance and it speaks volumes about the efficiency of our control system. We have organized discussion sessions with the officers’ association for understanding their basic needs and developing plan of action for acting on those requirements. We ensure all around participation in the events of workers union. 4. Organization supports the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour OIL believes in voluntary labour and right to work. As per directives of the Government of India, the Company ensures payment of minimum wages to labour. The Company also abides by the strict statutory guidelines laid down by the Mines Safety Directorate, the Industrial Act and other statutory regulations of the Government of India. We prohibit the deployment of forced labour across our entire operations. For the current reporting period we did not have a single operation or any significant suppliers exposed to the risk of forced or compulsory labour. 5. The organization supports effective abolition of child labour OIL ensures that every single one of its installations is routinely monitored to ensure that no child labour is employed at any of them. We strongly condemn the use of child labour and the nature of our operations that require years of training and experience to carry out are a natural barrier to prevent child labour. We also perform a rigorous process of due diligence before employing suppliers to ensure that there is no incidence of child labour in their operations among other ills. 6. Organization promotes elimination of discrimination in respect of employment The Company is an equal opportunity employer. There is no discrimination for employment or career progression on the basis of caste, gender, colour or religion. Government guidelines are strictly followed for employment of scheduled castes/scheduled tribes and physically challenged persons. 7. The organization adopts a precautionary approach to Environmental Challenges OIL is well aware of the myriad impacts that its operations have on the Environment. Our business operations by their very nature are prone to negative environmental impacts. We take this fact very seriously and have therefore made a commitment to ourselves and our stakeholders to ensure that we mitigate our environmental impacts to the greatest extent possible. OIL follows the precautionary approach to manage its environmental challenges. We also put a lot of emphasis on control of environmental pollution and conservation of energy and have always adopted a proactive approach to the conservation of the environment. This endeavour of the Company is reflected in the vision of the Company which clearly mentions OIL’s commitment to Safety, Health & Environment. Following are the existing environmental standards/rules acts enforceable under mandatory regulations and strictly followed by the organization: ü Tolerance Limits prescribed by State Pollution Control Board, Assam and Central Pollution Control Board for effluent discharge. ü Environmental Protection Act, 1986 & Rules. ü W at er Act & R ule s. ü A i r A ct & R u le s. ü The Batteries (Management & Handling) Rules, 2001. ü The Municipal Solid Waste (Management & Handling) Rules, 2000. ü The Bio-Medical Waste (Management & Handling) Rules, 1998. ü Noise Pollution (Regulation or control) Rules. ü Public Liability Insurance Act & Rules, 1991. ü The Ozone Depleting substances (Regulation & control) Rules, 2000. ü Hazardous Waste (management, handling, & trans boundary movement) rules, 2008 8. The organization initiates promotion of greater environmental responsibility OIL has adopted key environmental management practices, pollution control measures and environmental management systems as crucial mitigation measures. Several Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies have been carried out for all its upcoming projects. The social issues and societal impacts are assessed & measured and mitigation measures are implemented as per the recommendations of the EIA studies. Some of the key Environment Mitigation Measures Adopted in OIL are detailed below: Ø As a measure of safeguarding the environment a policy decision has been taken for mandatory use of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Chain of Custody Certified Paper and Print Products in all sphere of OIL, wef 12.09.2012 Ø For judicious use of paper, OIL has adopted a policy wef 18.12.2014 on “Economic Use of Paper in Offices” in all spheres of OIL, as the trees are considered the major source of paper pulp production and injudicious use of paper would create bad impacts on the environment. The basic guidelines of the policy are – To use both side of the paper, Single spacing typings, Policy or other circulars through website instead of paper circulation, switching over to eform system than manual submission of returns etc and recasting of proforma etc in a Simplified & shortened format. Ø Rain Water Harvesting has been made mandatory for all upcoming projects Ø OIL has carried out a full-fledged study on effect of gas flare on surrounding paddy crop and initiated mitigation measures accordingly. Ø Green belts are developed and maintained around major installations. Annually 7,000-8,000 trees are planted in different operational areas, survival rate of which is about 80-90%. OIL’s endeavor to harness Non-conventional Energy sources: Ø We, at OIL have installed 13.6 MW (31.03.2012) & 54 MW Wind Power plants (30.03.2013) in Rajasthan, which are supplying power to Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd (RRVUNL). Ø We also installed first mega Solar Power Plan of capacity 5 MW in Ramgarh, Jaisalmer, Rajasthan (20.01.2014). We have further plans to take up more projects in both Wind and Solar Power in near future. Ø OIL has Installed Solar Power Plants of various ratings – 100 KW at Joypur OCS (31.03.2012), 100 KW at Tanot Village Complex, Jaisalmer (31.03.2013) , 30 KW at Corporate Office (16.07.2012), 20 KW at Jagi Road Repeater Stations in Pipeline (28.10.2014)– We have plans to install more such solar plants at various locations including Gujrat & Madhya Pradesh. Ø Replacement of conventional Generator Sets with a 30 KVA Solar Generator Set in FHQ for night illumination purpose at Work-over locations has been carried out and is proposed for more locations Ø OIL has carried out installation of Solar Lighting Systems, Solar Lanterns & Solar PhotoVoltaic cells atTanot-GGS , Baghewala (Rajasthan), Security Camp at Well-279. It is also used for MART Communication system at Fields Head Quarters of OIL, and in OIL’s pipeline systems. Its use is proposed for more similar locations. In addition to having a sound Environment Policy, the Company also has a robust Sustainable Development Policy. The Sustainable Development Policy of OIL outlines its commitment towards reducing its carbon footprint. The Company calculates the carbon footprint and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission level of various operational units. To reduce GHG emissions, a Low Carbon Strategy is evolved as part of which OIL has identified opportunities for reducing GHG emissions through technology, process improvement levers and a strategic implementation plan. This strategy is then extended in initiating projects such as the proposed 5.0 MW Kumchai Power Plant (KPP), which was inaugurated in November, 2013. The proposed site of power plant is in the Changlang District of Arunachal Pradesh and is about 450 Kms from Itanagar. The power plant is to be fed with the associated gas production (presently approximately of 30,000 SCMD) for running this KPP. It is proposed that the existing 11 KV line would be converted to 33 KV line for evacuation of power. The project will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions because of a reduction in the flaring of gas. It will also lead to the utilisation of high calorific value gas, which is presently flared as a substitute for higher carbon intensive fuels. Finally it is set to have the beneficial impact towards conservation of depleting non-renewable natural resources and thus the promotion of sustainable economic growth via the implementation of an environment friendly technology. The Company has taken many other proactive measures on the front of environmental management and Sustainable Development, including initiation of projects on conservation of endangered biodiversity in and around its operational areas in India. The project on conservation of the Hoolock Gibbon, the only non-human ape species found in the entire Indian subcontinent is noteworthy. The species is listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red list & on CITES Appendix-I and is also listed on schedule-I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972. OIL has taken an ambitious project for spreading awareness for the conservation of this important species in its operational districts in upper Assam, which form one of the its’ last home ranges in India. Western Hoolock Gibbon (Female) Secondly, the Company has undertaken an initiative for supplementing the facilities of the forest guards of the Kaziranga Tiger Reserve, by providing them solar lamps for their guard posts. This small but significant initiative is set to provide support to these protectors of this world heritage site and help them in maintaining Kaziranga’s status as the most secure place in the world for the Asiatic One Horned Rhino. In addition, the Company is also planning to set up an eco-tourism centre in the Kaziranga Tiger reserve, with the help of Assam Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. (ATDCL). Illustrative photograph: Two One Horned Rhinoceros in their prime habitat in the Kaziranga Tiger Reserve and National Park The Company has also planned a project on mass tree plantation in degraded forest landscapes in and around its operational areas, which is set to provide a solution to combat Climate Change through sequestration of GHGs through the plantation of trees with high carbon absorption potential. As such, OIL carries out compensatory & obligatory tree plantation in its operational areas. In the year 2013-14 OIL has compositely planted more than 3000 trees in 2 hectares of land. 9. Organization should encourage development and diffusion of environment friendly technologies In the above context, the following Environment Mitigation Measures have been adopted in OIL: Ø Pilot project of using Bio Diesel fuel in Diesel Engines, is an initiative of OIL towards implementation of Bio-fuel policy of Govt. of India. Ø OIL in collaboration with TERI has taken up bioremediation project for treating the hazardous waste. In the year 2013-14, 9,028 m3 of oily sludge was bio remediated. The said project is taken up for applicable cases. Ø In collaboration with Institute of Advanced studies in Science & Technology, Guwahati OIL had taken up a Pilot Project on Phytoremediation, where selected species of plants were planted in oil contaminated plot of land size (30m X 20m) near Jorajan OCS. These plants degraded the hydrocarbon and heavy metal content of the contaminated area was restored to its normalcy – considering the success, OIL is planning to take out more such projects in other areas. Ø OIL has undertaken various environmental projects such as bioremediation, GHG emission & carbon footprint mapping, E-Waste management, Integarted Waste Mangement etc in all spheres of OIL . Ø Proper enclosures around the flare pits are provided, which helps in combating the effect of heat & light on the crops/environment Ø Flare pits are properly designed with multi burner facilities with arrangement of abundant supply of air for proper combustion Ø 95% of the Produced Formation Water is Recycled to Subsurface for the purpose of maintaining formation pressure Ø Water oil clarification plants are installed wherever necessary to restrict the oil content less than 10 ppm Ø Solid waste and biomedical waste are disposed as per Municipal Solid Waste Rules & Biomedical Waste Rules Ø Hazardous wastes are treated as per “The Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Trans boundary Movement) Rules, 2008, and sent to TSDF facilities (Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities), for which OIL has taken Membership Ø Oily sludge is recycled through registered recyclers. Ø OIL is also in the process of installing a sludge treatment and recovery plant.
