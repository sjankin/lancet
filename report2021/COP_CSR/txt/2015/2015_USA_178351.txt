United Nations Global Compact Communication of Progress With the publication of Eastman’s 2015 sustainability report, Gaining momentum, I am pleased to reaffirm our company’s commitment to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) with respect to the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption. For me, sustainability is about balance – maintaining sustainable business operations while doing great things for the environment and for people. This balanced focus leads to a better future for all of us. To that end, we have emphasized our focus on value chain collaboration over the past year. We continue to be an active voice in the chemical industry as well as other industries looking to improve sustainability. We have also strengthened our engagement through organizations such as World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and Together for Sustainability (TfS). Additionally, we are working downstream with brands and retailers to gain insights, which we then share with our customers and suppliers to drive the development of innovative, sustainable solutions. Throughout the report, we describe the progress we have made over the past year in support of our sustainability strategy and the ten UNGC principles, including the establishment of a new Code of Business Conduct. As we move forward, we will continue to refine our strategy to create collective impact for all our stakeholders while advancing these principles. Mark J. Costa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
