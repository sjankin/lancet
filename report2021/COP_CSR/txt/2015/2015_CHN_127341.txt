CEO Statement 2014 was an important year for NetDimensions from a CSR point of view because it was the first year in our 16-year history that we had a CSR Committee managing and consolidating our CSR efforts company-wide. Our CSR Committee enhanced and speeded-up the integration of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (“Ten Principles”) with respect to human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption into our business and value-chain, and communicated a clearer and stronger internal and external message regarding the importance of CSR and the Ten Principles. The result of this was a successful CSR year for NetDimensions and a clearer vision on what CSR and the Ten Principles mean to us as an organization and how we should make these concepts a part of our company DNA. Going forward, we shall continue to commit to the Ten Principles, improve our CSR practices and build towards a better and more sustainable society and business environment. We thank our employees and partners for their continuing support for our CSR efforts and look forward to our successful continuation of this exciting and important journey. Sincerely yours, Mr. Jay Shaw CEO & Managing Director www.NetDimensions.com 3 2.

Executive Summary 2014 was a fruitful CSR year for NetDimensions with a lot of CSR activity and development. With our CSR Committee only formally established at the end of 2013, 2014 started off with getting the Company CSR documentation and infrastructure upto-date and/or in place. We submitted our first Communication on Progress under the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in February, and subsequently updated our internal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, created two related Learning Management System delivered awareness courses, and developed a Company-wide Small Start Policy and Partner and Supplier Code of Business Conduct. Working from this foundation, we increased our internal and external CSR communication and initiated a number of CSR events throughout the Year. At the event-side, we organized a successful blood drive at our Hong Kong and US offices with approximately 20 colleagues donating blood to local blood banks, and an equally successful global food raising campaign, raising basic food supplies in our respective communities with an approximate value of US$1,000 for those in need. We also sponsored the United Technologies Corporation (UTC) Golf Tournament in the USA to benefit United Way and the From Darkness to Sunrise fundraising event in Hong Kong. At the communication-side, we implemented the Small Start Policy company-wide (in light of this, the Hong Kong office for instance switched its coffee bean supplies to 100% fair trade beans) and rolled out our new Supplier Code of Business to over 25 partner-organizations we work with, including a number of our resellers. In this regard we also gave a presentation at our 2014 Reseller Summit, which was received well. On top of all this, we initiated the end-of-the-year US$1-peremployee-per-month charity donation, which resulted in a significant amount being donated to four charities as chosen via an end-of-the-year by all of NetDimensions’ employees, and saw a number of our executives participating in the ALS Ice bucket challenge, raising awareness and over US$500 for the ALS Foundation. Throughout 2014, we continued to work with LINGOs and witnessed them taking the NetDimensions Talent Suite LMS system live. LINGOs now has a total of 9 of their member NGOs (and several thousands of users) working with our NTS system. An additional 20 odd NGOs are also going through the implementation phase at this point of time and should join the NTS system later this year. To conclude, NetDimensions’ CSR Committee’s budget for 2015 increased compared to 2014 and NetDimensions agreed to start with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI reporting) from this year onwards. GRI reporting comprises public sustainability reporting, informing our stakeholders through a number of annually reported KPIs that we as an organization care in continuously improving our social responsibility standards and output. Based on the frameworks we have put in place in 2014 and the first data sets we will be compiling during this year, we expect to www.NetDimensions.com 5 publish our first formal, publicly communicated GRI report as part of our Company annual report in 2016. The following sections summarize NetDimensions’ engagement with the United Nations Global Compact in 2014 in more detail. They also reflect on CSR goals we had set in 2013 for 2014 and set new goals under the Ten Principles for NetDimensions to strive for in 2015. NetDimensions will continue to communicate on progress under the United Nations Global Compact, and aims to continuously improve its business practices and environment in line with the Global Compact. www.NetDimensions.com 6 4. Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses 4.1 Introduction Respect and support of Human Rights are key to our philosophy on how we do business and treat our employees, partners and counterparts. Over the course of 2014 we took a number of steps to promote the UNGC principles related to Human Rights in our business and value chain. Below is a summary of our achievements in this area and of how we lived up to the measurements we had set ourselves for the year in our COP 2013. We will also set new goals for 2015 to continue our efforts to enhance, respect and/or improve human right in our company and business environment. 4.2 Achievements 4.2.1 Blood Drive A substantial number of employees from NetDimensions’ Hong Kong, Connecticut and Atlanta offices voluntarily donated blood to local blood banks in June in their support and respect of human rights and health. We believe blood donations are important because blood is a unique fluid required for people to live that cannot be made other than by a human body itself, hence can only be obtained through donations, and can save people’s lives. www.NetDimensions.com 7 4.2.2 UTC Golf Tournament to benefit United Way NetDimensions sponsored the 2014 United Technologies Corporation Golf Tournament hosted in September to support United Way. United Way's work is focused on improving people’s lives in the following areas: • Education Helping Children and Youth Achieve Their Potential • Income Promoting Financial Stability and Independence • Health Improving People's Health United Way envisions a world where all individuals and families achieve their human potential through education, income stability, and healthy lives. NetDimensions shares this vision hence decided to support United Way and the event. 4.2.3 ALS Ice-bucket challenge executive raise A number of NetDimensions’ executives, including our CEO and CFO, participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and communicated the ALS Foundation’s message and request for (research) funds through our internal company-wide communication channel (wiki). ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting nerve cell in the brain and spinal cord which currently cannot be cured. In the hope of being able to play a role in finding a treatment method, the ALS Foundation funds research after this terrible disease. www.NetDimensions.com 8 4.2.4 End-of year charity donation We initiated the end-of the-year-US$1-per-employee-per-month charity donation where NetDimensions contributed a total of US$12 per employee to a number of charities as chosen by NetDimensions’ staff members through an online poll. The poll resulted in monetary donations being made to, a.o., Save the Children, Alzheimer Foundation and a local Hong Kong based orphanage. 4.2.5 From Darkness to Sunrise charity fundraising NetDimensions sponsored several of its employees in their initiative to raise fund for a local Hong Kong charity that creates awareness around and works towards preventing suicides. 4.2.6 Global Food Drive Through our combined efforts in Hong Kong, EMEA and the USA, we managed to raise a substantial amount of emergency food and funds (with a total estimated raised value of food and funds of US$1,000) for food banks in our respective communities to support people who are not able to buy their own food and may otherwise hunger due to low or lack of income. It is in our opinion important for people to realize that despite there being general high living standards in our main business markets, there are still large groups of people not benefiting from these general high levels of development and in lack of one of the vital part of staying alive, food. www.NetDimensions.com 9 4.2.7 Fair trade Coffee To show respect to local coffee farmers and their rights to a fair existence, NetDimensions changed 100% of its coffee bean consumption in its Hong Kong offices from non-fair trade coffee to fair-trade coffee. 4.3 Measuring Goals 2013 % # 2013 COP Goal Summary Achieved Develop COP and updated Business 100% The COP 2013 was submitted Conduct and Courseware for internal in February 2014.

Labor Principle 3: Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labor Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 5.1 Introduction We support the Principles above and believe that labor conditions should be fair and respectful towards employees’ rights and status as free individuals. NetDimensions will not tolerate or accept any forced, compulsory and/or child labor within its company and value chain. Below is an overview of our 2014 efforts in relation to the UNGC Labor related Principles and related goals we set for 2015. 5.2 Achievements 5.2.1 LINGOs We continued to support LINGOs and set up and implemented the NetDimensions provided proprietary NetDimensions Talent Suite platform for LINGOs including training of its internal administrators. In addition, we witnessed LINGOs going live and had 9 ‘member NGOs’ implementing and starting to make use of the system with a total of 2,500 active users. As communicated in last year’s COP, NetDimensions committed to providing its proprietary developed learning platform NetDimensions Talent Suite free of charge to NGO LINGOs and the Last Mile Learning initiative which will make world-class courses and learning opportunities available online at no cost in areas such as basic finance, basic management, project management and other development-specific topics. These courses will be delivered to users via the NetDimensions Learning Management System and accessed through either the Global Last Mile Learning portal or national portals run by local associations and training providers. All content on the platform will be available in various online formats as well as in packages of facilitation and participant materials for face-to-face instruction. All materials are targeted to be available in a number of languages, including French, English and Portuguese. www.NetDimensions.com 12 The core learning paths of Last Mile Learning can be used to develop key management skills in young developing economy entrepreneurs, local NGOs and government ministries as well as locally established non-profits and businesses. 5.2.2. Completed ‘Interactive Dialogue System’ (‘IDS’) As part of our CSR Committee infrastructure set-up we completed a first rough version of the IDS by creating a company-wide CSR email account, starting periodic communication to all staff from there and by setting up an internal CSR Space at our internal company-wide communication platform (wiki). Whilst we certainly enhanced the CSR message and communication significantly through these means, we are not entirely happy with the IDS yet and will look to improve its visibility and effectiveness. 5.2.3 Started GRI reporting initiative We worked within the CSR Committee to agree on the Key Performance Indicators for the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and have started accumulating the relevant data for 2014 and 2015. Based on the work done and the related targeted tasks for this year (detailed below) we expect to be in a position to complete our first formal externally communicated GRI Report in April 2016 as part of our 2015 Annual Report and Accounts. www.NetDimensions.com 13 5.3 Measuring Goals 2013 % # 2013 COP Goal Summary Achieved Set up a company CSR email 100% Completed in early 2014 as address and internal web space on part of our CSR Committee our intranet (together referred to infrastructure set-up 1 ‘Interactive Dialogue System’ or ‘IDS’) for internal CSR communication purposes Monitor compliance with the 75% Passive monitoring has taken employee handbook and the place and NetDimensions; company’s applicable policies, Legal Department and CSR including compliance with the antiCommittee have clearly 2 discrimination and anti-sexual communicated reporting harassment laws.

Environment Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9: Encourage the development and use of environmentally friendly technologies 6.1 Introduction NetDimensions is determined to reduce its carbon footprint and add its weight in preserving the earth’s environment and livability for next generations. Whilst NetDimensions is involved in software development, marketing and sales, hence active in a low carbon exhausting industry, NetDimensions recognizes that it can nevertheless act responsibly and make a difference in relation to reducing carbon footprint. 2014 was a year where we may not have made the impact yet we would like to make, yet was important for us in shaping our ideas on where we could improve our related efforts. Below is a summary of our minor achievement related to the UNGC Principles surrounding Environments and our more ambitious goals for 2015. 6.2 Achievements 6.2.1 Small Start Policy We drafted and implemented a company-wide Small Start Policy (also communicated through our IDS) setting company-wide guidelines and standards around use (and recommended temperatures) of air conditioning installations and heating systems, use of computers and machines, consumption of paper, recycling and reduction of air travel where possible. 6.2.2 Supplier and Partner Code of Conduct We made an effort to influence our partners and suppliers and developed a Supplier and Partner Code of Conduct which we started implementing in our value chain in 2014. The Supplier and Partner Code of Conduct clearly articulates NetDimensions’ views on CSR and its support of the Ten Principles under the UNGC. Whilst the code is not binding to those parties it has been communicated to, it does send out a very clear message on the values NetDimensions thinks are critical in doing business. NetDimensions’ CSR Committee presented the code to its resellers at the 2014 Reseller Summit and included a copy of the code in a number of its supplier contracts. Over the course of the year, a total of 30 partner and supplier organizations have received and read a copy of the code. www.NetDimensions.com 16 www.NetDimensions.com 17 6.3 Measuring Goals 2013 % # 2013 COP Goal Summary Achieved Develop a Small Start Policy 100% Completed in mid-2014 and 1 communicated companywide through email and IDS Monitor compliance with Small Start 50% Passive monitoring has taken Policy place only – we have had 2 discussions with people around the policy but have not measured its actual impact The outcome of the Coastal Cleanup 100% The CSR Committee 2013 will be examined together with evaluated the Coastal Cleanup other CSR events at the periodic 2013 and believes the event meetings of the CSR Committee was a good tool to demonstrate our commitment 3 to a cleaner environment and raise awareness surrounding the subject, hence we may do something similar in 2015 again NetDimensions will communicate 100% As detailed below 4 environmental plans in its 2014 COP 6.4 Setting goals for 2015 We target to achieve the following in 2015 regarding to UNGC’s Principles in relation to Environment: 1.

Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 7.1 Introduction NetDimensions believes corruption and bribery to be a major challenge in international business and is in full support of this Principle under the UNGC. In recognition of this principle we continue to train and educate our staff and partners on how to recognize bribery and corruption and how to report any suspected bribery or corruption. 7.2 Achievements 7.2.1 Codes and (training) materials During 2014, NetDimensions updated its Business Code of Conduct and Ethics to include a clearer reporting procedure in relation to reporting suspected bribery or corruption. We also drafted a Supplier and Partner Code of Conduct outlining our views and the importance of working against corruption in all forms. Moreover, we updated our internal training (onboarding and periodic) courseware in the area of business conduct and ethics and created a new course on anti-corruption and antibribery in specific to make our employees and contractors aware of the vital importance of understanding these concepts and the risks involved. And lastly, we created front-line staff compliance acknowledgement statements where front-line staff needs to semi-annually acknowledge having read, understood and complied with all our internal anti-corruption, anti-bribery and ethics documentation and policies. 7.2.2 Implementation of codes and (training) materials The codes and materials referred to above were all implemented throughout 2014 and now form part of our onboarding and periodic staff training through our NetDimensions Talent Suite LMS system, and of our contractor, reseller and partner acceptance processes. 7.3 Measuring Goals 2013 NetDimensions’ Legal Department and CSR Committee have been actively involved in drafting, updating and implementing the codes, courses and documentation referred to above to ensure full understanding and compliance. 7.4 Setting goals for 2015 We target to achieve the following in 2015 regarding to UNGC’s Principles in relation to Anti-Corruption: www.NetDimensions.com 19 1.
