After a major expansion, Ingleby is now entering a growth phase. To produce healthy food with less input is now the most important task. Today, Ingleby produces food for more than 590,000 people annually without being a dominant actor in any of our markets. Carl-Gustaf Wachtmeister Chairman We believe that agriculture can feed the world’s growing population and we are proud of our contribution that is based on science and best practice. 5 INGLEBY CSR REPORT 2014/15 Communication on progress This is Ingleby Farms and Forests ApS’ first Communication on Progress for the United Nations Global Compact.
