BSH HAUSGERÄTE GMBH The Board's introduction to the progress report to the UN Global Compact BSH joined the Global Compact in 2004 and played a leading role in drawing up a code of conduct based on the Global Compact for the European Committee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers (CECED) in 2005. These principles are integrated in BSH’s Business Conduct Guidelines and are implemented throughout the Group. Our code of conduct for suppliers is also based on the UN Global Compact and ensures compliance with social and environmental standards in the upstream value chain. In 2015, our 23rd sustainability report has been published: Titled “consistently responsible“ the report focuses on steering of sustainability activities and the alignment of the four fields of activity of BSH’s sustainability strategy.
