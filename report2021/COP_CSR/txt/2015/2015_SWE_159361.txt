Overall, * Wood Mackenzie Jan 2015 4 BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2014 INTRODUCTION | President’s Statement current market conditions are bringing about a downturn in mines’ profitability but may well benefit smelters. Operating profit Boliden posted an operating profit for 2014 of SEK 2,759 million as a result of higher volumes within both Mines and Smelters, higher zinc prices, better treatment and refining charges, and a favourable exchange rate climate. The Group’s combined costs rose, year on year, due to higher production volumes. Boliden’s increased focus on procurement has resulted in moderate cost increases, volume effects excluded. Our exploration efforts have generated increases in mineral reserves and extended our mines’ lifespans, while simultaneously enabling lower grade ores to be extracted profitably. These successes, coupled with the investments we have made, have enabled Boliden to develop into a company that reports steady years of profit, rather than a company that posts individual high profit years. How Boliden works Ongoing improvement work seldom gives rise to huge headlines, but for a raw materials company in an investment-heavy sector, successful project that will help boost Boliden’s profits for high productivity and low costs are the key to success. many years to come.

Housing and infrastructure investments – both of which require base metals – are increasing. The average trend on base metal prices varied from one metal to another during the year, with zinc prices rising, while copper, gold, silver and lead prices fell. Treatment and refining charges for copper and zinc rose in 2014. The demand for metals grows most rapidly in countries where the GDP per capita rises in the interval from USD 5,000 to USD 15,000 as societies develop from agricultural to industrial econo­ mies. Approximately one third of the world’s population lives in countries where the per capita GDP is within this range.1) A high percentage still lives in countries with a per capita GDP of less than USD 5,000 and hence offer substantial potential for a sharp growth in demand for metals in future.

Global mined production has, for many years now, limited supply, but the last two years have seen the opening of several new copper mines and the expansion of several others. A number of new smelters have also been built, particularly in China, but capacity utilisation levels have been lower than normal in recent years due to poor profitability. This balance affects both the price level on the metal exchanges where base metals are traded and the treatment and refining charges that form the basis for the pricing structure between the smelters and the mines. Mines have a limited lifespan and the supply will conse­ quently decline if new mines are not made operational. An increase in mine capacity requires assumptions with regard to satisfactorily high future prices in order to ensure that the mining companies’ profitability requirements are met. When metal prices fall, the mining companies’ incentives to develop new mines decline and a number of mines with high cash costs will be closed, at least temporarily. This results in limita­ tions on mined production which halts the fall in metal prices, but means that treatment and refining charges fall and the smelters’ profitability is threatened. This results, in turn, in production cuts or the closure of smelters, which leads to improved terms for the remaining smelters. A reduction or stagnation in metal supply results, in the long-term, in rising market prices for metals. When the demand for metal then rises as the economic ­climate improves, metal prices and treatment charges rise.

The geometry and composition of the ore body determine how it is mined and which concentration processes are used. The ore is ground to a fine sand in the concentrator and metal-bearing elements are then separated out from waste rock using a variety of different concentration methods.

Operating profit, other –147 –115 The operating profit is shown both including and excluding the revaluation of the smelters’ process inventories. Excluding the effect of process inventory revaluation provides a better picture of the underlying trend. 2014 The operating profit excluding revaluation of process ­invent­ories increased by 124 per cent as a consequence of higher gross profit and lower costs in local currencies, which in turn are primarily the result of cost-cutting measures at Rönnskär. 6 OTHER and ELIMINATIONS Includes Group staff functions and Group-wide functions, differences in certain accounting principles between the Business Areas and the Group, and the elimination of profits on intra-Group sales.

In-house technological development is key to continued increases in the efficiency of the mining operations. A structure and a working model for project planning which enables efficient use to be made of resources, has been created within NBW and is now yielding clear results in the form both of organic growth and more efficient production. There are three main orientations to Boliden’s technological development work – metallurgy, which affects the concentrating activities, mine automation, which 1:1750 relates to process control underground, 0 100 200 and environmental technology, which is designed to minimise the operations’ Mining is a long-term activity.

Talent pool A significant percentage of Boliden’s employees will Boliden has an established method of working with succession retire over the next few years. Stiff competition for planning for key positions and has also drawn up plans for skill skilled employees with some experience increases development and knowledge transfer. Talent Forums are held at the difficulty of replacement recruitment. all units to ensure that the right expertise is available in the right key positions at the right time. Boliden has an established programme of employer branding work and over the past year, the company has increased the number of visits it makes to universities and trade fairs. Equal opportunities work has resulted in Boliden attracting considerable attention and this, in turn, has enabled us to demonstrate our talent pool work. One example of this is Women at Work – the network for women who are interested in career development. Market and commercial risks Boliden’s market and commercial risks are primarily managed within the individual Business Areas and at Group level. Risk Description of risk Management and comments for the year Metal prices Changes to metal prices have a significant impact Boliden’s policy is not to hedge metal prices, but rather to allow on Boliden’s profits and cash flow. changes to be reflected in the result. There are some exceptions to this, e.g. when mining ore bodies with short residual lifespans or in order to ensure financial effectiveness in conjunction with major investment projects. See also under the “Financial risks” section. Boliden also continuously hedges Smelters’ metal price and currency exposure (with the exception of process inventory) in what is known as transaction exposure. See also under the “Financial risks” section.

As a consequence, changes in energy prices impact the operating profit. Boliden monitors opportunities to enter into longer term agreements if and when such opportunities arise. Boliden continues to participate in collaborative projects designed to ensure long-term competitive power generation. 48 BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | DIRECTORS’ REPORT OPERATIONS | Risk management Financial risks Boliden has a centralised treasury function that is responsible for managing financial risks with the exception of credit risks in accounts receivable. The treasury function is tasked with supporting the management and operating units at Parent Company and Group level. This structure ensures good internal risk monitoring and offers both financial and administrative economies of scale. The treasury function is responsible for identifying and efficiently limiting the Group’s financial risks in line with the financial policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

Boliden works actively to risk its payment undertakings due to ensure satisfactory current liquidity by making appropriate use of unutilised credit faciliinsufficient liquidity. ties with marketand operations-adjusted loan durations. The refinancing requirement is reviewed regularly by Boliden’s treasury function. The refinancing requirement is dependent, first and foremost, on market trends and investment plans. The loan agreements carry loan covenants which oblige Boliden to comply with certain defined key ratio conditions in order to avoid early repayment. A deterioration in the global economic climate may entail increased risks in respect of profit performance and financial position, including the risk of Boliden coming into conflict with loan terms and conditions. Boliden has complied with all loan covenants in 2014. The average term of total loan facilities was 3.4 years (2.6 yrs.) at the end of the year, which is in accordance with established Group policy. On 31st December 2014, Boliden’s payment capacity totalled SEK 5,847 million (SEK 6,356 m) in liquid assets and unutilised binding credit facilities with a term in excess of one year. Boliden has established a cash pool structure that enables it to maintain a central overview of liquidity flows and ensures efficient management of the Group’s overall liquidity. 50 BOLIDEN ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | DIRECTORS’ REPORT OPERATIONS | Risk management Risk Description of risk Management Credit and Credit risks in financial operations In order to limit credit and counterparty risk, only highly creditworthy counterparties are counterparty The term, credit and counterparty accepted and, wherever possible, the commitment per counterparty is limited.

On 31st December 2014, the credit risk in derivative instruments corresponded to a market value of SEK 406 million (SEK 500 m), which relates to Boliden’s receivables from external counterparties. Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities is regulated under ISDA agreements (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) which handles both offsetting between contracted counterparties during day-to-day operations and in conjunction with special circumstances, such as failure to pay. Boliden, during the course of its day-to-day operations, offsets market values in the same currency with a single counterparty that mature at the same time and the excess sum is paid by the party with the biggest liability. In the event of a breach of contract, all outstanding obligations covered by ISDA agreements are terminated in a sum that is paid by the counterparty with the biggest liability. Credit risks are managed through an established credit rating process, active credit monitoring, short credit periods, and daily routines for monitoring payments. The Credit risks in accounts receivable ­requisite provisions for bad debts are also monitored continuously.

Control functions exist both locally, reporting operational reporting. in individual units, and within Business Areas and at the Head Office. All of the functions work within a Group-wide internal control framework for financial reporting that is based on COSO. The framework’s controls are tested annually, both internally and by external auditors. The internal tests have also resulted in the transfer of knowledge and experience between departments and units. The operational reporting is followed up and controlled by the Group’s Controller function, which works closely with the local units and Business Areas.

Boliden’s operations use large amounts of water, and reusing the water and returning it to the processes enables Boliden to reduce both its water withdrawal and its discharges. Boliden’s discharges to water nowadays mainly comprise ­metals and nitrogen. 66 per cent (78%) of the metal discharges come from the smelters’ water treatment plants that also treat the rainwater that falls on the industrial park area. Boliden’s mines account for the remaining 34 per cent (22%) in the form of discharges from tailings ponds at the mines’ concentrators and water treatment plants. Rainwater that falls within the industrial park areas is also treated. The mining operations account for 77 per cent (70%) of Boliden’s nitrogen discharges, which result mainly from the use Boliden performs regular measurements of the emissions and dis­ charges to air, soil and water in the vicinity of existing and closedof explosives.

Approximately 70 per cent of the transportation of metal concentrates and other smelting materials is done by ship or rail. The transport of finished metals from the smelters is primarily by ship or rail within Europe, and often involves reloading on to trucks for the final stretch of the journey to the customer. All of Boliden’s smelters are subject to the EU’s system for trading in carbon dioxide emissions rights, ETS. The smelters received a preliminary allocation of emission rights for the period from 2013 to 2020 of 3.87 Mtonnes of carbon dioxide, which corresponds to the forecast emissions for that period. Boliden applies transparent reporting of its climate control work and has been recognised for this in the CDP’s Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) in 2014. Energy supply The origins of the electricity Boliden uses is determined by the energy mix provided by the different countries in which the Group operates. Hydroelectricity predominates in Norway, while hydroelectricity and nuclear power are the main sources used in Sweden, and in Finland, a combination of different sources are employed. In Ireland, a higher percentage of the Metals can be recycled over and over again without losing any of their quality.
