It outlines our plans, progress and achievements in the area of corporate responsibility (CR), aligned with the UNGC’s ten principles. As in FY13, this document has been integrated with our existing approach to corporate reporting. The relevant information can be found in our 2014 Global Annual Review, our global CR website and PwC firms’ websites. To demonstrate our alignment with the principles we have provided links to examples of our policies, public commitments, and specific initiatives, including work with clients. This document also provides examples of the actions we have taken as endorsers of the CEO Water Mandate and as recent signatories to the Women’s Empowerment Principles. The UNGC Active level requires participants to meet, or have specific plans to meet, each of the UNGC principles. These may be met at a local level through the implementation of a variety of established or emerging best practices. We have met this requirement and implemented or plan to implement best practices across various PwC firms and where possible, the Network. Firms in the PwC network have different priorities in relation to CR so our global CR strategy provides a common vision for leadership but allows for flexibility in the pace, prioritisation and localisation of activities. Similarly, some PwC firms are more advanced in their progress in implementing the UNGC principles. This document includes a number of case studies which highlight initiatives from PwC firms that demonstrate how the principles are implemented. These examples are drawn primarily from larger PwC firms as these represent areas where we have the greatest impact. This document is not designed to be an exhaustive list of all the ways in which PwC firms have aligned to the principles. Please note that throughout the report we refer to the global network of separate PwC member firms as ‘the Network’. The terms ‘PricewaterhouseCoopers’, ‘PwC’, ‘our’ and ‘we’ are used to refer to the network of member firms of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited or, as the context requires, to one or more PwC member firms. The PwC member firms are separate legal entities. For more information, see http://www.pwc.com/structure 2 www.pwc.com/corporateresponsibility How PwC acts as a catalyst for change A key aspect of our CR strategic intent is to be a 'catalyst for change' by helping to solve some of the world’s important problems through our work with clients, thought leadership and stimulating debate. Every year, PwC firms invest significant resources to help develop new standards and to stimulate the debate on important issues, many of which support the UNGC principles. Included below are several links containing our contributions to a wide range of issues and we have also included a few specific examples within each of the sections covering the UNGC principles.  Megatrends our leadership explores how global megatrends are impacting business http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/megatrends/index.jhtml and http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/strategy/emerging-markets/africa/african-megatrends.jhtml  Sustainability our services, research and insights http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/sustainability/index.jhtml and http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/sustainability.jhtml  Our contribution to the debate including results of our annual CEO survey and our leadership's point of view on the big issues http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/about-pwc/contribution-todebate/index.jhtml and http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/index.jhtml  World watch news and opinions on corporate reporting issues facing business today http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/audit-services/corporate-reporting/publications/worldwatch/index.jhtml  Public Sector Research Centre (PSRC) through PSRC, we set out our opinions and ideas in public service areas where our professional skills, and our global reach, mean we can contribute our practical experience and insight to the debate.

conducted. with over 5,000 global respondents, is focused not only on breaking down the facts, figures, trends and regions, but also on analysing how and where it may be affecting organisations so they can address the issue from both a preventive and strategic perspective: http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/economic-crime-survey/index.jhtml PwC Fraud Academy: http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/consulting-services/fraud-academy.jhtml 7 www.pwc.com/corporateresponsibility Appendix I – PwC Network Integrated Security (NIS) The information below is accessible to all staff through internal systems. It has not been disclosed publicly in previous years. At PwC we consider the safety and wellbeing of our people to be paramount, and view security as an integral – and integrated – part of every facet of our Network’s business. Proactive Risk Analysis and Security Operations In a world beset by increasing threats, from terrorism to natural disasters, any effort at safeguarding our people must begin with identifying and assessing such threats even before they materialize. That’s why NIS works with both internal and external sources to keep a cautious eye on world events, and proactively works to develop the strategies and tactics that can help PwC partners and staff steer clear of, or mitigate, the risks when they appear. A key example is travel security for our people, NIS and the other security professionals in our network of member firms consistently go above and beyond the basics of “duty of care” by emphasizing pre travel advice, providing briefings, tracking travel to enable real time contact with our people as needed, and working to ensure every employee is aware of the 24/7 medical and security assistance that is available to them through our arrangements with the world’s leading provider for such services. Every traveler has access to both web based security information, as well as a mobile app that delivers information and services to their mobile devices. NIS also devotes considerable resources to supporting our people working in higher risk locations, enabling them to meet their obligations to clients through the application of carefully considered security protocols and risk mitigation procedures. In addition to these operational, day-to-day activities, NIS produces periodic longer term assessments on key issues and trends, helping give the PwC network leadership a holistic view of the global risk environment. Incident Management and Business Continuity Regardless of the emphasis on prevention, there will always be unforeseen events that require careful response and management. For example, in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake, and subsequent tsunami and nuclear disaster, NIS developed a clear set of incident management protocols to enable the network to deal with a wide range of possible incidents, including cyberattacks. Our member firms have developed similar approaches, tailored to their individual circumstances. Additionally, member firms have also stepped up efforts to further refine their existing business continuity plans to ensure that future incidents have minimal impact on our operations. Integration Security works best when it is involved early and often in almost every aspect of the business, and security solutions are the most effective (and cost effective) when developed in tandem with the full range of stakeholders to a given issue. In this regard, NIS works closely with colleagues in functional areas across the network, as well as with client engagement teams. In addition, NIS chairs the PwC Security Group, consisting of the security professionals across our member firms, to share best practices, leverage experience, and ensure consistency of approach to issues of risk and security. To better serve our member firms in the farthest reaches of the globe, NIS is continuing to build out a regional security architecture that aims to have security professionals placed in key strategic areas, where they can be closer to the people they serve and can do so with greater speed and efficiency. 8 www.pwc.com/corporateresponsibility Appendix II The UN Global Compact Principles Human Rights  Principle 1: businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and  Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.
