A Lantmännen company that brings together operations. Through its dedicated efforts, Lantmännen Cerealia 8 Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2014 has achieved great success, both in the market and financially. The acquisition of Strängnäs Valskvarn is a clear indication that our processing is important for Swedish farming. When it comes to product development, I am particularly proud of our oat products, which show how we at Lantmännen connect the chain from field to fork. Lantmännen Unibake is showing a positive development and is a company that, in both the short and long term, can strengthen Lantmännen and in doing so can also strengthen us as farmers. The agreement to acquire Vaasan may represent a very big step in the progression towards being a stronger international player in the area of bread. On the topic of managing and achieving profitable growth for our portfolio holdings, the Scandi Standard IPO, which left us with an ownership share of 13.5 percent, cannot be ignored. I can say that, through very well executed strategic decisions and active involvement from management, the divestments of Scandi Standard and Kronfågel Group in 2013 and 2014 have had a positive impact on earnings of just over SEK 1 billion, which means we can now reinvest these funds in line with the strategy. Lantmännen’s strong financial position and several successful businesses have laid the foundation for the high dividend proposal. The Board also wishes to confirm the Agriculture Sector’s performance. Consequently, the Board has adopted a refund and final price adjustment of 1.5 percent for Lantmännen Lantbruk and 0.5 percent for Lantmännen Maskin. The Board also proposes a contribution dividend of 9 percent and a contribution issue of MSEK 150. I see the positive response to our subordinated debenture issue and the over-subscription as good evidence that members and others believe in our long-term development. Finally, I would like to thank all our employees for their dedication. Achievement of our goals requires the right skills, good leadership and effective organization. I see widespread evidence that our President & CEO Per Olof Nyman is a valued leader. The ability to exercise leadership that shows the opportunities in developing daily work and clarifies the strategy is a major asset for employees and owners alike. For me, Lantmännen is a company where we can really benefit from collaboration along the entire value chain – from oat crops to grains and porridge! It is also quite natural for us to have the agricultural company at the center of the new strategy – the work and measures we carry out must benefit you and your business in different ways. To summarize briefly – we make farming thrive. Klockrike, February 2015 Bengt-Olov Gunnarson Chairman, Lantmännen Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2014 9 President’s overview Lantmännen’s income after net financial items for 2014, adjusted for items affecting comparability, amounts to MSEK 740 (683). During the year, a number of steps have been taken within the framework of Lantmännen’s long-term strategy, and the Company is well positioned for future growth. Lantmännen’s results have continued to develop positively in 2014. Many of our businesses have taken further improvement steps, on both a large and a small scale, and work on Lantmännen’s long-term strategy has begun to produce results in several areas. In combination with Lantmännen’s strong financial position, this means that we are well prepared to create further growth in the Group after a period of consolidation. How our Sectors performed Great improvements have been made within the agriculturerelated operations of the Agriculture Sector and Lantmännen Maskin during the year. Special focus has been placed on creating a customer and service-oriented organization for Swedish farmers – whether in relation to grain deliveries, feed and crop advice or servicing and spare parts. These efforts will continue with undiminished vigor in 2015 – we can still do better! We have also significantly reduced our overheads in the business during the year, which is a necessity in an increasingly challenging competitive environment. In January 2015, it was announced that the boards of Lantmännen and Kalmar Lantmän have proposed a merger between the two associations. The merger proposal will be decided on by Kalmar Lantmän’s annual general meeting and dealt with at Lantmännen’s meeting. A combined Lantmännen and Kalmar Lantmän – if the merger is adopted – will result in an even more competitive company with roots and ownership among Swedish farmers. The merger requires the approval of the competition authorities. The Agriculture Sector’s earnings are lower than in the previous year, partly due to lower sales of spring seed and intensifying competition in the Swedish market, as well as slightly lower earnings for the Sector’s international interests. The Sector performed positively during the latter part of the year, with an improvement in earnings. 2015 will see a continuation of efforts to achieve cost leadership and create long-term profitable agricultural activities that promote Swedish farming. The machinery market was weak during the year, mainly as a result of a deteriorating investment capacity for Scandinavian 10 Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2014 We are well prepared to create further growth in the Group after a period of consolidation. farming, which was partly due to falling milk prices, and also an effect of a sharp fall in demand for large construction machinery in Sweden following lower activity in the mining industry and delayed political infrastructure decisions. The Machinery Sector has been working intensively on measures to counteract the fall in demand, and a new savings program has been launched aimed at significantly lowering the cost structure of the business. international bread operations within Lantmännen Unibake The businesses in the Energy Sector continue to perform and certain of the portfolio companies (Lantmännen Aspen, well, which is pleasing. Lantmännen Aspen developed very for example), the profitable growth goal goes beyond that and positively. The Sector’s largest business, Lantmännen Agroetanol, the goal for Lantmännen Unibake is to create profitable growth still faces challenges in terms of very low ethanol prices and a at global level.

Returns from operations are reinvested in the owners’ farms and provide opportunities for long-term investments in research and development. The cooperative ownership model is central to economic stability and endurance over time. For our owners, this is about Lantmännen being a business partner characterized by a long-term approach and a local presence. More about our ownership model pages 13-15. Research & innovation in the grain value chain Lantmännen’s knowledge and operations in every stage represent an opportunity to drive and contribute to development in the grain value chain. Continuing business development in order to create value from grain is also a key part of Lantmännen’s Strategy 2020. We focus on long-term research aimed at developing and moving the entire grain sector in a more sustainable direction, while contributing to long-term profitability and growth. Lantmännen’s research foundation invests significant resources in research at universities and institutes in areas such as plant breeding, biological crop protection, use of by-products, resource management, health and eating habits. More about our investments in research and innovative business development on pages 24-25. Product safety, quality and traceability Product safety and quality are important issues for our customers and consumers. Lantmännen’s knowledge and presence in all stages from field to fork gives us a unique opportunity to ensure control and traceability of our products. The green sprout on food from Lantmännen is our guarantee of responsibly produced food, with quality and food safety playing a key role. More about our work Food Sector pages 53-60, lantmannen.se/responsibility Environmental impact from cultivation of our raw materials Long-term sustainability in the food sector is largely determined in the cultivation stage. From a lifecycle perspective, crop cultivation also represents the greatest environmental impact for many of Lantmännen’s products. For grain, Lantmännen’s most important raw material, the impacts include carbon footprint, soil fertility and yields over time, water, use of plant nutrients and crop protection and effects on biodiversity. For soy, palm oil and other imported commodities, there are also social risks to manage, such as working conditions and human rights for those working on the plantations. More about our work on reducing environmental impacts pages 24-25, 27 and at lantmannen.se/responsibility Climate impact A large proportion of the world’s greenhouse emissions come from the food industry, which gives rise to a specific industry responsibility. From a lifecycle perspective, a large part of the climate impact for Lantmännen’s products is in the cultivation stage. However, our own processing activities also cause greenhouse emissions, primarily through use of energy and transport. Lantmännen is working towards proactive climate targets to reduce these, and is collaborating with customers and suppliers to reduce the carbon footprint in other parts of the value chain. Lantmännen is one of the companies in the Haga Initiative, a Swedish business network working for a more proactive climate policy. Learn more on pages 17, 25-26 and at lantmannen.se/responsibility ? Additional important issues In addition to the issues described above, Lantmännen’s responsibility work includes a large number of other other issues, which are also vital to an efficiently functioning and long-term successful business. These include work on health and safety, leadership and employee participation, and business ethics. Certain issues are very high on the agenda for some of Lantmännen’s stakeholders. These include product-related questions about origin, health properties and product information.

Continuing focus on oats Oats have several unique health properties. It has been scientifically proven1) that oats contribute to the maintenance of normal blood glucose levels, lower the cholesterol level and help to keep the stomach in shape. This is mainly due to the high content of soluble fiber, beta-glucans, in oats. Conditions for oat cultivation are very good in the Nordic region. For several years, Lantmännen has invested in research and innovation in order to take advantage of the beneficial properties of oats and develop both new oat varieties and healthy foods.

This year’s measurement of the value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives did not result in any impairment. An impairment loss of MSEK 800 on goodwill and non-current assets in Lantmännen Agroetanol was recognized in 2013. The majority (87 percent) of the Group’s value of goodwill and other assets with indefinite useful lives is attributable to the business area Lantmännen Unibake. A pre-tax discount rate of 9 (9) percent was applied during impairment testing of this cash-generating unit and no impairment was identified. An increase of 1 percentage point in the discount rate would reduce the estimated value in use by MSEK 769. With an increase of 2 percentage points, an impairment loss would occur, all other assumptions remaining unchanged. Other units with goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were within the estimated value in use limit during impairment testing for the year.
