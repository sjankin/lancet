CPH has made these estimates based on the Company’s business plans and expected time of use of the assets and the technical and maintenance state of the assets and regulatory requirements. The residual value is substantially estimated at DKK 0 as at balance sheet date. The lives and residual values of the property, plant and equipment are reviewed at least every year-end based on these factors. CPH evaluates the carrying amounts in order to assess whether events have occurred that require an adjustment of the values, because the carrying value is not expected to be recoverable. In a­ ssessing the recoverable amount, CPH takes into account significant indicators of potential impairment such as purchase and sales prices and general market conditions. Impairments The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested at least annually for any indications of impairment of the value beyond what is expressed in the amortisation or depreciation charges. If so, an impairment charge is taken to the recoverable amount of the assets, if that is lower than the carrying amount (see also note 10 for a further description of impairment). 84 Contents Consolidated financial statements NOTES Note 11 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2014 Land and Plant and Other fixtures Property, plant and Total buildings* machinery and fittings, tools equipment under DKK million and equipment construction Cost Accumulated cost at 1 January 7,149.1 6,716.3 1,571.4 287.4 15,724.2 Additions 815.3 815.3 Disposals (153.3) (205.1) (43.3) (401.7) Transferred 117.1 329.6 128.2 (574.9) Accumulated cost at 31 December 7,112.9 6,840.8 1,656.3 527.8 16,137.8 Depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January 2,650.8 3,321.6 1,082.4 7,054.8 Depreciation 178.2 254.6 124.1 556.9 Depreciation on disposals (153.2) (205.1) (43.1) (401.4) Accumulated depreciation at 31 December 2,675.8 3,371.1 1,163.4 7,210.3 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,437.1 3,469.7 492.9 527.8 8,927.5 * CPH properties have been mortgaged for a total value of DKK 665.0 million (2013: DKK 665.0 million). 85 Contents Consolidated financial statements NOTES Note 11 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2013 Land and Plant and Other fixtures Property, plant and Total buildings* machinery and fittings, tools equipment under DKK million and equipment construction Cost Accumulated cost at 1 January 6,654.1 5,832.7 1,502.2 1,119.9 15,108.9 Additions 775.5 775.5 Disposals (63.2) (97.0) (160.2) Transferred 558.2 883.6 166.2 (1,608.0) Accumulated cost at 31 December 7,149.1 6,716.3 1,571.4 287.4 15,724.2 Depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January 2,539.2 3,090.6 1,059.2 6,689.0 Depreciation 174.8 231.0 119.9 525.7 Depreciation on disposals (63.2) (96.7) (159.9) Accumulated depreciation at 31 December 2,650.8 3,321.6 1,082.4 7,054.8 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,498.3 3,394.7 489.0 287.4 8,669.4 * See previous page for information. 86 Contents Consolidated financial statements NOTES Note 12 TRADE RECEIVABLES The year’s movements are recognised in the income statement under External costs.

The passenger charge for using the new CPH Go low-cost facility was reduced by approximately 35% under the new agreement as compared with the existing passenger charge. The passenger charge for other international departures and domestic transfers was reduced, while charges for domestic departures, international transfers and the security and handling charges were all increased. The changes took effect on 31 October 2010, the date when CPH Go was opened. In addition to the modified passenger charges, the agreement also included a new charge based on aircraft emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX), a charge designed to promote the use of more environmentally friendly aircraft.

Further, CPH has overdraft facilities of DKK 85.6 million available (2013: DKK 132.5 million). In addition to a general operational risk assessment, CPH endeavours to have a minimum of guaranteed unused liquidity in the region of DKK 250.0 million at any time so that CPH is able to meet its obligations from time to time and concurrently has capital resources to make necessary business-related arrangements. CPH has, itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries, undertaken not to create or permit to subsist any security over its assets or those of its subsidiaries, subject to a maximum permitted amount. Furthermore, CPH has made a commitment to its lenders to comply with a number of other terms and conditions, including financial covenants. A number of CPH’s agreements on loans and credit facilities can be terminated in the event of failure to comply with these terms and conditions.

The compulsory registration of the number of passengers is calculated by the ­handling companies on behalf of the airlines and includes passengers who have arrived in transit or travelled out of Copenhagen Airport. T­ raffic performance is measured based on standard hours, UTC. Import cargo is cargo that has Copenhagen as destination. Export cargo is cargo ­departed from Copenhagen Airport.

Water quality is monitored at each of the outlets by periodical analysis of 24-hour samples. The It is the year’s rainfall on CPH’s land that determines how much surface water water is analysed for BOD, COD, N, P, fuel, heavy metals, glycol, ammonium and is discharged into the Oresund. This means, there can be large variations in the formic acid. amounts from year to year. To minimise the discharge of oil components via the surface water system, approxThe number of recorded oil spills rose year on year. The total volume also increased. imately 143 oil separators have been set up in the airport area. A fixed procedure As these spills represent unintended events, there may be relatively large fluctuations of regular sounding and emptying ensures an optimal removal of oil so that it from year to year. does not end up in the surface water system. The volume of surface water discharged into the Oresund is measured at the largest outlet and is calculated based on areas and precipitation data for the other outlets. Oil and fuel spills: The number of oil and fuel spills is calculated as the number of reports filed by CPH’s internal organisation or the fuel delivery companies. The ­calculation of the volume of spills is subject to some uncertainty, as it is rarely possible to measure the exact volume of a spill. 126 Contents Consolidated non-financial statements (Supplementary information – not audited) NOTES Note Note 32 RUNWAY DE-ICING – CONSUMPTION OF FORMIATE 33 AIRCRAFT DE-ICING – GLYCOL USED Accounting policies Accounting policies The consumption of runway and taxiway de-icers is calculated on the basis of the Copenhagen Airport is at its highest alert level during the winter season. Especially volumes purchased as CPH has a consignment inventory. critical meteorological conditions at Copenhagen Airport are temperature fluctuations around zero degrees Celsius combined with precipitation or fog, as this implies a risk of ice formation on the runways, taxiways and aircraft. For safety Unit 2014 2013 2012 reasons, it is therefore necessary to use de-icing agents at the airport during the winter season.

The volume of formiate used decreased in 2014.

Unit 2014 2013 2012 Glycol used m3 389 684 534 Glycol collected m3 197 377 294 The consumption of glycol is highly dependent on the weather, and consumption therefore varies widely over a number of years. Thus, the decline in 2014 was due to meteorological conditions. The collection rate may for example be affected by how windy it is ­during the winter and during de-icing. Since 2008, the collection rate has varied from 48.5% to 65.5%. 127 Contents Consolidated non-financial statements (Supplementary information – not audited) NOTES Note Note 34 HERBICIDES 35 ROSKILDE AIRPORT – NUMBER OF OPERATIONS Accounting policies Accounting policies The consumption of herbicides containing glyphosate is calculated on the basis of Traffic performance is calculated on the basis of data in CPH’s traffic statistics volumes purchased, adjusted for inventory change. system and includes all aircraft operations (take-offs and landings), aircraft type, take-off weight, use of runway and flight time.
