SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS REPORT 2014/15 Contents A message from our CEO 3 About Danish Crown 4 Our CSR strategy 6 People 7 Planet 17 Product 30 2 A message from our CEO Part of a Global System All of us expect a lot from our global food system, as we should. We need it to provide safe, nutri*ous and aﬀordable food for everyone, and we want conﬁdence that food is farmed, processed and distributed responsibly. It’s not surprising, then, that ques*ons are being raised about the system’s ability to feed a growing global popula*on, the health eﬀects of today’s diets, the technologies used to grow and process food, and implica*ons for human rights, animal welfare and the environment. In the Danish Crown Group, we are commi2ed to making decisions that have a posi*ve impact on our business and the communi*es in which we operate. Danish Crown is part of a global community, a posi*on that puts it under certain obliga*ons. Social responsibility has been on our agenda for many years, and we are working hard to disseminate best prac*ce interna*onally. As a coopera*ve owned by Danish farmers, Danish Crown is constantly reminded of our obliga*ons and responsibility towards our surroundings; a responsibility which is underlined by our posi*on as one of the largest companies in Denmark and one of the largest meat processing businesses in the world. We support Global Compact Danish Crown joined the United Na*ons Global Compact in 2011, an important ini*a*ve to promote ethical business prac*ces. As a par*cipant, we are commi2ed to aligning the 10 basic principles of the Global Compact to our corporate strategy. The progress being made to fulﬁl the strategy’s objec*ves is described in this report. This year, we have taken the opportunity to create a new governance structure to manage corporate responsibility issues across the group. A new Sustainability Coordinator has been appointed to run projects and share best prac*ce across the group, and a newly formed Sustainability Steering Group will help inform and monitor our progress. Looking ahead, I believe we have implemented a number of ini*a*ves, both globally and locally, that will help us to build resilience into our business, thereby preparing us for future growth in an environment of heightened global challenges. Kjeld Johannesen, Group CEO 3 About Danish Crown The Danish Crown group is a global meat processing company and among the largest in its ﬁeld. The group is the World’s largest pork exporter and Europe’s largest pork processor (DC Pork). DC Foods is Europe’s largest meat processing company and DC Beef is a signiﬁcant player in the European beef market. Group turnover is app. DKK 59 billion with a workforce of approximately 26,000 employees. Danish Crown is a limited company but is owned by the coopera*ve society ‘Leverandørselskabet Danish Crown AmbA’ which has an elected board consis*ng of coopera*ve members. The board of the limited company also includes employee representa*ves and external members. 4 5 Our Responsible Business Strategy Danish Crown is among Europe’s leading food producers. Within all parts of the supply chain, Danish Crown is commi2ed to opera*ng in a sustainable way. For a number of years, Danish Crown has placed a special focus on addressing our key sustainability issues, including looking aCer our people by reducing the number of accidents at work, improving our processes and technologies to reduce our impact on the environment, developing safe and healthy products and seDng up strict requirements for animal welfare. As the group expands, we are working hard to share this best prac*ce across the whole business. We recognise our impacts along the supply chain, from farm to fork. Governance This year, we have also taken the opportunity to create a new governance structure to manage corporate responsibility issues across the group. A new CSR Coordinator has been appointed to run CSR projects and share best prac*ce across the group, and a newly formed CR Steering Group will monitor and review: ⇒ the Company’s management of corporate responsibility across all DC companies, making appropriate recommenda*ons to the Board on corporate responsibility ma2ers; ⇒ the eﬀec*veness of the Group’s strategy for, and management of, material sustainability issues; ⇒ the Group’s sustainability plans and ac*vi*es; and ⇒ the eﬀec*veness of CSR governance. Priori-es The group CSR strategy was updated in 2013 in connec*on with the current business strategy DC2018. The CSR strategy sets a number of concrete goals within each of the key areas that have the greatest signiﬁcance to our business and our stakeholders: animal welfare, human rights, working environment, environment and climate, food safety and health, responsible supplier management and corrup*on and bribery. Within all areas, Danish Crown has set long term goals for us to assess our performance against. We have shaped our priori*es around three key pillars. 6 7 Health & Safety The health and safety of our employees is a high priority for the Danish Crown Group. The company is commi2ed to prevent accidents at the workplace and to reduce the number of repe**ve strain injuries. For several years, Danish Crown has been working ac*vely to reduce the number of accidents. Posi*ve results have been achieved through con*nuously focusing on improving the workplace. We ensure that all employees have the best possible personal protec*on gear at their disposal, and they are instructed in how to perform the work in a safe and responsibly manner, while receiving regular training and instruc*on. New technology that can completely remove the risk of accidents for the individual employee is tested, tried and introduced where prac*cally and ﬁnancially possible. Our health & safety management systems ensure that the group follows uniform procedures for handling health and safety issues and con*nuously improve the working environment. Danish Crown’s employees are involved in the work via occupa*onal health and safety organisa*ons and groups that are con*nually being trained and updated on the latest working environment know-how. Objec*ves 2013-2018: ⇒ That all factories reduce the number of accidents at work that lead to a full day of absence. At company or division level, the aim is to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 20 per cent. ⇒ That all factories reduce the absence due to illness percentage. At company or division level, the aim is to reduce absence due to illness by 30 per cent. ⇒ To minimise the number of daily liCs for employees by introducing new technology, expedient workplace design and correct working instruc*ons & to ensure that all work func*ons are performed as ergonomically correct as possible. ⇒ To mo*vate and inspire employees to adopt healthy exercise and ea*ng habits and to ensure health ini*a*ves at all workplaces ⇒ To minimise noise levels through the introduc*on of new technology, the eﬀec*ve maintenance of produc*on equipment and noise-reducing work rou*nes and behaviour. Case Study: Noise Reduc-on Danish Crown has been focused on a major project to reduce noise levels. All of DC Pork`s, DC Beef`s and Tulip Food Company´s factories in Denmark have been involved in the project, which aimed to reduce the level of noise to a maximum of 85 dB for all func*ons. Except for very few speciﬁc areas where the authori*es have recognized that it is not possible to reach the 85 dB, we have been successful in reaching the target for all of our Danish employees. Reaching the target has been very complicated and has required a lot of investment, as it has been a challenge to reduce the level of noise without having to compromise with the tough requirements for food safety. 8 Our Progress Health & Safety performance is measured in the number of lost *me accidents occurring, converted to an incidence rate, based on injuries per 1,000 employees. The incidence rate has shown a good improvement, with a reduc*on from our base year (2010/11) of 32.6% and a reduc*on from the last ﬁnancial year of 8.4%. The rate of absence per accident has seen a marked increase (absence has increased and at the same *me incidents have decreased). This is caused by a reduc*on in the overall number of minor accidents, but absence levels remaining, consistent therefore increasing the average absence per accident. Case Study: Reward for Fewer Work Accidents Three of Plumrose USA´s plants received awards for their work on improving safety to employees and reducing the number of accidents. Among the companies receiving recogni*on were Plumrose USA´s plants in Booneville, Elkhart and Council Bluﬀs to the sa*sfac*on of Dave Schanzer, CEO Plumrose USA. “We are naturally proud of the results we have achieved in bringing down the number of work accidents but we will not be sa*sﬁed un*l all our plants are awarded the highest level. In future we will therefore focus even more on the importance of avoiding accidents among others through educa*on of our employees”. 9 Case Study: Robots do the heavy li7ing Robots have taken over the hard physical work at Danish Crown in Blans Every day between 120 and 130 tons of bacon is salted each day. This has been done by hand for a number of years but in 2015 two robots took over the job. According to Operator Michael Jespersen, the robots are among the most modern available, and Danish Crown in Blans is the ﬁrst factory in Europe to use them. This has taken 10 people away from this demanding role. However, the 10 employees aﬀected have been oﬀered posi*ons within other departments, so no one has suﬀered a job loss as a result. “It is very hard to work in the curing department, as a lot of heavy liCing is part of the job. Today this liCing is done by robots, which is a big advantage for the employees”. 10 Well-being Our Commitments Danish Crown puts massive focus on monitoring the wellbeing of our employees. We train our managers to be aware of factors inﬂuencing the wellbeing of the employees. A precondi*on for Danish Crown’s business development is commi2ed, quality-conscious and result oriented employees who meet customer demands and wishes. This requires the con*nual development of the employees’ competencies and construc*ve coopera*on across the organisa*on. Competence development is also an important element in implemen*ng Danish Crown’s policy of ensuring a more equal distribu*on of men and women at all management levels. Objec*ves 2013-2018: ⇒ To strengthen the eﬀorts being made to ensure high job sa*sfac*on, including measures to prevent stress and bullying. ⇒ To ensure the posi*ve development of staﬀ mo*va*on and commitment throughout the en*re group. ⇒ To gear the organisa*on for the future with respect to business succession and to a2ract and retain competent employees while also increasing diversity in the ﬁlling of management posi*ons throughout the group. ⇒ To increase focus on interna*onalisa*on while increasing knowledge-sharing and exploi*ng synergies across companies and na*onal boundaries. Case Study: Equipped for Life Tulip Ltd have developed a major programme regarding the health and wellbeing. Our ‘Equipped for Life’ (EFL) programme is built on best prac*ce advice and covers health, educa*on, personal development and how we link with local communi*es. Our annual plan is issued to every employee; themes are run for diﬀerent months, linking into na*onal campaigns. While our Occupa*onal Health team provide advice and mini health check ups to support on issues such as weight loss and smoking cessa*on. Successes from this programme include: • Our absence levels have dropped by 0.5% in 6 months – projected at 1% in the year – that’s a drop in 17,000 absence days in a 12 month period. • We have achieved a success rate of over 50% of colleagues signing up to our rewards discount scheme at sites across our UK opera*on. • An average 556 colleagues ac*vely par*cipate in the Tulip lo2o on a regular basis, winning over £1000’s of prize money as well as raising an equal amount for worthy causes. • 128 Tulip colleagues have taken advantage of our discounted gym membership scheme in the last 12 months. • 280 colleagues have taken up the cycle to work scheme. 11 Our Progress As Danish Crown con*nues to grow interna*onally the group puts increased focus on coopera*on between employees from diﬀerent companies. To strengthen rela*ons Danish Crown has created new interna*onal forums concerning innova*on and purchasing, and planned ini*a*ves includes stronger and more focused coopera*on on subjects such as energy consump*on, water and waste. This is a task which will be headed by Danish Crowns newly appointed CSR Coordinator. Danish Crown also carries out a staﬀ survey “DC Check” on a regular basis, thereby gaining input on working condi*ons and sa*sfac*on with management. The number of employees par*cipa*ng in DC Check has been expanded, making it much easier for Danish Crown to point out where to focus in order to improve working condi*ons. During the last survey, 36% of employees across the group received the ques*onnaire. Another important focus of Danish Crown is the recruitment and educa*on of new employees as well as succession planning concerning management posi*ons. Concerning new employees, Danish Crown cooperate with a number of educa*onal ins*tu*ons, and a number of companies within the Danish Crown Group employ appren*ces as part of the groups responsibility towards society. In 2014/15 a planned succession programme was carried out. This included 176 cri*cal posi*ons within DC pork, DC Beef and Tulip Food Company. The process has also been carried out for top management posi*ons at Plumrose USA, ESS-Food and DAT-Schaub. As part of the process, relevant educa*on is oﬀered towards employees appointed to be successors to current managers. 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 Total number of employees (FTE) Average 26,655 27,178 26,231 25,980 25,873 Total number of employees leaving (FTE) 5,025 4,945 4,738 4,771 5,339 Number of employees leaving the Group in % 19% 18% 18% 18% 21% 12 The share of women within management posi*ons con*nues to steadily rise and stands at 28% for ﬁnancial year 2014/15. Case Study: Tulip extends appren-ceship scheme Tulip Ltd launched a na-onwide search for the next genera-on of butchers, engineers and technical specialists as it expands its industry-leading appren-ceship programme. Tulip has extended its appren*ceship scheme to include addi*onal func*ons following the success of its original programme, which has been running for four years. The business oﬀered 24 butchery, 15 engineering and ﬁve technical appren*ceships at various loca*ons across its UK opera*on to start in the autumn and was keen to hear from young people looking for real career and development opportuni*es. Tulip’s Group Learning & Development Manager Ally Pa2erson explained: “We have been working in partnership with the Department for Business, Innova*on & Skills together with the Department of Educa*on and other industry leaders over the last few years to develop the Trailblazers standard, which oﬀers candidates relevant formal qualiﬁca*ons to support them in building a career in the food industry. Candidates are assessed throughout their appren*ceship to ensure that they learn the knowledge and relevant skills in their chosen career. For butchery appren*ces there is an independent assessment at the end of the programme on knowledge, skills and behaviours, which is a brand new concept introduced via the Trailblazer standard, which will help improve standards across the industry.” 13 Human Rights Our Commitments Danish Crown recognises and protects relevant interna*onal human rights, including labour rights. We want to ensure that human rights are not violated at Danish Crown companies, and we demand the same of all our business partners. Objec*ves for the strategy period: ⇒ To incorporate due diligence processes for human rights in exis*ng management systems. ⇒ To explore the possibili*es of establishing an appropriate system for handling of grievances. Our Progress Danish Crown put a lot of focus on human rights, both regarding how the companies within the Danish Crown Group treat their own employees and the group´s ability to inﬂuence suppliers to focus on human rights. All of Danish Crowns contracts for suppliers require that suppliers obligate themselves to live up to the human rights as deﬁned by the UN Global Compact in order to become a Danish Crown supplier. Work on human rights internally in the group include equal opportunity for employees regardless of gender, race, sexual orienta*on or other personal ma2ers.

Morten. 14 Community Case Study: Live like a pig Danish Crown held an auc-on over the right to live in a genuine pigsty! The result was 246.000 DKK, which was donated to the Child Cancer Founda-on. For a number of years, Danish Crown has given visitors at the Danish music fes*val ‘Smukfest’ in Skanderborg the possibility to spend the fes*val in a genuine pigsty. The organic pig huts have been modiﬁed to provide luxury accommoda*on for two legged creatures. Besides the special sleeping arrangements, the guests are also treated with food from Danish Crown and a lot of entertainment, and as a result there is a lot of interest in the 15 huts. This year however, the interest was even bigger, meaning the 15 huts were sold at a record price of 246.000 DKK, which was handed over to the Child Cancer Founda*on. 15 Case Study: Food for thought and thought for food As one of the UK’s leading food producers, Tulip Ltd engagement in food chari*es is a no-brainer. Under its sustainability plan “Growing Responsibly”, the company has made a commitment to support ac*on on food poverty. Several sites, are already involved in dona*ng food and making a signiﬁcant diﬀerence to their local communi*es. For a number of reasons, including insuﬃcient shelf-life or a packaging issue, our factories end up with food that cannot be sold to our primary customers. Tulip Bodmin has been suppor*ng St Austell and WadeBridge Food Banks since 2010. Nigel Colston takes up the story: “Things started in small way when a number of *nned meat products were sent to our site as samples for a mee*ng and things grew from there. We’ve also found other chari*es that need our support, including the Devon and Cornwall Food Associa*on with whom we have recently formed a partnership. They help vulnerable people in our local community by providing food and cookery skills. We also support STAK (St Austell Community Kitchen), which provides meals at heavily subsidised prices. In fact, Glen Cur*s, one of our trainers, recently revealed that when he was very young and living on his own for the ﬁrst *me, he found himself with a tough choice of buying food or paying rent. STAK had provided a hot meal for him for a few weeks while he sorted himself out.” 16 17 Animal Welfare Our Commitments How animals are treated on the farms, during transport and in the slaughterhouse is of primary importance to us. Danish Crown meets all statutory animal welfare requirements and also sells a wide selec*on of products that meet special consumer requirements with respect to quality and animal welfare. Our Danish pig suppliers must comply with a Code of Prac*ce for animal welfare on their farms. Similar schemes are found in the UK, and we con*nuously inves*gate the possibility of introducing similar schemes in other slaughtering units. Danish Crown has a special responsibility for ensuring that the collec*on, unloading and slaughtering of animals are carried out as gently as possible and performed within reasonable *me limits. Employees engaged in handling live animals therefore receive special training so they understand the animals’ behaviour and physique. Danish Crown also strives to make the *me of transporta*on from farmer to slaughterhouse as short as possible. Objec*ves 2013-2018: ⇒ To increase the number of pigs subject to higher animal welfare requirements. ⇒ To ini*ate the development and implementa*on of cer*ﬁca*on schemes for groups of ca2le suppliers. ⇒ To extend animal welfare training to staﬀ working in the pens at all the slaughterhouse units and to enhance animal welfare through equipping the pen areas accordingly. Our Progress Among the ini*a*ves taken within the last ﬁnancial year is an increased interest for more health control, where Danish Crown oﬀers the suppliers a unique possibility to get informa*on about individual sows delivered for slaughter at Danish Crown in Skærbæk. This gives the farmer an opportunity to react much faster, if the wellbeing or health of the animals from the speciﬁc farm is declining. Concerning ca2le, Danish Crown has taken a new ini*a*ve to support cross breeding of Jersey cows and meat cows in order to make it ﬁnancially a2rac*ve to raise the calves of Jersey ca2le. Looking at organic and free range produc*on our eﬀorts in 2014/15 have to a large degree revolved around increasing the number of organic pigs slaughtered within the Danish Crown Group. The organic part of DC Pork, Friland, has taken a number of ini*a*ves to increase the number of organic pigs, including ﬁnancial support towards farmers bringing new organic sows into produc*on. This has been a very successful ini*a*ve, however the impact within the ﬁnancial year 2014/15 has been very small, as it takes *me from new sows being introduced to the ﬁrst pigs being ready for slaughter. 18 Case Study: Friland aAracts new sows The increased need for more organic meat means that Friland has chosen to give a cash reward to farmers increasing the number of organic sows at their farm European consumers huge appe*te for organic products means that there is a shortage of organic pig meat. As Europe’s biggest supplier of organic meat this is also challenging Friland, and during 2014/15 the company frequently turned down customers, because the available volume of meat did not align with demand. As a result, Friland has taken two new ini*a*ves in order to expand the produc*on of organic pigs in Denmark. “We have chosen to take a very unusual step, but this underlines that we are facing some very unusual challenges. We are facing a great need for new organic piglets, and as a result we have chosen to provide cash support to farmers increasing the number of sows and thereby also the number of piglets”, explains CEO of Friland, Henrik Biilmann. Help with funding Friland allocated 2 million DKK which is given as establishment grants when farmers increase the number of organic sows. The scheme became ac*ve on May 1st. Besides the cash reward for new sows Friland also oﬀers to ﬁnance new organic sows. “We have experienced that some banks are reluctant towards lending money to farmers, which is slowing down the growth of organic meat. However Friland is convinced that organic pig farming will be a proﬁtable business in the future, and as a result we have chosen to oﬀer help ﬁnance the cost of establish or increasing produc*on of organic sows”, says Henrik Biilmann. 19 Case Study: An-bio-c Free Produc-on of Pigs As of December 1st ﬁve Danish Crown suppliers began trials raising pigs without using any an-bio-cs Denmark is among leading countries with the smallest use of an*bio*cs in pig produc*on. Danish Crown is focused on taking responsibility and further decreasing the use of an*bio*cs, in close coopera*on with the company´s owners. As a result, ﬁve farmers from the island of Bornholm set up a trial produc*on of pigs without the use of an*bio*cs. Along with the farmers, experts have closely followed the trials to ensure the there is no impact on animal welfare. The produc*on of pigs without an*bio*cs is more expensive for the farmer, due to increased control with the pigs, which calls for extra employees. One of the goals with the trials was to ﬁnd out if there is demand for these pigs, and so far Danish Crown has been able to ﬁnd customers. As a result Danish Crown decided to expand the trial so more suppliers now raise pigs without the use of an*bio*cs. 20 Energy Our Commitments Danish Crown focuses on the overall climate change impact of our products. We are therefore working to reduce the environmental impact of the group’s ac*vi*es. Eﬀorts being made to reduce energy consump*on at our facili*es are concentrated on the most energy-intensive processes. The temperature in Danish Crown’s factories is cri*cal to food safety, and consequently process cooling for rooms and for freezing products is the primary source of energy consump*on. Objec*ves 2013-2018: ⇒ That all factories reduce energy consump*on to the group’s best prac*ce level. At company or division level, the aim is to reduce energy consump*on by 3% per year per ton of ﬁnished products. ⇒ To explore the possibili*es and savings poten*al of inves*ng in renewable energy or selling surplus energy from produc*on. ⇒ To implement carbon footprint projects within key product categories in partnership with the retail trade. Case Study: Full focus on energy savings Diﬀerent Danish Crown facili-es work closely together on how to reduce energy. This is also the case at Danish Crown’s biggest slaughtering facility in Horsens, where a number of projects are helping to drive down energy use. Reducing energy consump*on is key to Danish Crown, and the company has carried out a number of projects in 2014/15, which has resulted in a reduc*on of energy at several thousand MW/h. Along with other projects Danish Crown in Horsens reuses the heat from emissions, resul*ng in a signiﬁcant reduc*on of the energy usage for hea*ng of water for cleaning. The two biggest projects carried out in Horsens give a combined reduc*on of energy usage of 4.500 MW/h per year, which equals the energy usage of nearly 1.000 Danish households with two adults. “We completed a number of projects, and besides op*mizing the heat recovery and savings from recovery from capacitors, we have been able to reduce energy consump*on throughout the facility. Another example is a reduc*on of energy usage of 970 MW/h from heat recovery from scalding cabins, an op*miza*on of the suc*on system coming from replacing compact air injectors with vacuum pumps, just as all ﬂuorescent lamps are replaced by LED ligh*ng”, explains Engineer Gregor Kaster. Learning from each other Among future projects expected to result in a signiﬁcant energy reduc*on is the drying of produc*on rooms aCer cleaning. New moisture analyzers have been installed, making it possible to calculate the exact amount of energy necessary to dry the rooms before star*ng produc*on. Gregor Kaster underlines that this is just examples of the necessity of constantly monitoring and reducing energy consump*on; “The focus on consump*on of energy and water has increased signiﬁcantly for a number of years. We are held accountable on our KPI´s which makes the task of reducing consump*on much more visible”. This is not only the case for Danish Crown in Horsens, but for all Danish Crown facili*es. Coopera*on on reduc*ons in consump*on have become much more important. “We learn by visi*ng diﬀerent facili*es and exchanging experiences on energy projects. An energy portal has been created, which is used to share good ideas and success stories to make sure that good ideas do not go to waste. However we can s*ll improve, and one way to do that is to include even more companies within the group” says Gregor Kaster. 21 Our Progress Our eﬀorts have focused on individual site energy management projects to work towards a 3% year–on-year improvement. We measure both overall carbon emissions and energy emissions. Carbon emissions include electricity use, fuel use (including natural gas and propane), refrigerant usage, as well as nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases. Overall carbon emissions have reduced, both in terms of absolute performance and ra*o performance per produced volume of products. Speciﬁcally focusing on energy, overall energy consump*on has increased from the previous ﬁnancial year, and our ra*o performance per volume produced has also increased due to a reduc*on in produc*on levels. Total energy use increased by 0.1% on the previous year, a reduc*on in 3.7% since FY2010/11. Energy use per produced volume has increased 5.8% on the previous year, predominantly due to a reduc*on in overall produc*on volumes and a change in the type of products being produced which use more energy in manufacturing. The pig and sow slaughterhouses consumed 44 per cent of the total energy consump*on in Danish Crown, followed by the processing plants consuming 40 per cent of the energy consump*on. The energy consump*on per produced volume is higher in the processing plants, because of many energy intensive processes, compared to other ac*vi*es in Danish Crown. The processes include curing, smoking, roas*ng, deep-frying and cooking. The energy consump*on in rela*on to deboning, cuDng and retail packing is low, both in total and per produced volume, compared to the slaughterhouses and processing plants. Despite focus in this area, our progress does not match our targeted improvement. Individual projects have led to signiﬁcant improvements at an individual site level, but the overall trend requires further ac*on to address this issue. 22 Water Our Commitments Danish Crown uses water to clean our produc*on facili*es, for disinfec*on, and to cook our products. Some of the water evaporates in connec*on with cooling, cleaning and drying, but most is discharged as wastewater. We are con*nually looking to reduce the company’s water consump*on and the volume of organic material, which is discharged to the drains. These eﬀorts include changing behaviour as well as implemen*ng technical solu*ons. Objec*ves 2013-2018: ⇒ That all factories reduce water consump*on to the group’s best prac*ce level. At company or division level, the aim is to reduce water consump*on by 3 per cent per year per ton of ﬁnished products. ⇒ That all factories reduce the drain discharged volume to the group’s best prac*ce level. At company or division level, the aim is to reduce the volumes by 10 per cent per ton of product produced. ⇒ To explore the possibili*es for and savings poten*al of reusing water for other processes. Case Study: Water Consump-on @ Danish Crown In partnership with other food companies, technology providers, universi-es and knowledge providers , Danish Crown aim to reduce water consump-on by 15-30 percent. Lack of access to clean drinking water is among the biggest challenges at a global level. As a result the use of water resources must be carefully managed. Danish Crown are par*cipa*ng in a new project, where Innova*on Fund Denmark will invest 50 million DKK in new technology, which can help reduce water consump*on. Since the 1980´s, Danish slaughtering facili*es have worked hard to reduce water consump*on. Within the last couple of years however it has been very hard to iden*fy new sustainable ways of reducing water consump*on further. This means that we need a huge technological leap forward and a shiC in the way we think about water consump*on. The partnership has been named INNO + VIP (Water eﬃcient Industrial Produc*on). The project will run for ﬁve years from 2015 to 2020. 23 Our Progress Our eﬀorts have focused on individual site water management projects to work towards a 3% year on year improvement. In absolute terms (m3), water use decreased from our base year by 3.4%, but increased on the previous ﬁnancial year by 1.0%. In ra*o terms against volume produced, water use (m3/tonne) increased by 6.7% on the previous year. This is predominantly due to a reduc*on in overall tonnages produced. The pig and sow slaughterhouses consume 55% of the total water consump*on in the Danish Crown group, followed by the processing ac*vi*es (23%). Water consump*on per produced volume, however, is lower in the slaughterhouses than in the processing plants. The processing plants not only use water for cleaning according to meet high safety and sanita*on standards. They also use water in the product processing such as cooking and curing. Despite focus in this area, our progress does not match our targeted improvement. Individual projects have led to signiﬁcant improvements at an individual site level, but the overall trend requires further ac*on to address this issue. 24 Chemical Usage Our Commitments Most of the chemical products are used for cleaning at the plants, which is crucial for food safety. Danish Crown is con*nually working to reduce the use of cleaning chemicals and to replace environmentally harmful substances with more environment-friendly alterna*ves, where this can be done without compromising food safety. Objec*ves for 2013-2018: ⇒ That all factories reduce the consump*on of classiﬁed substances (excluding refrigerants) to the group’s best prac*ce level. At company or division level, the aim is to reduce the use of classiﬁed substances by 20%. ⇒ That all factories reduce the emission of refrigerants to the atmosphere to the group’s best prac*ce level. At company or division level, the aim is a 50% reduc*on. Case study: Signiﬁcant Chemicals Savings in Ringsted The use of chemicals at the DC Pork ﬂota-on system in Ringsted, Denmark, has been reduced by more than 60 percent and now other plants are next. A research trip to the Netherlands to draw inspira*on from waste water treatment now results in markedly reduc*on of the use of chemicals at the Danish Crown ﬂota*on system in Ringsted. In a ﬂota*on system chemicals are added in the form of polymers that bind to the organic ma2er in waste water. Previously polymers were supplied to the Ringsted aba2oir in liquid form in tanks where the ac*ve ma2er had been pre-mixed with water to be added to the waste water. Now however Danish Crown receives the polymer in powder form. This means that we have been able to reduce the use of chemicals for waste water cleaning from 23 to 8 tonnes, says Senior Manager Sustainability, Charlo2e Thy. Together with a colleague she coined the idea of replacing polymers from ﬂoa*ng to solid form during a research trip to the Netherlands. “Quickly we realised savings because when we mix the polymers with water ourselves we achieve op*mal eﬀect of the ac*ve ma2er. This is because the eﬀect is con*nuously reduced when the polymer is mixed with water”, Charlo2e Thy explains. Apart from the signiﬁcant reduc*on in the use of chemicals, the nega*ve environmental impact of the transporta*on is also reduced when the polymer is mixed at the aba2oir because water is not included in the road transporta*on. It is therefore in every way a change that pays oﬀ both ﬁnancially and environmentally and it is therefore the plan to extend the project to other plants. 25 Our Progress The total usage of cleaning chemicals has risen 5.4% on the previous year. Addi*onal hygiene requirements have meant an overall increase in the level of cleaning required to maintain high food standard prac*ces, although the increase may also be due to diﬀerent repor*ng methods in each part of the business. Cleaning chemicals are mainly used at the food processing plants and at the pig and sow slaugtherhouses in regards to food safety. 44% of the consump*on is within the processing plants, while 41% is used in the pig and sow slaughterhouses, including deboning, cuDng and retail pack ac*vi*es. 26 Waste Our Commitments Waste is a resource, and the method of handling it largely determines whether it can be recycled. Danish Crown is focusing eﬀorts on increasing the degree to which waste is sorted into recyclable waste frac*ons. This applies to plas*c and cardboard. We also want to use as much of the animal as possible for food. By strategically exploi*ng the diﬀerences that exist in global food cultures, we can sell more of the pig and the ca2le for consump*on, thereby reducing the loss of animal proteins. Objec*ves 2013-2018: ⇒ To increase the use of biological waste, including the use of animal byproducts, sludge and fer*lizer. ⇒ To increase the propor*on of waste which is reused, while taking account of the collec*on systems and recycling op*ons in the various countries. ⇒ To implement two to three projects on food waste per company per year. ⇒ To implement two projects on minimising packaging each year for the slaughterhouses and ﬁve projects per year for the processing companies. Case Study: Save Our Bacon Due to the size and diversity of Tulip Ltd’s opera*on, the business recognised it could have a signiﬁcantly posi*ve impact on the sustainability of the UK’s food manufacturing industry as a whole, and set about puDng in place a range of ini*a*ves across its opera*on to, wherever possible, reduce or eliminate waste throughout the supply chain. Adap*ng a holis*c approach in tackling waste the company developed its ‘Growing Responsibly’ strategy which acknowledges the necessity for the business to con*nue to grow, whilst puDng in place a framework that would allow this to happen in a sustainable way. Tulip’s ‘Save Our Bacon’ ini*a*ve which involves all elements of the company’s supply chain, quite literally from ﬁeld to fork, is a great example of how seriously the business is taking its commitment to growing responsibly. Working in partnership with WRAP and the Co-op, Tulip has adopted a problem-solving approach to reduce waste and improve resource eﬃciency by u*lising the principles of ‘lean thinking’ by determining what the end customer perceives as value and then developing a Value Stream Map (VSM) to analyse the value added and non-value added tasks and ac*vi*es along the whole supply chain. The ini*a*ve’s objec*ve was to iden*fy, quan*fy and eliminate or minimise the non-value added tasks and make recommenda*ons to be implemented across the industry to improve eﬃciency. Pig feed and more speciﬁcally crop growth represents the most signiﬁcant hotspot for waste. To date this has delivered a hugely signiﬁcant 15% reduc*on in waste, with further savings s*ll to come, and due to the success of this project we are in the process of rolling the ini*a*ve out across all of our manufacturing facili*es. “I felt that we hadn’t quite broke through the ‘ceiling’ at management level fully as the environmental programme threw up the age old ques*on ‘how do we get all our people to buy into this?’. By using lean techniques, followed up by providing detailed training for all our staﬀ to allow them to become involved in problem solving, has been a great success. The process has been informa*ve, engaging, thought provoking and fun which made it memorable, resul*ng in people wan*ng to be part of a change at both site and at home, which is a ‘win-win’ for everyone” says Neil Taylor, Tulip Site Manager – Tipton. 27 Case Study: Tulip bid to cut food waste Tulip Ltd is the ﬁrst UK manufacturer to oﬀer a chilled, gas ﬂushed, label re-sealable packaging format, which it believes will help in reducing food waste. The new packaging should make it easier for consumers across the country to use just the right amount of chilled cooked meats they require at any given *me, in an easy to use format. Ma2 Richards, Tulip’s Packaging Innova*on Manager explains; “We believe we’re the ﬁrst UK food manufacturer to oﬀer a label resealable, gas ﬂushed, chilled packaging format which we’re conﬁdent will prove a huge success with busy consumers, as it oﬀers them a convenient way of using just the right amount of product they need at any given *me, they can then re-seal the pack for later use. “The new packaging is convenient and simple to use, it should help to reduce food waste as tradi*onally consumers discard original packaging once it has been opened recovering unused product with ﬁlm wrap and, invariably, forgeDng to note the use by date. With the new format the use by date remains clearly visible, allowing consumers to make an informed choice and taking the guesswork out of whether they should use the rest of the contents.” Andy Wright, Tulip’s Corporate Responsibility manager added “We’ve made a commitment as part of our corporate responsibility plan to tackle supply chain food waste. This project is a great example of us delivering on that commitment.” Commen*ng on Tulip’s ini*a*ve Dr. Richard Swannell, Director Sustainable Food Systems WRAP said, “Food packaging has two important roles, to protect food in transit and to help prolong the life of the food within. This second func*on is important, and the new ini*a*ve from Tulip shows how innova*ve packaging can help give shoppers as much *me as possible to eat food, by helping it stay fresher for longer.” 28 Our Progress Non-organic waste is generated mainly through redundant packaging, either transit packaging or product packaging. This is mainly plas*c and cardboard. The vast majority of this waste will be recycled. Total non-organic waste levels have increased by 5.4% on the previous year. The processing plants cover 52% of the non-organic waste volume, while the pig and sow slaughterhouses including deboning, cuDng and retail pack ac*vi*es cover 27%. Byproducts for feed come from the slaughterhouses, 79% from the pigand sow slaughterhouses, 9% from the ca2le slaughterhouses and 9% from DAT-Schaub. Byproducts for destruc*on mainly derive from slaughterhouses. The pig and sow slaughterhouses deliver 70% of the total volume, while 16% comes from DAT-Schaub and 12% from the ca2le slaughterhouses. The remaining 2 per cent is from the deboning and processing ac*vi*es. The volume of byproducts for destruc*on is s*ll higher than the volume of byproducts for feed, but the diﬀerence in volume between the two categories has been reduced as Danish Crown companies have taken new ini*a*ves in order to improve u*lisa*on of raw materials. 29 30 Food Safety Our Commitments The quality and safety of the group’s products are given extremely high priority. We impose strict requirements in regards to cleaning, our own checks and traceability, and are con*nually working to improve our internal procedures. More than 95 per cent of produc*on takes place at facili*es cer*ﬁed by independent third par*es in accordance with the requirements and rules applicable in the countries where the products are marketed. Danish Crown’s facili*es are primarily cer*ﬁed on the basis of the following standards: GRMS (Global Red Meat Standard), SQF (Safe Quality Food), IFS (Interna*onal Food Standard) and BRC (Bri*sh Retail Consor*um). In addi*on to our own checks and external audi*ng in connec*on with the cer*ﬁca*ons, our products are checked by local authori*es as well as by our customers. Danish Crown requires that our European suppliers meet EU food safety requirements. We are also working to ensure that non-EU suppliers meet these requirements. An important aspect of food safety is iden*fying any product contamina*on/defects before products leave produc*on and are shipped to customers. This principle is guarded by a strict own control system that iden*ﬁes poten*al food safety issues. If a poten*al food safety risk is discovered the product will be deemed unﬁt for human consump*on and either used for animal feed or destroyed. Should the product have leC the produc*on sites, Danish Crown has established a procedure for recalling products and informing the public about the risks if a product presents a poten*al risk to the consumers. Objec*ves 2013-2018: ⇒ To keep product recalls at the lowest possible level. ⇒ To register and follow up on complaints. Our Progress Massive numbers of tests were carried out in 2014/15 in order to ensure food safety. During the ﬁnancial year a total of 279 ton of ﬁnished products were recalled due to food safety concerns. At the same *me, Danish Crown has looked into other methods of tes*ng the company´s products, with the aim of geDng the ﬁnal results earlier, thereby reducing the risk of contaminated meat reaching the consumers. In that regard Danish Crown has carried out trails with a new way of tes*ng for traces of an*bio*cs, which mean that DC Pork and DC Beef have signiﬁcantly reduced the *me it takes to iden*fy traces of an*bio*cs in meat. Case Study: New way of tes-ng strengthens food safety In 2015 Danish Crown began using a new mulchemical way of tes-ng for traces of an-bio-cs on a trial basis. In 2016 this way of tes-ng will become permanent. Fast and correct results of tes*ng are crucial, when talking food safety. Danish Crown con*nuously strives to improve tes*ng and obtain correct results even faster. Both became a lot easier in 2015, as Danish Crown began using a new way of tes*ng through mul* chemical analyses, which is used to test for traces of an*bio*cs in meat from pigs and ca2le. This way of analyzing is signiﬁcantly more expensive than the methods formerly used for tes*ng, which means that the number of analyses will be reduced. However the mul* chemical analyses has the huge advantage, that traces of a wide range of an*bio*cs will be found, while former tests only found traces of a predetermined range of an*bio*cs. The new way of tes*ng will become permanent in 2016 at all slaughtering facili*es within DC Pork and DC Beef. As the new way of tes*ng is much faster and much more precise than the former way of tes*ng, the mul* chemical analyses also strengthens Danish Crown posi*on as one of the most reliable food producers in the world regarding food safety. 31 Health Our Commitments Danish Crown wishes to play our part in improving consumer health, and every year we launch new products where focus is both on ﬂavour and on fat and salt content. We will ensure that our products carry nutri*onal labelling so that consumers have a genuine choice. Consumer preferences and demands vary at diﬀerent markets, and we therefore supply products tailored to diﬀerent tastes and economies. Objec*ve 2013-2018: ⇒ To oﬀer products that meet the oﬃcial nutri*onal recommenda*ons within as many diﬀerent product categories as possible. Our Progress The companies within the group constantly work on new product development focused on nutri*on and the reduc*on of fat and salt. In the ﬁnancial year 2014/15 103 projects concerning nutri*on were concluded, and of those 103 projects 89 turned out successful, while 14 were closed without reaching the results intended. An addi*onal 70 projects were s*ll running by the end of the ﬁnancial year. Case Study: Danepak bacon same great taste, now with 30% less salt Bacon experts, Danepak, the UK’s biggest bacon brand, have launched their new lower salt bacon. Made with 30% less salt than standard bacon, Danepak will be the ﬁrst brand in the UK to use an innova*ve curing process from manufacturer. The bacon, produced by Tulip Ltd, features Iposol, a solu*on of water and sea salt developed by Iposol GMBH. This cuDng edge process results in great tas*ng bacon that's 30% lower in salt and is be2er on the heart. Developed by food experts, this secret process is set to make one of Britain’s bestloved foods healthier without comprising on its mouth-watering taste. The great tas*ng bacon will be of interest to bacon lovers, foodies and the health conscious. 32 Case Study: Sokolow launch ini-a-ves to help diabe-cs As part of a new campaign launched by Coali-on for Diabe-cs, Sokolow has entered the baAle to provide beAer opportuni-es for diabe-cs More than 3 million Polish people suﬀer from diabetes. This means that a healthy diet is crucial for their well being. Sokolow has chosen to contribute to a new campaign launched by Coali*on for Diabetes, part of which is to inform diabe*cs with more knowledge about the right diet. “Our aim is very simple. We want to make it easier to live with diabetes. Diabetes is the ﬁrst non-infec*ous disease which the World Health Organiza*on considers an epidemic of twenty-ﬁrst century. This clearly indicates the need for more knowledge about how to live a life with diabetes” explains Communica*on Manager at Sokolow, Aleksandra Chalimoniuk. Part of the innova-on process Sokolow aim to make it easier for diabe*cs to buy food, by developing dishes which are developed speciﬁcally to meet the need of diabe*cs. “Sokolows mission is to meet the demands and needs of the consumers. As a lot of people suﬀer from diabetes it is crucial to Sokolow to develop products, which are suited for people suﬀering from diabetes. As a result most of our recent developments take the nutri*onal needs of diabe*cs into considera*on. One example of this is our recent line of beef products, sold under the name Uczta Qulinarna” explains Quality Director of Sokolow, Dr. Antoni Gibowicz. 33 Procurement Our Commitments Suppliers of consumables and subsidiary materials that come into direct contact with foods must, as a minimum, comply with the principles of the UN Global Compact, of con*nuously reducing their nega*ve environmental impacts and have a food safety system. Danish Crown is incorpora*ng these requirements in a Framework Agreement (FWA) as and when we conclude new agreements and renego*ate contracts. All future agreements will also require suppliers to comply with the UK Bribery Act. We assess whether our suppliers are complying with the requirements in connec*on with the annual Supplier Risk Assessments, and we carry out audits of suppliers where, in our view, it is necessary to raise competence levels. The purpose of the supplier audits is to iden*fy poten*al focus areas and to inspire suppliers to do more in the area of responsible business. If audits reveal signiﬁcant discrepancies, we demand that suppliers draw up ac*on plans that we will con*nually follow-up on. As part of the dialogue with suppliers, we encourage them to establish their own due diligence processes. This will help prevent them from having a nega*ve impact on the CSR principles, and to handle such an impact if it occurs. Danish Crown is opera*ng in several markets, where corrup*on and facilita*on payments can occur. We do not accept either corrup*on nor facilita*on payments, even if non-payment can lead to a signiﬁcant delay or other inconvenience for the company or our employees. We are ac*vely working to prevent facilita*on payments, and our policy is being impressed on all employees through regular risk analysis, par*cularly in regions where facilita*on payments are widespread. Objec*ves 2013-2018: ⇒ To implement the bribery and corrup*on policy in Danish Crown and aﬃliated companies. ⇒ To incorporate sustainability in all supplier contracts for all companies. ⇒ To carry out an ongoing assessment of the method and scope of the Supplier Risk Assessment, including the dissemina*on of the method to relevant companies. Our Progress Danish Crown carries out an on-going evalua*on of our suppliers. To standardise this process, a common procedure of supplier risk assessment has been taken into use within all group companies, with the excep*on of Plumrose USA and ESS-FOOD, which has not yet started to use the common supplier risk assessment. When assessing suppliers, areas such as the suppliers quality management system, environmental management system and CSR policy is taken into account. This includes guiding principles, ethics of nego*a*on, bribery, conﬂict of interest, travel and entertainment, giCs, rebate on private purchasing from suppliers and general guidance and concerns. Each of these areas are described thoroughly in the Danish Crown procurement Code of Prac*ce. The companies within the Danish Crown Group con*nuously monitor transac*ons in order to make sure that corrup*on or facilita*on payments do not occur in any transac*on. During the ﬁnancial year 2014/15 Danish Crown have not experienced any a2empt to break the rules made by Danish Crown concerning these areas. As the group has not become aware of any viola*on of the rules set regarding corrup*on and facilita*on payments the progress is considered acceptable. 34 Danish Crown supports the Global Compact Businesses should: Danish Crown examples: Page: Human rights 1. support and respect the protec*on of interna*onHuman Rights 14 ally proclaimed human rights; and Well-being 11 2. make sure that they are not complicit in human Procurement 34 rights abuses.
