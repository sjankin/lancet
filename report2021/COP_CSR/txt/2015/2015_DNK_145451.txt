UN Global Compact COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2015 Executive statement of continued support for the Global Compact from GAN founder Jens Berthelsen GAN Integrity Solutions joined the UNGC 10 June 2007, and we continue to wholeheartedly support the Principles of the UNGC. We are committed to living out those principles as a business internally as well as with our work for clients. GAN Integrity Solutions is committed to promoting corporate integrity.
