Since we joined GLOBAL COMPACT in 2012, wee started consciously implementing the Ten Principles Princi in our everyday operations and our business culture. culture Please find a report on our progress for or the period of 2014 201 to 2015 below. Human Rights Principle 1:: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. The respect for and protection of internationally proclaimed human rights is a very basic requirement and GRAND PARTNERS has never had any difficulty with that. Working in the areas of HR management and development we understand personal needs for safety and a respect as well as how businesses directly benefit from these policies as well. We have had an employee representative, who is required by Lithuanian law, but we've delegated many more rights to that person than required. In addition to taking care of employee safety at a workplace, this person overlooks such issues as internal communications and microclimate within the organization to ensure the optimal conditions for employees. We also invest in employee skills training, yearly events and celebrations. celebrati 4 GRAND PARTNERS Team Building Event, 2015 In addition to that we conduct yearly surveys that measure employee satisfaction and allows them to confidentially express their ideas for improvement. During yearly evaluations people discuss any problems they may have with their direct supervisor and find solutions as fast as possible. The outcome of retaining the best talent and quickly attracting potential otential employees fully covers the costs incurred. Labour Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Lithuania has regained its independence in 1991. Since then its economy has experienced very fast growth and development in many respects. Forced and compulsory labour have not been an issue after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Communist rule, which happened way before we started our business. Child labour has never been a problem in this country. However, collective bargaining is one of the hot topics in Lithuania.. GRAND PARTNERS has had several projects for three Clients in 2014, which helped their collective bargaining policies of their trade unions be more transparent and clear to its employees. Our consultants also conducted mediation services during some negotiations between the business and their trade union. We also have an ongoing cooperation cooperatio with one of the main trade-unions unions in the country and do pro-bono work for them to help them develop their effectiveness as well as build their influence. In general in our country in case there difficulties between an employer and employee, the employer is always the guilty side until it proves otherwise. In most cases that are taken to court, employee wins and the employer pays fines and compensation. However, However, there are a lot of cases when employees do not know their rights or are afraid to exercise them them because of a threat to lose their job. 5 At least 50% of our work consists of training and consulting in the area of human resources. We stress the importance of equal rights and opportunities opportunities for every employee. We emphasize that employees need to be judged ged based purely on their competencies and value they create for business and not their personal traits, beliefs or other factors that do not have direct impact on their work results. We deeply believe that businesses also benefit from that greatly not only onl because they are viewed as a more desirable and trustworthy employer, but also because it is easier for them to attract and retain talent. In 2013 2015 GRAND PARTNERS conducted 8 very large EU funded training projects for various business associations.. A total of about 120 various-sized various sized companies were involved. It was a requirement by the EU that every person in these projects takes a training in the area of gender equality. A group of senior consultants from GRAND PARTNERS and some additional gender equality consultants prepared three different 1-2 1 2 day training programs that were conducted in every company that participated in those projects. During those trainings: People found out that female discrimination is still very persistent; Some common practices tices that are still widely acceptable are considered to be female discrimination; Participants got advice who to contact in case of being victim to or witnessing any kind of gender discrimination; Employers got some help with their HR practices to make them them equal to both genders. We believe that those are only the first steps in equal rights and opportunities for all in business, but they are significant because people are starting to recognize these issues around them and are getting tools that allow them to react and stop unequal treatment of employees in the workplace. AT GRAND PARTNERS we are committed to implementing equal opportunities for all and to spreading these policies among all of our shareholders through our everyday operations as well as our training and consulting where ere it is appropriate. We have made equal rights part of our hiring and employee retention plan from the very beginning of our operation in 2004. Our team consists of almost an equal amount of men (40 %) and women (60 (6 %). Environment Principle 7: Businesses sses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. We still implement the very basic principles that help us stay as green and environmentally responsible as possible: Think before you print! Recycle! Reuse! Use scratch! Car-sharing sharing at all times possible! In 2014, we also started some initiatives to reduce direct carbon emission. Some of the practices we promote at work as well as our households include: 6 Using low-power light bulbs; Optimizing heating and cooling cycles; Responsible use of personal computers computers and IT equipment (e.g. setting computers to sleep mode when not in use, turning them off overnight and defaulting to double-sidedsided printing); printing Use of greener travel modes. Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. We are proud to be a responsible tax payer. We make our business as transparent to legal institutions and even our stakeholders as possible. We make sure that our business deals are based on what our Clients are willing to pay for the value we create. When When we participate in legal tenders, we attract sub-contractors contractors that see ethical business as their priority. We choose our suppliers, partners and consultants based on the their core competencies they can offer our Clients and make decisions based purely on the value we can create together. CONCLUSION We are glad to witness more of our partners and other companies from our industry joining the UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL AL COMPACT. COMPACT When we joined this initiative and started talking about it in 2012, people were surprised and wondered what this meant for our business and a them. Now the majority of more advanced companies have joined the GLOBAL COMPACT, some of the are active members at a local chapter. It is great to see this community of responsible business people rising. We are proud to be a part of it! Managing Director Goda Azeneckaite-Petraviciene Azeneckaite 7
