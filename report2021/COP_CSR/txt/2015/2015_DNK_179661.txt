Code of Conduct In 2013, we developed Balslev’s Code of Conduct, based on the ten principles of Global Compact, outlining how we act towards the surrounding world as a company. The mandatory introduction course for new employees includes lectures in our Code of Conduct and the applicable code of ethics, in order to make them an integrated part of our organisation. Social responsibility Balslev is a socially responsible company, and we are very serious about our contribution to solving common issues. In terms of employment, we have increased focus on reflecting the global society and aim to achieve diversity in terms of ethnicity, educational background, sex, religion, sexuality, age and work ability. We are further involved in the education of new employees within the industry, and have ongoing internships for students and counsellors on bachelor and master level. Our employees are dedicated tutors, assist with dissertations and give lectures and presentations for engineering students.

Introduction day for new employees Balslev believes in the importance of involvement and information about the company, our history, strategy and action plans. Thus, it is crucial that new employees receive a proper introduction to the workplace, and we have therefore established a mandatory introduction day for new employees. During the day, we introduce Balslev as a company, the individual departments and our competencies, as well as procedures and processes. The process is subsequently evaluated. We further develop a personal introduction plan for the first weeks in the company. Project management course for all employees Our employees are our most valuable asset and their knowledge and ability to run projects is vital to our success. Thus, it is essential to maintain a high level of knowledge and as a consequence, Balslev developed a grouped project management course, which was introduced in 2013. Established a formal liaison committee With a total of seven members three from management and four employees the group meets three to four times a year discussing current events. Stress prevention In order to prevent stress among Balslev’s employees, we have chosen to focus on how we as managers and employees become better in detecting stress symptoms before the situation gets critical, and better in handling stress once occurred. As a consequence, we have established a stress coach hotline that is open to all of Balslev’s employees, in case they need professional help for handling situations of emerging stress. The coach can offer instruments to tackle difficult situations and thereby prevent severe cases of stress. Resignation interview and outplacement Balslev has for the past year been focusing on ensuring a proper resignation for employees that are leaving the company. We conduct resignation interviews with all resigned employees, and initiate outplacement programmes in case of dismissal. COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 7 UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014/2015 ENVIRONMENT Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies technologies technologies. Our vision is to create the sustainable and intelligent solutions of tomorrow. We observe our vision through the great number of projects in which we play an advisory role. In planning and designing new buildings, installations, plants and infrastructures as well as renewal, Balslev does not only take the requirements of today into account. We do everything possible to ensure that the design has the required flexibility to accommodate future requirements in terms of: • Sustainability • Energy efficiency, hereunder recycling • Environmentally damaging or toxic substances • Recycling after the end of useful life. DGNB Balslev is DGNB certified and our consultant can be part of a building project team and provide guidance on sustainability and direct the focus towards areas that require special attention in order to guarantee sustainable building and DGNB certification. The DGNB system is a certification solution whose purpose is to create a common starting point for measuring and assessing sustainable building. The system is based on a holistic approach and a lifecycle assessment of a building and in that way it weighs a number of dimensions to assess sustainability. Energy optimisation consulting Our energy consultants are committed to optimise energy consumption in large buildings with both simple and more complicated installations. In close co-operation with the users and the owners’ heads of operations or technical departments, we have implemented a very large number of optimisation projects where we achieved significant energy savings with short pay back times. Research projects As consulting engineers, we are responsible for doing all the required research in terms of future energy supply, which is why our employees participate in several research projects within the area of intelligent energy. In 2015 we commenced as partners in the EUDP funded project EnergyLab Nordhavn New Urban Energy Infrastructures. The project will run from 2015-2019 and will serve as an experimental platform a real-life energy laboratory in Nordhavn. COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 8 UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014/2015 ANTI CORRUPTION Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Since consultants often change roles, depending on the project, we focus on maintaining our independent approach to the individual project and parties involved. In order to avoid conflicts of interests, Balslev’s employee handbook includes the following rule: „It is not allowed to receive gifts, discounts or the like from company suppliers, business partners or others, unless granted by a superior manager in each single case”. According to our Code of Conduct, Balslev does not tolerate any form of corrupt or fraudulent behaviour.
