One matter of concern was the book value of part of our 747-400F fleet that had to be adjusted in 2014; while we depreciate our All this must be seen against the prevailing economic difficulties, aircraft over 18 years, we finance them over 12 years. This measure low yields, severe competition and overcapacity we saw in 2014, ate up Cargolux’s operational profit for 2014, but the consolidated especially from carriers in the Middle East that continue to dump result after taxes and expenses still showed a black zero at the massive capacity into the market.

And unlike passenger that proved challenging. In contrast, Asia showed strong growth and airlines, Cargolux and other all-cargo carriers do not enjoy the produced solid loads, especially China. As we did in 2014 with high contribution of passenger revenue and subsidized belly freight, the build-up of Zhengzhou as our complementary hub in China’s but for us, cargo has to absorb the entire cost of flying.

The operational activity of the Cargolux fleet in 2014 significantly exceeded the budget; the company produced 11% more block hours than in 2013. Nevertheless, M&E managed to keep the schedule reliability on a high level, similar to 2013, and achieved an average dispatch rate of 97.3% for the 747-8F and 97.6% for the 747-400F. Cargolux takes delivery of its 12th and 13th 747-8 freighter in 2015 and expects to operate a fleet of 24 aircraft by the end of the year. This will add further to the level of activity of M&E and the organization is continuously implementing productivity improvements. HARD LANDING INCIDENT At the end of November 2014, one of our 747-8F aircraft experienced a hard landing in Libreville, Gabon; during the subsequent detailed inspections in our hangar in Luxembourg, deformation of some skin-panels and the keel beam were discovered. The aircraft was repaired in cooperation with Boeing’s AOG Team and went back into service in April 2015. 28 flight operations TRAINING Cargolux utilizes two full-motion flight simulators, one each for the 747-400F and the 747-8F. Based on 24 hours per day, the 747-400F simulator was used for 5,410:30 hours, a utilization of 62%, while the 747-8F simulator was used for 4,212:30 hours, or 48%. Apart from the company’s own crewmembers, Cargolux makes its simulators available for third-party training. The main customers in 2014 were Silkway Airlines of Azerbaijan and Cargolux Italia. In addition, Cargolux conducted training for mechanics from our Maintenance Division. MEDIA ATTENTION During the take-off on its delivery flight from Seattle, the crew of Cargolux’s 747-8F LX-VCJ performed a wing wave that deviated from the traditional procedure and resulted in a high bank angle at low altitude. This maneuver not only attracted considerable media interest, but also triggered an investigation by Cargolux’s Aviation Safety department as part the company’s safety management system (SMS). The investigation determined that the cause of this incident was the pilot flying’s handling of the maneuver he intended to fly. After receiving a specific flight data monitoring debriefing and after the completion of further recommended actions, the three crew members returned to flying duties. The safety management investigation has led to the decision to discontinue the traditional Cargolux wing wave on delivery flights. The Cargolux safety culture and its established SMS have proven to be significant steps forward to further enhance the safety of the airline’s operations. NETWORK Most of the airports in the Cargolux network are now certified for the 747-8F and only a few airports still remain to be certified for the operation of this larger aircraft type. In 2014, our 747-8F fleet operated to 99 commercial and 8 alternate destinations. In early 2015, Manaus became the 100th 747-8 certified airport in the Cargolux network. In addition to serving the major air freight lanes, we operate a dynamic network in order to meet the needs of our customers and to optimize the profitability of our scheduled flights. The network continues to be developed with new markets constantly analyzed for inclusion if it makes economic sense. 30 0 3 4 Consolidated income statement For the year ended December 31, 2014

At a 2014 average of US$/tonne 906, the jet fuel market price decreased by US$/tonne 81 compared to the preceding year. The average reflects both the strong fuel market prevailing until summer and the substantial price weakening during the rest of the year. Fuel hedges To manage its fuel price risk the Group uses derivative instruments, mainly options. Call options are purchased as insurance against high fuel prices. The Group is protected against high fuel prices above the call strike price and pays a premium for this insurance. The worst outcome of this strategy would be that the premium is not recovered. Fuel exposures are hedged over time. The hedging portfolio and the strategy are reviewed in regular meetings of the Group’s Fuel Risk Management Committee. The Committee works within a Governance framework of Policy and Procedures and actively manages the fuel hedge portfolio regularly reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

The company commits to lessen this impact as much as possible and has set a number of near and long-term goals to achieve this. Operating the most efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft results in a measurable improvement in fuel efficiency as well as a reduction in noise and CO2 emissions. The introduction of the new Boeing 747-8F fleet represents a significant investment for the company in monetary terms but yields excellent results, not only operationally but also for the environment. Communities, especially, benefit from a further 30% reduction in take-off noise compared to the already excellent values that the company’s 747-400 freighters show. Yet, Cargolux’s various programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions go beyond the operation of a ‘green’ fleet of aircraft and extend to its ground service vehicles, maintenance equipment and office facilities in Luxembourg. The company’s Ground Operations Division and its Luxembourg Station, as well as its Flight Operations Division, the Type Rating Organization and its Maintenance and Engineering Division are ISO 14001 certified, underlining its efforts to lower the environmental impact of its operations. Additionally, Cargolux continuously assess the environmental commitment of its ground handling agents throughout its network. The company’s environmental management system follows the requirements of the ISO 14001 certification in defining how to approach environmental challenges. Cargolux also encourages its staff to cut down on waste and has made conscious efforts to better control and segregate waste at its home base in Luxembourg. Cargolux is a major employer in Luxembourg and creates many jobs, not only at its home base, but also at many airports and communities around the world. However, as a good corporate citizen and neighbor, the company strives to further support the community, introducing young people to the many career opportunities in air cargo through school visits, presentations and a close relationship with the Lycée Technique Privé Emile Metz in Luxembourg that runs an aircraft mechanics apprenticeship program. In addition, Cargolux At a glance supports a number of NGOs that bring relief goods and medication to victims of natural disasters or health crisis around the world.
