Performance highlights in 2014/15 Our approach  Increased recycling of production waste. The primary method used by Coloplast to address Since last year, Coloplast increased our environmental challenges is the incorporation of recycling rate from 26% to 31%.

Her sister Thora has just had an ostomy operation and is afraid to go out, fearing that her stoma might leak in public. Listening to her sister’s problems, Elise creates the world’s first adhesive ostomy bag. A bag that does not leak, giving Thora – and thousands of people like her – the chance to return to their normal life. A simple solution with great significance. Today, our business includes ostomy care, urology and continence care and wound and skin care. But our way of doing business still follows Elise’s example: we listen, we learn and we respond with products and services that make life easier for people with intimate healthcare needs. Coloplast develops products and services that make life easier for people with very personal and private medical conditions.
