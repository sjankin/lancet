Note 8 Finance Income and Expenses 83 For development projects that have not been finalized and amortization has not started, a full impairment test is performed annually. The annual impairment process occurs Funded by customers (18) in the fourth quarter after the budget process has been completed. The impairment test is done for each development project by updating the initial business case that Note 9 Earnings per Share 83 Research and development expense 185 132 was used when approving the development. The impairment testing is done using a value-in-use approach. This means that all future cashflows are re-assessed and a Note 10 Tax 84 new net present value is calculated. Impairment losses are recognized for projects where net present value of future cashflows does not exceed book value of expected Note 11 Property, Plant and Equipment 87 Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the expected economic life, ranging between 5-10 years. capitalized amount upon completion of the development.

Aker Solutions ASA is the owner of the cash pool system arrangements with DNB, Nordea and The Royal Bank of Scotland. The cash pool systems cover a majority of the group geographically and assure good control and access to the group’s cash. Participation in the cash pool is vested in the group policy and decided by each company’s board of directors and confirmed by a statement of participation. Certain entities in Brazil, Angola and other locations do not participate in the cash pool arrangements due to local restrictions. The participants in the cash pool system are joint and severably liable and it is therefore important that Aker Solutions as a group is financially viable. Any debit balance on a sub account can be offset against any credit balance. Hence a debit balance represents a claim on Aker Solutions ASA and a credit balance a borrowing from Aker Solutions ASA. The cash pool systems were showing a net balance of NOK 1,717 million per December 31. This amount is reported in Aker Solutions ASA’s accounts as short term borrowings from group companies and as cash in cash pool system. Aker Solutions ASA is the group’s central treasury function and enters into borrowings and deposit agreements with group companies. Deposits and borrowings are agreed at market terms and are dependent on the group companies’ credit rating and the duration of the borrowings. 124 AKER SOLUTIONS ANNUAL REPORT 2014 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AKER SOLUTIONS ASA AKER SOLUTIONS ASA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AKER SOLUTIONS ANNUAL REPORT 2014 125 INTRODUCTION 4 GLOBAL EXPANSION 12 INNOVATION 16 DELIVERING EXCELLENCE 20 PEOPLE 24 RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS 29 BOARD OF DIRECTOR’S REPORT 53 Note 10 Financial Risk Management and Financial Instruments Note 11 Guarantees FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CURRENCY RISK Amounts in NOK million 2014 AKER SOLUTIONS GROUP 64 2014 Amounts in NOK million Assets Liabilities Parent company guarantees to group companies1 58,017 Counter guarantees for bank/surety bonds2 5,252 AKER SOLUTIONS ASA 116 Forward exchange contracts with group companies 2,476 (900) Total guarantee liabilities 63,269 Financial Statements 115 Forward exchange contracts with external counterparts 304 (1,881) Income Statement 116 Total 2,780 (2,781) MATURITY OF GUARANTEE LIABILITIES: Statement of Financial Position 117 6 months and less 1,036 Statement of Cashflow 118 Aker Solutions ASA have entered into forward exchange contracts with subsidiaries in 2014 with a total value of about NOK 58 billion.
