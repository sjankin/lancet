Geopolitics, global security concerns, economic uncertainties and the current environment, with market volatility, which may have driven investors to precious metals as a safe haven in the past, had no direct correlation to prices this a commitment to long-term year; gold and silver prices were both lower in the year. However, these circumstances provided us with an opportunity to acquire the value creation.” remaining 44% of Penmont (and associated companies), substantially strengthening our gold production and resources. Alberto Baillères The overall decline of precious metals equities affected all companies Non-executive Chairman in the sector; however, Fresnillo’s low cost operations, strong balance sheet, high quality assets and a solid pipeline of organic growth projects provided some defence. Nonetheless, the Company’s financial performance in the year was affected by a 10.2% decline in our average realised gold price, which fell to US$1,257.7 per ounce, and an 18.4% fall in our average realised silver price, to US$18.6 per ounce. Optimising performance through the cycle Against this backdrop we also faced a number of internal challenges: lower ore grade at the Fresnillo mine, the stoppage of operations at Soledad-Dipolos, and processing capacity issues at Herradura. Yet, as outlined in the Chief Executive’s report, these factors were mitigated by increased production at other mines and important measures taken to secure our 2018 production targets. Silver production, including the Silverstream, of 45.0 moz exceeded our budget and 2013 production. Having acquired Newmont Mining’s 44% interest in Penmont (and associated companies), we met the revised gold production target of 590 koz, producing 596 koz. Development projects advanced according to plan: Saucito II commenced operations in December 2014 and San Julián is set to start up in the 4Q 2015. This progress was achieved in the context of a maturing sustainability framework and a continuously improving safety culture. Our strategy of continued investment in exploration to underpin organic growth yielded good results. We added 3.0 moz gold (+45.0%) and 102.2 moz silver (+21.3%) to our reserves, although lower price assumptions led to a narrower increase in gold resources (+1.7%) and a 6.2% decrease in silver resources. We were particularly encouraged by the strong increase in resources and reserves at Herradura, underscoring the value of our acquisition. Fresnillo plc reported adjusted revenue of US$1,545.0 million in 2014, down 12.3% from 2013, and EBITDA of US$567.3 million, 22.3% lower than in the previous year. Profit attributable to equity shareholders, excluding Silverstream effects, was US$54.5 million, down 80.4%. These figures reflect the decline in average realised silver and gold prices, lower volumes of gold sold and increased stripping in the Herradura district in accordance with mine plans, all of which were partially mitigated by lower refining charges and the devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar. While profit margins declined in the period, cost control measures and certain efficiency improvements allowed us to maintain our position as a low cash cost producer.

There is little consensus today on where we are in the current cycle On management’s recommendation, the total investment in exploration and which catalysts might bear most impact on pricing. In the face of for 2014 was reduced from the original US$225.0 million budget to such uncertainties, we choose to be conservative in our projections. US$184.5 million. However, as costs for contracted exploration and drilling Notwithstanding, I remain committed to our proven strategy in have declined, the pace of progress was essentially unchanged from plan. precious metals. Our priority, for 2015 and beyond, is firmly set With the US$450.0 million acquisition of Newmont Mining’s 44% interest on value creation. Thus, management must continue to focus on in Penmont (and associated companies), all current operations, two key managing ore grades, optimising capacity and throughput, bringing on advanced exploration projects and a number of exploration targets in new projects, and extending the growth pipeline, all while continuing one of Mexico’s most attractive gold belts are now fully attributable to to contain costs, enhance sustainability practices and uphold our the Group. As a result, our 2018 gold production target increased from commitment to stakeholders. 500,000 ounces to 750,000 ounces. In light of that commitment, the Board has authorised a total budget In line with our conservative growth strategy, Fresnillo initiated a of approximately US$170 million to be invested in exploration one-off hedging programme to protect the value of the investment and early stage underground development in 2015, a decrease of made in the Penmont acquisition, allowing for partial exposure to gold 7.9% from the 2014 figure.

While there was no shortage of geopolitical risk in the year, which may have offered price support to gold in the past given Challenge creates opportunity its safe haven status, the impact was muted compared to prior periods This is not to say we did not encounter internal challenges in the year. of turmoil. However, as I lay out below, these have in fact provided us with an opportunity to adapt, innovate, modify and enhance our operations such that our long-term outlook is secure. Strategy drives value creation The first key challenge was at the Fresnillo mine, where we faced With price cycles much less predictable now, a company’s strategy, the natural and expected decline of silver ore grades; this was business model and execution have become the barometers of further exacerbated by dilution due to rock conditions and a delay in value‑creation and longevity. We know that sheer size alone does development activities as a result of mechanical failures with contractor not determine success – but that operational excellence, targeted equipment, limiting access to some stopes in the first quarter of the year. investment, disciplined cash management, and a commitment to shared value just may. In that regard, I remain confident Combined, these factors clearly had an impact on the mine’s silver that we are on the right path. production, down 11.7% year on year, but it also prompted us to adjust mining methods, change drilling layouts, bring in new contractors, and For Fresnillo, production goals have always been set according to our implement stricter controls on development rates, all of which will ability to profitably maximise operations, develop new projects and support production volumes next year.

Our value chain sets strategic relationships directly in the economies of scale. centre, with the recognition that shared value creates the support required to sustain our business model. Second, as you may recall, we entered 2014 with a suspended explosives permit at our subsidiary Minera Penmont, arising from the legal challenge How is this reflected in our performance? By design, our mines are set raised by the Ejido El Bajío agrarian community in 2013, who contested to yield returns even in a low metal price environment. All-in sustaining the ownership of the surface land of the Dipolos pit and the beneficiation costs (AISC) on a life of mine basis in most of our mines are amongst the plant of the Soledad-Dipolos mine.

Strengthening our precious metals position We went on to significantly bolster our gold outlook during the year. We allocated US$184.5 million to exploration during the year. In October we acquired Newmont Mining’s 44% interest in Penmont While this was somewhat below the original budget, we identified (and associated companies), allowing us to take full ownership of the a number of promising new targets in the mining districts where we assets we already operated, and strengthening our regional footprint operate, an approach that has proven to deliver cost-effective discoveries in one of Mexico’s richest gold belts.

Financial performance The Group’s financial performance was negatively impacted by the decline in precious metal prices. Our average realised silver and gold prices decreased by 18.4% and 10.2% respectively compared to 2013. We were also affected by the reduced sales volumes of gold resulting from the suspended operations at Soledad-Dipolos and the temporary halt in production at Herradura.

Mexico is the largest producer of silver in the world and a top global producer of gold, copper and zinc, amongst other minerals. The country has a long mining tradition, and still vast reserves of unexploited minerals. Changing labour landscape According to the Ministry of Economy, 70% of the Mexican territory is In 2014 a Mexican court exonerated a powerful exiled labour leader, suitable for the development of mining projects.

We believe a number of events in the Mexican mining industry in 2014, including major environmental incidents, on-going land access issues and labour union developments, have the potential to adversely impact the entire industry. As such we determined that certain risks facing Fresnillo plc have changed; the risk rating levels have increased for potential actions by the government, public perception against mining, and access to land; we also designated union relations as a separate principal risk from human resources, within which it had previously been included.

At the end of 2014, the physical advance was 45%, according to plan; the expenses incurred and committed were on budget. The major risk factor specific to this project is to determine a sufficient water supply for when the mine becomes operational; the Company has begun to develop engineering plans as well as obtaining permits for the construction of a dam and/or a deep well. In 2013 the Board approved the Saucito II project with an investment of US$235 million; Saucito is expected to produce 8.4 million ounces of silver and 35,000 ounces of gold per year once at full capacity. In December 2014, the treatment plant commenced operations, and we expect to ramp up production according to plan in 2015. At the Centauro Deep project exploration continued in 2014, but additional exploration activities are required to accurately define the ore bodies.

We produced a record 45.0 million ounces of silver in 2014 (including the Silverstream) mainly as a result of higher ore throughput and maintenance efficiencies at Saucito and greater contribution from the Silverstream; these factors more than offset the expected lower ore grade at Fresnillo and higher dilution and development delays in some of that mine’s stopes, as well as lower than expected silver ore grade at Ciénega. Gold production of 596 thousand ounces declined slightly from 2013, mainly as a result of the stoppage of operations at Soledad-Dipolos and the expected lower ore grade at Ciénega, as well as technical and capacity issues associated with the ramp-up of operations at Herradura; an increase in ore deposited at Noche Buena and higher contribution from Saucito supported gold production levels. We took vital steps to increase development rates and mitigate the decrease in ore grades at Fresnillo; optimised milling capacity at Ciénega; started up the dynamic leaching plant at Herradura and ramped up production at the mine following the temporary explosives suspension from the previous year, putting in place the steps to address technical and capacity issues in 2015; acquired Newmont’s 44% stake in Penmont, consolidating our position in one of Mexico’s richest gold belts; and ramped up capacity at Noche Buena following an expansion of the processing plant. Our development projects advanced according to plan, with the completion of Saucito II on time and budget, and construction advancing at San Julián toward its expected commencement in 4Q 2015. Exploration mainly focused on areas of influence at current operating mines and key exploration projects, with notable findings at Mega Centauro, Centauro Deep, Guanajuato and Rodeo. Despite the lower price assumptions used to estimate resources and reserves, gold resources and reserves increased 1.7% and 45.0% respectively; silver reserves rose 21.3% and resources declined 6.2%. We also obtained OHSAS 18001 certification at Fresnillo, Penmont and Ciénega, an international occupational health and safety standard; implemented safety action plans following situational assessment audits at every unit; adopted new industry best practices in stakeholder engagement within our communities; and improved the gender balance in our operations. Despite the increase in unit prices of key materials such as diesel and electricity, as well as the 5.5% increase in wages paid in Mexican pesos, our focus on efficiency gains and cost controls, combined with the benefit of the 4.1% devaluation of the average Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate, allowed us to reduce cash cost per ounce of metal produced at almost every mine this year, maintaining our position as a low cost producer. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 55 Our Mines in Operation 1 2 1 Operate: Maximise the Potential 3 4 of Existing Operations Risk Management Framework Fresnillo Fresnillo is the largest primary silver mine in the Ownership: 100% Fresnillo plc Location: Zacatecas world and one of the world’s oldest continuously In operation since: 1554 Mine life (years): 10.2 (2013: 11.8) operating mines; it produced 44.7% of the Group’s Facilities: Underground mine and flotation plant total silver in 2014, compared to 53.1% in 2013, Milling capacity (2014): 8,000 tpd/2,640,000 tpy and generated 29.8% of adjusted revenue.

Continue preparatory works to deepen San Carlos shaft We expect silver ore grades to average approximately 250 g/t in 2015, Expand tailings dam and approximately 265 g/t in the long term. We expect the volumes of ore milled in 2015 to increase due to efficiencies in the milling process and the additional volumes of ore processed from the development works at the mine. Silver contained in resources decreased by 5.9% to 753.0 million ounces whilst in terms of reserves, silver content decreased by 17.4% to 229.3 million ounces. This resulted from the 7.7% decrease in silver price used to calculate reserves and resources, as well as delayed development. 2014 Adjusted 2014 Capex US$ revenue US$ Capital expenditures 175.9m 460.3m Total capex of US$175.9 million in 2014 was allocated mainly to mine +9.3% development and sustaining capex. This figure does not include mining –21.8% works at San Julián and acquisition of equipment at Orisyvo (wholly owned by Minera Fresnillo) where US$112.3 million and US$1.2 million, respectively, were invested in 2014. In 2015 capex will be allocated to equipment replacement, preparation of new stopes and the continuation of preparatory works to deepen the San Carlos shaft, which will reduce haulage costs and increase access to ore reserves at deeper levels of the mine. Based on the progress of mine stope development, we expect to commence the expansion of milling capacity in 2015 and commercial production to start in 2017. This will include the adjustments necessary to process higher lead and zinc ore grades.

This additional volume enabled us to take advantage of available capacity Obtain Clean Industry and ISO 14001 certifications at the Fresnillo beneficiation plant, and efficiencies in the Saucito plant. Saucito II successfully commenced operations on time and on budget in What we did in 2014 the fourth quarter of 2014, with an incurred capex of US$180 million as Saucito II plant commenced operations on time and on budget in 4Q 2014 of December 2014. The remaining US$55 million for the total anticipated Mine development on the Jarillas vein at Saucito was increased in capex of US$235 million is expected to be spent in 2015 on in-mine preparation for the Saucito II expansion; additional material was development. Saucito II will contribute an additional 8.4 million ounces processed from these development activities, partly at the Fresnillo of silver and 35,000 ounces of gold per year once at fully capacity, which beneficiation plant we now expect to reach ahead of the three-year timeframe previously anticipated. The total production at Saucito (including Saucito II once at Reserves decreased as a result of lower price assumptions, despite full capacity) is expected to average approximately 20 million ounces of significant conversion of resources into reserves silver and 75,000 ounces of gold per year. Advanced process to obtain Clean Industry and ISO 14001 certifications In 2015, the average silver ore grade at Saucito is expected to be around 290 g/t and going forward, is expected to average approximately 350 g/t.

As a result, a foreign exchange loss of US$24.4 million was review during the period, resulted in a weighted average increase of 3.4% recognised in the income statement. in dollar terms (equivalent to 1.9%-12.2% in Mexican pesos). The strengthening of the US dollar against the Mexican peso also caused an increase in the difference between accounting values of assets and Maintenance liabilities in US dollars under IFRS and tax values in Mexican pesos under Unit prices of spare parts to provide maintenance decreased 0.3% in Mexican tax legislation. As a result, additional deferred taxes were US dollars. recognised in the income statement, thus affecting the effective tax rate.

Energy The Group uses mainly two sources of energy, electricity and diesel. Revenues Electricity Adjusted revenues decreased by 12.3% to US$1,545.0 million in 2014 The Group’s weighted average cost of electricity remained unchanged as a result of the lower gold and silver prices and the decrease in at US$11.0 cents per kW in 2014. Electricity rates are set by the Comisión sales volumes of gold, mainly from Soledad-Dipolos and Ciénega Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the national utility, based on their average (see table above). generating cost, which correlates mainly to fuel oil and coal prices. In 2014, we entered into derivative contracts to hedge lead and zinc through respective collar structures, resulting in a US$0.1 million gain Diesel recorded in the income statement. In addition, we initiated a one-off gold The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars increased 6.3% to hedging programme to protect the value of the investment made in the US$83.5 cents per litre in 2014.

Mexicanos (PEMEX), the national oil company, and are not expected to decrease in the near term despite the decline in international oil prices. The total metal price effect (lower prices of gold, silver and lead mitigated by an increase in zinc price), resulted in an adverse impact on revenues Operating materials of US$238.0 million. This was partially mitigated by the US$21.1 million In 2014, unit prices of the majority of key operating materials decreased favourable impact of the total volume effect; which resulted from the due to the lower demand for these inputs, resulting in a net weighted higher volumes of silver sold at Saucito and higher volumes of zinc sold average decrease of 1.8%. This reflects the combined effect of price from the underground mines; partially offset by the lower sales volumes inflation and the weighting of each component in the total cost of of gold due to the stoppage at Soledad-Dipolos. operating materials (see table above). In 2014, silver and gold contributed in nearly equal parts to adjusted revenues. In terms of adjusted revenues by mine, Fresnillo remained the main contributor to adjusted revenues, albeit with a lower contribution. Saucito and Noche Buena increased their contributions as a result of their respective expansions that increased sales volumes. In contrast, the lower gold and silver ore grades at Ciénega combined with the lower precious metal prices resulted in a decrease in its contribution to adjusted revenues. At Herradura, the lower gold price was the main driver reducing its contribution to consolidated adjusted revenues (see table above). 1 Treatment and refining charges include the cost of treatment and refining as well as the margin charged by the customer. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 99 Financial Review continued Adjusted revenues by metal 2014 2013 Gold 47% 47% Silver 46% 48% Zinc 4% 2% Lead 3% 3% Total 100% 100% Adjusted revenue by mine 2014 2013 US$m US$m Fresnillo 460.3 588.3 Saucito 372.5 326.3 Herradura 342.7 379.4 Ciénega 206.0 250.7 Noche Buena 163.5 148.4 Soledad-Dipolos 0.0 68.8 Total 1,545.0 1,761.9 Adjusted revenues by mine 2014 2013 Change % Volumes of metal sold Silver (koz) Fresnillo 19,513 21,709 (10.1) Saucito 14,684 11,073 32.6 Ciénega 3,427 3,760 (8.9) Herradura 673 295 128.0 Noche Buena 100 47 111.9 Soledad-Dipolos 0 30 (100.0) Total Silver (koz) 38,398 36,914 4.0 Gold (koz) Fresnillo 32 29 8.6 Saucito 53 42 26.4 Ciénega 97 107 (9.3) Herradura 264 262 0.5 Noche Buena 128 107 19.7 Soledad-Dipolos 0 47 (100.0) Total Gold (koz) 573 594 (3.5) Lead (mt) Fresnillo 12,754 13,821 (7.7) Saucito 8,959 4,835 85.3 Ciénega 3,655 3,934 (7.1) Total Lead (mt) 25,369 22,591 12.3 Zinc (mt) Fresnillo 12,657 12,385 2.2 Saucito 8,643 3,772 129.2 Ciénega 5,399 4,694 15.0 Total Zinc (mt) 26,699 20,851 28.1 100 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Strategy Performance Cost of sales The above adverse effects were partially mitigated by decreases in: Cost of sales totalled US$892.6 million, an increase of 5.3% over 2013. –– Variation in change in work in progress and inventory write down The US$44.9 million increase is explained by a combination of factors: (–US$103.4 million): This was mainly explained by the increase in ore inventories on the leaching pads at Herradura as a result of not having –– Adjusted production costs (+US$110.3 million): The increase was sufficient capacity at the Merrill Crowe plant to process all the rich mainly driven by: i) the increased ore throughput at Noche Buena, solution coming from both the pads and the new dynamic leaching Saucito and Ciénega (+US$60.5 million); ii) the temporarily higher plant.

As a result Alberto Baillères of these developments, I believe we are entering a new phase in the Chairman of the Board evolution of our board governance, which will build on the achievements that we have made since our IPO in 2008. The composition of the Board changed when three Directors did not stand for re-election at the Annual General Meeting in May 2014, and three new independent Non-executive Directors were appointed in their place. I am most grateful to Lord Cairns, Fernando Solana and Javier Fernández for their contributions to the Board and its committees over the past few years and I will be sorry not to have the benefit of their wisdom and counsel in the future. However, as the UK Corporate Governance Code expects boards to look at their composition on a regular basis, I, along with my colleagues on the Nominations Committee, took this expectation seriously and a year or so ago embarked on a process which resulted in our new Directors – Jaime Serra, Bárbara Garza Lagüera and Charles Jacobs – joining the Board at the 2014 AGM. Our new Directors bring useful new skills and experience to the Board and, of course, the process continues to honour our commitment to the principle of broad diversity in the boardroom. I am pleased that this transition has gone well and I would like to thank my Board colleagues – both old and new – for making it such a smooth and effective process. 110 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Continuing the theme of effectiveness, I said last year that we would conduct our second externally facilitated board evaluation exercise in UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 and we have fulfilled that commitment.

Our decision was guided by the principles set out in our Board Chairman of the Nominations Committee Appointments and Board Diversity policies which are summarised below and on our Company website. Consequently, when recommending the new appointments to the Board, we were able to recognise the potential contribution that each of them could make to the Board on account of their knowledge and experience. I believe that the quality of these new appointments also justifies our decision not to use external agencies to assist in the appointment process. Given the importance of the Mexican context for most of our operations and recognising our responsibilities as a UK-quoted company, we believe that the Company’s contacts provide the best source of quality candidates. We have also considered the composition of our Board committees following the Board changes and we have ensured that all of our independent Non-executive Directors now have a role on at least one Board committee. As far as the Nominations Committee is concerned, I would like to thank Javier Fernández for his contribution to that Committee over the past few years and I look forward to working with Bárbara Garza Lagüera as she joins the Committee.

Remuneration Committee Board appointments Lord Cairns (Chairman) Charles Jacobs (Chairman) Recognising that the majority of the Board had been in post since the Company’s IPO in 2008, the Nominations Committee has, since 2013, been considering the need for progressive refreshing of the Board, as recommended by Code Provision B.2.3 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. This thinking was developed over a period of time through discussions between the Chairman and each Director. As a result of those discussions, it was agreed that Lord Cairns, Javier Fernández and Fernando Solana would not stand for re-election at the 2014 AGM. A number of candidates were considered for appointment and three new independent Non-executive Directors – Bárbara Garza Lagüera, Charles Jacobs and Jaime Serra – were appointed.

I felt comfortable in taking on the role as Chairman of the Company’s Remuneration Committee from Lord Cairns while at the same time with effect from the 2014 AGM for two reasons. Firstly, under the wise chairmanship of Lord Cairns and with the input of his fellow members not forgetting the Mexican of the Remuneration Committee, the Company has since its listing on the London Stock Exchange back in 2008 adopted a conservative and traditions of the Company measured approach in relation to the whole issue of remuneration.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee As a Committee we feel it is important to embrace the governance requirements of the UK while at the same time not forgetting the Mexican traditions of the Company and that our management team is based in Mexico. In view of the above, we will continue to report on the remuneration of our Chief Executive Officer as if he was a member of the Board of Directors. Consistent with the approach of many Mexican companies, we adopt a conservative approach in relation to remuneration and have no current intention of requiring Executive Directors to build up an equity stake in the Company whether by way of share options or otherwise. We have not made any changes to the Remuneration Policy adopted at last year’s AGM but we have reproduced it in this year’s annual report for ease of reference. We have also established, with the assistance of Towers Watson, a peer group for benchmarking the Chief Executive’s salary and the percentage range within which it should be set.

The employing company may also make additional contributions between 5% and 8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match contribution percentages between 5% and 8% of salary.

What we have audited We have audited the financial statements of Fresnillo plc as at 31 December 2014 and for the year then ended which comprise: –– the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets; –– the Consolidated Income Statement; –– the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Comprehensive Income; –– the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flow; –– the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity; and –– the related notes 1 to 34 of the Group financial statements and 1 to 19 of the Parent Company financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 155, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 158 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Our application of materiality We consider profit before tax to be one of the principal considerations for members of the Group; however, we believe that members focus on the results before the remeasurements of the Silverstream contract. We, therefore, determined materiality with reference to pre-Silverstream revaluation effect profit before tax. We calculated materiality at the planning stage of our audit and updated it based on actual full-year results which reflected the effect of foreign exchange losses at the year end and the write-off of property, plant and equipment at Soledad-Dipolos. Final materiality was US$8.7 million (2013: US$23.6 million), which is 5% of profit before tax and before the effects of the Silverstream revaluation (2013: 5%). The decrease in materiality from prior year reflects the decrease in commodity prices, the effects of foreign exchange rates, particularly on indirect taxation balances, and the write off of assets at Soledad-Dipolos. On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is that overall performance materiality for the Group should be 75% of materiality (2013: 75%), namely US$6.5 million (2013: US$17.7 million). Our objective in adopting this approach was to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of US$0.4 million (2013: US$1.2 million), as well as differences below that threshold that in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the light of other relevant qualitative considerations. The scope of our audit Our assessment of audit risk and our evaluation of materiality determined our audit strategy and scope. The factors that we considered in our assessment included the following: financial significance, specific risks, effectiveness of the control environment and monitoring activities, including entity-level controls and recent internal audit findings. Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, we focused our Group audit scope on eight components (2013: eight) which represent the principal business units within the Group. Five of these were subject to a full scope audit (2013: five) and accounted for 77% of the Group’s profit before tax (2013: 68%) and 70% of the Group’s net assets (2013: 71%). The remaining three were subject to an audit of specific account balances (Specific Scope Components), and accounted for 19% of the Group’s profit before tax (2013: 19%) and 27% of the Group’s net assets (2013: 25%). The extent of audit work on Specific Scope Components was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s business operations at that component. For the remaining components, we performed analytical procedures and other procedures to confirm that there was no residual risk of material misstatement in the Group financial statements. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative size of the component and our view of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality assigned to components was US$1.3 million to US$3.6 million (2013: US$5.1 million to US$14.0 million). The Group’s significant operations are in Mexico. All of the components are audited by one local team under our direct supervision. We, including the senior statutory auditor, visited the local team during all stages of the audit, participated in discussions on fraud and error and directed the approach and execution of the work of the local team, focusing on areas with higher inherent risk. We, including the senior statutory auditor, reviewed key working papers including but not limited to the risk areas described below. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 159 Independent Auditor’s Report continued to the members of Fresnillo plc Risks of material misstatement We discuss below the risks of material misstatement which had the greatest effect on the audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team and our response to those risks. The Audit Committee’s response to these risks is set out in the Audit Committee’s Report on pages 129-141.

1. Corporate information Fresnillo plc. (‘the Company’) is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 4 (‘the Group’). Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V. (‘Peñoles’) currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baillères family, whose beneficial interest is held through Peñoles. Copies of Peñoles’ accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. Further information on related party balances and transactions with Peñoles’ group companies is disclosed in note 29. The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc. on 3 March 2015. The Group’s principal business is the mining and beneficiation of non-ferrous minerals, and the sale of related production. The primary contents of this production are silver, gold, lead and zinc. Further information about the Group operating mines and its principal activities is disclosed in note 3. On 1 January 2014, as a part of an internal reorganisation to mitigate risk exposure, the operating entities without being extinguished transferred part of their assets, liabilities and capital through a spin-off into eight new entities. As a result of the spin-off Fresnillo plc. continues retain control over the new entities. See note 4. 2. Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation and consolidation, and statement of compliance Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial instruments and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as of 31 December 2014 and 2013, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended. Entities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein, see note 4. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance. Transactions with non-controlling interest that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, a transaction with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interest are also recorded in equity. (b) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective as of 1 January 2014, the amendment to the cash and cash equivalents and borrowing costs accounting policies and the new accounting policy for short-term investments. 168 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Amendments to accounting policies –– Cash and cash equivalents In light of the Group placing funds in new types of instruments and short-term deposits, as compared to prior year, the Group has amended its accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents as follows: For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have maturities of between one day and four months. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Short-term investments accounting policy Where the Group invests in short-term instruments which are either not readily convertible into known amounts of cash or are subject to risk of changes in value that are not insignificant, these instruments are classified as short-term investments. Short-term investments are classified as loans and receivables. New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group The nature and the impact of each new standard and amendment is described below: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: The standard replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated being those investees in which the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group adopted this standard as at 1 January 2014, as adopted by the European Union. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the financial position and performance of the Group. IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities: IFRS 12 includes all of the disclosures that were previously in IAS 27 related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and IAS 28. These disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and structured entities. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 with the adoption of IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IAS 27 (2012) and IAS 28 (2012). The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the financial position and performance of the Group, the new disclosures required has been presented in note 4. Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32: These amendments clarify the meaning of ‘currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’ and the criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting and is applied retrospectively. These amendments have no impact on the Group, since none of the entities in the Group has any offsetting arrangements. Disclosure for Impairment for Non-financial Assets – Amendments to IAS 36: This amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. Addition the IASB added two disclosure requirements: –– Additional information about the fair value measurement of impaired assets when the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal –– Information about the discount rates that have been used when the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal using a present value technique. The amendments harmonise disclosure requirements between value in use and fair value less costs of disposal These amendments have no impact on the Group, since there are no impairment in non-financial assets. Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting – Amendments to IAS 39: These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria and retrospective application is required. These amendments have no impact on the Group as the Group has not novated its derivatives during the current or prior periods. IFRIC 21 Levies: IFRIC 21 clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be anticipated before the specified minimum threshold is reached. Retrospective application is required for IFRIC 21. There was no impact on prior year comparative figures as a result of the application of IFRIC 21. Annual improvements 2010-2012 cycle: In the 2010-2012 annual improvements cycle, the IASB issued seven amendments to six standards, which included an amendment to IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. The amendment to IFRS 13 is effective immediately and, thus, for periods beginning at 1 January 2014, and it clarifies that in the Basis for Conclusions, short-term receivables and payables with no stated interest rates can be measured at invoice amounts when the effect of discounting is immaterial. This amendment to IFRS 13 has no impact on the Group. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 169 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards that it considers will be applicable to the Group’s financial statements, when they become effective. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. Early application of previous versions of IFRS 9 (2009, 2010 and 2013) is permitted if the date of initial application is before 1 February 2015. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 9 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date. Annual improvements 2010-2012 cycle: These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group. They include: IFRS 3 Business Combinations: The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that all contingent consideration arrangements classified as liabilities (or assets) arising from a business combination should be subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable). IFRS 8 Operating Segments: The amendments are applied retrospectively and clarify that: –– an entity must disclose the judgements made by management in applying the aggregation criteria in paragraph 12 of IFRS 8, including a brief description of operating segments that have been aggregated and the economic characteristics (e.g. sales and gross margins) used to assess whether the segments are ‘similar’; and –– the reconciliation of segment assets to total assets is only required to be disclosed if the reconciliation is reported to the chief operating decision maker, similar to the required disclosure for segment liabilities. IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies that a management entity (an entity that provides key management personnel services) is a related party subject to the related party disclosures. In addition, an entity that uses a management entity is required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services. Annual improvements 2011-2013 cycle: These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group. They include: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13 can be applied not only to financial assets and financial liabilities, but also to other contracts within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable). IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and provides a model framework to recognise revenue, which is the five step model framework that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue. The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a full or modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Group given that the Group has not used a revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets. Annual improvements 2012-2014 cycle: These improvements are effective from 1 January 2016 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group. They include: IFRS 7 Servicing contracts: This amendment clarifies that a servicing contract that includes a fee can constitute continuing involvement in a financial asset. An entity must assess the nature of the fee and arrangement against the guidance for continuing involvement to assess whether the disclosures are required. The assessment of continuing involvement is applied retrospectively but disclosures are required prospectively. IFRS 7 Applicability of the offsetting disclosures to condensed interim financial statements: The amendment, which is applied retrospectively, clarifies that, unless there is a significant update from the most recent annual report, the disclosures required by IFRS 7 in respect of offsetting financial assets and liabilities are not required in the condensed interim financial report. IAS 19 Discount rate: regional market issue: The amendment clarifies that in determining the discount rate for determining the present value of defined benefit obligations, market depth of high quality corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which the obligation is denominated, rather than the country where the obligation is located. When there is no deep market for high quality corporate bonds in that currency, government bond rates must be used. This amendment is applied prospectively. 170 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements IAS 34 Disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial report’: The amendment, which is applied retrospectively, states that the required interim disclosures must either be in the interim financial statements or incorporated by cross-reference between the interim financial statements and wherever they are included within the greater interim financial report (e.g., in the management commentary or risk report). The Board specified that the other information within the interim financial report must be available to users on the same terms as the interim financial statements and at the same time. If users do not have access to the other information in this manner, then the interim financial report is incomplete. The IASB have issued other amendments to standards, including those resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective. (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Judgements Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are: –– Determination of functional currencies note 2(d): The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. –– Evaluation of projects status note 2(e): The evaluation of project status impacts the accounting for costs incurred and requires management judgement. This includes the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals to justify the commencement of capitalisation of costs; the timing of the end of the exploration phase and the start of the development phase and the commencement of the production phase. These judgements directly impact the treatment of costs incurred and proceeds from the sale of metals from ore produced. –– Stripping costs note 2(e): The Group incurs waste removal costs (stripping costs) during the development and production phases of its surface mining operations. During the production phase, stripping costs (production stripping costs) can be incurred both in relation to the production of inventory in that period and the creation of improved access and mining flexibility in relation to ore to be mined in the future. The former are included as part of the costs of inventory, while the latter are capitalised as a stripping activity asset, where certain criteria are met. Significant judgement is required to distinguish between development stripping and production stripping and to distinguish between the production stripping that relates to the extraction of inventory and what relates to the creation of a stripping activity asset. Once the Group has identified its production stripping for each surface mining operation, it identifies the separate components of the ore bodies for each of its mining operations. An identifiable component is a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. Significant judgement is required to identify and define these components, and also to determine the expected tonnes of waste to be stripped and ore to be mined in each of these components. These assessments are undertaken for each individual mining operation based on the information available in the mine plan. The mine plans and, therefore, the identification of components, will vary between mines for a number of reasons. These include, but are not limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location and/or financial considerations. Judgement is also required to identify a suitable production measure to be used to allocate production stripping costs between inventory and any stripping activity asset(s) for each component. The Group considers that the ratio of the expected tonnes of waste to be stripped for an expected tonnes of ore to be mined for a specific component of the ore body, is the most suitable production measure. Furthermore, judgements and estimates are also used to apply the units of production method in determining the depreciable lives of the stripping activity asset(s). –– Qualifying assets: All interest-bearing loans are held by the parent Company and were not obtained for any specific asset’s acquisition, construction, or production. Due to this financing structure, judgement is required in determining whether those borrowings are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset in subsidiaries. Funds from these loans are transferred to subsidiaries to meet the strategic objectives of the Group or are otherwise held centrally. Therefore, management determines whether borrowings are directly attributable to an asset or group of assets based on whether the investment in an operating or development stage project is classified as contributing to achieving the strategic growth of the Group. –– Contingencies (note 29): By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 171 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Estimates and assumptions Significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include: –– Estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources, note 2(e): Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s mining properties. The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates, in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code 2012. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such as estimates of commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and production costs, along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body. As the economic assumptions used may change and as additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine, estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources may change. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported balance sheet and income statement including: –– the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows, those cash flows consider both ore reserves and mineral resources; –– depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using the units of production method, or where the useful life of the related assets change; units of production method considers ore reserves; –– capitalised stripping costs recognised in the income statement as either part of mine properties or as part of inventory or charged to profit or loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios; determination of stripping ratios is based on ore reserves; –– provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve estimates affect expectations about when such activities will occur and the associated cost of these activities; –– the recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes in the judgements regarding the existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets. –– Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes, notes 2(e) and 14: Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the unit-of-production method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine specific assets. This results in a depreciation/amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the estimated remaining life of mine production. Each item’s life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is used. –– Silverstream, note 16: The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires significant estimation by management. The derivative has a term of over 20 years and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the Sabinas mine, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. For further detail on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see note 33. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions, foreign exchange, inflation and the discount rate is included in note 34. –– Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges, note 2(f): The assessment of asset carrying values requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. Changes in these assumptions will affect the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment. –– Estimation of the mine closure costs, notes 2(l) and 24: Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine closure cost as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine life and changes in discount rates. Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the balance sheet date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required. –– Income tax, notes 2(r) and 12: Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. 172 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (d) Foreign currency translation The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the parent Company’s functional currency. The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined. For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars, as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement. (e) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. The cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual re-assessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset when not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated. The expected useful lives are as follows: Years Buildings 6 Plant and equipment 4 Mining properties and development costs 16 Other assets 3 An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised. Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale. Disposal of assets Gains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. Mining properties and development costs Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred. Purchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination. Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 173 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Mine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained, pre-operative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost. The initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. Revenues from metals recovered from ore mined in the mine development phase, prior to commercial production, are credited to mining properties and development costs. Upon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit of production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate. Mining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any. Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. The cost of construction in progress is not depreciated. Subsequent expenditures All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced, is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred. Stripping costs In a surface mine operation, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies (stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost of development and construction of the mine (the stripping activity asset) and charged as depreciation or depletion to cost of sales, in the income statement, based on the mine’s units of production once commercial operations begin. Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. This activity is referred to as production stripping and commences at the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the surface mine. The removal of waste may occur following initial extraction of saleable material and during the production phase. This stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria is met: –– It is probable that the future economic benefits (improved access to an ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group –– The Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved –– The costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably Stripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as mining properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as ‘component stripping ratio’, which is revised annually in accordance with the mine plan. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset, by using the units of production method. The identification of components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated annually. Depreciation is recognised as cost of sales in the income statement. The capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletion/depreciation, less impairment in value, if any. Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from the cost of the stripping activity asset. If not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they are incurred. In identifying components of the ore body, the Group works closely with the mining operations personnel for each mining operation to analyse each of the mine plans. Generally, a component will be a subset of the total ore body and a mine may have several components that are identified based on the mine plan. The mine plans and therefore the identification of components can vary between mines for a number of reasons including but not limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location and/or financial considerations. 174 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (f) Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level. If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount of an asset The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to disposal. Fair value is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group’s cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Reversal of impairment An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement. (g) Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; held to maturity investments; available-for-sale financial assets; or loans and receivables or derivatives designated as hedging instruments, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value, presented as finance costs or finance income in the income statement. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains or losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost. Loans and receivables from contractors are carried at amortised cost. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 175 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Loans and borrowings After initial recognition at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss, in the income statement, when the liabilities are de-recognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. The Group shall adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense. This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. For more information refer note 23. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held to maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is de-recognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. (h) Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are de-recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. 176 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Available-for-sale financial assets If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged, by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. (i) Inventories Finished goods and work in progress inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs. For this purpose, the costs of production include: –– personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore; –– the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and –– related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). Operating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. (j) Short-term investments Where the Group invests in short-term instruments which are either not readily convertible into known amounts of cash or are subject to risk of changes in value that are not insignificant, these instruments are classified as short-term investments. Short-term investments are classified as loans and receivables. (k) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and four months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. (l) Provisions Mine closure cost A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 177 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued (m) Employee benefits The Group operates the following plans: Defined benefit pension plan This funded plan is based on each employee’s earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial firm as at each year end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on mxAAA (Standard & Poors) and AAA-mex (Fitch Ibca) credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss. Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the benefits have already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately. The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. Net interest cost is recognised in finance cost and return on plan assets (other than amounts reflected in net interest cost) is recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss. Defined contribution pension plan A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee’s salary. This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme. Seniority premium for voluntary separation This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary. The cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial firm as at each year end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur. Other Benefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies. Termination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred. (n) Employee profit sharing In accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing (‘PTU’) equivalent to 10% of the taxable income of each fiscal year. PTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, paid in each fiscal year, is considered deductible for income tax purposes. 178 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (o) Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A re-assessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: –– There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement –– A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term –– There is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset –– There is a substantial change to the asset Group as a lessee Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in the income statement. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Group as a lessor Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. Where a re-assessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the re‑assessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b) above. For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2007, in accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRIC 4. (p) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates and other sales taxes. Sale of goods Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. The Group recognises revenue on a provisional basis at the time concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are delivered to the customer’s smelter or refinery, using the Group’s best estimate of contained metal. Revenue is subject to adjustment once the analysis of the product samples is completed, contract conditions have been fulfilled and final settlement terms are agreed. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined. In addition, sales of concentrates and precipitates throughout each calendar month, as well as doré bars that are delivered after the 20th day of each month, are ‘provisionally priced’ subject to a final adjustment based on the average price for the month following the delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Doré bars that are delivered in the first 20 days of each month are finally priced in the month of delivery. For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing, revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met using the provisional price. The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotation period ends. The selling price of the metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges. The revaluing of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue. The customer deducts treatment and refining charges before settlement. Therefore, the fair value of consideration received for the sale of goods is net of those charges. The Group recognises a levy in respect of the Extraordinary Mining Right on a progressive basis as sales of gold and silver are recognised during the fiscal year and deduct from the corresponding sales. The Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles. The payment must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions. The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax. Extraordinary Mining Right is recorded in selling expenses. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 179 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Other income Other income is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. (q) Exploration expenses Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions: –– Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life –– Exploration expenses: –– Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves –– Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identified by project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project (r) Taxation Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates. Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: –– where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and –– in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except: –– where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and –– in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are re-assessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Mining Rights The Special Mining Right is considered an income tax recognised in the income statement of the year. The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right (note 12). 180 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Sales tax Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except: –– when the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable; and –– when receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included. The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. (s) Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions. The Group also entered in a one-off hedging programme to protect the value of Penmont’s acquisition as described in note 4(b), using a collar structure to allow partial exposure to gold prices limited up to the attributable reserves acquired from Newmont. The measures implemented on production at the acquired Penmont assets do not constitute a change in the Group’s hedging policy on commodity risk. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The full fair value of a derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black-Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using the Black-Scholes model. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an on-going basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: Cash flow hedges For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income statement of the related period. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement. When hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. Changes in fair value of time value is recognised in the income statement in finance costs. Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with re-assessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 181 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued (t) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 12 or more months to get ready for its intended use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. (u) Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 33 and 34. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: –– in the principal market for the asset or liability; or –– in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 33. (v) Dividend distribution Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s shareholders or Board as appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s subsidiaries. 182 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements 3. Segment reporting For management purposes the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines. At 31 December 2014 the Group has six reportable operating segments represented by six producing mines as follows: –– The Fresnillo mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, the world’s largest primary silver mine –– The Saucito mine, located in the State of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine –– The Ciénega mine, located in the State of Durango, an underground gold mine; including the San Ramón satellite mine –– The Herradura mine, located in the State of Sonora, a surface gold mine –– The Soledad-Dipolos mine, located in the State of Sonora, a surface gold mine –– The Noche Buena mine, located in State of Sonora, a surface gold mine The operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group’s chief operating decision maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information. The exploration services provided by the exploration companies listed in note 4 and projects under development have been aggregated into the Other segment below. Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in Revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within Cost of Sales and Gross Profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to Gross Profit as per the consolidated income statement. Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arm’s length basis similar to transactions with third parties. In 2014 and 2013 substantially all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico.

The total amount capitalised including interest earned as at the day of the transaction amounted US$41,633 thousands. See note 30(a). On 6 October 2014, the Group acquired the remaining 44% of the issued shares of Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V., Desarrollos Mineros Fresne, S. de R.L. de C.V., Proveedora de Equipos Fresne, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Minera Bermejal, S. de R.L. de C.V.

Total mining concessions right paid during the year were US$16 million and have been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales and exploration expenses.

tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to the same fiscal authority. On the basis of management’s internal forecast, a deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to US$169.1 million (2013: US$159.2 million). The Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$4.5 million (2013: US$5.6 million) on which no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits. (d) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,528 million (2013: US$1,271 million). 194 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (e) Corporate Income Tax (‘Impuesto Sobre la Renta’ or ‘ISR’), Special Mining Right (‘SMR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica’ or ‘IETU’) The Group’s principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes. In December 2013, a new Tax Reform was enacted, effective as from 1 January 2014. As a result of such Tax Reform, a new Income Tax Law (ISR) was enacted and the IETU Law was abolished. The new ISR includes: –– new criteria and limits for certain tax deductions, that among others are: payroll-related expenses, including contributions to pension funds that are considered exempt income for employees will be considered non-deductible. –– certain payments to related parties, that do not comply with specific legal requirements would be considered as non-deductible. –– the requirement to calculate the mandatory profit sharing (PTU) that is paid to Mexican employees on the same base as the income tax, before deduction for profit sharing and before the use of net operating losses. Differences between the profit sharing and income tax base historically relate to inflation accounting, which is not included in profit sharing, the recognition of exchange gains and losses, and the recognition of income for dividends. –– a dividend withholding tax of 10% tax on distributions of dividends paid to Mexican individuals as well as foreign residents. Dividends between Mexican resident entities are not subject to tax at the shareholder level. The corporate income tax rate for 2013 and future years, under the new ISR, remains at 30%. Previously enacted reductions of the tax rate over the next two years to 28% were repealed. As at 31 Deferred 2013 tax assets and liabilities were remeasured to reflect these changes, the remeasurement increased income tax expense by US$14.5 million. As part of the Tax Reform, the Federal Rights Law was amended on certain mining matters with the SMR added as from 1 January 2014. The SMR is considered as income tax under IFRS, and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities. The SMR allows as a credit the payment of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable. The 7.5% tax applies to a base of income before interest, annual inflation adjustment, taxes paid on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR. This SMR can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year. IETU was an alternative minimum corporate income tax, effective from 1 January 2008 through 31 December 2013. Companies were required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU which was calculated at the rate of 17.5% and applied to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions were allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income. 13.

Borrowing costs were capitalised at the rate of 5.78%. Sensitivity analysis As at 31 December 2014, the carrying amount of mining assets was fully supported by the value in use computation of their recoverable amount using price assumptions of US$1,250 per ounce and US$18 per ounce for gold and silver, respectively. Management consider that the model supporting the determination of value in use is most sensitive to commodity price assumptions and have therefore performed a sensitivity analysis for those CGUs, where a reasonable possible change in prices could lead to an impairment. As at 31 December 2014, the carrying amount of Ciénega mine is US$240.5 million. In regard to Noche Buena mine the carrying amount is US$141 million. The following table sets out the approximate expected impairment which would be recognised in 2015 at hypothetical decreases in commodity prices: Decrease in commodity prices Ciénega Noche Buena Gold Silver US$ thousands US$ thousands Low sensitivity 5% 10% 18,033 – High sensitivity 10% 20% 127,124 37,986 15.

This decrease has been consistent during the past 12-month period, which is considered to be prolonged; therefore, an impairment of US$982 thousands was recognised as other expenses in the income statement. At December 2013, the published quoted price of Orex Minerals’ share decreased below the cost paid by the Group, therefore an impairment of US$2.1 million was recognised as other expenses in the income statement. At 31 December 2014, based on the published quoted price a reversal of impairment of US$192 thousands was recognised in other comprehensive income of the year. The fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 197 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 16. Silverstream contract On 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Peñoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Peñoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine (‘Sabinas’), a base metals mine owned and operated by the Peñoles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of US$2.00 in years one to five and US$5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment commencing on 31 December 2013) is payable to Peñoles. The cash payment per ounce for the year ended 31 December 2014 was US$5.05 per ounce (2013: US$5 per ounce). Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Peñoles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Peñoles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall. The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate. Changes in the contract’s fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2014 total proceeds received in cash were US$58.7 million (2013: US$63.8 million) of which, US$8.1 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2013 (2013: US$11.0 million). Cash received in respect of the year of US$50.6 million (2013: US$52.8 million) corresponds to 4.1 million ounces of payable silver (2013: 3.5 million ounces). As at 31 December 2014, a further US$6.9 million (2013: US$8.1 million) of cash corresponding to 638,681 ounces of silver is due (2013: 560,465 ounces). The most significant drivers of the US$77.1 million unrealised gain taken to income statement (2013: US$54.0 million loss) were the updating of assumptions used to value the Silverstream contract. The most significant of these were an increase of the Sabinas mine silver reserves, the decrease of the reference discount rate (LIBOR) and the difference between the payments already received in 2014 and payments estimated in the valuation model as of 31 December 2013. These were partially offset by a decrease in the forward price of silver which was lower than the previous year.

During 2013, share premium increased by US$335.2 million as a result of the issue of new Ordinary Shares on 3 May 2013. During 2014 there have been no changes. Capital reserve The capital reserve arose as a consequence of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation as a result of using the pooling of interest method. Net unrealised gains/(losses) on revaluation of cash flow hedges This reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge, net of tax. When the hedged transaction occurs, the gain or the loss is transferred out of equity to the income statement or the value of other assets. Unrealised gains/(losses) on available-for-sale financial assets This reserve records fair value changes on available-for-sale investments, net of tax. On disposal or on impairment, the cumulative changes in fair value are recycled to the income statement. Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of entities with a functional currency different to that of the presentational currency of the Group. Retained earnings/accumulated losses This reserve records the accumulated results of the Group, less any distributions and dividends paid. 22.

Fair value of senior notes is categorised as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, note 33(b). 24. Provision for mine closure cost The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits. The discount rate used in the calculation of the provision as at 31 December 2014 is in a range of 3.22% to 7.51% (2013: 7%). Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning, dismantling, and reclamation alternatives and timing, the levels of discount foreign exchange and inflation rates. Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group’s intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the life of the mines. The provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine, based on the reserves and resources, which ranges from three to 19 years from 31 December 2014 (three to 30 years from 31 December 2013).

Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans The Group has a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan. The defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each worker’s earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired through 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers. Pensions benefits accrued as at 1 July 2007, are restated based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) until the retirement date of each worker. The overall investment policy and strategy for the Group’s defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan. However, the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded. The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations. The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan, including potential short-term liquidity requirements. The defined benefit contribution plan was established as from1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each non-unionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers’ contributions, capped at 8% of the employee’s annual salary. Death and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies. 202 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements The following tables provide information relating to changes in the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets: Pension cost charge to income statement Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI Return on plan assets Actuarial Actuarial Defined (excluding changes changes benefit amounts arising from arising from increase Balance at Past Sub-total included changes in changes in Sub-total due to Balance at 1 January service Service Net Foreign recognised Benefits in net demographic financial Experience Foreign included Contributions personnel 31 December 2014 cost cost Interest exchange in the year paid interest) assumptions assumptions adjustments exchange in OCI by employer transfer 2014 US$ thousands Defined benefit obligation (34,001) (1,028) (886) (2,121) 3,935 (100) 1,643 – (324) – (898) – (1,222) – 16 (33,664) Fair value on plan assets 22,526 – – 1,381 (2,493) (1,112) (1,643) (629) – – – – (629) 645 (16) 19,826 Net benefit liability (11,475) (1,028) (886) (740) 1,442 (1,212) – (629) (324) – (898) – (1,851) 645 – (13,838) Pension cost charge to income statement Remeasurement gains/(losses) in OCI Return on plan assets Actuarial (excluding changes Actuarial Defined amounts arising from changes arising benefit Balance at Past Sub-total included changes in from changes in Sub-total increase due Balance at 1 January service Service Net Foreign recognised Benefits in net demographic financial Experience Foreign included Contributions to personnel 31 December 2013 cost cost Interest exchange in the year paid interest) assumptions assumptions adjustments exchange in OCI by employer transfer 2013 US$ thousands Defined benefit obligation (31,500) – (951) (2,152) 276 (2,827) 1,113 – (467) – (320) – (787) – – (34,001) Fair value on plan assets 20,777 – – 1,439 (196) 1,243 (1,113) (968) – – – 30 (938) 2,557 – 22,526 Net benefit liability (10,723) – (951) (713) 80 (1,584) – (968) (467) – (320) 30 (1,725) 2,557 – (11,475) Of the total defined benefit obligation, US$8.9 million (2013: US$8.2 million) relates to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers which are not funded.

These leases have renewal terms at the option of the lessee at lease payments based on market prices at the time of renewal. There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases. The Group has put in place several arrangements to finance mine equipment through loans and the sale of mine equipment to contractors. In both cases, contractors are obligated to use these assets in rendering services to the Group as part of the mining work contract, during the term of financing or credit, which ranges from two to six years. The Group considers that the related mining work contracts contain embedded operating leases.

Contingencies As of 31 December 2014, the Group has the following contingencies: –– The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties –– T ax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods –– In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable –– O n 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate –– P eñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ o ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax –– O n 30 November 2012, the Mexican Government enacted a new federal labour law. During 2014 management implemented certain actions as a part of an on-going process in order to manage the exposure resulting from the issuance of the new labour law including any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group, however management does not expect any potential contingency or significant effect on the Group’s financial statements as at 31 December 2014 and going forward www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 205 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued –– In regard to the Ejido El Bajío matter previously reported by the Company: In 2009 five members of the El Bajío agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim to the Unitarian Agrarian Court (‘Tribunal Unitario Agrario’) of Hermosillo Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of Soledad-Dipolos is located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares of land. The disputed land was returned in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. The Magistrate noted that remediation activities are necessary to comply with relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) in this respect. The Agrarian Magistrate further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining, amongst other aspects, that Penmont must remediate the lands to the same state that they were before Penmont’s occupation. In the opinion of the Company, the procedural order is excessive since such level of remediation was not considered as part of the original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appears not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits. Penmont has challenged the procedural order before Federal courts and is awaiting resolution of this filing. Penmont conducted mining activities on approximately 300 hectares of such lands and the remediation activities in this respect are still pending. In connection with the foregoing matters, members of the El Bajío agrarian community presented additional claims, including a separate legal suit before the Unitarian Agrarian Court, claiming US$65 million for damages, alleging that the Group improperly used the land affected by the court ruling, as well as requesting the cancellation of Penmont’s mining concessions and environmental permits within the El Bajío lands. Such concessions and permits are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land. The claimants have not yet presented substantial evidence to support their claim and the Group believes that these claims are without merit. Any initial ruling in this case would be subject to the appeals process in Mexico before judicial authorities other than the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora. Given the lack of evidence in support of the damages claim, the Company believes that an adverse and definitive ruling is not probable. In addition, claimants have also presented other claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described above. Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in this matter including appeals that are pending as well as criminal complaints. There is significant uncertainty relating to the finalisation and ultimate result relating to these legal proceedings. 30.

The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values: Option and forward foreign exchange contracts The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black-Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency. Option commodity contracts The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts are valued using the Black-Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity. Silverstream contract The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model (for further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 16). This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. 212 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peñoles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by Peñoles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years. Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above, and determines their impact on the total fair value. The significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. The fair value of the Silverstream is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future exchange rates, however, it is to a reasonable change in future silver price, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate is disclosed in note 34. Quoted investments Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Interest-bearing loans Fair value of the Group’s interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Loans with related parties Fair value of the Group’s loan from related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates at each reporting date. Embedded derivatives within sales contracts Sales of concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are ‘provisionally priced’ and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Group’s best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2 (q)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation. At 31 December 2014 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was US$(2.9) million (2013: US$(1.2) million). The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenues. (c) Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos and other currencies. The Group also enters into option contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price risk as described in note 2(s). Foreign exchange hedging The Group entered into a number of forward derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Financial risk management Overview The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets, interest-bearing loans and trade payables. The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: –– Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks –– Credit risk –– Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. (a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Foreign currency risk The Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso, euro and Swedish krona which are exposed to foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, dividends, fixed assets, spare parts and other items. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso. In order to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts with maturity dates from 2014 (see note 30 for additional detail). The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of available-for-sale assets to a reasonably possible change in market price of these equity instruments, reflecting the effect on the Group’s profit before tax and equity: Effect on profit before tax: Effect on equity: Increase/ increase/ increase/ (decrease) (decrease) (decrease) Year ended 31 December in equity price US$ thousands US$ thousands 2014 60% – 51,157 (40%) (16,983) (17,632) 2013 70% – 45,368 (40%) (69,773) (962) (b) Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Group’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets and derivative financial instruments. The financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, the Silverstream contract and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Group’s financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 30, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due, other than ‘Other receivables’ as disclosed in note 17. The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. The Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Peñoles, the Group’s primary customer throughout 2014 and 2013. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Peñoles Group which currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating. The Group’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments, investing in a number of financial institutions. Accordingly on an on-going basis the Group deposits surplus funds with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits surplus funds with financial institutions with a credit rating of MX-1 (Moody´s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor’s) and above. As at 31 December 2014 the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 66% of surplus funds was deposited with one financial institution and 94% was held in short-term Mexican Government paper. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 15 for the maximum credit exposure to available-for-sale financial assets, note 19 for short-term investments, note 20 for cash and cash equivalents and note 30 for related party balances with Met-Mex. The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2014, being US$392.2 million (2013: US$339.8 million). 218 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows from operations and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Capital management The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing loans, including loans from related parties, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders’ capital invested in the Group, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 219 Parent Company Statement of Comprehensive Income Year ended 31 December Year ended 31 December 2014 2013 Notes US$

www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 223 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1. Corporate information Fresnillo plc (‘the Company’) is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 6. The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes with tax residency in Mexico City. For further information see note 5. Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V. (‘Peñoles’) currently owns 75% of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baillères family, whose beneficial interest is held through Peñoles. The country of incorporation of Peñoles is Mexico. Copies of Peñoles’ accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for the Fresnillo Group of companies. On 1 January 2014, as a part of an internal reorganisation to mitigate risk exposure, the operating entities without being extinguished transferred part of their assets, liabilities and capital through a spin-off into eight new entities. As a result of the spin-off the Company continues to retain control over the new entities, see note 6. The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 3 March 2015. 2. Significant accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which considers the realisation of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at 31 December 2014, the Company is in a net current liability position due to an increase in the intercompany loan. The Company’s Directors confirm that Fresnillo plc’s subsidiaries have funds and distributable earnings available for distribution sufficient to repay the intercompany loan and to fund other forecast liabilities of the Company to be incurred in the next 12 months. Further, given that the loan counterparty is a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that it will not request a repayment of the loan until such time as the Company has sufficient cash balances to make the repayment. As such the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements of the Company is deemed appropriate. The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$ thousand) except when otherwise indicated. The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated. (b) Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective as of 1 January 2014. New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Company IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: The standard replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including special purpose entities. The changes introduced by IFRS 10 require management to exercise significant judgement to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated, being those investees in which the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Company adopted this standard as at 1 January 2014, as adopted by the European Union. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the financial position and performance of the Company. IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (as revised in 2012): As a consequence of the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12, what remains of IAS 27 does not change the recognition and presentation requirements as it relates to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities, and associates in separate financial statements (cost method or fair value) and as a result the adoption of this revised standard is not expected to impact the parent Company financial statements. The Company adopted this standard as at 1 January 2014, as adopted by the European Union. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the financial position and performance of the Company. Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32: These amendments clarify the meaning of ’currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off’ and the criteria for non-simultaneous settlement mechanisms of clearing houses to qualify for offsetting and it is applied retrospectively. These amendments have no impact on the Company, since it does not have any offsetting arrangements. 224 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Disclosure for Impairment for Non-financial Assets – Amendments to IAS 36: This amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. In addition the IASB added two disclosure requirements: –– Additional information about the fair value measurement of impaired assets when the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal –– Information about the discount rates that have been used when the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal using a present value technique. The amendments harmonise disclosure requirements between value in use and fair value less costs of disposal Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting – Amendments to IAS 39: These amendments provide relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a derivative designated as a hedging instrument meets certain criteria and retrospective application is required. These amendments have no impact on the Company as the Company has not novated its derivatives during the current or prior periods. Annual improvements 2010-2012 cycle: In the 2010-2012 annual improvements cycle, the IASB issued seven amendments to six standards, which included an amendment to IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. The amendment to IFRS 13 is effective immediately and, thus, for periods beginning at 1 January 2014, and it clarifies in the Basis for Conclusions that short-term receivables and payables with no stated interest rates can be measured at invoice amounts when the effect of discounting is immaterial. This amendment to IFRS 13 has no impact on the Company. Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Company’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt these standards that it considers will be applicable, when they become effective. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and provides a model framework to recognise revenue, which is the five step model framework that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue. The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a full or modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. Early application of previous versions of IFRS 9 (2009, 2010 and 2013) is permitted if the date of initial application is before 1 February 2015. The Company is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 9 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date. Annual improvements 2010-2012 cycle: These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. They include: IFRS 3 Business Combinations: The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that all contingent consideration arrangements classified as liabilities (or assets) arising from a business combination should be subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable). IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies that a management entity (an entity that provides key management personnel services) is a related party subject to the related party disclosures. In addition, an entity that uses a management entity is required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services. Annual improvements 2011-2013 cycle: These improvements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. They include: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13 can be applied not only to financial assets and financial liabilities, but also to other contracts within the scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable). Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements: The amendments will allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements. Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change to the equity method in its separate financial statements will have to apply that change retrospectively. For first-time adopters of IFRS electing to use the equity method in its separate financial statements, they will be required to apply this method form the date of transition to IFRS. These amendments will not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements. The IASB has issued other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company. The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 225 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is in the accounting policies and the notes to the financial statements. Judgements Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: –– Determination of functional currency note 2(d): The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. –– Contingencies (note 14): By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. Estimates and assumptions Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial information statements include: –– Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets notes 2(g) and 7: The Company classifies certain financial asset as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity. When the fair value declines, management makes assumptions about the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss. At 31 December 2014 impairment loss of US$0.9 million has been recognised relating to available-for-sale assets (2013: US$2.1 million). –– Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries notes 2(e) and 6: The Company assesses the investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and the value in use. A value in use assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. Fair value less costs of disposal is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2014, impairment losses of US$130,169 have been recognised relating to subsidiaries (2013: US$628.0 million). (d) Foreign currency translation The Company’s financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined. (e) Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies and is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. When the Company incurs increases in or return of share capital, to/from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition or return of capital to the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. Fair value less costs of disposal is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. When this information is not available the fair value is determined based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount. 226 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. (f) Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. Financial assets are offset with liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value transactions through profit and loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments, as defined by IAS 39. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale. After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, net of directly attributable transaction costs, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss, in the income statement, when the liabilities are de-recognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. The Company shall adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as income or expense. This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans. For more information refer note 12. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments. Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve until the financial asset is de-recognised. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense. De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 227 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. (g) Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. Available-for-sale financial assets If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Company considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. (h) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and four months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. (i) Share capital Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue. (j) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates and other sales taxes. Trademark royalties Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received. Interest income Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established. 228 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (k) Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: –– where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and –– in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: –– where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and –– in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are re-assessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. (l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodity prices which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. In the Group’s consolidated financial statements these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges. Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black-Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract, with re-assessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 229 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued (m) Fair value measurement The Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 18 and 19. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: –– in the principal market for the asset or liability; or –– in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 18. (n) Dividend distribution Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 3. Profit or loss attributable to the parent Company The profit for the Company is US$139.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: loss of US$(292.2) million). In accordance with the exemption granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement for the Company has not been presented. 4.

The amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities before offset as at 31 December considering the nature of the temporary differences are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2014 2013 US$ thousands US$ thousands Prepayments and other 697 (3,591) Derivative financial instruments 5,258 (357) Losses carried forward (14,240) – Available-for-sale financial assets 5,147 1,703 Net deferred tax balances 3,138 (2,245) (c) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries The Company has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,528 million (2013: US$1,271 million). (d) Corporate Income Tax (‘Impuesto Sobre la Renta’ or ‘ISR’) and Business Flat Tax (‘Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Única’ or ‘IETU’) The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes. In December 2013 a new Tax Reform was enacted, effective as from 1 January 2014. As a result of such Tax Reform, a new Income Tax Law (ISR) was enacted and the IETU Law was abolished. Among others, the new ISR includes: –– certain payments to related parties, that do not comply with specific legal requirements would be considered as non-deductible; and –– a dividend withholding tax of 10% tax on distributions of dividends paid to Mexican individuals as well as foreign residents. Dividends between Mexican resident entities are not subject to tax at the shareholder level. The corporate income tax rate for 2013 and future years, under the new ISR, remains at 30%. Previously enacted reductions of the tax rate over the next two years to 28% were repealed. IETU was an alternative minimum corporate income tax, effective from 1 January 2008 through 31 December 2013. Companies were required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU which was calculated at the rate of 17.5% and applied to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions were allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 231 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 6.

During 2014 and 2013, due to the gold and silver prices decreased, the Company made an impairment assessment to determine whether the carrying value of each of its subsidiaries was impaired as at 31 December 2014 and 2013. As a result an impairment loss of US$130.2 million was recognised with respect to certain of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries (2013: US$604.6 million). The recoverable amount was estimated based on the FVLCD (2013: Minera Mexicana la Ciénega, S.A. de C.V. based on value in use; Exploraciones Mineras Parreña, S.A. de C.V. based on FVLCD). The following table provides relevant information in respect of each impaired subsidiary: Year ended 31 December 2014 Recoverable Impairment amount US$ thousands US$ thousands Discount rate Minera Mexicana la Ciénega, S.A. de C.V. 9,277 414,252 Post-tax 4.04% Minera Saucito, S.A. de C.V. 37,406 1,182,239 Post-tax 4.16% Exploraciones Mineras Parreña, S.A. de C.V. 83,372 138,936 Post-tax 4.63% Year ended 31 December 2013 Recoverable Impairment amount US$ thousands US$ thousands Discount rate Minera Mexicana la Ciénega, S.A. de C.V. 461,500 423,633 Pre-tax 4.74% Exploraciones Mineras Parreña, S.A. de C.V. 143,127 222,324 Post-tax 4.94% In determining FVLCD it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash flows including volumes, price assumptions and cost estimates. Accordingly, the fair value is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Management considers that the model supporting the determination of FVLCD is most sensitive to commodity price assumptions. The price assumptions used to determine FVLCD are based on analysts’ consensus of long-term prices. As at 31 December 2014, the Company used price assumptions of US$1,250 per ounce and US$18 per ounce for gold and silver, respectively. Exploraciones Minera Parreña, S.A. de C.V. (Parreña) provides exploration services to the mining entities and management determined FVLCD based on the future cash flow derived from such services, which are derived from estimated costs. Accordingly, the fair value is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Management considers that the model supporting the determination of FVLCD is most sensitive to the estimate of exploration expenses. Sensitivity analysis Management has performed a sensitivity analysis for those subsidiaries where an impairment was determined.

This decrease has been consistent during the past 12-month period, which is considered to be prolonged; therefore, an impairment of US$0.1 million was recognised as other expenses in the income statement. At December 2013 the published quoted price of Orex Minerals’ share decreased below the cost paid by the Company therefore an impairment of US$2.1 million was recognised as other expenses in the income statement. At 31 December 2014, based on the published quoted price, a reversal of impairment of US$0.2 thousands was recognised in other comprehensive income of the year. The fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market. 8.

The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company is 736,893,589. As at 31 December 2014, all issued shares with a par value of $0.50 each are fully paid. The rights and obligations attaching to these shares are governed by law and the Company’s Articles of Association. Ordinary Shareholders are entitled to receive notice and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transfer of the Ordinary Shares. The Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares only entitle the shareholder on winding up or on a return of capital to payment of the amount paid up after repayment to Ordinary Share holders. The Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares do not entitle the holder to payment of any dividend, or to receive notice or to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. The Company may also at its option redeem the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares at a price of £1.00 or, as custodian, purchase or cancel the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares or require the holder to transfer the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares. Except at the option of the Company the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares are not transferable. Reserves Share premium This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value. During 2013, share premium increased by US$335.4 million as a result of the issue of new Ordinary Shares on 3 May 2013. During 2014 there have been no changes. Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the difference between the value of the net assets acquired as part of the Pre-IPO reorganisation and the nominal value of the shares issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Movements in this reserve during 2014 and 2013 represent the impairment of the carrying value of Fresnillo’s investments in subsidiaries transferred from retained earnings. Unrealised gains/(losses) on available-for-sale financial assets This reserve records fair value changes on available-for-sale investments, net of tax. On disposal or on impairment, the cumulative changes in fair value are recycled to the income statement. Retained earnings This reserve records the accumulated results of the Company, less any distributions and dividends paid. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 235 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 11.

Contingencies As of 31 December 2014 the Company has the following contingencies: –– The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. –– Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of the corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Company has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. –– On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group (‘the Group’) and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate. –– Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or Admission and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ tax consolidation pays an intra-group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or ‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an amount in respect of that tax. –– In regard to the Ejido El Bajío matter previously reported by the Company: In 2009 five members of the El Bajío agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim to the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of Soledad-Dipolos is located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares of land. The disputed land was returned in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. The Magistrate noted that remediation activities are necessary to comply with relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) in this respect. The Agrarian Magistrate further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining, amongst other aspects, that Penmont must remediate the lands to the same state that they were before Penmont’s occupation. In the opinion of the Company, the procedural order is excessive since such level of remediation was not considered as part of the original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appears not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits. Penmont has challenged the procedural order before Federal courts and is awaiting resolution of this filing. Penmont conducted mining activities on approximately 300 hectares of such lands and the remediation activities in this respect are still pending. In connection with the foregoing matters, members of the El Bajío agrarian community presented additional claims, including a separate legal suit before the Unitarian Agrarian Court, claiming US$65 million for damages, alleging that the Group improperly used the land affected by the court ruling, as well as requesting the cancellation of Penmont’s mining concessions and environmental permits within the El Bajío lands. Such concessions and permits are held by way of separate title to that relating to the surface land. The claimants have not yet presented substantial evidence to support their claim and the Group believes that these claims are without merit. Any initial ruling in this case would be subject to the appeals process in Mexico before judicial authorities other than the Unitarian Agrarian Court of Hermosillo, Sonora. Given the lack of evidence in support of the damages claim, the Company believes that an adverse and definitive ruling is not probable. In addition, claimants have also presented other claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described above. Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in this matter including appeals that are pending as well as criminal complaints. There is significant uncertainty relating to the finalisation and ultimate result relating to these legal proceedings. www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 237 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 15.

The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values: Options and forwards to hedge foreign exchange contracts The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black-Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency. Option commodity contracts The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts are valued using the Black-Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity. Quoted investments Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Interest-bearing loans Fair value of the Company’s interest-bearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Loans with related parties Fair value of the Company’s loan to related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates at each reporting date. 242 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (c) Derivative financial instruments The Company enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its subsidiaries’ exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from the activities of these subsidiaries.

Financial Risk Management Overview The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets, loans to and from related parties, interest-bearing loans and trade payables. The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries. The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: –– Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks –– Credit risk –– Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework. The Company’s risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. 244 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements (a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Foreign currency risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, dividends and other items. As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles. The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge against precious metals commodity price, mainly gold production, see note 18(c). The table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity relating to changes in the fair value of commodity hedging of financial assets and liabilities, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant.

Increase/ Effect on profit before tax: (decrease) in increase/(decrease) Year ended 31 December gold price US$ thousands 2014 10% (109,994) (10%) 66,523 Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments. The Company’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value, therefore, are excluded from the table below. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date.

The financial assets are trade and other receivables, intercompany loans, cash and cash equivalents and available-forsale financial assets. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties with what the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 15, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Company’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency and commodity hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings. The Company’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of M-1 (Moody´s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor’s) and above, and only for periods of less than four months. The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 7 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 9 for cash and cash equivalents and note 15 for related party balances. (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Capital management The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders’ capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows. 248 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Reserves and Resources Tables Fresnillo plc Consolidated Audited Mineral Resource Statement As at 31 December 2014 Quantity Grade Contained Metal Tonnes Gold Silver Lead Zinc Gold Silver Lead Zinc Resource Category* Cut-off Grade** Mt (g/t) (g/t) (%) (%) (Moz) (Moz) (kt) (kt) Fresnillo Underground Measured 103 g/t Ag Eq 9.75 0.79 645 0.91 1.51 0.25 202.28 88.47 147.39 Indicated 25.15 0.76 283 1.80 3.70 0.61 229.15 452.39 930.59 Measured & Indicated 34.89 0.76 385 1.55 3.09 0.86 431.43 540.86 1,077.98 Inferred 31.31 0.70 319 1.25 2.47 0.71 321.55 389.96 772.97 Saucito Underground Measured 136 g/t Ag Eq 1.62 2.60 477 0.88 1.58 0.14 24.82 14.25 25.54 Indicated 9.97 1.80 379 1.89 3.47 0.58 121.55 188.08 346.00 Measured & Indicated 11.59 1.91 393 1.75 3.21 0.71 146.37 202.33 371.54 Inferred 27.91 1.04 335 1.05 1.89 0.93 300.81 293.39 527.33 Ciénega Underground Measured Multiple1 6.15 2.43 123 0.74 1.19 0.48 24.25 45.72 72.96 Indicated 15.29 1.59 158 0.56 0.90 0.78 77.73 85.67 138.21 Measured & Indicated 21.43 1.83 148 0.61 0.99 1.26 101.99 131.39 211.16 Inferred 8.52 1.16 148 0.45 0.85 0.32 40.42 38.35 72.53 San Julián Veins Measured 1.47 2.25 185 – – 0.11 8.76 – – Indicated 122 g/t Ag Eq 8.40 1.93 146 – – 0.52 39.29 – – Measured & Indicated 9.87 1.98 151 – – 0.63 48.05 – – Inferred 3.47 1.62 141 – – 0.18 15.73 – – San Julián Disseminated Measured 8.37 0.09 272 0.68 1.64 0.03 73.19 57.01 137.25 Indicated 102 g/t Ag Eq 12.02 0.06 139 0.48 1.33 0.02 53.89 57.95 159.60 Measured & Indicated 20.38 0.08 194 0.56 1.46 0.05 127.08 114.96 296.85 Inferred 0.04 0.05 46 0.09 2.10 0.00 0.06 0.03 0.82 Herradura Veins Measured 1.70 g/t Au Eq – – – – – – – – – Indicated 13.00 3.57 – – – 1.49 – – – Measured & Indicated 13.00 3.57 – – – 1.49 – – – Inferred 27.00 3.25 – – – 2.82 – – – Continued overleaf... www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 249 Fresnillo plc Consolidated Audited Mineral Resource Statement continued Quantity Grade Contained Metal Tonnes Gold Silver Lead Zinc Gold Silver Lead Zinc Resource Category* Cut-off Grade** Mt (g/t) (g/t) (%) (%) (Moz) (Moz) (kt) (kt) Open Pit2 Herradura (Disseminated)3 Measured Multiple4 123.73 0.82 – – – 3.28 – – – Indicated 117.09 0.77 – – – 2.91 – – – Measured & Indicated5 240.82 0.80 – – – 6.19 – – – Inferred 24.86 0.75 – – – 0.60 – – – Soledad-Dipolos6 Measured 0.30 g/t Au 29.65 0.64 – – – 0.61 – – – Indicated 13.92 0.58 – – – 0.26 – – – Measured & Indicated7 43.57 0.62 – – – 0.87 – – – Inferred 0.02 0.45 – – – 0.00 – – – Noche Buena Measured 0.30 g/t Au 33.02 0.55 – – – 0.59 – – – Indicated 36.79 0.53 – – – 0.62 – – – Measured & Indicated8 69.81 0.54 – – – 1.21 – – – Inferred 5.40 0.47 – – – 0.08 – – – Totals – Underground9 Multiple Measured & Indicated 111.17 1.40 239 0.89 1.76 5.00 854.92 989.55 1,957.53 Inferred 98.25 1.57 215 0.73 1.40 4.96 678.56 721.74 1,373.65 Totals – Open Pit10 Multiple Measured & Indicated 354.20 0.73 – – – 8.27 – – – Inferred 30.28 0.70 – – – 0.68 – – – * Mineral resources are reported inclusive of ore reserves.

Gold, silver, lead and zinc assays were capped where appropriate. Mineral resources are reported at variable metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions** and appropriate metallurgical recoveries. For the open pit mineral resources, silver grades and contained metal are based on metallurgical production data and have not been estimated. ** Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries. Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of cut-off grades and metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,150.00), Silver (US$/oz 18.00), Lead (US$/lb 0.95) and Zinc (US$/lb 0.95) 1 The cut-off grade for Ciénega’s mineral resources varies between the following range: 1.35 to 2.64 g/t Au equivalent. 2 The Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena resources are reported within pit shells run at a US$1,350/oz Au price. 3 The Herradura open pit mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 1.1 g/t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, projected in situ M & I silver in the veins resource is 0.46 Moz and projected in situ Inferred silver in the veins resource is 0.95 Moz. 4 Herradura mineral resources are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.30 g/t Au reports to the heap leach, transitional and sulfide material from 0.35 to 0.60 g/t Au report to the heap leach, oxide material above 1.14 g/t Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.60 g/t Au reports to the mill. 5 The Herradura open pit mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 1.1 g/t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, projected in situ M & I silver in the open pit resource is 8.52 Moz and projected in situ inferred silver in the open pit resource is 0.88 Moz. 6 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access. SRK has been provided with documents indicating a reasonable chance that these actions will be settled in favour of the mine. 7 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.5 g/t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, projected in situ M & I silver in the resource is 0.70 Moz and projected in situ inferred silver in the resource is 4K ounces. 8 The Noche Buena mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.3 g/t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, projected in situ M & I silver in the veins resource is 0.67 Moz and projected in situ inferred silver in the resource is 0.05 Moz. 9 Includes Fresnillo (Proaño), Saucito, Ciénega, San Julián and Herradura Vein deposits. 10 Includes the open pit portion of Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena deposits. 250 Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Consolidated Audited Mineral Resource Statement of Exploration Projects and Prospects1 As at 31 December 2014 Deposit1 Quantity Grade Contained Metal Tonnes Gold Silver Lead Zinc Gold Silver Lead Zinc Fresnillo Subsidiary Cut-off Grade* (000 t) (g/t) (g/t) (%) (%) (koz) (koz) (kt) (kt) Measured Mineral Resource Orisyvo – disseminated Au**3 Multiple 27,827 1.38 1 – – 1,236 1,260 – – Candameña – disseminated Au** – – – – – – – – – Leones – breccia** – – – – – – – – – Tajitos – disseminated Au – – – – – – – – – Lucerito – breccia/mantos** – – – – – – – – – Rodeo – disseminated Au – – – – – – – – – San Juan – veins – – – – – – – – – Manzanillas – veins US$58.30/t 74 6.75 130 – – 16 309 – – Juanicipio – veins2 – – – – – – – – – Guachichil – disseminated Au** – – – – – – – – – Opulencia – veins – – – – – – – – – La Gloria – veins – – – – – – – – – La Joya – Cerro Blanco – veins – – – – – – – – – La Joya – Potrerillos – veins – – – – – – – – – La Joya – San Gregorio – veins – – – – – – – – – Cebadillas – veins – – – – – – – – – La Yesca – veins – – – – – – – – – San Nicolás – veins – – – – – – – – – Pilarica – mantos – – – – – – – – – Total Measured 27,901 1.40 2 0.00 0.00 1,252 1,570 0 0 Indicated Mineral Resource Orisyvo – disseminated Au**3 Multiple 180,612 1.07 1 – – 6,235 8,080 – – Candameña – disseminated Au** 0.38 g/t Au Eq 20,952 0.46 16 – – 313 10,464 – – Leones – breccia** – – – – – – – – – Tajitos – disseminated Au 0.30 g/t Au Eq 4,590 0.50 – – – 74 – – – Lucerito – breccia/mantos** 1.00 g/t Au 131,862 0.37 24 0.26 0.42 1,574 102,937 344 556 Rodeo – disseminated Au – – – – – – – – – San Juan – veins US$58.30/t 2,688 1.30 138 – – 112 11,957 – – Manzanillas – veins US$58.30/t 907 4 69 – – 104 2,012 – – Juanicipio – veins2 US$70.27/t 4,782 1.86 512 2.12 4.01 286 78,779 101 192 Guachichil – disseminated Au** – – – – – – – – – Opulencia – veins 2.10 g/t Au Eq 465 3.09 197 – – 46 2,945 – – La Gloria – veins – – – – – – – – – La Joya – Cerro Blanco – veins – – – – – – – – – La Joya – Potrerillos – veins – – – – – – – – – La Joya – San Gregorio – veins – – – – – – – – – Cebadillas – veins – – – – – – – – – La Yesca – veins – – – – – – – – – San Nicolás – veins – – – – – – – – – Pilarica – mantos – – – – – – – – – Total Indicated 346,857 0.78 20 0.13 0.22 8,743 217,173 445 748 Continued overleaf... www.fresnilloplc.com Fresnillo plc | Annual report 2014 251 Consolidated Audited Mineral Resource Statement of Exploration Projects and Prospects1 continued Deposit1 Quantity Grade Contained Metal Tonnes Gold Silver Lead Zinc Gold Silver Lead Zinc Fresnillo Subsidiary Cut-off Grade* (000 t) (g/t) (g/t) (%) (%) (koz) (koz) (kt) (kt) Inferred Mineral Resource Orisyvo – disseminated Au**3 Multiple 70,983 0.55 1 – – 1,247 2,027 – – Candameña – disseminated Au** 0.57 g/t Au Eq 41,056 0.54 22 – – 706 28,654 – – Leones – breccia** 60 g/t Ag 7,049 0.01 113 1.46 1.27 1 25,509 103 90 Tajitos – disseminated Au 0.30 g/t Au Eq 10,958 0.49 – – – 173 – – – Lucerito – breccia/mantos** 1.00 g/t Au 30,408 0.44 38 0.21 0.34 426 37,279 64 103 Rodeo – disseminated Au 0.30 g/t Au 42,315 0.54 4 – – 730 5,770 – – San Juan – veins US$58.30/t 5,015 1.60 111 – – 257 17,964 – – Manzanillas – veins US$58.30/t 306 2.06 47 – – 20 464 – – Juanicipio – veins2 US$70.27/t 3,431 1.52 325 1.68 2.80 168 35,815 58 96 Guachichil – disseminated Au** 0.42 g/t Au Eq 37,297 0.61 9 0.12 0.16 726 11,271 43 61 Opulencia – veins 2.10 g/t Au Eq 2,015 2.21 140 – – 143 9,070 – – La Gloria – veins 2.10 g/t Au Eq 2,213 3.14 86 – – 224 6,098 – – La Joya – Cerro Blanco – veins 2.10 g/t Au Eq 499 3.56 436 – – 57 6,989 – – La Joya – Potrerillos – veins 2.10 g/t Au Eq 576 0.78 502 – – 14 9,295 – – Cebadillas – veins 2.10 g/t Au Eq 2,055 2.55 64 – – 168 4,236 – – La Yesca – veins 159 g/t Ag Eq 1,005 0.78 145 – – 25 4,674 – – San Nicolás – veins 2.10 g/t Au Eq 2,167 1.61 225 – – 112 15,684 – – Pilarica – mantos 30 g/t Ag Eq 16,174 – 68 0.30 0.44 – 35,398 48 70 Total Inferred 275,523 0.59 29 0.11 0.15 5,199 256,196 316 421 1 Mineral resources are not ore reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

For the open pit ore reserves, silver grades and contained metal are based on metallurgical production data and have not been estimated. ** Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries. Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of cut-off grades and metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,150.00), Silver (US$/oz 18.00), Lead (US$/lb 0.95) and Zinc (US$/lb 0.95). 1 The cut-off grades for Ciénega’s reserve varies between the following range: 1.88 to 3.21 g/t Au equivalent. 2 Herradura ore reserves are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.30 g/t Au reports to the heap leach, transitional and sulfide material from 0.35 to 0.60 g/t Au report to the heap leach, oxide material above 1.14 g/t Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.60 g/t Au reports to the mill. 3 The Herradura open pit mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 1.1 g/t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, projected in situ P&P silver in the reserve is 7.41 Moz. 4 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.5 g/t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, projected in situ P&P silver in the reserve is 0.61 Moz. 5 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access. SRK has been provided with documents indicating a reasonable chance that these actions will be settled in favour of the mine. 6 The Noche Buena mine has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.3 g/t. Silver is not assayed for and is not estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, projected in situ P&P silver in the reserve is 0.61 Moz. 7 Includes Fresnillo (Proaño), Saucito, Ciénega, San Julián and Herradura Vein deposits.
