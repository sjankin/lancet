Thus, Compañía Comercial Herdez became a manufacturing company that, through its focus on innovation, would later become a market leader. “Grupo Herdez is a fantastic collection of products, consumption occasions, and partnerships. A hundred years of history, a hundred years of trust, a hundred years of safety. Few companies in the world are able to offer this”. ALEJANDRO MARTÍNEZ-GALLARDO associated companies business unit vice president Part of the Grupo Herdez family since 1988 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 18 Creating innovative stories From our beginnings, we have been known for launching new products to the market, always complying with the highest quality and safety standards and addressing ever-changing lifestyles. During these 100 years, innovation has been a cornerstone of the Group’s growth, from new technologies used in our processes and products, to the creative ways in which we have reached our customers. Grupo Herdez was the first company in Mexico to bottle serrano and jalapeño chili peppers through a short process, eliminating the extended pickling times. We were also pioneers in bottling mole, a typical Mexican sauce that requires a great variety of ingredients and a complex production process, thereby enabling Mexican families to enjoy this traditional dish in a matter of minutes. Our focus on innovation led us to revolutionize an emblematic component of Mexican gastronomy: salsa. In bottling it, our consumers were able to leave the “molcajete” (a stone tool used for manual grinding) behind and instantly enjoy the flavor of the Herdez® salsas. We were also the first company to process squash blossom, corn smut – or cuitlacoche the ‘Mexican truffle’ –, nopales, chile poblano and teas. GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 19 Since the 50’s – when our processes were handcrafted and our products made in small batches – we have evolved and incorporated continuous, automated and state-of-the-art preparation systems into our processes, such as high-pressure pasteurization. Our current manufacturing capabilities enable us to meet the demand of ever-growing markets. Today, Herdez® frozen Mexican cuisine meals and the line of Wholly Guacamole® minis – both avail100% able in the US market –, are strong examples of our focus on innovation, through which we seek to offer authentic Mexican products in accessible and convenient formats. of our products are subjected to procedures WE CREATE HEALTHY EATING that assess their impact on HABITS the health and safety of As part of our commitment to offer healthy opconsumers tions to consumers, our product portfolio includes organic foods, frozen yogurt, superfoods and food & sports supplements.

In 2014, we created jelly formulas that add fiber and have no sugar, sugarless maple-flavored syrup, and low-fat mayonnaise and dressings. One hundred percent of our products are subjected to procedures that assess their impact on the health and safety of consumers. These assessments are performed in all phases of the lifecycle of the products: research and development, certification, production, marketing, storage and 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 20 distribution, as well as during the use and disposal of packaging. To this end, our manufacturing processes are certified by the Business Alliance for Secure Commerce (BASC), BRC Global Standard For Food Safety, Food Safety System Certification 22000 (FSSC 22000), Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), and ISO 9001.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE Compliance with regulations is an essential prerequisite for our operations. Therefore, we comply fully with laws and regulations in all countries where we operate. Even before industry certifications such as ISO and FSSC were created, we already had internal systems to test our processes and ensure the quality and safety of all our products. During the 90’s and 2000’s, the Group was a pioneer in Mexico of the ISO 9000 certification for a food plant and distribution center. It also received the first Food Safety System Certification 22000 (FSSC 22000) in Latin America, which is recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI).

A. B. de C. V.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries (the “Company” or the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2014 and 2013, the consolidated statements of income, statements of other comprehensive income, statements of changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes, comprising a summary of the accounting policies and additional explanatory information. MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit in order to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 48 In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. OPINION In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C.

GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 57 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (Thousands of Mexican pesos) These financial statements have been translated from the Spanish language original and for the convenience of foreign/English-speaking readers. (1) Reporting entityGrupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. (the “Company”), is a company located in Mexico, which trade shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange. The Company’s registered office is at Calzada San Bartolo Naucalpan 360, Col. Argentina Poniente, Mexico, D.F., C.P. 11230. These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Group” and individually “the Group companies”) and the Group’s share on related entities and jointly controlled. The Company is a 51.0% subsidiary of Hechos con Amor, S. A. de C. V., which is empowered to lead its operations. The Group is mainly engaged in the manufacture, purchase, distribution and marketing of canned and packed food products in Mexico, as well as food products targeted at the Mexican food segment within the United States of America (USA). The entities of Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. manufacture and commercialize products under the following trademarks: Aires de Campo, Barilla, Búfalo, Carlota, ChiChi’s, Del Fuerte, Don Miguel, Doña María, Embasa, Herdez, La Victoria, McCormick, Wholly, Yemina and Nutrisa, among others. For such purposes, Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. have forged alliances with leading companies worldwide, such as: McCormick and Company Inc., Hormel Foods Corp., Barilla GeR Fratelli S.p.A. and Grupo Kuo, S. A. B. de C. V. (Grupo Kuo). (2) Basis of preparationThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). On February 26, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In accordance with the Mexican Corporations Law (LGSM by its Spanish acronym) and the bylaws of Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V., the stockholders are empowered to modify the consolidated financial statements after issuance. The accompanying consolidated financial statements will be submitted to the next Stockholders’ Meeting for approval. Details of the Group’s accounting policies, including changes during the year, are included in notes 2(d) and 3. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 58 (a) Basis of MeasurementThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following significant items, which have been measured on an alternative basis on each date of the consolidated financial statements: • The defined benefit asset is recognized as plan assets, less the present value of the defined benefit obligation and is limited as explained in note (3(i)(ii)). • Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and recognized in the other comprehensive income when these are effective within the accepted range and qualify as hedge, otherwise these instruments will be recognized in the income statement. • Items of property, machinery and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. • Bank loans and notes payable are recognized at their amortized cost. (b) Functional and reporting currencyThese consolidated financial statements are presented in Mexican pesos, which is the Company’s functional currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousands of Mexican pesos, unless otherwise indicated. In the case of the foreign entities of the joint venture in the U.S., their financial statements are presented in the local currency, which is their functional currency, and they are converted to Mexican pesos allowing the Company to recognize their participation in such entities. On December 19, 2013, the subsidiary in Spain decided to transfer its business address to Mexico, adopting for such effects the Mexican nationality and the figure of corporation with variable capital, as well as the Company’s name of “MARCAS HERDEZ “, keeping its functional currency, which is Mexican peso. (c) Use of judgments and estimatesIn preparing these consolidated financial statements according to IFRS, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group´s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect over the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment in the next financial year are described in the next page: GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 59 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) i) Consolidation of entities with no majority shareholding The Group analyzes the existence of control over those entities on which it does not have majority shareholding, evaluating if it is exposed or has rights to the variable yields from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect yields through its power over the entity. If as a result from the analysis, the Group determines that it exercises control of these entities, they are consolidated within the Group. If there are no signs of the existence of control on the entities, the investment in those associated companies is recognized under the equity method. ii) Fair values determination The Group applies the guidelines of IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement (“IFRS 13”) to determine the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value. IFRS 13 does not require fair values in addition to those required or allowed by other IFRS and is not required to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. Under IFRS, the fair value represents the “Selling Price”, which would be received from selling an asset or would be paid for transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as at the date of valuation, considering the credit risk of the counterparty in the valuation. The concept of selling price is based on the assumption that there is a market and participants in such market for the specific asset or liability. When there is no market and/or participants to form the market, the IFRS 13 establishes a fair value hierarchy that organizes the inputs in the valuation techniques used to determine fair value. The hierarchy of highest priority is unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority is that of the calculations that have to do with inputs that are significant but unobservable (level 3 measurement). The three levels of hierarchy are as follows:  Level 1 inputs are active market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets and liabilities that the Group has the ability to negotiate on the measurement date.  Level 2 inputs are different from market prices, but are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability.  Level 3 inputs are those that are unobservable for the asset or liability. iii) Fair value of derivative financial instruments The fair values of derivative instruments traded on recognized markets are determined based on quotations issued by these markets. In those cases in which the instruments are traded on OTC market (“Over The Counter”), the fair value of the financial instruments is estimated on the basis of valuation technical models accepted in the financial arena, mainly using expected future cash flows discounted at present value and based on market information available at the valuation date. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 60 In determining the fair values, conditions and assumptions are used, mainly based on rate models based on TIIE 28, the Mexican Average Interbank Interest Rate (TIIE per its Spanish acronym) and exchange rate MXP/USD available at the valuation date. The Company has conducted the effectiveness tests required to comply with hedge accounting, which fall within the ranges allowed under IFRS. iv) Useful lives and fair value of property, machinery and equipment The Group determines the useful lives of its assets based on their best estimate of the periods during which economic benefits are expected to be obtained from such assets. v) Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with undefined useful lives In the case of goodwill and intangible assets with undefined useful lives, the impairment test is performed annually on the same dates. In evaluating the value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted at their present value, using a discount rate before taxes that reflects the market evaluations of the value of the money over time, taking into account the specific risks inherent to the asset. For impairment testing purposes, assets that cannot be tested individually are integrated in smaller groups of assets that generate cash inflows from on-going use and that are, for the most part, independent from the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash generating unit”). For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is distributed to the group of cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of such combination. This distribution is subject to operating segment ceiling testing and reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Impairment losses are recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses recorded with respect to the cash generating units are distributed first to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill distributed to the units and subsequently to reduce the carrying value of other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. No goodwill-related impairment loss is reverted. vi) Determination of employee benefits Direct benefits are applied in the income statement as they arise and the related liabilities are stated at their nominal value, due to their short-term nature. The Group’s net obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans are calculated separately for each plan, estimating the amount of the future benefit earned by employees in return for their services in the current and past periods; this benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is calculated on the basis of zero coupon government bonds with maturity term resembling those of the Group’s obligations and that are determined in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary, using the projected unit credit method. vii) Impairment of accounts receivable On each reporting date, the Group evaluates whether or not there is objective evidence that its accounts receivable are impaired, which includes defaulting or late payment by a debtor, or the restructuring of an amount due to the Group. The Company considers evidence of impairment of accounts receivable at both the specific asset level and collective. All accounts receivable considered significant individually are evaluated for possible specific impairment. All accounts receivable evaluated that are GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 61 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) not specifically impaired are subsequently evaluated collectively to identify impairment that may have occurred and, that has not yet been identified. Accounts receivables not significant individually are evaluated collectively for possible impairment, by grouping the accounts showing similar risk features. In evaluating collective impairment, the Group uses the historical trends of the likelihood of default, timing of recoveries and losses incurred, adjusted as a result of the analysis conducted by Management to determine whether or not current economic and credit conditions are such, that actual losses are likely to be higher or lower than those the historical trends suggest. (d) Changes in accounting policiesExcept for the changes shown below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in note 3 to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. The Group has adopted the following amendments to standards and new interpretations with a date of initial application of January 1, 2014. a. Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IAS 32) b. Recoverable Amount Disclosures for NonFinancial Assets (Amendments to IAS 36). The nature and effects of the changes are explained below: a) Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities As a result of the amendments to IAS 32, the Group has expanded its disclosures regarding offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. (Note 5). b) Disclosures of recoverable amount for Non-Financial Assets As a result of amendments to IAS 36, the Group has expanded its disclosures of recoverable amount when they are based on fair value less cost of disposals and recognized an impairment (see note 11). 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 62 (3) Significant accounting policiesThe following accounting policies set out have been applied consistently to all the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, and have been applied consistently by the Group’s entities: (a) Consolidation basis(i) Businesses combinationsThe Group accounts for businesses combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group (see (a) (iii)). The consideration transferred in the acquisition and the identificable net assets acquired are generally measured at fair value. Any determined goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment (see (h) (iii)). Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in the income statement, immediately. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are recognized in the income statement. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, incurred by the Group in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Some contingent payable considerations are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. In other cases, subsequent changes in fair value in the contingency are recognized in the income statement. (ii) Non-controlling interestFor each business combination, the Group measures any non-controlling interest in the investee at:  Fair value, or  The proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company, which are generally at fair value. Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. No adjustments are made to goodwill nor any gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. (iii) SubsidiariesSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.

(5) Merged Entity in March 2014 with Nutrisa, S. A. de C. V., the latter acting as the merging company. (6) Merged Entity in March 2014 with Promociones Inmobiliarias Naturistas, S. A. de C. V., the latter acting as the merging company. (iv) Loss of controlWhen the Group loses control over any given subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. (v) Investments in associated entities and jointly controlled entities (equity method)The associated entities are those entities in which the Group has a significant influence, but not control nor joint control, over the financial and operating policies. The joint ventures are those entities in which the Group has joint control over its activities, through which the Group is entitled to the net assets of the agreement and not entitled to its assets and obligations for liabilities, established by contractual agreement and unanimous consent to take financial decisions and strategic operations. The investments in associated entities and joint venture are recognized by the equity method and are initially recorded at cost. The investment cost includes the transaction costs. The consolidated financial statements include the interest of the Group in the profits or losses and other comprehensive income of investments accounted by the equity method, after performing the adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence and the joint venture begins and until these are finished. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 66 When the portion of losses of the Group exceeds its interest in an investment recognized by the equity method, the carrying amount of that interest, including any long-term investment, is reduced to zero and the recognition of more losses is discontinued except if the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the company it participates in. (vi) Transactions eliminated in the consolidationIntercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized profits arising from transactions with companies which investment is recognized by the equity method are eliminated from the investment in the proportion of the Group’s participation in the investment. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized profits, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. (vii) Discontinued operationsA discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that has been disposed, where, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which:  Represents either a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;  Is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose a separate major line of business or geographic area of operation that is significant and can be separated from the rest; or  Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with the purpose of re-sale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of income statement and other comprehensive income is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the begining of the comparative year. (b) Foreign currency(i) Foreign currency transactionsTransactions in foreign currency are translated into the respective functional currency of Group companies at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the consolidated financial statements date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 67 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) Foreign currency differences arising from translation of the following items are recognized in other comprehensive income:  Available-for-sale equity investments (except for impairment, in which case foreign currency differences that have been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement).  A financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge is effective.  Qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective. (ii) Foreign operationsAssets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Mexican pesos at the exchange rates on the consolidated financial statements date. Revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Mexican pesos at the exchange rates at the date of transactions. Foreign currency translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve, except when the translation difference is allocated to non-controlling interest. On a complete or partial foreign business disposal on which control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interest. When the Group disposes only part of an associate or joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the corresponding proportion of the total amount is reclassified to the income statement. (c) Financial instrumentsThe Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through income statement, held-to-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables and available-forsale financial assets. The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category. (i) Financial assets and non-derivative financial liabilities – Recognition and derecognitionThe Group initially recognizes loans and trade account receivables on the date when they are originated. All the other financial assets (including assets designated at fair value with changes in income) 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 68 are initially recognized on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the instrument’s contractual provisions. The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in such derecognized financial assets created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability. The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are paid or cancelled, or expire. Financial assets and liabilities are subject to be offset being the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to settle the net amount or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. (ii) Non-derivative financial assetsLoans and accounts receivables Loans and accounts receivable are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not traded in an active market. These assets are initially recognized at fair value, plus any directly attributable transaction cost. Loans and accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost by using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. Loans and accounts receivable include trade accounts receivable and other accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and deposits with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition subject to exchange effects in fair value and are used by the Group in the Management of its short-term commitments. The amount of cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet includes restricted cash and investments, comprised of deposits in margin accounts that guarantee several Group obligations, to the extent that the restriction will be lifted in less than three months from the balance sheet date. When the restriction period is greater than three months, such restricted cash and investments are not considered cash equivalents and are included within short-term or long-term “Debtors” as appropriate. (iii) Non-derivative financial liabilitiesInitially, the Group recognizes the debt securities issued at the date on which they are generated. All the other financial liabilities are initially recognized on the contracting date on which the Group becomes a party to the instrument’s contractual provisions. The Group eliminates a financial liability when its contractual obligations are cancelled, or expired. The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities in the category of other financial liabilities. GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 69 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value without any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured amortized cost using the effective interest method. Other financial liabilities consist of notes payable, suppliers and other accounts payable and stock market certificates. (iv) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accountingThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. In addition, the Group holds derivative to hedge the price of the raw materials (Commodities), which are designated in a formal hedging relationship. In the initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and the item(s) covered, including the risk management objectives and strategy when entering the hedging transactions, as well as the methods to be used in assessing the effectiveness of the hedge relationship. The Group conducts an evaluation at the outset of the hedge operation (prospectively) and subsequent on-going evaluations (retrospectively), if the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective to offset the changes in fair value of the primary positions during the period for which the hedge is designated, and if each hedge’s actual results are within a range of 80-125 percent. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are recognized in the income statement as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognized in the income statement; in case they are designed in a cash flow hedge, changes are recognized in other comprehensive income. Cash flow hedgesWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the income statement. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount accrued in the stockholders’ equity is maintained in other comprehensive income and it is reclassified to income statement in the same period when the hedged item affects the income statement. In other cases, the amount accrued in stockholders’ equity is reclassified to the income in the same period when the hedged item affects the income statement. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 70 If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to the income statement. Embedded derivativesEmbedded derivatives are separated from the main contract and recorded separately if:  The characteristics and risks of the main contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related.  A separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative could meet the characteristics of a derivative.  The combined instrument is not measured at fair value with changes in income statement. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedgingWhen a derivative financial instrument is not designated for a hedging qualifying relationship all changes in fair value are immediately recognized in income statement. (v) EquityOrdinary sharesOrdinary shares are classified in stockholders’ equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares, net of any tax effects, are recognized as a deduction from equity. Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (treasury shares)When shares recognized as stockholders’ equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effect, is recognized as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury shares reserve. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognized as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premiums. Capital stock, the reserve for the purchase of shares, the statutory reserve, the premium on the subscription of shares and accrued profits are stated as follows: i) movements made from January 1, 1998 at their historical cost, and ii) movements made prior to January 1, 1998 at their restated historical values by applying factors derived from the NCPI until December 31, 1997. (d) Property, machinery and equipment(i) Recognition and measurementItems of property, machinery and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 71 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) The cost includes expenses directly attributable to acquisition of the asset. The cost of assets built by the entity includes the following:  The cost of materials and direct labor.  Any other costs directly attributable to making the asset suitable to a working condition for its intended use.  When the Group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site, an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site where they are located.  The capitalized loan costs. At December 31 2014 and 2013, there are no qualifying assets where capitalized financing cost exist. Acquired software, which is part of the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of such equipment. If significant parts of an item of property, machinery and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, machinery and equipment. Any gain or loss on the disposal of an item of property, machinery and equipment (determined as the difference between the proceeds obtained from the sale and the book value for such item) are recognized in the proceeds statement. (ii) Subsequent costsSubsequent expenditures are capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. Continuous repairs and maintenance are expensed in income statement as incurred. (iii) DepreciationItems of property, machinery and equipment are depreciated from the date on which they are installed and ready for their use or in the case of assets internally built, from the date on which the asset is completed and ready to be used. Depreciation is calculated to write-off the cost of items of property, machinery and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognized in the income statement. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 72 The estimated useful lives of property, machinery and equipment for current and comparative periods of the significant items are as follows: Years Buildings 20 33 Machinery and tools 10 14 Fishing equipment 14 17 Furniture and office equipment 12 Stowing and transportation equipment 4 10 Electronic data processing equipment 4 Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each date of the consolidated financial statements and adjusted, if appropriate. (e) Intangible assets and goodwill(i) GoodwillGoodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. (ii) Subsequent measurementGoodwill is recognized at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. In relation with the investments recognized under the equity method, the book value of goodwill is included in the book value of the investment, and any impairment loss is distributed to the book value of the investment recognized under the equity method as a whole. (iii) Intangible assets with defined lifeIntangible assets acquired by the Group consisting of non-competition agreements, developed technology and customer relationships that have defined useful lives are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. The aforementioned does not refer to intangible assets internally developed as they arise from acquisitions made. (iv) Intangible assets with undefined useful livesIntangible assets with undefined useful lives correspond to patents and trademarks, involving no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic or other factors that might limit their useful lives, and which are expected to generate future cash flows, which are not conditioned to a limited period of time, and are thus subject to annual impairment testing under IFRS. GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 73 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) (v) Subsequent expendituresA subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditures, including expenditures on internally generated trademarks and goodwill, are recognized in income statement. Goodwill is not amortized. (vi) AmortizationAmortization is calculated to write-off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values by using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognized in the income. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Years Non-competition agreements 2-3 Developed technology 8 20 Customer relationships 13 20 Lease rights and software 3 Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each date of the consolidated statements of financial position and adjusted, if appropiate. (f) LeasessDetermining whether an agreement contains a lease At inception of an agreement, the Group determines whether the agreement is or contains a lease. The Group separates payments and other consideration required by the agreement, at the beginning of it or after making the proper review, between those derived from the lease and those derived from other elements, based on their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a finance lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, then an asset and a liability are recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset, subsequently, the liability is reduced by payments made recognizing the financial cost on the liability using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Leased assets Assets held by the Group under leases that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as financial leases. The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 74 to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognized in the Group’s statement of financial position. Lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognized in income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognized as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the lease term. Minimum lease payments made under financial leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of liability balance. The financial expense is allocated to each period during the lease term in order to obtain a consistent interest rate on each period, over the remaining balance of the liability. (g) InventoriesInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes disbursements incurred for the acquisition of inventories, production or manufacturing costs and other costs incurred to transport them to their site and current conditions. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, costs include an apropiate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. The cost of inventory may also include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on the rated flow hedges of inventory purchases in foreign currency. Net realizable value is the estimated sale price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and the estimated necessary costs to close the sale. (h) Impairment(i) Non-derivative financial assetsFinancial assets not classified as at fair value through income statement, including an interest in an equity accounted subsidiary investee, are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether or not there is objective evidence of impairment. Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes:  Default or non-compliance of a debtor;  Restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;  Indications that a debtor or issuer will declare bankruptcy;  Adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers;  The disappearance of an active market for a security; and  Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the expected cash flows from a group of financial assets. GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 75 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) For an investment in an equity security, objective evidence of impairment includes a significant or prolonged fair value decrease below its cost. The Group considers a decrease of 20% to be significant and a period of nine months to be prolonged. (ii) Financial assets measured at amortized costThe Group considers evidence of impairment for the assets measured at amortized cost (loans and receivables and financial assets held to maturity) both an individual assets and at collective level. All receivables and investment securities held to maturity individually significant are assessed for specific impairment. Those who are not specifically impaired are evaluated for collective impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified. Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping assets with similar risk characteristics. In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information on the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, and makes and adjust if current economic and credit conditions make probable that the actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than suggested by historical trends. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognized in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account against loans and receivables or investment securities held to maturity. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognized. When an event occurring after the impairment is recognized it causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease is reversed in income. (iii) Non-financial assetsAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its non-financial assets, excluding employee benefits, inventories and deferred tax assets, to determine whether is any indication of impairment exists. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and intangible assets with undefined useful lives are tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets that cannot be individually tested are integrated in smaller groups of assets that generate cash inflows from on-going use and that are, for the most part, independent from the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets. For the purposes of impairment testing of goodwill, goodwill acquired in a business acquisition is distributed to the group of cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 76 An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount. The Group’s corporate assets do not generate cash inflows separately. If there is any indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, the recovery value of the cash-generating unit to which the corporate asset pertains is then determined. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the cash-generating unit on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. (i) Employee benefits(i) Short-term benefitsShort-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. (ii) Defined benefit plansThe Group’s net obligations in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of the future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The costs for prior services not yet recognized and the fair value of plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is calculated on the basis of zero-coupon government bonds with maturity term resembling those of the Group’s obligations and that are determined in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary, using the projected unit credit method. When the result of the calculation is a benefit for the Group, the asset recognized is limited to the net total of prior-service costs not yet recognized and the present value of the economic benefits available, in the form of future reimbursements of the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. In calculating the present value of the economic benefits, the minimum funding requirements applicable to any of the Group’s plan must be considered. The resulting increase in labor cost of the benefit obligation and expenditure by employees in the year are recognized in operating expenses. The financial cost associated with increased liability over time, as well as the expected return on the period of plan assets are recognized in the financial results. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or liquidation of the obligations of the plan. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognized in income using the straight-line basis over the average period until the GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 77 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) benefits are delivered. To the extent that the benefits are immediately delivered, the expense is immediately recognized in income. The Group recognizes the actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income and all expenses related to the defined benefit plans in the expenses for benefits to the employees in income. When having reductions or settlements in a defined benefit plan, the Group shall recognize gains or losses arising from there. These gains or losses shall include any change that could result in the present value of the defined benefit obligations incurred by the entity, and any changes in the fair value of plan assets, any actuarial gains and losses and past service costs that had not been previously recognized. (iii) Termination benefitsThe benefits at the end of the employment relationship not associated with a restructuring event, such as severance payments are recognized in the income statement as incurred. (j) AllowancesAn allowance is recognized if: it is a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or assumed obligation that can be reliably estimated, and will probably require the use of economic resources to settle the obligation. The long-term allowances are determined by discounting future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market evaluation of the book value attributable to the time factor and risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as a financial cost. RestructuringThe Group recognizes allowances for restructuring, when restructuring plans have been properly completed and approved by the Management, and have been reported to the third parties involved and/or affected before the date of the financial statements. Contingencies and commitmentsObligations or losses related to contingencies are recognized as a liability when there is a present obligation resulting from past events and it is likely that the effects will materialize and can be measured reliably; otherwise they are qualitatively disclosed in the financial statements. The effects of long-term commitments established with third parties, as in the case of supply contracts with suppliers or customers, are recognized in the financial statements considering the substance of the agreements based on what was incurred or accrued. Relevant commitments are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. No income, profits or contingent assets are recognized. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 78 (k) RevenueSale of goodsIncome from the sale of goods during the course of ordinary operations is recognized at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade and volume discounts. Revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customers, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing Management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. The timing of the transfer of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the sales agreement. Generally, the transfer takes place when the product is received at the customer’s warehouse. (l) DonationsTo the extent the Group donations to social programs benefit the community in general, they are applied to income as incurred. (m) Financial income and financial costsFinancial income includes interest income on invested funds, income on earnings and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through income statement, as well as foreign exchange gains. Interest income is recognized at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. Income on earnings are recognized in income on the date on which the Group’s right to receive payments is established, which for the aforementioned instruments corresponds to the date of income payment. Financial costs comprise the interest expense on loans, foreign exchange losses, changes in the fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through income. Costs of loans that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that qualifies, are applied to income using the effective interest method. Gains and losses on foreign currency for financial assets and financial liabilities are presented according to their profit or loss position. (n) Income taxIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. It is recognized in income except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. (i) Current taxCurrent tax comprise the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 79 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statements of financial position date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends. (ii) Deferred taxDeferred taxes are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for:  Temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;  Temporary differences related to the investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal on the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not be reverse in the foreseeable future; and  Taxable temporary differences arising on initial recognition of goodwill. Assets and liabilities in deferred taxes are adjusted if there is an exigible legal right to adjust liabilities and assets for current tax, and are related to the income taxes imposed by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or different tax entities, but intend to settle the liabilities and assets for current tax on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. Deferred tax assets recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits exists. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period under review, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered through sale. The effects of income taxes for uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on its technical merits and assuming that the authorities will review each position and have full knowledge of the relevant information. These positions are valued based on the accumulated probability model. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 80 Each position is considered individually, without considering its relation to other fiscal procedure. The indicator of more likely than not represents a statement from management that the Group is entitled to the economic benefits of the tax position. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, the benefits of the position are not recognized. The Group recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of the income tax expense in the consolidated income statements. (o) Earnings per shareThe Group presents information on basic Earnings per Share (EPS), and the diluted earning per share corresponding to its ordinary shares. Basic EPS are calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the holders of ordinary shares by a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, adjusted by own shares held (see note 26). As there are no dilutive effects, the basic earning per share and diluted earning is the same. (p) Operating segmentsSegment results that are reported to the Group General Manager (highest authority in making operating decisions) include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets (primarily the Company’s headquarters), the costs of the central office, and tax assets and liabilities. (q) Comprehensive incomeComprehensive income is comprised of net income, the valuation of derivative financial instruments, translation effects and the results from actuarial losses on employee benefit obligations, which are reflected in stockholders’ equity, but which do not constitute capital contributions, reductions and/or distributions. (4) Standards issued but not yet adopted and reclassificationsA number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after January 1, 2014; however, the Group has not applied the following new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The Group does not plan to adopt these standards early. (a) IFRS 9 Financial InstrumentIFRS 9, published in July 2014, replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. IFRS 9, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 or subsequently, with early adoption permitted. The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 9. GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 81 Grupo Herdez, S. A.

Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 87 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) activities. The Group, through its standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures, and review the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risk faced by the Group. The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the internal audit. Internal audit conducts both routine and special inspections of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. i) Credit riskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a costumer or counterparty for a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises mainly from the Group’s accounts receivable and the investment instruments of the Group. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Accounts receivable The credit risk represents the risk of financial loss for the Group, if a customer or counterparty of a financial instruments defaults on its contractual obligations, and arises mainly from the client accounts receivable. The Risk Management Committee has implemented a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, if they are available, and in some cases bank references. Sale limits are established for each customer and reviewed quarterly, that represents the maximum open amount that does not require approval from the Risk Management Committee. Customers failing to meet the Company’s credit reference requirements can only conduct operations with the Group through upfront payments. More than 95% of the Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for more than four years, and no impairment loss has been recognized against these customers. In monitoring customer credit risks, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or a legal entity, whether they are a wholesaler, retail or an end-user customer, their geographic location, industry, years in business, maturity and existence of prior financial difficulties. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 88 Carrying amount 2014 2013 Wholesale customers $ 1,534,04 1 1,582,137 Retail customers 5,116 1,367 End-user customers 30,753 29,295 Other 27,336 35,027 Total $ 1,597,246 1,647,826 At December 31, 2014, the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables by counterparty type was as follows: • At December 31, 2014, the Group’s most significant customer, accounted for 26% of the trade and other receivables carrying amount (2013: 25%). • Customers classified as “high risk” are included in a list of restricted customers and they are monitored by the Risk Management Committee. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the aging of trade and other receivables was as follows: 2014 2013 Current portfolio $ 1,123,664 1,016,393 Past-due portfolio 1-30 314,566 467,340 Past-due portfolio 31-60 82,103 117,698 Past-due portfolio 61-90 35,612 16,087 Past-due portfolio +90 42,293 32,001 Legal portfolio 8,161 7,910 Total portfolio 1,606,399 1,657,429 Estimated portfolio of doubtful accounts (9,153) (9,603) Total trade receivables $ 1,597,246 1,647,826 The allowance for doubtful accounts movement for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows: 2014 2013 Allowance as at January 1 $ 9,603 9,245 (Applications) additions (450) 358 Allowance as at December 31 $ 9,153 9,603 At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had certain accounts receivable that were not past due or impaired. The credit quality for said accounts receivable shows no signs of impairment, as income is obtained from a broad variety of customers ranging from supermarkets, wholesalers and stores. The Company’s customer portfolio is mainly comprised of wholesalers and self-service stores, which entails similar credit GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 89 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) risk conditions and accounts for 96% and 96% of the overall portfolio in 2014 and 2013, respectively. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, none of the aforementioned accounts receivable showed default; however, Company Management has recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts past due and in legal process, that could represent impairment. Cash and investment in securities The Group held cash and cash equivalents of $2,450,833 as of December 31, 2014 (2013 $904,819). The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions, which are rated between the rank AAand AA+. Guarantees Cash and cash equivalents include restricted cash as follows: Margin account held for commodities operation $37,222 as at December 31, 2014 (2013 $18,139). Trust account by $33,332 at December 31, 2014 (2013 $29,886). Derivatives The derivatives are entered into with bank and financial institution counterparties, which are rated between the range AAand AA+, according to various rating agencies. The book value of derivative and non-derivative financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure of the Group: Book value (000'MXP) Derivative financial hedging instruments DECEMBER 31, 2014 Derivative financial assets measured at fair value Forwards on exchange rate hedging $ 23,641 Futures on raw materials 368 DECEMBER 31, 2013 Derivative financial assets measured at fair value Forwards on exchange rate hedging $ 10,834 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 90 ii) Liquidity riskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated witch its financial liabilities that are settled by delivery of cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking the Group’s reputation. The Group uses activity based costing to cost its products and services, which assist it in monitoring cash flow requirements and optimizing its cash return on investments. Normally, the Group ensures that it has sufficient available cash to cover expected operating expenses for a 60-day period, which includes payment of its financial obligations. The aforementioned excludes the possible impact of extreme circumstances that are not reasonably predictable, such as natural disasters.

The purpose of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposure within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return. The Group uses derivatives to manage market risks and it also incurs in financial obligations, such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Risk Management Committee. Generally, the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting to mitigate volatility in income statement. It is noteworthy that Grupo Herdez also has the risk of price changes in raw materials which is why the Company operates with future derivatives. Currency riskThe Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a difference between the currencies in which sales, purchases and loans are denominated and the functional currency of the Group, which is the Mexican peso. The main currency in which these transactions are denominated is the U.S. dollar (US$). Through hedging, the Group protects its estimated exposure to variations in exchange rates with respect to purchases projected with suppliers, denominated in foreign currency. The Group uses “forwards” exchange rate contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with maturities of less than one year from the reporting date. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 92 In respect to other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at exchange rates of transactions in cash or “spot” to cover incidentals in short-term. Exposure to currency risk The summarized quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to currency risk as reported to the Management of the Group is as follows: December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 MXN USD MXN USD Trade receivables 335,143 22,745 348,453 26,670 Trade payables (1,171,284) (79,491) (1,058,670) (81,030) Net statement of financial (836,141) (56,746) (710,217) (54,360) Position exposure Held to maturity agreements in (205,816) (13,968) foreign currency Net exposure (1,041,957) (70,714) (710,217) (54,360) The following significant exchange rates have been applied during the year: Average Exchange rate at exchange rate December 31, 2014 2013 2014 2013 U.S. dollar $ 13.3043 12.7700 14.7348 13.0652 Sensitivity analysis A reasonably possible strengthening (weakening) of the US dollar, against all other currencies at December 31 would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and affected equity and income statement by the amounts shown below.

Capital is comprised by total stockholders’ equity, minus the accrued amounts in the equity related with hedging of cash flow. The Board of Directors also monitors the returns on capital and as well as the level of dividends distributed to the stockholders of ordinary shares. The Group monitors capital using a debt-equity adjusted index, which adjusts net debt to adjusted equity. For this purpose, adjusted net debt is defined as total liabilities (including interest-bearing loans and borrowings and obligations under finance leases) plus dividends proposed unearned, less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted equity includes all components of equity other than amounts recognized in equity relating to cash flow hedges, less proposed unearned dividends. During the reporting periods, there were no changes in the approach to the Group’s policies on capital management. The Company and its subsidiaries are not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Periodically, the Group purchases its own shares on the market; the timing of such purchases depends on market prices. Buying and selling decisions are made by Management; the Group does not have a defined specific plan to repurchase shares. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 98 Company Management has established the following rules for management of financial and capital risks: –– The debt and its cost must not exceed 100% of consolidated stockholders’ equity. –– Not to reduce capital stock to under $5,300,000. –– Debt ans its cash cost net must not exceed 2.75 times the EBITDA (1). –– Not to reduce interest hedge (EBITDA/net financing expenses) to less than 3 times. All of these rules were duly complied with at December 31, 2014 and 2013.

The following is a summary of goodwill assigned to each operating segment: December 31, 2014 Opening Ending Additions balance balance Goodwill related to National segment $ 2,854,112 32,752 2,886,864 Goodwill related to Nutrisa segment 1,724,463 1,724,463 $ 4,578,575 32,752 4,611,327 December 31, 2013 Opening Ending Additions balance balance Goodwill related to National segment $ 2,854,112 2,854,112 Goodwill related to Nutrisa segment 1,724,463 1,724,463 $ 2,854,112 1,724,463 4,578,575 Cash flows subsequent to that period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates shown below, which do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the business in which each CGU and/or segment operates. The key assumptions used in estimation of value in use in 2014 are as follows: National segment Gross margin 30.00% Long-term growth rate 3.90% Discount rate 9.50% The key assumptions used in estimation of value in use in 2013 are as follows: National segment Gross margin 31.00% Long-term growth rate 3.90% Discount rate 9.90% 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 104 These assumptions have been used for each CGU. The gross margin has been budgeted based on past performance and on development expectations of each market. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the projections included in the industry’s reports. The discount rate corresponds to a pre-tax measure that is estimated based on past experience and the weighted average cost of capital of the industry that is based on a possible range of debt leveraging of 40 percent at a market interest rate of 7 percent. Five years of cash flows were included in the model of discounted cash flow. A long-term growth rate in perpetuity was determined based on the estimate of the administration of long-term compound annual growth rate that, in the opinion of Management, was consistent with the assumption that it would make a market participant.

V. signed a purchase agreement to acquire the shares of Grupo Nutrisa, S. A. B. de C. V. “Nutrisa”. Such agreement contained certain terms and conditions, including the approval by the Federal Commission of Competence and the approval by the shareholders of Grupo Herdez, which had to be complied with for the operation to be completed. In addition, Grupo Herdez was forced by the Securities Market Law to carry out the public offering for the acquisition of outstanding shares. On May 9, 2013, Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V announced a successful result of the public offering to acquire the outstanding shares of Grupo Nutrisa, S. A. B. de C. V. setting a share price of $91.00 pesos. As a result of the public offering, Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. acquired 99.82% of the capital stock of Grupo 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 108 Nutrisa, S. A. B. de C. V., thus originating the closing of the transaction based on the terms and conditions of the sales agreement. The closing of the operation was performed on May 13, 2013, since that date Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. consolidated the results of Grupo Nutrisa, S. A. B. de C. V. In the eight months elapsed as to December 31, 2013, Nutrisa contributed revenues of $782,738 and profits of $46,392 to the Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2013, the management estimates that consolidated revenue would have amounted to $13,629,137 and consolidated profits for the period would have amounted to $1,193,825. In determining these amounts, the management has assumed that the provisionally determined fair value adjustments, arising from the acquisition date would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2013. Nutrisa shareholders received $91.00 pesos per share, representing a total of $2,971,308 of the consideration transferred. Acquisition-related costs The Group incurred in acquisition costs of $6,000 relating to external legal fees, due diligence costs and bank commissions that guaranteed payment. These costs have been included in administrative expenses. Identifiable assets acquired and identifiable liabilities assumed The following table is a summary of the amounts recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to the acquisition date: Property, machinery and equipment $ 339,300 Intangible assets 1,010,747 Other assets 16,037 Deferred tax assets 16,823 Non-current assets 1,382,907 Inventories 99,008 Taxes receivable 86,118 Account receivables and others 24,383 Prepayments 9,558 Cash and cash equivalents 84,540 Current assets 303,607 Total assets $ 1,686,514 Deferred tax liabilities 349,887 Accruals 4,360 Non-current liabilities 354,247 Income taxes payable 125 Suppliers and other payables 74,989 Accruals 3,835 Current liabilities 78,949 Total identifiable acquired net assets $ 1,253,318 GRUPO HERDEZ | 100 YEARS CREATING OUR STORY 109 Grupo Herdez, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Thousands of Mexican pesos) Measurement of fair values Valuation techniques used to measure fair value of tangible assets acquired are as follows: Asset acquired Valuation technique Market Comparison Technique and Cost Technique: The valuation model considers quoted market prices for items when they are available, and PROPERTY, PLANT AND the depreciated replacement cost when appropriate. The depreciated EQUIPMENT replacement cost reflects the adjustments relating to physical deterioration as well as the functional and economic obsolescence. Relief-from-royalty method and multi-periods excess earning method: The relief-from-royalty method considers the discounted estimated royalty INTANGIBLE ASSETS payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned. The trade receivables include the gross contractual amounts due of $24,383 at the acquisition date. If the new information obtained within a period of one year from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date identifies adjustments to the above amounts, or any additional provisions that existed at the date of acquisition the accounting for the acquisition shall be revised. Goodwill Goodwill arising from the acquisition was recognized as follows: Transferred consideration $ 2,971,308 Non-controlling interest 6,473 Fair value of the identified net assets (1,253,318) Goodwill $ 1,724,463 Goodwill is mainly attributable to Nutrisa workforce skills and technical talent and the growth strategy of the Group to strengthen its position in the segment through the incursion into the category of frozen foods and a new sales channel through retail stores. No portion of the recognized goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Contingent consideration On August 22, 2011, HDF acquired through their joint venture called Megamex, 100% of the shares of the corporation Avomex, which purpose is the production, marketing, distribution and sale of processed avocado and “guacamole” through premium trademarks in the U.S. 2014 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 110 As part of Avomex sales agreement, Megamex pledged to the payment of contingent consideration subject to Avomex financial results, which was due in 2014 (in terms of annual compound growth rate of net sales and adjusted EBITDA percentage on net sales). The Group’s Management concluded that the contingent consideration was paid by Megamex, following the acquisition of Avomex is part of the consideration for the business combination. Due to the above and as a result of the valuation of the consideration, the best estimate was indeed performed; therefore, no significant losses are expected for any variation that may occur. The record of this allocation was made on the proportional part, and was part of the total consideration related to such business combination. The subsequent adjustments of valuation are recognized in the income statement of the Group. On October 8, 2013, the Group entered an agreement in which they agreed to limit contingent consideration to US$60 million, which was paid in November 2014. Such agreement created the recognition of the corresponding liability. Also, the net effect on the Group income statement was by $9.2 million USD in 2013. (16) Operating leaseLeases as lessee The Group leases a number of warehouses and factory facilities under operating leases. The leases typically run for a period of maximum 5 years, with an option to renew the lease after that date. Lease payments increase every five years to reflect the market lease prices. Some leases include additional lease payments based on changes in a local price index. Leases of plant and warehouse were signed more than ten years ago and they correspond to combined leases of land and facilities. The Group determined that the land and buildings items of the lease of the warehouse and factory are operating leases. The fee paid to the owner of the building is increased to market prices at regular intervals, and the Group does not participate in the residual value of the facilities. Therefore, it was determined that substantially all the risks and benefits belong to the lessor. One of the leased properties has been sub-leased by the Group. The lease and sub-lease expire in 2019. Sublease payments expected to be received arised to $1,500, during 2014. Amounts recognized in profit or loss During the year, $110,218 were recognized as an expense in the income statement in regards to operating leases ($106,371 in 2013). An amount of $1,500 was included as “other income” in respect of sub-leases ($1,500 in 2013). Future minimum lease payments At December 31, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases were as shown in the next page.

The main variables used in the actuarial calculations were the following: Discount rateThe determination of the discount rate considers the term and behavior of zero-coupon government bonds in force as at November 31, 2014 and 2013, a 7.00% rate (rounded off to the nearest quarter). Long-term inflation rateBanco de México (Central Bank) established a goal for long-term inflation of 3.50%, which was considered for the valuation of the labor obligations. Salary increase rateBased on experience, salary increases have been observed to be presented on the basis of annual inflation, thus a nominal rate of 4.50% was maintained, the same as in 2013. Expected return of PAThe expected return rate on plan assets is consistent with the discount rate reported by the actuary and it was determined with the guidelines established in the most recent version of IAS 19.
