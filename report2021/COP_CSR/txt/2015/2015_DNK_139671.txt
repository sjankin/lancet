General human rights Our support We find it important to respect international human rights and we state our support of human rights in our CSR Policy. We also underline that we will strive to prevent any negative impact on human rights and remedy violations of human rights in case we are involved in such. We are geographically represented through our suppliers in countries where compliance with human rights is not a given. This situation constitutes a risk of negative impact on human rights. We want to work with our suppliers to continuously promote their respect of human rights. We have developed a Supplier Code of Conduct, which is the basis for dialogue with our suppliers and for monitoring their responsibility. Implementation We have distributed our CSR Policy to our employees and published it on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. In our Supplier Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to respect human rights. The management of our supply chain primarily focuses on our suppliers of tools, as our suppliers of materials are large reputable international companies that already in a detailed manner publish their efforts in the area of CSR. Progress No incidents of involvement in human rights violations or negative impact on human rights were reported in 2014. Once every 3 years we initiate a self-assessment screening process of our most significant suppliers of tools. The last screening took place in 2013. The suppliers reported on a number of indicators concerning human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption and we did not find any issues of concern3. 3 GRI G4 HR-10 SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 6 Working conditions Our support Without our employees SP Moulding A/S is nothing.

Increasing automation in our production by implementation of advanced robots at the injection moulding machines, new automatic assembly lines and robots in our department for mounting and printing needs more than just investment in equipment it needs of cause also investment in our employees. Advanced robots on injection moulding machines and assembly lines increase the needed skills of our employees. They have to handle more advanced machinery, complex working instructions, and more documentation and must always be adaptable for new and more advanced tasks. In the summer, SP Moulding started cooperation with two institutions of education in Horsens. The scope was improvement of skills such as: Reading and writing Danish, mathematics and use of computers. SP Moulding did an event (barbecue in the lunch break) in September, were consultants from the institutions told about the education they could provide. Then employees were offered screening in the skills Danish, mathematics and use of computer. The result of the screening was education of employees that would like to improve their skills in Danish and use of computer. Education is planned to be completed in year 2015. SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 12 Case: SP Moulding is a responsible employer a good place to work. Krystyna Katarzyna Jørgensen is working as operator at SP Moulding A/S in Juelsminde. In March 2013, Krystyna got an awful message from the doctors: “you have aggressive breast cancer”. Suddenly the situation turned for Krystyna and her family; from a normal life working at SP Moulding to survival against this terrible illness. What would the future bring? Krystyna went through surgery and further treatments to stop the breast cancer. In the beginning of spring, Krystyna was in progress and wanted to come back at work. Unfortunately, Krystyna could not manage the work as an operator in production, but she surely wanted to start working again and participate in the social community at SP Moulding. The municipality suggested her other jobs that did not require so much physical work, but it had no interest. Krystyna would like to go back to SP Moulding. As a responsible cooperate employer SP Moulding offered, that Krystyna could start as an operator. SP Moulding, Krystyna and the municipal made agreement of trainee from end of April 2014 to end of the year. Krystyna started working 3 hours 2 days a week, and from June she worked 3 hours 3 days each week. Krystyna and SP Moulding made an agreement of employment, so that from the 1st of January 2015 she works as an operator working 10 hours a week with alternated tasks in production that Krystyna can manage and give her quality in life. In January 2015 Krystyna were at one of her many medical checks after the surgery, and got the wonderful result: no more cancer. SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 13 LABOUR RIGHTS Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Our support We find it important to comply with international human rights and labour standards. In our CSR Policy, we state that we recognize our employees' right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. We also state that we denounce forced labour and child labour. As an international company, we respect differences in cultures and traditions and we value a diverse workforce. We will comply with national legislation on non-discrimination and promote equal opportunities at the work place. With regard to gender, non-discrimination and diversity our Board of Directors has decided that the target for the underrepresented sex in the Board should be minimum one member at the time of the General Assembly in 2017. On the next level of management (executive management and management) the target to be met before the end of 2017 for the underrepresented sex is 20 %. We are geographically represented through our suppliers in countries where compliance with human rights and labour rights is not a given. This situation constitutes a risk of negative impact on labour rights. We want to work with our suppliers to continuously promote their respect of labour rights. We have developed a Supplier Code of Conduct, which is the basis for dialogue with our suppliers and for monitoring their responsibility. Implementation We have distributed our CSR Policy to our employees and published it on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. In our Supplier Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to respect labour rights. SP Moulding is a member of the Confederation of Danish Industries (DI). In its capacity of employer’s association, DI is responsible for collective bargaining at the Danish level within our sector. Through our membership of DI and in our daily practice, we support the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and most of our employees are members of labour unions. SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 14 To comply with general discrimination rules, all employment-related decisions are based on relevant and objective criteria. We only recruit, appoint and promote employees on the basis of their qualifications and experience. To reach our target of having at least one female member in the Board of Management at the time of the General Assembly in 2017 and to meet our target of 20 % female managers at the next level of management, we have established a Policy on Equal Opportunity, supporting diversity and non-discrimination with regard to gender. Progress Once every 3 years we initiate a self-assessment screening process of our most significant suppliers of tools. The last screening of our most significant suppliers of tools took place in 2013 and we did not find any issues of concern with regard to labour rights10. We have not identified sites in Denmark, Poland or China or suppliers in which the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining have been at significant risk11 At the sites in Denmark, employees appoint representatives for joint consultation committees and working environment committees where they meet with local management. At the sites in Poland and China, systems have been established where the employees appoint spokesmen for negotiations with management12. In general, we do not hire children or young workers below 18 years of age and no claims of child labour were reported in 201413 We only have one business unit SP Moulding (Juelsminde) in Denmark – where we hire children above 13 years of age to help us with lighter work after school hours. In 2014, five children between 13 and 18 years of age worked for a maximum of 2 hours a day and we have special quality procedures for these children. Danish law only allows for lighter forms of labour for children above 13 years of age and SP Moulding obviously follows these strict legal requirements for employment of children in Denmark. All our employees are provided with an employment contract and no claims of forced labour were reported in 201414. Likewise no claims of discrimination were reported in 201415. 10 GRI G4 LA-14 11 GRI G4 HR-04 12 GRI G4 HR-04 13 GRI G4 HR-05 14 GRI G4 HR-06 15 GRI G4 HR-03 SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 15 When it comes to age and gender, we have a relatively diverse workforce: Composition of governance bodies and employment categories16 Male Female Total Board, Management / Executives 18 9 27 White collar employees 71 149 220 Blue collar employees 188 332 520 Total 277 490 767 Composition of governance bodies and employment categories17 Board, Management White collar Blue collar Total / Executives employees employees Age <30 1 22 160 183 Age 30-40 12 46 198 256 Age 40-50 2 38 122 162 Age 50-60 9 38 89 136 Age 60-70 1 8 17 26 Age> 70 2 2 4 Total 27 154 586 767 16 GRI G4 LA-12 17 GRI G4 LA-12 SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 16 ENVIRONMENT Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.

The aim for reduction of energy consumption was to decrease consumption of electricity and be liable to the environment. Therefore SP Moulding in Juelsminde has made an investment in a new heating system using heat pump. The heat pump is using the “energy” (warm) from the recycled “process-cooling water”. Calculated yearly saving in electricity consumption is about 242,200 kWh each year, which also gives a reduction in emission of greenhouse gases. Yearly saving with implementation of heat pump as “heat-system” is about 21.500 Euro. Case: Reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emission in Poland SP Moulding in Poland has built an installation, which is using warm air from carrier to heat our offices, canteen, changing rooms. Due to this, in 2014 SP Moulding has observed savings in oil consumption: in 2013 we used 9973 liters (355 GJ) of fuel oil and in 2014 we only used only 877 liters (31 GJ). SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 21 ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Our support We believe in responsible behaviour and that we must take a clear stand against corruption. We express it clearly in our CSR Policy that we do not participate in corruption or bribery. We will not offer, promise or give any kind of bribes to improperly influence public officials, judges or business associates. We also state that we will refrain from receiving or accepting any bribes ourselves and that persons acting on our behalf are subject to the obligation not to participate in corruption or bribery. We are obliged by legal obligations, including the UK Bribery Act, to work against corruption and facilitation payment. Corruption has a significant and negative societal impact especially in poor countries. Also a corruption-case may potentially cause prison sentences, large fines and reputational damage impacting our business sustainability and social license to operate. In our Supplier Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect anti-corruption principles. Implementation We have distributed our CSR Policy including our statement on corruption and bribery to our employees. We have started planning adequate procedures against corruption as well as formal training sessions on anti-corruption for core employees. China has a special focus, due to the higher risk potential in this part of the world. Our management makes detailed controls on all sites and all significant transactions are analysed by our management. As part of the audit of our companies, the auditors consider the risk of bribery and the measures taken by management to reduce this risk. In our Supplier Code of Conduct our suppliers and business partners are requested to respect principles of anti-corruption. As described under the Human Rights section for all new suppliers, the Supplier Code of Conduct constitutes a part of their co-operation agreement with us. In China, we have established a specific audit team of employees where 2-3 individuals regularly audit our suppliers to ensure that our Supplier Code of Conduct and statement on anti-corruption is respected and adhered to. Progress We have not received any administrative or judicial sanctions for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws. No claims or request for monetary sanction SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 22 for corruption and no legal corruption cases against any of our sites were reported in 201433. In 2014 we started a process communicating and training our employees in our anti-corruption policies and procedures. The program will be fully implemented in 201534. Once every 3 years we initiate a self-assessment screening process of our most significant suppliers of tools. The last screening of our most significant suppliers of tools took place in 2013 and we did not find any issues concerning corruption35. 33 GRI G4 SO-05 34 GRI G4 SO-04 35 GRI G4 SO-09 SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 23 GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE G4 CONTENT INDEX Category ASPECT Indicator and Description Page ECONOMIC ECONOMIC G4-EC01 DIRECT ECONOMIC VALUE 5 PERFORMANCE GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS G4-EN01 MATERIALS USED BY 18 + 19 WEIGHT OR VOLUME G4-EN02 PERCENTAGE OF MATERIALS 19 USED THAT ARE RECYCLED INPUT MATERIALS ENERGY G4-EN03 ENERGY CONSUMPTION 19 WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION G4-EN06 REDUCTION OF ENERGY 19 + 20 CONSUMPTION WATER G4-EN08 TOTAL WATER 20 WITHDRAWAL BY SOURCE EMISSIONS G4-EN15 DIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS 20 (GHG) EMISSIONS (SCOPE 1) G4-EN16 ENERGY INDIRECT 20 GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS (SCOPE 2) EFFLUENTS AND G4-EN23 TOTAL WEIGHT OF WASTE 20 WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSAL METHOD COMPLIANCE G4-EN29 MONETARY VALUE OF 18 SIGNIFICANT FINES AND TOTAL NUMBER OF NON-MONETARY SANCTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS SUPPLIER G4-EN32 PERCENTAGE OF NEW 18 ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPLIERS THAT WERE SCREENED ASSESSMENT USING ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA HUMAN RIGHTS NONG4-HR03 TOTAL NUMBER OF 15 DISCRIMINATION INCIDENTS OF DISCRIMINATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN FREEDOM OF G4-HR04 OPERATIONS AND SUPPLIERS 15 ASSOCIATION IDENTIFIED IN WHICH THE RIGHT TO AND COLLECTIVE EXERCISE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION BARGAINING AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING MAY BE VIOLATED OR AT SIGNIFICANT RISK, AND MEASURES TAKEN TO SUPPORT THESE RIGHTS SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 24 Category Aspect Indicator and Description Page HUMAN RIGHTS CHILD LABOR G4-HR05 OPERATIONS AND SUPPLIERS 15 IDENTIFIED AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR INCIDENTS OF CHILD LABOR, AND MEASURES TAKEN TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOR HUMAN RIGHTS FORCED OR G4-HR06 OPERATIONS AND SUPPLIERS 15 LABOR PRACTICES COMPULSORY IDENTIFIED AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT AND DECENT LABOR RISK FOR INCIDENTS OF FORCED OR WORK COMPULSORY LABOR, AND MEASURES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED OR COMPULSORY LABOR SUPPLIER G4-HR10 PERCENTAGE OF NEW 6 HUMAN RIGHTS SUPPLIERS THAT WERE SCREENED ASSESSMENT USING HUMAN RIGHTS CRITERIA EMPLOYMENT G4-LA01 TOTAL NUMBER AND RATES 8 OF NEW EMPLOYEE HIRES AND EMPLOYEE TURNOVER BY AGE GROUP, GENDER AND REGION OCCUPATIONAL G4-LA06 TYPE OF INJURY AND RATES 9 HEALTH AND OF INJURY, OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES, SAFETY LOST DAYS, AND ABSENTEEISM, AND TOTAL NUMBER OF WORK-RELATED FATALITIES, BY REGION AND BY GENDER TRAINING AND G4-LA09 AVERAGE HOURS OF 10 EDUCATION TRAINING PER YEAR PER EMPLOYEE BY GENDER, AND BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY TRAINING AND G4-LA10 PROGRAMS FOR SKILLS 10 EDUCATION MANAGEMENT AND LIFELONG Diversity and LEARNING THAT SUPPORT THE Equal Opportunity CONTINUED EMPLOYABILITY OF EMPLOYEES AND ASSIST THEM IN MANAGING CAREER ENDINGS G4-LA11 PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYEES 11 RECEIVING REGULAR PERFORMANCE AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT REVIEWS, BY GENDER AND BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY G4-LA12 COMPOSITION OF 16 GOVERNANCE BODIES AND BREAKDOWN OF EMPLOYEES PER EMPLOYEE CATEGORY ACCORDING TO GENDER, AGE GROUP, MINORITY GROUP MEMBERSHIP, AND OTHER INDICATORS OF DIVERSITY SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 25 Category ASPECT Indicator and Description Page LABOR PRACTICES SUPPLIER G4-LA14 PERCENTAGE OF NEW 15 AND DECENT ASSESSMENT FOR SUPPLIERS THAT WERE SCREENED WORK LABOR USING LABOR PRACTICES CRITERIA PRACTICES SOCIETY ANTIG4-SO04 COMMUNICATION AND 23 CORRUPTION TRAINING ON ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES G4-SO05 CONFIRMED INCIDENTS OF 23 CORRUPTION AND ACTIONS TAKEN COMPLIANCE G4-SO08 MONETARY VALUE OF 3 SIGNIFICANT FINES AND TOTAL NUMBER OF NON-MONETARY SANCTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS SUPPLIER G4-SO09 PERCENTAGE OF NEW 23 ASSESSMENT FOR SUPPLIERS THAT WERE SCREENED IMPACTS ON USING CRITERIA FOR IMPACTS ON SOCIETY SOCIETY SP Moulding A/S April 2015 Communication on Progress – 2014 Page 26
