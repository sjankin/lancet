This led us to reassess our recycling work done with cooperatives of urban waste materiality matrix and give this issue a higher level of recuperators and the commitment of Globers to separarelevance. We outlined a five-year action plan with the te our own waste doubled the amount of recycled mategoal of reducing energy consumption per capita in each rial, reaching two tons in six offices. We hope to replicate office. To do so, a Chief Security Officer was included at this program in other sites, such as La Plata and MonteviGlobant's Sustainability Council, who took over the deo, whose cities also have recycling material programs. development of this plan. The first stage of the project (to be undertaken during 2015) is linked to an exhaustive consumption survey. In 2014, an investment in localized energy meters was performed, and these devices were placed at the Head Office and in two other departments. Beyond this ambitious long-term project that will result in an environmental management system we continued to work on maximizing resources and recycling materials. In this regard, our main achievement was the more than 15% decrease in our energy consumption per capita, which is where we had the greatest environmental impact. In addition, server virtualization was maintained 30-1 even with a 35% increase of actual memory consumption. In addition, low-power data centers have reduced their gigabyte (Gb) consumption use by 15%. Finally, local data centers meeting ASHRAE standardsmaximize cooling and reduce expenditure. This allowed us to continue growing as a company, maintaining and even reducing our consumption ratios.
