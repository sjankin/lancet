CCVTs are provided at RR stations (often located remotely) for supplying electrical power to installed instrumentation and burn natural gas for its operation. It was decided to install Solar power system to replace CCVTs at RR or IP or SV stations in pipeline under Dibiyapur region in 2013-14. The total expenditure on Project was Rs. 98.30 Lacs. Solar PV plants (6 nos. of 10 kWp each) are expected to generate 86400 unit (kWh)/year of electricity which can save almost 1638 Tons of CO2equivalent /year with replacement of existing power source operated on natural gas fuel.
