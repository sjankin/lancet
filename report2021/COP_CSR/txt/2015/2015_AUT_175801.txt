Back to contents Introduction by the Page 4 Wienerberger AG Chief Executive Officer Sustainability Report 2014 Introduction by the Chief Executive Officer Ladies and Gentlemen, We design the infrastructure Wienerberger is a modern company that looks back to a history of almost 200 years. Over of the future the past five years, the company has evolved from a pure brick producer into a leading building materials supplier with worldwide operations. Our activities in the infrastructure sector have grown in scope and now include pipe systems supplied by Pipelife and Steinzeug-Keramo as well as pavers by Semmelrock. We have also expanded significantly in the roofing segment – most recently through the takeover of Tondach Gleinstätten. Thus, we are now in a position to offer modern and innovative building material and infrastructure solutions for the construction of healthy and energy-efficient buildings for residential and commercial purposes, as well as the design of modern infrastructure. Wienerberger operates The transformation of the Group from a supplier of building materials into a diversified worldwide infrastructure provider is also reflected in the internal development of the company. Today, we have a worldwide presence, with almost 14,000 employees working at 203 (2015) production sites in 30 countries. We have become more diverse, more international and more flexible. However, our fundamental values have remained the same – they include respect, integrity as well as transparency and sustainability. Wienerberger plan of action: In recent years, we have reported regularly with respect to our sustainability targets and Sustainability Roadmap 2020 our performance. We have achieved most of our targets, some of them even ahead of schedule. Other targets were revised or dropped within the framework of the materiality analysis performed with input from our stakeholders. Our new targets and the measures envisaged have been laid down in our Sustainability Roadmap 2020, which is being presented to the public for the first time in this report. The priority targets set in the Roadmap include the health and safety of our employees, energy efficiency and climate action, innovative products and business ethics. Focus on our employees The safety and satisfaction of our 14,000 employees are top priorities for us. For years, we have been making every effort to increase the standard of safety in our plants. However, despite our full commitment and the numerous initiatives taken to avoid accidents, two fatal accidents occurred in 2014. We deeply regret these accidents. We have further intensified our safety training measures. Moreover, we are continuing our efforts in the areas of health care. For example, monitoring of employees potentially exposed to respirable crystalline silica now covers a satisfactory 95.6% of our workforce. Our employees benefit from a broad range of training programs. In 2014, the number of hours of training per employee increased by 12.5% compared with the previous year. Innovation in response to the The requirements to be met by building materials and infrastructure solutions have challenges of the future changed profoundly in recent decades. There is high demand for innovative products in order to meet the challenges of the future: adjustment to climate change, efficient use of resources in an expanding urban space and, in particular, the provision of social housing. We saw these trends coming and focused on research and development at an early point in time. In 2014, innovative products accounted for almost 25% of Wienerberger’s total revenues. This is not only to Wienerberger’s own benefit, but also to the benefit of our customers and the environment. Our innovative infill bricks with thermal insulation material integrated into the clay block, for example, not only make the building envelope highly energy-efficient, but also help to reduce heating costs. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 5 Sustainability Report 2014 Heimo Scheuch, Chief Executive Officer of Wienerberger AG We want to take the lead in other areas as well. It is our goal to improve our performance Improving performance organically through operational excellence. Apart from the aspect of cost savings, we strive for with protection of the environment continuous improvements in all corporate processes and in our employees’ working conditions. In doing so, we never lose sight of environmental protection. Tailor-made internal programs are designed to introduce uniform production management standards, streamline organizational structures, optimize all technical processes, improve working conditions and raise safety standards. By the end of 2014, 45 brick production sites were participating in the Plant Improvement Program; by 2016, the program is to be rolled out to a total of 110 sites. Increasing energy efficiency in production is a particularly important topic in this context. Wienerberger concentrates, above all, on innovative process technologies, the use of waste heat, and product optimization. By 2020, we intend to reduce specific energy consumption and CO2 emissions from primary energy sources in brick production in Europe and at Pipelife by 20%, compared with 2010. So far, our track record is good. Pipelife has implemented the Group-wide “Energy Treasure Hunt” project in order to reduce energy and electricity consumption at individual production sites. The success achieved confirms the value of the project: Pipelife Poland alone was able to reduce its energy consumption by about 7% in 2014. As shown by numerous studies, a higher percentage of women in executive positions usuDiversity on the ally has a positive impact on the performance of a company. Having role models is particularly Supervisory Board important in this context. Therefore, I am happy to report that at the 146th annual general meeting on 22 May 2015 the shareholders of Wienerberger AG not only reelected Regina Prehofer as chairwoman of the Supervisory Board, but also elected another two women, Caroline Grégoire Sainte-Marie and Myriam Meyer, to serve on the top-level supervisory body of our company. As a result, three out of eight members of the Supervisory Board are women, corresponding to a ratio of 37.5%. We explicitly commit ourselves to the goal of further increasing the percentage of women at senior management level and in executive positions. To reach this target, we not only provide appropriate career development paths for our female employees, but also create an environment that facilitates the reconciliation of work and family obligations. We have therefore set ourselves the goal of increasing diversity and becoming an even more family-friendly company for all our employees, regardless of gender, by the end of 2015. When we signed the UN Global Compact in 2003, we officially acknowledged our responEndorsement of the ten sibility as a corporate citizen. We actively promote business ethics and see to it that the ten principles of the UN Global Compact principles of the UN Global Compact are consistently implemented throughout the Wienerberger Group. For further information on this topic, please refer to the UN Global Compact Communication on Progress and the GRI Content Table in this report as well as on our website. We will continue working intensively on the implementation of our goals in the future and I invite you to join us on this course.

Wienerberger is among the leading suppliers of both plastic pipes and ceramic pipes in Europe and of concrete pavers in Central and Eastern Europe. In India, clay blocks are produced by a relatively small local company reporting to the Holding & Others Division. The History of Wienerberger From an Austrian brick Wienerberger was founded in 1819 by Alois Miesbach in the Wienerberg district on the manufacturer … southern outskirts of Vienna. The Austrian brick manufacturer became one of the first companies to be listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange in 1869. Wienerberger is now a publicly traded company with a 100% free float of its shares. Details regarding the shareholder structure are outlined in the 2014 Annual Report. The company took its first step towards internationalization through the takeover of the Oltmanns Group in 1986, which was followed by a successful expansion into Eastern Europe, France and the Benelux countries during the 1990s. The establishment of Pipelife (plastic pipes) as a joint venture and the development of the Group’s ceramic pipe and concrete paver activities also occurred during these years. … to a global player … After a further period of expansion in Europe, the Wienerberger Group developed into a global player with the takeover of General Shale in the USA in 1999. Another strategic milestone was set in 2003 with the Group’s entry into the roofing systems market through the acquisition of Koramic and the steady expansion of this business in the following years. … and an international With the full takeover of Semmelrock (2010), Steinzeug-Keramo (2011), Pipelife (2012) supplier of building material and the clay roof tile producer Tondach Gleinstätten in 2014, Wienerberger completed its and infrastructure solutions transformation into an international supplier of building material and infrastructure solutions comprising the Divisions Clay Building Materials Europe and Pipes & Pavers Europe.

These include acquisitions, capacity extensions and the exploration of new product segments or regional markets. Strategic resource allocation is based on clearly defined decision-making processes and subject to strictly observed yield targets, the objective being to ensure that growth steps directly contribute to the achievement of the Group-wide CFROI target of 11.5%. Given that we already have a modern and comprehensive network of production sites, sufficient capacity reserves and strong market positions in the ceramics business, acquisitions in the plastic pipe business are of particular interest on account of this segment’s sustainable growth potential and the lower capital intensity. The acquisitions of Pipelife (plastic pipes), Tondach Gleinstätten (clay roof tiles, which are also strongly used in renovation) and Steinzeug-Keramo (ceramic pipes) testify to the consistent implementation of our strategic goals. Through these growth steps, we have strengthened our position as an international provider of building material and infrastructure solutions and reduced our dependence on the cyclically sensitive sector of new residential construction from 70% to about 60% of our revenues. In 2014, the three new business units generated a CFROI of well above 11.5%. Corporate Governance at Wienerberger Implementation of Strict principles of good governance and transparency as well as the continuous developstrict principles of good ment of an efficient corporate control system form the basis of corporate governance at corporate governance and Wienerberger. In 2002, we were one of the first companies to commit to the Austrian Corpotransparency rate Governance Code, a voluntary framework for corporate management and control that goes beyond the legal requirements. Wienerberger complied with all rules and recommendations of the Code in 2014. Moreover, a compliance code to prevent insider trading and a code of conduct for lobbying activities provide a framework for all the Group’s operations. For a detailed presentation of activities relating to corporate governance at Wienerberger in the year under review, please refer to the 2014 Annual Report. Our corporate governance principles are communicated in detail on the Wienerberger website. The Year 2014 in Review Significant improvement In 2014, the development of residential construction in Europe was stable to slightly poof brick business results sitive, but characterized by major regional and seasonal differences. Despite a significant slowand stable development of down of activities in some European core markets, Wienerberger reported substantial increases European pipe business in revenues and results thanks to volume growth in all product groups and the improvement of average prices. In the European pipe business, better results at Steinzeug-Keramo and Semmelrock compensated for a slight decline at Pipelife, the latter largely due to fewer orders received for international project business, compared with the record year of 2013. In North America, lower prices in the brick business on an annual average as well as negative changes in the product mix in the plastic pipe business were reflected in a slight decrease in results. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 11 Wienerberger at a Glance Sustainability Report 2014 The Year 2014 in Review In this market environment, Wienerberger generated record revenues of € 2,834.5 million Record revenues and and an operating EBITDA of € 317.2 million. Besides substantial organic growth, the Tondach a strong operating performance in 2014 Gleinstätten Group, which has been fully consolidated since 1 July 2014, and the completion of the cost-cutting program were the main factors contributing to the improved results. The value-creating takeover of Tondach Gleinstätten represents an important growth step for Wienerberger in the clay roof tile segment, which will allow the company to benefit from the above-average growth potential in Eastern Europe. Non-cash impairment charges in the amount of € 207.6 million prevented the Group from returning to the profit zone. The after-tax loss for the year in the amount of € 170.0 million was booked against a steep increase of 41% in the free cash flow to € 130.6 million. This resulted in an improvement of the net debt to EBITDA ratio to 1.9 years, which we regard as yet another confirmation of the strength of our business model. In 2015, the Managing Board therefore proposed to the annual general meeting that a dividend of € 0.15 per share is paid out, an increase of 25% compared with the previous year. The company’s equity totaled € 2,046.8 million in 2014; its net debt amounted to € 621.5 million. The average number of employees of the Wienerberger Group in 2014 amounted to Headcount increase mainly 14,836, up by 8% from 2013. The increase was mainly due to the takeover of the remaining due to takeover of Tondach Gleinstätten shares in the Tondach Gleinstätten Group in July 2014. Excluding the employees of Tondach Gleinstätten, Wienerberger’s average headcount in 2014 was 13,930, 1% higher than in the previous year. Due to the fact that the sustainability data gathering processes have not yet been fully implemented at Tondach Gleinstätten, the sustainability parameters of Tondach Gleinstätten have not been integrated into this Sustainability Report. In 2014 a dividend of € 0.12 per share, corresponding to a total of € 13.8 million, was paid out from the Group’s 2013 net profit. In September 2014, Wienerberger successfully completed the exchange of € 272 million of the hybrid bond 2007 into a new hybrid bond 2014. The hybrid coupon paid out during the year includes not only the annual coupon of € 32.5 million, but also the prepaid coupon of the hybrid bonds exchanged in the amount of € 11.6 million. Payments to public bodies, comprising taxes on income and other taxes (excluding deferred taxes), rose to € 40.5 million due to the improvement in earnings and the resulting increase of the tax burden in 2014.

The principles relating to the individual fields are described in the chapters on employees, production, products and corporate social responsibility. The Materiality Analysis 2014 and the Wienerberger Sustainability Roadmap 2020 Material sustainability issues For many years, Wienerberger has submitted clear, transparent and informative reports result in a new sustainability on its sustainability performance. Wienerberger’s sustainability reports have always met the strategy standard of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The revised guidelines according to GRI G4 require that the reporting companies focus particularly on topics of material importance for the organization and its stakeholders. In 2014 Wienerberger performed a materiality analysis involving the company’s stakeholders. The process of identifying the issues and/or aspects to be covered, the involvement of the stakeholders in this process, and the selection of relevant aspects meet the requirements of GRI G4 Core. Thus, this Sustainability Report meets the GRI G4 standard. The materiality analysis project was completed in April 2015. Already at the end of 2014, first results provided input for the Wienerberger sustainability strategy and the Sustainability Roadmap 2020, i.e. the new Wienerberger sustainability program.

Impact of the company’s The impact of the company’s activities on the entire value chain is taken into consideration, activities on the entire value chain ranging from raw material extraction to the entire supply chain, the production and use of products, and finally to the product’s transformation into waste at the end of its service life. The limits to the scope of the analysis are to be determined separately for each essential aspect, depending on the impact of the company’s activities along the value chain. Wienerberger’s corporate structure is based on business units, which focus on different Four Business Units – products and operate along the following fundamental value chains: Four value chains • Bricks: Clay blocks, facing bricks, clay roof tiles and clay pavers (Clay Building Materials Europe, General Shale within the North America Division) • Concrete pavers and concrete wall cladding products (Semmelrock, Arriscraft within the North America Division) • Ceramic pipes (Steinzeug-Keramo) • Plastic pipes (Pipelife, including Pipelife production site within the North America Division) Back to contents Wienerberger’s Sustainability Page 14 Wienerberger AG Management Sustainability Report 2014 The Materiality Analysis 2014 and the Wienerberger Sustainability Roadmap 2020 Step 2: Establishment of materiality from the stakeholder point of view Material aspects To establish the materiality of the individual steps of the value chain, potential ecological, of the value chains social, ethical, regional and economical issues as well as security of supply issues were allocated to them. Subsequently, the stakeholders’ view of materiality was established by means of a survey. Some of the questions of the survey also referred to the perception of Wienerberger’s current commitment in respect of the individual aspects. Almost 500 stakeholders Close to 500 stakeholders were invited to take part in the survey – 80% of them external invited to take part in the stakeholders. Among them were many customers and users, such as building material dealers, survey, 80% of them external building contractors, architects and landscape designers, real-estate developers and final custostakeholders mers, as well as suppliers, representatives of public authorities, the research sector and academia. Media representatives, policy-makers, trade unionists, shareholders and analysts were also invited to take part in the survey. Among the internal stakeholders – almost 100 in total – management representatives accounted for the largest group, followed by representatives of production, the works council, sales and human resources. Employees working in controlling, marketing, communication and research and development were also contacted. Online survey with The stakeholders selected received an online questionnaire in which they were asked to excellent return rate classify the Wienerberger sustainability issues by materiality and Wienerberger’s existing commitment. A total of 232 persons responded to the online survey, which corresponds to a return rate of well above 45% an excellent value for a survey of this type. Stakeholders acknowledge The evaluation of the results covered the materiality of the issue for Wienerberger and Wienerberger’s commitment Wienerberger’s perceived commitment to that specific issue. A strong and consistent correlation in many areas between these two aspects was found: Both internal and external stakeholders acknowledged that Wienerberger had already been working intensively on those sustainability issues which they regarded as particularly important, and had reached a high level of development. Materiality analyses for all Based on the stakeholders’ responses, the essential issues for the four business units (Clay product-group-specific value Building Materials Europe, Semmelrock, Steinzeug-Keramo and Pipelife) along their respecchains tive value chains were established. The significance (medium to high) of individual aspects, as perceived by internal and external stakeholders, was entered into a matrix. The essential issues of the four value chains are described on the following pages. It turned out that the stakeholders perceived certain aspects as being of similarly high significance across all business units. In the supply chain, the avoidance of hazardous substances and long-term security of raw material supply were mentioned frequently as material aspects. As regards environmental protection in production, the stakeholders ranked energy efficiency and measures to combat climate change, as well as resource efficiency and waste management, as high priorities. Among the social aspects of production, the safety and health of employees, business ethics and compliance scored high in all business units. Throughout the Wienerberger Group, the sustainability of products was found to be determined, in particular, by their long service life and their innovative strength.

The description applies to the Clay Building Materials Europe business unit and relevant products of General Shale within the North America Division. VALUE CHAIN: CLAY BRICKS AND ROOF TILES 1 2 3 SUPPLY CHAIN / RAW MATERIALS PRODUCTION PERIOD OF USE AND END-OF-LIFE Energy: Water Natural Gas Re-use Coal Electricity Production process: Delivery/Storage Landfill (debris) Clay – Facing bricks Mixing – Clay blocks Shaping Recovery (packaging Admixtures and additives: – Roof tiles Drying material) Sand, grit, gravel Processing Materials such as Glazing Re-use (scrap) pulp, saw dust, Firing polystyrene Packaging Recirculation to Infill material production process Pigments, glazing Packaging material Production Waste water waste Emissions Raw materials + Waste (not energy for production recyclable) Sustainability in the supply chain and in raw material sourcing Clay and loam are the most important raw materials for brick production. They are either extracted in Wienerberger’s own clay pits or obtained from suppliers. Numerous issues relating to safety and protection arise in the operation of an extraction site. Besides ensuring the safety and health of employees, minimizing noise and dust pollution for local residents is another important aspect. Raw material extraction always constitutes an interference with nature, which is kept as low as possible during operation. Depleted extraction sites have to be re-cultivated, renaturalized or re-used for other purposes. The availability of adequate regional extraction sites is very important for a long-term supply strategy. To obtain the desired product quality, aggregates, such as sand, grit and gravel, as well as additives, such as straw, paper fibers or polystyrene, are added to the base material for the production of clay blocks. Some types of clay blocks are filled with mineral wool or perlite to increase their thermal insulation capacity. For facing bricks various production methods lead to a large range of colors, surface textures and shapes. Special texturing, for example, can be created through sanding, milling, engobing, glazing or brushing. Roof tiles are glazed or engobed to prolong their service life and/or to obtain a variety of surface finishes. The materials used should be free of hazardous substances. Renewable or mineral-based fillers, such as mineral wool or perlite, have ecological advantages. Organic and Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 19 Wienerberger’s Sustainability Sustainability Report 2014 Management The Value Chain: Clay Bricks and Roof Tiles carbonaceous components in clay (e.g. bitumen) and in additives result in the release of climate-relevant CO2 emissions to the atmosphere during production. While this can hardly be avoided in clay and loam, CO2 emissions from additives and fillers can be reduced through the use of biogenic substances that are considered to be climate-neutral. Environmental aspects in production Energy consumption for the energy-intensive processes in ceramic brick production, such as firing and drying, is a major environmental aspect. Climate-relevant emissions are generated either in the production plant itself or by the (remote) electricity generating plant. Emissions can be reduced, above all, through an increase in energy efficiency in the brick plant. At the same time, the use of renewable sources of energy contributes towards reducing CO2 emissions. Direct climate-relevant emissions also have an impact on costs, as ceramic production is subject to the European CO2 emissions trading system (ETS). Resource efficiency is defined as the sparing use of natural resources, such as raw materials or environmental goods. Efforts are made in the production process to avoid scrap and breakage, and most of the remaining production waste is recycled internally. Water consumption in ceramic production can be further reduced through efficiency measures and the introduction of closed-cycle systems. Social aspects in production The safety and health of employees as well as business ethics and compliance are important social aspects in production. Protecting employees from exposure to respirable crystalline silica, a substance released primarily during brick grinding and cutting, is a major health issue in the brick segment. Technical and organizational measures as well as the use of personal protective equipment help to reduce the exposure of employees to this hazard. Dust monitoring, health checks and training programs also serve to reduce exposure and, thus, diminish the risk of disease. These and other aspects are described in the chapters “Employees” and “Social Responsibility”. Sustainability in period of use and at end-of-life Bricks are durable and strong. They offer protection in the event of fire, earthquakes or floods. During their service life, bricks provide thermal insulation and thereby help to reduce the energy consumption of buildings, which in turn results in lower CO2 emissions. Moreover, the energy efficiency of buildings can be optimized through smart building concepts. Clay blocks contribute towards a healthy indoor climate and ensure good indoor air quality. Facing bricks and roof tiles are essential elements determining the appearance of a building; they are weather-proof, require little care and are easy to clean. In many regions, brick façades, pitched brick roofs or brick pavings are part of the cultural heritage. There is also a growing interest in the re-use of historical bricks. When buildings are demolished, ceramic material can be separated from other building debris and re-used. Wienerberger has little influence on the erection and demolition of buildings. Thorough planning of the construction process helps to avoid scrap and reduces the amount of products to be returned. The use of recycled raw materials from construction debris in brick production is technically feasible, but an economic balance cannot yet be drawn up. Nevertheless, with a view to “urban mining”, Wienerberger always keeps the recyclability of its brick products in mind. Back to contents Wienerberger’s Sustainability Page 20 Wienerberger AG Management Sustainability Report 2014 The Materiality Analysis: Clay Bricks and Roof Tiles The Materiality Analysis: Clay Bricks and Roof Tiles Segment Previous targets in the Clay Bricks and Roof Tiles Segment Even before the materiality analysis performed in 2014, Wienerberger had set quantitative sustainability targets for brick production. CMBE had set itself the goal of reducing specific energy consumption and the volume of specific CO2 emissions by 20% each by 2020, compared with 2010. In clay block production the energy consumption target was already reached in 2014 (-21%); in roof tile production we are on track (-6%); in facing brick production an improvement has been achieved over the previous year’s level, but there have been no efficiency gains yet compared with 2010 (0%). As regards specific CO2 emissions, savings of between 2% and 8% were achieved in all three product groups in 2014 compared with 2013. The Group-wide target of reducing the amount of water drawn from public networks to 40% of total water consumption was reached ahead of schedule. As regards the safety and health of our employees, the target of reducing the frequency of accidents has been pursued consistently. Nevertheless, a slight increase in accident frequency was reported in 2014, compared with 2013. The corrective measures taken are described in the chapter “Employees”. The percentage of potentially exposed employees covered by dust exposure monitoring has been increased to 95.6%; the percentage of employees receiving training has gone up to 93.8%. Moreover, additional technical and organizational measures have been taken to reduce the generation and release of respirable crystalline silica in an effort to protect our employees even more effectively against this hazard. Material sustainability issues for the Clay Bricks and Roof Tiles Segment “Avoidance of hazardous substances”, “Security of supply” and the “Protection of local residents and employees at extraction sites” were classified as material issues in raw material sourcing. As regards environmental protection in production, the main focus was on energy efficiency and climate protection. Specific water consumption was not perceived to be a material issue. Employee issues – with few exceptions – were generally regarded as matters of high priority. The results of the materiality analysis have been translated into the Sustainability Roadmap. The aspects “long service life and long-term value” and “safety and health impact of buildings” were classified as material. However, given the fact that these are core qualities of brick products, no specific targets were set for the Roadmap. Clay blocks and facing bricks are an essential innovation driver for the energy efficiency of buildings. Therefore, the issue “energy efficiency of buildings” is an integral part of the target of increasing the share of innovative products in total revenues. Maintaining good relations with local stakeholders is one of the tasks of the operational management at production sites; training of employees is covered by human resources management; therefore, specific targets for these issues have not been set in the Sustainability Roadmap 2020.

The statements made apply to the Steinzeug-Keramo business unit. VALUE CHAIN: CERAMIC PIPES 1 2 3 SUPPLY CHAIN / RAW MATERIALS PRODUCTION PERIOD OF USE AND END-OF-LIFE Energy: Water Natural Gas Electricity Recycling Production process: Ceramic pipes for waste Recovery material water disposal (packaging material) Delivery/Storage Clay Mixing Re-use (scrap) Shaping Admixtures and Drying additives: Glazing Refractories Firing Stone meal, etc. Packaging Glazing Production Waste water Packaging material waste Emissions Waste (not Raw materials + energy recyclable) for production Sustainability in the supply chain and in raw material sourcing Ceramic pipes, like bricks, are made of clay, which Steinzeug-Keramo obtains from its own clay pit and from suppliers. Aggregates and additives are added to the base material in order to obtain the optimal material mix. The sustainability issues arising in the supply chain for ceramic pipes are similar to those of the brick segment. They include the security of regional clay supply, nature conservation and re-use concepts for depleted sites, protection of local residents from noise and dust, and ensuring the safety and health of employees; organic and carbonaceous components in the clay resulting in CO2 emissions in the downstream production process; and the avoidance of hazardous substances in aggregates and additives and in glazing material. Steinzeug-Keramo uses recycling material from its own plants and secondary raw materials from external sources in its production. All production plants recycle their internal ceramic waste and use recycled refractory material. Environmental aspects in production Ceramic pipes are first shaped, then dried, glazed (in an immersion bath) and fired. These processes are based on the use of energy from renewable sources and from natural gas. Given the CO2 emissions thus generated, Steinzeug-Keramo plants are subject to the European emissions trading system. The volume of CO2 emissions can be reduced through a further increase in the use of energy from renewable sources and further efficiency increases. Electricity demand can also be met from renewable sources. Raw material consumption can be reduced by minimizing scrap, recycling own ceramic waste, and designing products with a view to a sparing use of Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 23 Wienerberger’s Sustainability Sustainability Report 2014 Management The Value Chain: Ceramic Pipes resources. Steinzeug-Keramo minimizes the consumption of raw materials by re-introducing all production waste into the production cycle. Water consumption in production can be lowered by means of close-cycle systems. Social aspects in production As in the brick segment, protecting employees against respirable crystalline silica is a major issue in the production of ceramic pipes as well. Other issues, such as safety and health of employees, business ethics and compliance, rank at a similar level of relevance for the entire Wienerberger Group and are described in the chapters “Employees” and “Social Responsibility”. Sustainability in period of use and at end-of-life A long service life and high resistance are the technical requirements to be met by ceramic sewage pipes. Steinzeug-Keramo products are characterized, above all, by high abrasion resistance, bending tensile strength, frost resistance and high resistance against biological and chemical influences. Sewage pipes should require little maintenance and be easy to repair. Products by Steinzeug-Keramo meet these requirements on account of their sturdiness and their vitrified surface. Their high-quality design ensures a long service life and helps to avoid repairs. Steinzeug-Keramo supports planning engineers and contractors through expert advice, online tools and visits to construction sites. The range of innovative pipe products includes pipes certified by environmental product declarations and climate-neutral products. Accessories, such as talcum, lubricants, twocomponent adhesives, flanges and seals should not contain any potentially harmful chemical substances. Easy and complete recyclability at the end of the product’s service life is another property to be mentioned in this context. Products should be easy to separate from other construction debris in order to be recycled into the production process or to be re-used for other purposes. Waste water solutions for developing countries or heat recovery from waste water are potential issues for the future. Back to contents Wienerberger’s Sustainability Page 24 Wienerberger AG Management Sustainability Report 2014 The Materiality Analysis: Ceramic Pipes The Materiality Analysis: Ceramic Pipes Segment Previous targets in the Ceramic Pipes Segment The materiality analysis has shown that our stakeholders regard energy efficiency, climate protection and the safety and health of our employees as priority issues in the ceramic pipe segment. Steinzeug-Keramo was following the targets to reduce its specific energy consumption (reference year: 2010) and its specific CO2 emissions (reference year: 2013) by 20% each by 2020. While energy consumption was down by 14% already in 2014, specific CO2 emissions from fuel remained unchanged. The Group-wide target of reducing the amount of water drawn from public networks to 40% of total water consumption was reached ahead of schedule. As regards “Social aspects in production”, the main focus was on the safety and health of employees. Regrettably, the accident rate in 2014 was significantly higher than in 2013. Consistent measures were therefore taken to reduce the frequency of accidents. With a view to improved health protection for our employees, respirable crystalline silica measurements were rolled out to additional plants step by step. Material sustainability issues for the Ceramic Pipes Segment From the stakeholders’ point of view, “Avoidance of hazardous substances” and “Security of supply” are priority issues in raw material sourcing, as in the brick segment. “Nature conservation and the re-use of extraction sites” are other important aspects. Priority issues in production are energy efficiency and climate protection, as in the brick segment. Additionally, “Resource efficiency and waste management” were classified as essential. Employee issues were generally regarded as priorities. Products should be durable, recyclable and innovative; transport to the customer should be environment-friendly. Waste water solutions for developing countries were identified as yet another issue. The results of the materiality analysis have been translated into the Sustainability Roadmap. A long service life and long-term value – two aspects ranked as very important in the analysis – are core qualities of ceramic pipes; therefore, no specific target has been set in the Sustainability Roadmap. Environment-friendly transport is an integral part of efficient logistics and, therefore, has not been considered as a separate issue in the Sustainability Roadmap. Employee development and training are covered by human resources management, with the establishment of the “Steinzeug-Keramo Academy” being particularly noteworthy in this context. Considering the interests of local stakeholders is a matter for production site management.

VALUE CHAIN: PLASTIC PIPES 1 2 3 SUPPLY CHAIN / RAW MATERIALS PRODUCTION PERIOD OF USE AND END-OF-LIFE Energy: Water Plastic pipes for the public Electricity infrastructure: Natural Gas Sewage pipes Drinking water supply Additives and Production process: Cable ducting admixtures (talcum, Preparation of input Gas pipes glass fibres…) materials Landfill Extruding Plastic pipes in Energy recovery Mineral oil extraction Injection molding agriculture/green spaces: and processing Processing Drainage and rain water Recycling Packaging Irrigation Plastics Plastic pipes for buildings: Discharge pipes Heating systems Secondary plastics Cold and hot water Production Waste water Electric installations waste Emissions Alternative energy Waste (not Residential ventilation recyclable) Sustainability in the supply chain and in raw material sourcing Pipelife pipes and fittings are made primarily of mineral-oil-based PVC powder and polyolefin granulates. Relevant sustainability aspects include environmental protection and the respect of human rights in oil extraction as well as energy efficiency and climate protection in oil processing. The plastic materials obtained from suppliers (PVC, PP and PE) should be free of potentially hazardous substances. These issues are covered by legislation, i.e. REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization und Restriction of Chemicals) applicable within the EU and TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act) applicable in the USA. Recycled plastic materials can be used for the production of numerous Pipelife products, provided all requirements in terms of product quality and product properties as well as the relevant standards are met. The use of recycled plastic materials is one way of improving the ecological aspects of the value chain for Pipelife products. Environmental aspects in production The most important form of energy used in the production of plastic pipes and fittings is electricity. The primary focus, therefore, is on energy efficiency. Using electricity from renewable sources helps to reduce indirect CO2 emissions. As hardly any direct CO2 emissions are generated in production, Pipelife is not subject to the European CO2 emissions trading Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 27 Wienerberger Wienerberger’s AG Sustainability Sustainability Report 2014 Sustainability Management Report 2014 The Value Chain: Plastic Pipes system. The consumption of water from public networks for cooling purposes is very low. Larger quantities are drawn from wells or bodies of surface water, which are subsequently discharged into the environment, free of pollution and therefore do not count as water consumed. The consumption of resources can be reduced through product design and by reducing scrap and waste to a minimum. Social aspects in production As in the other Divisions, safety and health of employees as well as business ethics and compliance are important social aspects in production. These and other aspects are described in the chapters “Employees” and “Social Responsibility”. Sustainability in period of use and at end-of-life Sustainability aspects during the products’ service life are as varied as the Pipelife product range. There is, however, a common denominator: high product quality, which is crucial for a long service life and the avoidance of leakages, and the innovative strength of new products. Public infrastructure is a sector with high demand for such products. As a consequence of climate change, weather conditions are becoming more extreme in many parts of the world. Heavy flooding occurs more frequently, and public sewer networks and water management systems are no longer able to cope with excessive quantities of rain water. Pipelife offers solutions for heavy rain events. Rain water can be efficiently captured even on smaller surfaces, stored and re-used. Water retained for subsequent re-use should be as clean as possible. Pipelife’s advanced filtering and cleaning systems include heavy-metal and oil separators. Moreover, Pipelife offers solutions for small-scale water treatment plants for decentralized applications. Technologies of this type are well-suited for use in developing countries. Plastic pipes contribute to the sustainable management of green spaces in a variety of ways. Irrigation systems serve to increase agricultural output for a growing world population and ensure a more efficient use of scarce water resources. Drainage systems prevent landslides caused by heavy rain. Plastic pipes installed in buildings have a beneficial climate effect, as heat losses can be minimized through insulated heating and hot-water pipes. Geothermal and solar collectors made of plastic pipes open up renewable or alternative sources of energy. Moreover, special plastic pipes for electric installations offer improved protection from electro-magnetic fields. Ease of assembly is an important consideration for Pipelife. Thanks to a design effort aimed at reducing product weight while maintaining product quality and safety, Pipelife products are easy to install. Plastic pipes can be re-used at the end of their life cycle. Pipelife is for example a member of the Austrian Working Group on Plastic Pipe Recycling (ÖAKR), which operates a collection system for end-of-life pipes, fittings and pipe scrap left over after installation throughout Austria. Pipelife uses recycled material from used PVC pipes for the production of cable ductings. Modern waste management aims at a high recycling rate, efficient heat recovery and the avoidance of landfilling. Pipelife does not operate in markets in which inadequate disposal practices, such as irregular incineration of PVC-containing plastic pipes, are common. Back to contents Wienerberger’s Sustainability Page 28 Wienerberger AG Management Sustainability Report 2014 The Materiality Analysis: Plastic Pipes The Materiality Analysis: Plastic Pipes Segment Previous targets in the Plastic Pipes Segment The Group-wide target of reducing the amount of water drawn from public networks to 40% of total consumption was reached ahead of schedule. Among the “Social aspects in production”, the main focus was on the safety and health of employees. In this respect, the target of reducing the frequency of accidents was pursued consistently. Nevertheless, an increase in accident frequency over the previous year’s level was observed in 2014. Measures aimed at reducing accident frequency are being pursued consistently. Material sustainability issues for the Plastic Pipes Segment From the stakeholders’ point of view, the avoidance of hazardous substances and the use of recycled plastic materials are material supply chain issues. In production, energy and resource efficiency as well as sustainability-oriented waste management have been identified as essential topics. As regards Pipelife’s employees, health and safety, ethical behavior, employee satisfaction and employee involvement have been identified as priority issues. The essential product issues are a long service life, the avoidance of leakages and innovative strength. Solutions for periods of drought and heavy rain events as well as sustainable energy systems for buildings have been emphasized as future issues. The results of the materiality analysis have been translated into the Sustainability Roadmap 2020. The issue “Long service life and avoidance of leakages” was given a high score in the materiality analysis. However, these being core product qualities that are subject to continuous improvement, no specific target has been set. As regards the aspect “Sewage systems: solutions for periods of drought and for heavy rain events”, Pipelife’s Raineo® system is already available and successfully marketed (see chapter “Products” – paragraph on “Energy efficiency and climate action”). The issue will be further pursued within the framework of research and development of innovative products. Resource efficiency and waste management are being continuously optimized through measures taken at the production sites.

VALUE CHAIN: CONCRETE PAVERS 1 2 3 SUPPLY CHAIN / RAW MATERIALS PRODUCTION PERIOD OF USE AND END-OF-LIFE Limestone Energy: Water Natural Gas Coal Re-use Electricity Cement Production process: Landfill (debris) Pavers and slabs Additives: Delivery/Storage Mixing Walls and fences Recovery Sand Shaping Steps, edging stones, (packaging material) Grit Gravel Processing design elements… Re-use (breakage) Drying Admixtures: Packaging Recirculation to Pigments production process Plasticizers Hydrophobing agents Packaging Production Waste water material waste Emissions Equipment (paver joints, Waste (not adhesive mortar, joint sand...) Raw materials + energy recyclable) for production Sustainability in the supply chain and in raw material sourcing Concrete pavers consist primarily of sand, grit, gravel and cement; the essential raw materials for cement production are limestone and clay and/or marl. The main focus in the extraction of these mineral raw materials is on the safety and health of employees, the protection of local residents against noise and dust pollution, the protection of the natural environment and the re-use of depleted extraction sites. The production of cement is a highly energy-intensive process requiring firing temperatures of about 1,450 °C. High-calorific fuels, such as coal and fuel oil, are used to reach such high temperatures. To a growing extent, however, these are being replaced by other fuels of fossil origin, such as used tires, processed plastic materials and waste oil. Over the entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, cement production accounts for a major part of the CO2 emissions caused by Semmelrock’s concrete products. The use of recycled concrete helps to minimize the carbon footprint and, at the same time, diminishes the burden on extraction sites. The fact that heavy-weight aggregates, such as sand, grit and gravel, are transported only over short distances helps to minimize transport-related CO2 emissions. Therefore, the availability of sufficient extraction sites in the vicinity of production plants is essential. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 31 Wienerberger’s Sustainability Sustainability Report 2014 Management The Value Chain: Concrete Pavers Environmental aspects in production Compared with other processes within the Wienerberger Group, concrete paver production consumes relatively little energy. In the process of drying concrete products, thermal energy is even released and can be recovered. The use of renewable sources of energy helps to reduce direct CO2 emissions. Raw material efficiency can be increased through the avoidance of breakage and scrap and the re-introduction of production waste into the production process. Intelligent product design results in raw material savings and, at the same time, maintains a high level of product quality. Water, an important raw material for cement-bound products, is drawn mainly from the company’s own wells. Water consumption is reduced through various efficiency-enhancing measures or through closed-cycle systems. As regards packaging material, the main focus is on avoidance, the use of ecologically safe materials and recovery within the framework of sustainable construction site management. Social aspects in production The main issues relating to social responsibility in production in this business unit, as well as in all others, are the safety and health of employees, business ethics and compliance. Additional aspects are described in the chapters “Employees” and “Social Responsibility”. Sustainability in period of use and at end-of-life In the case of concrete pavers, sustainability means a long service life, a high level of resistance, easy repairs and easy cleaning. These requirements are met through high quality, a protective surface finish and the possibility of exchanging individual pavers even after the finishing layer has been applied. The products should help to prevent user accidents. For pedestrians, Semmelrock products should be slip-proof. Solutions for people with special needs, such as guiding systems for the blind, are possible. Semmelrock pavers and slabs have a soilsealing effect and an influence on acoustics and on the micro-climate. Soil sealing can be reduced by making the products water-permeable. Negative acoustic effects, such as road traffic noise and echo effects in an urban environment, can be reduced through appropriate product design. Climate change results in higher summer temperatures in towns. Concrete surfaces tend to store heat and contribute to this effect. These aspects represent considerable challenges to be addressed through product innovation. Near-natural materials should also be used for accessories, such as paver joints, adhesive mortar or joint sand stabilizers. For design elements, such as pavers with integrated LED lighting, relevant eco-design principles apply. Semmelrock has hardly any influence on the construction and demolition phase in the life cycle of its products. During demolition, care should be taken that concrete is properly separated from other materials and free of contamination. If these requirements are met, re-use as subgrade material in road construction is possible. Fine-grained, processed recycling concrete can also be used as a secondary raw material for new concrete products. However, maintaining the desired level of product quality is a considerable challenge. For the time being, the amounts of recycled material from construction debris re-introduced into the Semmelrock production process are insignificant. Back to contents Wienerberger’s Sustainability Page 32 Wienerberger AG Management Sustainability Report 2014 The Materiality Analysis: Concrete Pavers The Materiality Analysis: Concrete Pavers Segment Previous targets for the Concrete Pavers Segment The Group-wide target of reducing the amount of water drawn from public networks to 40% of total water consumption was reached ahead of schedule. Among employee issues, the main focus was on safety and health. In this respect, the target of reducing the frequency of accidents was pursued consistently. Compared with the year before, accident frequency dropped significantly in 2014. Material sustainability issues for the Concrete Pavers Segment Material sustainability issues in the supply chain include security of supply, nature conservation at and around extraction sites, and the use of recycled concrete. As regards environmental protection in production, the main focus is on resource efficiency and waste management as well as water conservation. Safety and health are perceived as priority issues for human resources. A long service life and innovative strength are classified as product priorities. At the same time, sustainable transport, recyclability, the avoidance of accidents and help for people with special needs score high on the stakeholders’ list of priorities. The results of the materiality analysis have been translated into the Sustainability Roadmap 2020. The “Long service life” aspect, which scored high in the stakeholders’ assessment, is a core quality of Semmelrock products and subject to continuous improvement. Therefore, no specific target has been set for the Sustainability Roadmap. Avoiding accidents and designing solutions for people with special needs are part of the company’s product innovation management. Sustainable transport is integrated into continuous efforts to increase the efficiency of logistics. Maintaining good relations with local stakeholders is part of operational management at the production sites; therefore, a specific target has not been included in the Sustainability Roadmap 2020.

The main focus is on awareness building, so that sources of danger will be more easily identified and eliminated. Unfortunately, a negative trend was nevertheless observed in the Clay Building Materials Europe business unit in 2014, with two fatal accidents, which we deeply regret. To counteract this trend, CBME implemented a number of instruments, such as the Safety Alert, a well-developed, standardized process for dealing with occupational accidents at all CBME production sites. After every accident, the head of engineering of the plant documents the cause of the accident, explains how it happened and which measures were taken and communicates the information to the health and safety officer of the CBME business unit. The Safety Alert records are then transmitted to all other local companies, which enables them to take specific measures in order to avoid similar accidents in their plants. As an additional incentive, the CBME Safety Award was created in 2014 to reward employees for outstanding achievements in the field of occupational safety. 28 production sites in 11 countries participated in the first round.

In a first step, a colleague from the Wienerberger holding company, himself a passionate cyclist, put together several teams of four people each to collect mileage. Over the month of May 2014, our Vienna-based colleagues together covered the impressive distance of 1,800 km on their bicycles. The idea was taken up by Corporate Human Resources, “Cycling to Work” was communicated throughout the holding company, bicycle service checks were offered free of charge, and many more employees joined the cycling enthusiasts. semmelroCk Pol anD Semmelrock invests in occupational health and safety For our colleagues at Semmelrock Poland the strategic objective of increasing occupational health and safety at their plants is an issue of high priority. They not only invest a great deal in technical safety measures, but also make an effort to build awareness among employees for their own and their colleagues’ safety. The plant at Kolbiel, which has been operated by Semmelrock Poland for many years, was brought up to the highest possible standard of safety in 2014, and all employees working at the production site underwent intensive safety training. Moreover, occupational safety has been included in the individual target agreements with our employees and counts as a factor determining premium payments. In 2014, our colleagues at Semmelrock Poland succeeded in significantly reducing the accident rate and the number of sick-leave days in their plants. gener al sHale georgia 10 years without a single day lost through an accident Our American colleagues have been running the plant in Georgia for ten years without the loss of a single working day through an occupational accident. Two other production sites have been accident-free for more than five years. These outstanding results are due to various initiatives taken to promote safety at the workplace. For example, all people working at these plants, regardless of their employment status, are involved in the monthly safety checks. This means that our staff members contribute significantly to the early identification and elimination of potential hazards at the workplace. We are proud of having achieved such a high level of occupational safety together.

Wienerberger is aware of its responsibility to its employees framework for and fully committed to sustainable human resources management. Specifically, it is our sustainable human resources management task to create the necessary basis and the best possible conditions for the safety, health and satisfaction of our employees. To this end, we are making every effort to achieve continuous improvements in the fields of occupational safety and health, diversity and equal opportunities, and initial and further training. A culture of open communication in our company, the consistent involvement of our employees and a motivating working environment are essential in this context. Our human resources management is based on the following sustainability principles, which apply throughout the entire Group: • Safe and healthy workplaces • Equal opportunities regardless of age, gender, culture, religion, origin or political orientation • Advancement and development of each employee • Willingness to pursue demanding targets and to assume personal responsibility • Entrepreneurial spirit and action With the signing of the Social Charter in 2001, Wienerberger committed itself to The Social Charter: creating Group-wide employment and working conditions that meet national legal proa basis for fair visions or collective bargaining agreements as a minimum standard. Thus, Wienerberger working conditions undertook to comply with the recommendations of the International Labour Organization (ILO). At Wienerberger it goes without saying that, in compliance with the ILO recommendations, child labor and discrimination are not tolerated. We pay special attention to adequate and safe working conditions, fair remuneration, freedom of association and the right to engage in collective bargaining. Approx. 80% of all Wienerberger employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

The figure does not include the employees of Tondach Gleinstätten. The headcount of the Clay Building Materials Europe Division remained almost constant, with a slight increase reported for Clay Building Materials Eastern Europe. In the Pipes & Pavers Europe Division the number of employees increased by 2% in the year under review, mainly due to a strong performance and market share gains in Eastern Europe. The Western Europe segment of the Pipes & Pavers Division and the Holding & Others Division reported minimal reductions. Due to continued positive developments in all its fields of business, the North America Division reported a 3% headcount increase.

Our employees’ perception of their working environment, in turn, has a direct influence on their motivation. We plan to carry out an employee survey that goes into a high level of detail in order to learn more about how our employees feel in their working environment; the results will then be followed up with appropriate measures to further increase employee satisfaction. We intend to cooperate with external experts and have already evaluated potential cooperation partners and the evaluation criteria to be applied in 2014.

Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 43 Employees Sustainability Report 2014 Occupational Safety and Health Occupational Health and Safety Wienerberger takes responsibility for providing safe working conditions and protecting the Group-wide safety initiative health of its employees. This focus was confirmed by the materiality analysis performed in the intensified to achieve even higher safety standards year under review as an aspect of special relevance. All normal capex and standard maintenance activities in our plants are always carried out in line with the health and safety needs of our employees. The Wienerberger safety initiative was launched in 2010 to implement Group-wide safety Focus on safe and healthy standards and thereby reduce the number of accidents. In 2014, the existing standards were working conditions further developed for the entire Wienerberger Group and activities undertaken within the framework of the safety initiative were stepped up. Measures were taken to strengthen employee and management involvement and greater emphasis was placed on direct accountability of the business units. Among other measures, specific targets were defined for each business unit. Based on the safety targets defined, e.g. reduction of accident frequency, specific targets and time schedules are agreed upon with each plant manager in the individual regions. Developments in the field of safety also have an influence on the variable salary components, especially for employees in executive positions. The Wienerberger safety standards call for the installation of occupational safety commitDiverse initiatives within the tees, the assignment of responsibilities and the introduction of comprehensive training. Moreframework of the Group’s safety standards over, every accident is documented in detail and communicated within the Division to ensure that the causes of the accident are understood and lessons learned. A toolbox of best practice examples is available to help plant managers select the corrective measures best suited to reaching their goals. Investments in protective equipment were the first step in the implementation of the safety initiative and continue to be an important part of ongoing production optimization processes. However, based on the evaluation of accidents in the past, the focus remains on building awareness for safety among all employees as a means of preventing accidents by making changes in working habits on a long-term basis. Accident frequency The Safety, Health and Education reporting records all accidents that lead to a loss of at Accident frequency in least one working day for the person concerned. We regret to note that the frequency of accithe Wienerberger Group increased from 10 to 12 dents increased in almost all operating segments in 2014. Despite comprehensive, Group-wide activities aimed at building awareness and changing behavioral patterns, carelessness continued to be the most frequent cause of accidents. We therefore will cooperate even more intensively with our employees at all management levels to draw their attention to potential sources of danger and to drive home the binding nature of safety rules and the importance of protective equipment.

In the Clay Building Materials Eastern Europe segment, accident frequency increased in the Czech Republic, Poland and Croatia, whereas the number of accidents decreased in Hungary and dropped to zero in Slovakia. In the Pipes & Pavers Western Europe segment the accident frequency increased in the year under review. The positive trend of the previous year did not continue for Steinzeug-Keramo. Besides continuous training in the individual plants, this development resulted in the introduction of supplementary reports describing the causes of the accident in greater detail and the inclusion of safety parameters as a factor of the variable salary component of all executives. A reduction in accident frequency was achieved in the Pipes & Pavers Eastern Europe segment, the Holding & Others Division and the North America Division. Pipelife production sites in Greece, Ireland, Austria, Poland, Russia and Sweden proudly reported zero accidents in the year under review. Accident severity Increase in accident severity The severity of accidents, measured as the number of accident-related sick leave days per throughout the entire million hours worked, increased from 301 in 2013 to 340 in 2014 for the entire Wienerberger Wienerberger Group Group.

Two employees, one in Hungary and one in Romania, were killed in production accidents, which we deeply regret. Under the impact of these accidents, we even further intensified our safety training measures. The initiatives taken in the individual business units are described in the following. We uphold our zero accident target for the entire Group. Clay Building Materias Europe (CBME) implemented the Safety Alert as a standardized Safety Alert and Safety process of dealing with occupational accidents at all CBME production sites. The plant maAward of CBME nager has to document the cause of the accident, how it happened and which measures were taken as a result, and communicate the report to the occupational safety officer of the business unit. The Safety Alert records are transmitted to all other local companies, so that targeted measures to prevent similar accidents can immediately be taken at all other locations. Moreover, the accident reduction targets serve as input factors for establishing the variable salary components of managing directors and plant managers. The Safety Award, which was launched in 2014, is a prize awarded for outstanding performance in the field of safety. Pipelife has followed a zero accident strategy for many years. One of the most important Safety Training Observation tools for reaching this goal is the STOP™ Program (Safety Training Observation Program) of Program at Pipelife accident prevention. Employees use STOP cards to identify hazards and report occupational safety issues to the managers in charge. Thus, the entire workforce is actively involved in eliminating potential dangers. This initiative is intended to sustainably improve working conditions and reduce the frequency of accidents, while creating a better awareness for safe behavior among employees. Semmelrock launched its new safety program “Safety@Semmelrock” in 2013. It uses the “Safety@Semmelrock” to so-called AIRS document (“Accident Investigation Report Semmelrock”) to centrally record, record and analyze accidents analyze and communicate all accidents and/or incidents. The main objective is to sensitize employees to safety issues through the documentation and communication of the measures taken, such as the Safety Day organized in 2014 in cooperation with plant and engineering managers.

Protection against respirable crystalline silica Internal Wienerberger Since 2008, the European Union has collected comprehensive data on respirable crystalline survey in 2014 silica from all industries concerned. This survey is conducted every two years via NEPSI, a shared online platform (Negotiation Platform on Silica). The NEPSI system collects data, inter alia, on potential hazards for employees, health checks, training, the distribution and use of personal protective equipment, and technical measures, such as the enclosure of production lines concerned. There was no NEPSI survey in 2014; the most recent one was conducted in 2013. Standardized internal survey Wienerberger nevertheless continued to collect data from across the Group and conducted its system of the Wienerberger internal survey via the standardized Wienerberger survey system.

This can be explained by the higher level of granularity applied in data collection at the sites surveyed. The higher level of differentiation of the survey also resulted in a reduction in the number of potentially exposed employees undergoing health screening. It is satisfactory to note that the share of potentially exposed employees covered by monitoring of respirable crystalline silica has increased to 95.6%. The share of potentially exposed employees who have received training has risen to 93.8%.

Health, safety and human rights at our own raw material extraction sites In the context of our supply chain, we first look at clay as our most important raw material and at our own clay pits. Protecting workers from dust emissions and noise as well as avoiding occupational accidents are our top priorities. Compliance with all rules regarding protection against health hazards and ensuring occupational safety is an absolute must at Wienerberger. Occupational health and safety in our own clay pits are issues of foremost importance and will therefore be given even greater attention in sustainability reporting in the future. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 49 Employees Sustainability Report 2014 Communication and Employee Involvement Communication and Employee Involvement Corporate culture plays an important role at Wienerberger. It is the visible expression Strengthening awareness of our shared values and constitutes the central foundation of our organization. We intend for the importance of our corporate culture to further strengthen these values across the Group and translate them into everyday reality through continuous communication measures and practical examples. We are firmly committed to the principles of sustainability, respect for other cultures and opinions, and entrepreneurial spirit and action. These principles guide our human resources management. The selection and development of employees on the basis of our shared values – expertise, passion, integrity and respect, customer orientation, entrepreneurship, quality, responsibility – is an essential goal for us, which we continued to pursue in 2014 through various support and networking measures. To strengthen awareness of the importance of our corporate culture, we made sure that our values were at the focus of attention at all company levels. We use a variety of communication channels and platforms to inform our employees about Use of various corporate targets and strategies as well as current developments. Moreover, we take a variety of communication channels and platforms measures to ensure the active involvement of our employees: • Social media: Our employer branding profile on XING and LinkedIn was professionalized in 2014. News postings informing about events and success stories as well as corporate strategies and career options are published regularly. An increase in reach has been observed since the launch of the employer branding initiative. The large number of interactions and reactions to news mainly come from our employees. To make our social media presence even more attractive and to respond more effectively to the needs of our target groups, an employer branding strategy was developed in the second half of 2014 for implementation at the beginning of 2015. The strategy comprises, for example, a professional presence on the employer evaluation platform Kununu, which features authentic and honest reports and serves as an important source of information for potential applicants. • Group-wide newsletters and video messages: Monthly newsletters are produced in Vienna and sent to all business unit headquarters, which then transmit relevant information and news to their local companies. We also inform our employees about all organizational changes. Quarterly video messages, in which our CEO addresses all employees to explain current changes and provide background information on the operating results achieved, are disseminated throughout the Group. • ideas & more: Via the information platform “ideas & more“, a simple and transparent online idea management tool, our employees can contribute their own ideas which, if implemented, are also rewarded. This tool was originally introduced by Pipelife and subsequently rolled out. It encourages the creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees and significantly increases the rate of interaction at Wienerberger. A total of 944 ideas were posted by our employees in 2014, about a third of which were implemented during the same year. Back to contents Employees Page 50 Wienerberger AG Communication and Sustainability Report 2014 Employee Involvement • Specific communication instruments of the business units and their local companies: Our business units and their local companies operate in a variety of production areas and therefore have to address completely different issues. Therefore, the business units and their local companies use their own internal communication tools. These include, for instance, specialized newsletters, multilingual knowledge bases on a variety of topics or, in the case of Pipelife, an app store for optimized information exchange. • Events: Various events are organized to promote the Wienerberger corporate culture, to encourage communication and networking between individual teams, departments and business units, and to facilitate the exchange of knowledge within the business units. These range from international marketing meetings, product management meetings and online meetings to networking events and arrangements for the clear distribution of tasks. Regular presentations by the Managing Board on developments within the company serve to keep everyone up to date on what is happening in the company. Moreover, the Managing Board regularly hosts the so-called CEO breakfast, where employees have a chance to meet the CEO and to engage in a personal exchange. • Best Practice Poster: Within the framework of the “Inside – Focus on our Employees” initiative, best-practice examples of employees and projects relating to our corporate values were presented via several communication channels. • Intranet: The Intranet in its current form, called iComm, is a simple, static platform on which the departments can present themselves and provide relevant information for downloading. Moreover, news items are published regularly on the Intranet. Besides Wienerberger AG, the CBME countries of Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Great Britain are already actively represented on iComm. In order to intensify the level of interaction and communication among the employees of all business units and countries, the Managing Board initiated a project in 2014 to relaunch the Intranet. The underlying idea is to develop a technical solution for the Intranet as a central point of access for efficient working and for Group-wide dialogue, networking and interaction. The project vision is: “iComm is my gateway to the Wienerberger world, where I can network and communicate with colleagues to cooperate more efficiently and to share knowledge.” This vision will be implemented in 2015 and 2016. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 51 Employees Sustainability Report 2014 Industrial Relations Industrial Relations The Wienerberger Social Charter was signed in 2001 by the Managing Board of WienerWienerberger Social berger AG and the chairman of the European Forum, a social partnership body and precursor Charter signed in 2001 of the European Works Council in Strasbourg, to formally confirm the company’s engagement to comply with the relevant agreements and recommendations of the International Labour Organization (ILO). With this charter, Wienerberger demonstrates its global commitment to human rights, fair working conditions, payment of adequate remuneration, avoidance of excessive working hours, permanent employment relationships and respect for the freedom of employees to join the union of their choice and the right to participate in free collective bargaining negotiations. The European Works Council (EWC) was established in 2011 as the successor to the European Works European Forum. It addresses issues of European interest, such as strategy, investments, reCouncil since 2011 organization and streamlining measures. The goals of the European Works Council are to engage in constructive social dialogue and to facilitate networking among local bodies representing employee interests. Currently, 11 countries are represented by 32 delegates. The steering committee of the European Works Council, chaired by Gerhard Seban, includes five elected delegates from Austria, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. The EWC meets twice a year and the steering committee holds at least two meetings a year. Following the takeover of Tondach Gleinstätten, the composition of the EWC is to be adjusted accordingly. The most important objectives of the European Works Council are to improve workplace Improvement of workplaces conditions (protection of employees against hazards and implementation of safety standards) and health protection as central goals and to protect the employees’ health. Another concern is to reduce the physical burden for older workers resulting from the higher retirement age by assigning them to jobs that require less physical labor. The European Works Council also strives to ensure fair and just remuneration. In Austria, employees at all locations are represented by works councils. A Group works National works councils: council, comprising employee representatives from all Wienerberger companies, was estabthe Austrian example lished in Austria in November 2013. Currently, it has ten members and is chaired by Gerhard Seban. The Group works council meets at least four times a year, or more often, if required. Similar structures also exist in other European countries. As required by Austrian law, several employee representatives are members of the Supervisory Board of Wienerberger and, as such, closely involved in the strategic development of the Wienerberger Group. Employees in Europe are covered by a broad range of provisions, such as collective bargaiPlant agreements, collective ning agreements, wage agreements, laws and regulations, trade-union agreements, plant agreebargaining agreements, or at least legal provisions ments or individual agreements. All sites operated by Wienerberger AG are located in countries in which employees can exercise their freedom of association and their right to collective bargaining negotiations.

The topics senior management included the “MBTI Individual Profile” (Myers-Briggs type indicator), “Being in the Grip” and the “Key Leadership Challenge”. Pipelife University, Lean Six Sigma and the Pipeschool: The Pipelife University is a training Pipelife University, Lean facility for all Pipelife employees, aimed at the implementation of Lean Six Sigma. As in the Six Sigma (L6S) and the Pipeschool previous year, this well-known management system was at the focus of attention in 2014. The objective of Lean Six Sigma is to deliver qualitatively faultless products and services that completely and profitably meet customers’ needs. Employees trained in this method have successfully carried out over 80 optimization projects according to the principles of Lean Six Sigma. The Pipeschool is an online learning platform that offers lessons on Pipelife in general, Pipelife products, 5S (methodology for creating safe, clean and well-arranged workplaces) and visual management (organizational and communication concept). All Wienerberger training programs are designed to support networking and an internaFocus on networking and tional transfer of knowledge. The programs provide tailor-made training for specific areas and international knowledge transfer support long-term succession management. Diversity and Equal Opportunities The principles of sustainable human resources management at Wienerberger ensure that Not a single case of all employees, regardless of age, gender, culture, religion, origin or political orientation, have the discrimination since the beginning of data collection same rights and opportunities. Based on these principles, Wienerberger does not tolerate any form of discrimination. Since the beginning of data collection on possible cases of discrimination, no such incidents have been reported. As an internationally operating corporate group, Wienerberger respects local cultures and Corporate and cultural promotes diversity. We regard regionally recruited teams as a crucial factor of success. In our identity reinforced through regional recruitment human resources planning, we therefore make every effort to employ local staff, plant managers and managing directors, which enables us to gain a better understanding of the local market and to consider the specificities of the region in decisions taken at Group level. The international character of the company is strengthened through a system of job rotation, which enables people to gain new insights in various fields of work. Wienerberger’s corporate and cultural identity is characterized by cultural diversity and decentralized structures. Gender As a company in the building materials industry, Wienerberger traditionally has a high percentage of male employees. Up to the reporting year, quantitative goals have therefore been defined to increase the percentage of women, above all in administration, sales and management.

In sales, marketing across the Group and warehousing the percentage rose slightly from 24.0% to 24.2%. In the other functional areas the percentage of women decreased slightly. Measures to advance women We continue to adhere to our policy of giving preference to women for new appointments in senior management and in to senior management and executive positions, provided the candidates’ qualifications are equal. leadership positions One specific measure to increase the number of women in senior management and executive positions at Wienerberger is to enable women to embark on suitable career paths from an early time on. In the nomination process for Ready4Excellence, our cross-divisional further training program for international key employees, we focus especially on the potential of female employees and select them on a preferential basis, provided all qualifications are equal. HR management focus on The materiality analysis performed in 2014 showed that, from our stakeholders’ point of reconciling work and family view, focusing merely on the percentage of women in the functional areas is not a decisive factor of sustainable human resources management. Moreover, North America has to be excluded from the definition of target figures, as US law does not allow such targets to be set for the percentage of women. We therefore decided to abandon our former quantitative targets and to concentrate on the issue of reconciling work and family for all our employees, regardless of gender. Indicators adjusted We have adjusted our indicators accordingly and, starting from 2014, now gather data not accordingly only on the percentage of women in the functional areas, but also the number of newly recruited women and the percentage of women working part-time. On the basis of these indicators, we can take a more differentiated approach in human resources management in order to position ourselves as a family-friendly company and to define appropriate quantitative targets for the future.

In this context, we pay special attention to Group-wide training and development measures for young employees as well as to long-term succession management. In order to ensure continuity in positions that are critical for Wienerberger’s success, we defined key positions for which succession plans are to be prepared in all business units in 2014. At the same time, we identified internal talents and high-potential employees, who are to be gradually prepared for succession to key positions through targeted training measures over the coming years. Through this process, we are ensuring that critical key positions can be filled with the right people at the right time and in line with our corporate culture. Back to contents Employees Page 56 Wienerberger AG Targets and Future Measures Sustainability Report 2014 Relating to our Employees Targets and Future Measures Relating to our Employees The quantitative targets and future measures described in the following were defined by the Managing Board of Wienerberger AG and the business unit CEOs. The decisions were taken on the basis of the materiality matrix developed in 2014 for the individual business units and at Group level. The measures foreseen are part of the Wienerberger Sustainability Roadmap 2020. Safety of our employees At Group level, our long-term target is zero accidents. Every single occupational accident is analyzed at Group level; core issues and possible Group-wide initiatives are evaluated once a year. In 2015, a specific target for investments in research and development and the development of additional safety measures will be defined. To reach the Group target, the business units have taken and/or planned a variety of measures. Clay Building Materials Europe (CBME) will implement the safety alert, developed in 2014, in the course of 2015. Exemplary behavior will again be rewarded with the Safety Award. Another innovation planned for 2015 is the installation of a safety manager, who will be responsible exclusively for the safety issues of the entire Division and coordinate all safety measures and safety standards. North America will introduce monthly meetings on safety issues and reporting lines between the top management and the local management. Additionally, a person responsible for safety will be nominated at each production site; their mandates will include the aforementioned measures as well as communication on safety matters. To advance the development process, each production site will define its safety targets for the coming two years. Pipelife plans to implement safety calls, a measure introduced in 2014, on the basis of past experience. Every time an accident occurs, a safety call is organized with the managing directors of all local companies of the business unit to analyze the cause of the accident, to share experience and to initiate the necessary improvement steps. Semmelrock will continue its “Safety@Semmelrock” program in 2015, introduce technical measures to optimize its production processes, and use the “Accident Investigation Report Semmelrock” (AIRS) as well as an internal communication platform. From 2016, there will be a new safety guideline, and corresponding agreements will be made with the management. Steinzeug-Keramo will define business-unit-specific benchmarks for safety measures, on the basis of the initiatives taken by the Wienerberger Group. By 2016, the business unit will continuously invest in safety and health measures and analyze its production workplaces for potential risks. The measures taken will be subject to regular internal audits. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 57 Employees Sustainability Report 2014 Targets and Future Measures Relating to our Employees Health of our employees At Group level, our quantitative target of rolling out the collection of data on respirable crystalline silica to at least 95% of all Wienerberger ceramic production sites by 2020 was already achieved in 2013. This target will be maintained, as Tondach Gleinstätten is not yet included in the indicators. The next step is aimed at reducing the generation and release of respirable crystalline silica in our ceramic plants. This process is to be supported through a targeted exchange of information within the framework of working groups set up at Group level and including representatives from all business units. Potential core indicators and Group-wide initiatives are evaluated annually. Clay Building Materials Europe (CBME) will develop a strategy for the reduction of respirable crystalline silica in 2015, which will serve as a basis for the definition of a quantitative reduction target. The exchange of information with the other business units and the annual evaluation of core issues and initiatives will support the process at Group level. North America will extend its respirable crystalline silica measurements to its non-ceramic plants in 2015 (excluding Pipelife production site). Based on these measurements, protective measures are taken for potentially exposed employees. Programs already introduced are being continued and standards for reduction measures developed. In addition, all full-time employees of North America will be covered by health insurance, the scope of which goes beyond the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Semmelrock will evaluate the relevance of respirable crystalline silica to its employees. Its health-promoting measures within the framework of Safety@Semmelrock will be continued. Steinzeug-Keramo will participate in the subject-specific working groups organized centrally for an exchange of experience and evaluate potential core issues once a year. In 2016, at the latest, Steinzeug-Keramo will define further quantitative targets for the reduction of respirable crystalline silica. Communication and Employee Involvement At Group level, further measures will be taken to improve communication with our employees and to encourage their active involvement in the coming years. The Employer Branding Strategy initiated in 2014 will be continued in 2015. Our corporate values will be firmly embedded in our everyday working routine as a source of guidance and orientation. By 2017, the Intranet will be rolled out to all business units and their local companies in an effort to improve communication and interaction among our employees. Employee satisfaction At Group level, Corporate HR will evaluate employee satisfaction through an employee survey to be performed in 2015 and develop appropriate measures. The evaluation will be performed in Austria first and subsequently rolled out to other countries on the basis of the experience gained.

We are well aware that industrial production processes always involve a certain degree of interference with the natural environment. Therefore, production in harmony with the environment is a matter of great importance to us. Conservation of resources in production is a key aspect in both the ceramic proFocus on key aspects duction as well as the production of plastic pipes and concrete pavers. We focus on the in sustainable responsible use of our raw materials and other resources, such as energy and water. In production addition, we constantly work on contributing to the fight against climate change through greater energy efficiency and the reduction of our CO2 emissions from production. In all business units we strive to increase the amount of recycled material used in production, considering the technical and economic possibilities. A presentation of the general principles of production, updated on the basis of Principles of the materiality analysis performed, can be found on the Wienerberger website. The environmental management in Sustainability Report 2014 briefly outlines the essential aspects of these principles.

One of the core activities of R&D is to optimize production processes and product development. R&D activities are managed across all business units, but most of the results are implemented locally through the close cooperation of the various R&D departments with the local managers and engineers on site. Thus, successful developments can be rolled out quickly and efficiently to the entire Group. R&D expenditure increased from € 11.4 million in 2013 to € 17.0 million in 2014, which corresponds to 0.6% of the company’s revenues. Environmental management Environmentally relevant Environmentally relevant aspects, e.g. the management of waste and residual substances aspects in QMS or the avoidance of noise and dust emissions, have been integrated into the company’s quality management systems (QMS), which are certified according to ISO 9001 at almost all production sites. The criteria laid down in the QMS provide the basis for the requirements to be met in production and its processes. Environment officers have been appointed to ensure the implementation of environmentally relevant standards. A number of production sites have already been certified according to ISO 14001. There are no plans for Group-wide certification according to ISO 14001 or EMAS, as Wienerberger considers the current QMS to be sufficient for the control and management of production processes and their environmental impacts. Technical controlling system Production-related data are A technical controlling system has been installed in all production areas of the Wienerberger recorded in the technical Group. This system collects all production-related data required for the management of the controlling system company and for the internal benchmarking of production sites against one another. The data collected include statistics on production volumes as well as information on product quality, the efficiency of the machinery used, and energy consumption. On the basis of such data, the effectiveness of the measures taken to reduce the environmental impact of our production processes can be analyzed.

Steinzeug-Keramo changed its data collection method in 2014 and will kiln capacity state its three-year trend accordingly from 2016 onward. The data for Pipelife have been included since June 2012. Tondach Gleinstätten has been fully consolidated in the Wienerberger Group since July 2014, but is not yet included in the 2014 Sustainability Report. The necessary structures for the collection of sustainability data are not yet in place at Tondach Gleinstätten, but are currently being implemented. Re-Statements Index calculation in general, combined product group indices: For a more precise presentation of index developments, the indices of individual areas were combined and calculated in absolute figures; in the past, the calculation was based on weighted production tonnages of the individual product groups. The index data of the previous years were adjusted accordingly to show a three-year trend. Index of specific CO2 emissions for 2013, Clay Building Materials Europe (CBME): The previous year’s figures were adjusted retroactively, as data registration on the EU server (EUTL) had not yet been completed at the time of publication of the 2013 Sustainability Update. Production volumes of a single roof tile plant, Clay Building Materials Europe: The management of master data relating to the production volumes of a single roof tile plant of the CBME Division was corrected in 2014; for reasons of comparability, the data for 2012 and 2013 were restated to show a three-year trend.

Total energy consumption In 2014, the total energy consumption of the Wienerberger Group declined by 2% from of the Wienerberger Group the previous year’s level. The most significant savings were achieved in the consumption of dropped by 2% natural gas. This development is due to continuous, Group-wide efforts to optimize production. Group-wide conversion to Efforts are being made throughout the Wienerberger Group to change over to lowlow-emission energy sources emission energy sources. In particular, fuel oil and coal are to be replaced by other sources of energy in order to reduce CO2 emissions and save costs. The percentage of fuel oil used declined by 68% in 2014. The consumption of liquefied natural gas, which is used mainly in India, was reduced by more than 40%. In Italy and Germany we use electricity generated by our own photovoltaic systems. The consumption of coal was reduced by 6% in 2014. Coal is the most important fuel in North America, but the production sites of the North America Division are gradually being converted to natural gas. A biogas plant fired with local biomass was set up near a SteinzeugKeramo production site. The biogas fuels a co-generation plant, the waste heat of which is used to dry the ceramic pipes. Electricity consumption The 1% increase in electricity consumption as compared to the previous year’s level is priincreased by 1% marily due to the higher volume of production and changes in the product mix of the Pipelife Group, as the plastic pipe production plants run almost exclusively on electricity. In 2014, electricity from renewable sources of energy accounted for 27% of total electricity consumption. Steinzeug-Keramo converted its ceramic pipe production plants completely to electricity from renewable sources in 2014.

In this report, the index of specific energy consumption (based on energy consumption compared with reference kWh/ton) refers to 2010 as the base year for the definition of our targets to be achieved by year 2010 2020. The Wienerberger Group continued to make good progress in 2014: specific energy consumption was reduced by 11% against the reference year 2010 and by 4% compared with 2013. The significantly increased energy efficiency of the Wienerberger Group resulted in a Reduction of specific energy further reduction of specific energy consumption in almost all product groups. The greatest consumption in almost all product groups success was achieved in clay block production, where specific energy consumption was reduced by 21% compared with the reference year 2010 and by 7% compared with 2013. Thus, the 2020 target for clay blocks was already achieved in 2014. In facing brick production, specific energy consumption dropped by 3% compared with 2013, which is due, inter alia, to investments in the optimization of production processes. In ceramic production as a whole, specific energy consumption was reduced by 10% compared with the reference year 2010 and by 3% compared with 2013. Satisfactory development has also been seen in concrete paver production, with specific energy consumption reduced by 11% from the reference year 2010 and by 6% from 2013. The Clay Building Materials Europe Division is currently working on the development of Index of specific energy new roof tile and facing brick products, one of the objectives being to increase resource efficienconsumption also reported per m² for roof tiles and cy and to further improve the product properties. Material input in production is being reduced facing bricks at the same time. To date, the index of specific energy consumption has been calculated as the energy consumed per ton produced. In order to record the energy efficiency increases and the reduction of material input in the production of roof tiles and facing bricks, the index of specific energy consumption for these two product groups is now also shown per square meter of product surface.

CO2 Emissions CO2 emission data collected In the collection of CO2 emission data, we apply the method of the European Union Emisaccording to the method sions Trading Scheme (ETS system), which records direct CO2 emissions, excluding indirect applied by the European CO2 emissions resulting from the use of electricity. Accordingly, the only relevant data are Emissions Trading System CO2 emissions from our ceramic production (bricks and ceramic pipes). CO2 emissions from primary energy sources vary in line with energy consumption, whereas so-called process emissions result from the raw material and, in clay block production, from the use of poreforming agents. Electrical energy is used in the production of plastic pipes and concrete pavers, with the related CO2 emissions being attributed to the electricity producer. 2013 as the new reference The changes brought about by the transition to the third trading period of the European year for future developments Union Emissions Trading Scheme and the resulting decision taken by the Wienerberger Sustainability Steering Committee were described in the 2013 Sustainability Update. On account of the transition to the third trading period, emission data collected in 2013 now provide the new reference base for future developments. CO² emissions ¹ in tons 2013 ² 2014 ³ Change in % From primary energy sources 1,002,751 979,996 -2 From processes 645,355 668,298 +4 Total – covered by ETS 4 1,648,106 1,648,295 0 Plants not covered by ETS 5 187,589 191,259 +2 From biogenic materials 6 257,986 228,694 -11 ¹ Following the transition to the third EU emission trading period in 2013, Wienerberger’s data from previous years are no longer comparable; therefore, CO² emission data from 2013 serve as the new reference base for future developments. ² The previous years’ figures were adjusted retroactively, as data registration at the EU server (EUTL) had not been completed at the time of publication of the report. ³ Tondach Gleinstätten not included. 4 Source: Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL). 5 Calculated in accordance with national rules (Switzerland) or EU standard emission factors. Only CO emissions from the combustion ² of primary energy sources are included for production sites in the USA; from 2015 onward, CO² emissions from processes will also be included. 6 Figures from Wienerberger CO monitoring are based on national rules. ² Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 67 Production Sustainability Report 2014 CO² Emissions Despite higher production volumes, total CO2 emissions from the ceramic plants of the CO2 emissions from primary Wienerberger Group covered by ETS remained at the previous year’s level. Plants not coverenergy sources reduced by 2% ed by ETS reported an increase in total CO2 emissions by 2% due to increasing production volumes. The 4% increase in process-related emissions compared to the previous year’s level is due to the same reason. However, despite increasing production, CO2 emissions from primary energy sources dropped by 2% as a result of the consistent optimization of fuel use. The results of the materiality analysis have shown that, from the stakeholder point of CO2 emissions from primary view, our measures in the field of climate action are relevant only in connection with energy energy sources: an essential aspect for Wienerberger consumption. Therefore, only fuel-related CO2 emissions that can be directly influenced by Wienerberger have been classified as a material aspect of climate action for Wienerberger. For this reason, the updated quantitative target definition exclusively refers to the reduction of specific CO2 emissions from primary sources of energy. The calculation of the index of specific CO2 emissions was adjusted accordingly, with only fuel-derived CO2 emissions included in the index. On account of the transition to the third emission trading period of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, the index of specific CO2 emissions was reset to 100% in 2013. Index of specific CO² emissions ¹ in % based on kg CO² /ton (2013 = 100 %) 2013 2014 ² Change from 2013 in % Clay blocks 100 92 -8 Roof tiles ³ 100 95 -5 Facing bricks 100 98 -2 Ceramic pipes 100 100 0 Ceramic production 100 96 -4 ¹ Specific CO² emissions now refer exclusively to fuel emissions.

As regards the index of specific CO2 emissions from primary energy sources, we also achieved Group-wide reduction of significant reductions, compared with 2013, in almost all production areas. Our efforts were specific CO2 emissions by 4% compared with 2013 particularly successful in clay block production, where specific CO2 emissions were reduced by 8% from the previous year’s level. Taken together, specific CO2 emissions from all ceramic production plants of the Wienerberger Group were 4% lower than in 2013. The development of specific CO2 emissions from primary energy sources shows that there is a linear correlation with energy efficiency; the change-over to low-emission fuels adds to this positive development. Calculated on this basis, specific CO2 emissions from primary energy sources in ceramic production were 10% lower in 2014 than in 2010. Efforts made within the Clay Building Materials Europe Division to reduce raw material Index of specific CO2 input in production serve the goal of increasing energy efficiency and, at the same time, further emissions also reported per m² of surface for roof tiles improving the product properties. We have therefore decided to report the index of specific CO2 and facing bricks emissions from primary energy sources not only per ton produced, but also per square meter of product surface.

The reduction in specific CO2 emissions from primary energy sources is clearly noticeable in these two product groups. A 6% reduction was achieved in roof tile production and an 8% reduction in facing brick production. CO2 emissions in cement A major part of the carbon footprint of Semmelrock’s concrete products is generated production upstream in raw material production. Cement production is particularly energy-intensive and, consequently, CO2-intensive. Within the framework of the Sustainability Roadmap 2020, Semmelrock has undertaken to reduce these emissions, e.g. by implementing pilot projects investigating the use of recycled concrete and concrete produced by climate-friendly methods. CO2 emissions from Other types of indirect CO2 emissions, such as those caused by the transport of raw matransport of raw materials terials and finished products, are not covered in this report. According to the assessment of our stakeholders, such emissions only account for a relatively small part of the total carbon footprint of our products, compared with direct emissions from ceramic production and/or the CO2 intensity of the raw materials used in the production of plastic and concrete products. Nevertheless, within the framework of the Sustainability Roadmap 2020, Semmelrock is exploring the possibility of using more local suppliers in order to reduce transport-related CO2 emissions. Water Consumption Wienerberger Group The Wienerberger Group succeeded in further reducing its total water consumption in further reduced its 2014 by 3%, whereas the volume of water drawn from public networks increased by 3%.

Specific water consumption In the year under review, specific water consumption was again reduced significantly in further reduced in almost all almost all operating segments. Water plays a secondary role in ceramic production. In contrast, operating segments plastic pipe production requires comparatively large volumes of water to cool the extruded pipes. Pipelife therefore uses water from own sources (wells), from ponds (rainwater) or rivers. Investments in the optimization of water management continued in 2014, particularly in the plastic pipe segment, where they resulted in a further 2% drop in specific water consumption by Pipelife. The water consumption in paver production resulted from the percentage of premium products with special protective surface finishing (Semmelrock Premium Protect) produced in 2014, which greatly facilitates cleaning even of heavily soiled surfaces.

Sustainable Raw Material Supply and Extraction Long-term availability of raw materials is a crucial aspect of sustainability for Wienerberger. Continuous monitoring of To mitigate the risk of potential shortages, Wienerberger pursues various strategies, such as an long-term availability of raw materials increase in raw material efficiency (reduction of losses and waste), increased recycling, early identification of possible shortages, and the diversification of sources of supply. In 2013, for example, Clay Building Materials Europe developed a plan of action to secure strategic raw material supplies for the coming 20 years. In 2014, a risk analysis covering all clay extraction sites was begun, from which further steps are to be derived. Within the framework of the Sustainability Roadmap 2020, similar measures will be taken by Steinzeug-Keramo, North America and Semmelrock. At Pipelife, the diversification of the supplier structure contributes towards securing the availability of raw materials on a long-term basis. Nature conservation and a meaningful use of extraction sites that have reached the end of Nature conservation their service life are the guiding principles of sustainability in the operation of any extraction and re-naturalization of extraction sites site. This includes non-interference with protected areas and the re-cultivation or re-naturalization of spent extraction sites or their use for other purposes. As regards Wienerberger’s own clay pits, nature conservation and a meaningful use of exhausted sites are guaranteed. Extraction site operators in our supply chain are not yet subject to detailed scrutiny in ecological and social terms. Local residents in the vicinity of clay extraction sites are an important stakeholder group Protection of local residents for Wienerberger. New extraction sites have to undergo intensive processes of approval and at our own extraction sites authorization by public authorities, which are strictly observed by Wienerberger. Moreover, Wienerberger engages in open dialogue with the local residents concerned because their health and safety are important concerns for the company. Health and safety of our employees are matters of special importance at our own clay Health and safety at our extraction sites. Avoiding occupational accidents and protecting workers from dust emissions own extraction sites and noise are our top priorities. Compliance with all rules regarding protection against health hazards and ensuring occupational safety is an absolute must at Wienerberger. Occupational health and safety in our own clay pits are issues of foremost importance and will therefore be given even greater attention in future sustainability reports. For manufacturers of plastic products, sustainable sourcing of raw materials comprises a numSustainability in plastic ber of critical issues, ranging from nature conservation and the rights of regional stakeholders in production: The Pipelife crude oil extraction to energy efficiency in processing in the petrochemical industry. For the time Supplier Code of Conduct being, Pipelife’s plastic suppliers are not yet subjected to a sustainability assessment, as sustainability certificates or labels are not yet available in this industry. However, Pipelife expects its suppliers to observe the principles of sustainability – see “Pipelife Supplier Code of Conduc”. Back to contents Production Page 70 Wienerberger AG Sustainable Raw Material Sustainability Report 2014 Supply and Extraction, Resource Efficiency and Waste Management, Targets and Future Measures Relating to Production Use of biogenic and From the viewpoint of resource efficiency, the use of secondary raw materials is an imporsecondary raw materials tant topic for the future. However, technical feasibility depends on the types of materials and the applications concerned. The use of secondary raw materials has become common practice in plastic production. In ceramic production, secondary raw materials are used as additives. Substances such as ash, slag, EPS, paper fibers, saw dust or straw are added to ceramic products to obtain the desired product qualities. Using secondary raw materials as a substitute for primary raw materials is a greater challenge. While residual material from our own plants can be recycled into production on account of its high degree of purity, the use of secondary ceramic material from external sources is hardly possible, at least for the time being. Ceramic material can be separated from other construction debris and re-used in the production of building materials, but is not yet available in sufficient quantities. In particular, material from the façade or the roof of a demolished building can be recycled directly into brick production. Generally speaking, most of our business units regard the use of recycled materials as a promising and future-oriented approach, but – with the exception of Pipelife – consolidated recycling rates are not yet reported. Resource Efficiency and Waste Management Increasing resource Wienerberger is making a continuous effort to optimize the use of its resources. Our parefficiency and reducing ticular focus is on reducing raw material consumption. The Clay Building Materials Europe bumaterial input siness unit, for example, is devoting special attention to the optimization and further development of roof tiles. The finite element method (FEM) is used to increase resource efficiency in production and further improve product properties at the same time. Thus, the high transverse breaking strength and the frost resistance of our roof tiles have been further improved and material input in production has been reduced. Figures on the total amount of raw materials used in the Wienerberger Group cannot be disclosed for reasons of the company’s intellectual property rights in product and production technologies. Waste and packaging efficiency A total of 151,357 tons of waste was generated by Wienerberger in 2014 with hazardous waste, such as oily rags and waste substances collected in oil separators (at gas stations), accounting for less than 1%. Almost 100% of the waste generated by the Wienerberger Group is non-hazardous waste, which is collected and recycled at a rate of 85%. Targets and Future Measures Relating to Production The following targets and future measures were defined by the Managing Board of Wienerberger AG and the business unit CEOs. The decisions were taken on the basis of the materiality matrix developed in 2014 for the individual business units and at Group level. The measures foreseen are part of the Wienerberger Sustainability Roadmap 2020. Availability of raw materials Clay Building Materials Europe (CBME) will secure the availability of raw materials for a period of 20 years. In the course of 2015, CBME will establish a raw material risk management system that identifies all clay pits with short-term availabilities at an early point in time. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 71 Production Sustainability Report 2014 Targets and Future Measures Relating to Production North America checks the availability of raw material from its own clay pits by means of a “raw material availability map”. The system triggers an alarm as soon as the availability of raw material from the clay pit drops below the amount required for ten years of operation. North America will intensify its monitoring of the raw material availability map in the coming years. Pipelife will draw up a list of all products and their suppliers for all essential product groups by 2017 and implement a strategy for the avoidance of supply shortages on that basis. Semmelrock will perform a risk assessment regarding raw material supply in 2015 and subsequently develop a raw material procurement strategy, which is to be implemented step by step by 2016. Steinzeug-Keramo will carry out a survey of the availability of raw materials from its own clay pits and from supplier-operated extraction sites in 2015 and identify potential risks. Use of secondary raw materials Clay Building Materials Europe, working on the basis of its strategy for the use of recycled materials, will define quantitative targets and decide on further measures to be taken. North America operates a production system based on a closed resource cycle. This process is continuously monitored with a view to possible improvements. By 2016, a pilot plant for the targeted use of recycled material in production is to be put into operation. Pipelife intends to increase the amount of recycled material per ton of products produced to 70 kg by 2020. To this end, Pipelife will carry out research projects in 2015 in order to optimize the composition of primary and secondary raw materials in its products. Moreover, the technical feasibility of the use of recycled material will be further explored. Semmelrock will analyze the recycling potential in various fields of production and evaluate the possibilities of substituting recycled material for primary raw material in its product mix. Another goal being pursued by Semmelrock is to reduce the amount of cement used. Steinzeug-Keramo has already increased the percentage of secondary raw materials used to very high levels, depending on economic and technical feasibility, and will evaluate the percentages of internal and external secondary raw materials in its products in 2015. Avoidance/substitution of hazardous substances At Group level and at business unit level, it goes without saying that Wienerberger meets all national, regional and European legal requirements regarding the avoidance and substitution of hazardous substances. Compliance with all legal provisions is continuously monitored and the necessary measures are taken whenever need arises. Protection of local residents, nature conservation and re-use of clay pits At Group level Wienerberger has undertaken to draft a code of conduct for suppliers by the end of 2015. Back to contents Production Page 72 Wienerberger AG Targets and Future Measures Sustainability Report 2014 Relating to Production North America guarantees that its production sites will be checked regularly for dust emissions and water quality. Open and transparent communication with local residents and local authorities is a matter of special concern for General Shale. Pipelife wants to make sure that its suppliers commit to a responsible way of interacting with people and the environment in accordance with the “Pipelife Supplier Code of Conduct”. Semmelrock will increase the number of local suppliers of additives in 2015, depending on conditions at the respective production sites. Steinzeug-Keramo will develop its own standard for nature conservation and the meaningful re-use of spent clay pit. Ultimately, this standard is to be applied to suppliers as well. The business unit will perform a supplier audit in 2016. Energy efficiency Clay Building Materials Europe is committed to the goal of reducing specific energy consumption in ceramic production by 20% by 2020, compared with the 2010 level. North America will optimize electricity consumption at additional selected production sites by 2016. The business unit commits to the quantitative target of reducing natural gas consumption at selected production sites by 5% each by 2016, compared with 2015. Further quantitative reduction targets will be evaluated in 2016. Pipelife commits to reducing specific energy consumption in production by 20% by 2020, compared with 2010. “Energy treasure hunts” (projects aimed at reducing energy consumption in production) are being performed at various locations. In addition, local electricity saving initiatives are being implemented. Steinzeug-Keramo will set a quantitative target for the reduction of specific energy consumption by 2016 and implement an energy management system in accordance with ISO 50001. Climate action Clay Building Materials Europe intends to reduce specific CO2 emissions from primary energy sources in production by 20% from the 2010 level. North America will change over all its main production sites from coal to natural gas by 2016. The corresponding emission-reducing measures will be implemented at the main production sites. Pipelife intends to reduce specific CO2 emissions from primary sources of energy in production by 20% by 2020, compared with 2010. Semmelrock will further reduce the percentage of cement in its products, thus reducing CO2 emission from cement production in the upstream supply chain. Steinzeug-Keramo intends to offset 5% of the annual CO2 emissions of the respective plant by contributing to climate action projects. In addition, efforts will be made to use more renewable sources of energy. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 73 Production Sustainability Report 2014 Targets and Future Measures Relating to Production Resource efficiency and waste management Clay Building Materials Europe will optimize the business-unit-specific strategy on resource efficiency and waste management in 2015. North America will further optimize its closed resource cycle in 2015 and 2016 and try out new possibilities of using recycled additives. Moreover, the recycling of packaging materials is to be extended and the sale of products in “bulk bags” (stable, re-usable containers) instead of paper bags is to be rolled out. Semmelrock will reduce its scrap rate in production by 15% compared with 2014; the target for 2017 is a 50% reduction compared with 2014. Water Pipelife has set itself the target of reducing its water consumption from public networks by 2020 to 0.55 m³ per ton produced. Semmelrock will optimize the water cycles in production and implement a pilot project by 2016.

Product development and optimization plays an important role in this context. Last year, our colleagues from Clay Building Materials Europe (CBME) put a great deal of effort into an innovation project focused on roof tiles. It is our goal to achieve a higher degree of resource efficiency and, at the same time, to further improve the properties of our products. By means of the finite element method (FEM), the fracture toughness and frost resistance of our roof tiles was further improved and raw material input was reduced. Since 2014, the finite element method has been rolled out in several local companies of CBME. Pi Pe l i f e n e t H e r l a n D s A pipe for 20,000 trees Since 2011, Pipelife’s innovative NatuDrain pipes have been used with over 20,000 newly planted trees in the Netherlands. The product comes as a sustainable alternative to conventional drip pipes for tree nurseries and landscape gardeners. Once the young trees have developed enough roots, the pipe dissolves. Made from secondary raw materials from the food industry, such as potato starch, the pipes are completely compostable and 100% biodegradable. Back to contents Products Page 76 Wienerberger AG Best Practice Examples Sustainability Report 2014 C B m e B e lg i u m Logistic innovations for the benefit of the environment In an effort to minimize the environmental impact of product transport, Wienerberger Belgium developed a transport strategy based on river navigation. Since 2013, not only primary raw materials, but also fired bricks have been delivered by boat. One boat shipment saves approximately 20 trips by truck. To increase the range of river transport even further, our colleagues in Belgium use special catamarans, which can navigate also through narrow rivers. Shipments from the Wienerberger production site are loaded onto sea-going ships that can also travel on canals. Thus, deliveries of bricks to Great Britain are now made exclusively by water. A ship of this type replaces about 75 truck trips over a distance of up to 200 km. Thanks to this transport strategy, our colleagues in Belgium have significantly reduced their CO2 emissions and their environmental impact. Dr.-Ing.

We view sustainability as a function of a product’s service life infrastructure solutions as well as of its impact on the environment during raw material extraction, production, transport, installation, use and disposal. Wienerberger brick products are an integral part of sustainable building concepts. They guarantee a high quality of life and make an active contribution to the fight against climate change. In the field of pipes and pavers, we offer system solutions for present-day challenges, including the demands on water management resulting from climate change and increasing urbanization. In view of what users and principals expect of a modern building, and considering Meeting modern building the numerous regulatory requirements to be met, such as the Energy Performance of requirements through a system-based approach Buildings Directive (EPBD), system-based approaches to building construction are getting more and more important. Integrated system solutions enable us to combine the outstanding properties of individual products of the Wienerberger product portfolio with products supplied by our partners in the field of building services and facilities in order to obtain the best possible results. The general principles of Wienerberger’s sustainable product management are presentPrinciples of sustainable ed on the Wienerberger website. The 2014 Sustainability Report contains a brief product management description of the essential aspects of these general principles. The quantitative targets and measures are summarized at the end of this chapter under “Targets and Future Measures Relating to Products”. Back to contents Products Page 78 Wienerberger AG Processes and Instruments Sustainability Report 2014 of Sustainable Product Management Processes and Instruments of Sustainable Product Management Market-oriented product Research and Development (R&D) are among the priorities of Wienerberger’s strategic development within the planning and at the focus of the company’s attention. The core tasks of R&D include the optiframework of R&D mization of production processes and the continuous further development and improvement of products and system solutions in all areas of applications – from energy-efficient construction projects to environment-friendly pavings to water supply and sewage systems. Wienerberger aims to secure and further strengthen its market positions through cost and technology leadership and product innovations. R&D: managed centrally but R&D at Wienerberger is managed centrally, but most of the results achieved are implementimplemented locally ed locally. Wienerberger operates several research centers in Europe, each of them specializing in a different product group. Our product management specialists cooperate closely with the marketing and sales departments of the individual segments in order to adapt new developments to the needs of our customers. The market launch of new products across several countries is managed centrally, but the products are adjusted to local market conditions by our specialists on site. Thus, successful developments can be rolled out quickly and efficiently to the entire Group. R&D expenditure increased from € 11.4 million in 2013 to € 17.0 million in 2014, which corresponds to 0.6% of our revenues. Process optimization makes In pursuit of our sustainability goals, we are continuously improving our production procesour ceramic products ses. In the energy-intensive field of ceramic production (bricks and ceramic pipes), our engisustainable neers focus, above all, on the reduction of energy consumption in the drying and firing process and on the optimization of product properties as regards fire safety, sound and thermal insulation, and structural strength. This is essential in order to meet the continuously increasing requirements in residential and commercial construction. Other research priorities concern a sparing use of resources in production and environmentally responsible raw materials processing. As a pioneer in the use of waste products in our raw material mix, we have succeeded in using up to 60% recycled ceramic material in the production of certain vitrified clay pipes. Moreover, our vitrified clay pipes are made 100% of natural and recyclable raw materials and therefore meet the demanding criteria of Cradle to Cradle® certification. Continuous optimization Besides the optimization of production processes, R&D efforts concerning our current of production and surface product range in the plastic pipe segment are focused mainly on savings in raw material contreatment for plastic pipes sumption by reducing product weight and on increasing the percentage of recycled materials and concrete pavers in production. In the development of new products, we take the ever-increasing technical requirements to be met by plastic pipes and fittings into account and develop solutions that permit environmentally compatible, fast and easy installation of the products at construction sites. In the case of concrete pavers, our efforts are aimed at improving the raw material mix and optimizing our processes of production and surface treatment. Another priority relates to new surface textures and innovative product solutions for high-quality design of public spaces. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 79 Products Sustainability Report 2014 Environmental Product Declarations and Certifications Environmental Product Declarations and Certifications For many years, Wienerberger has been working intensively on the voluntary preparation Wienerberger prepares of eco-balances and environmental product declarations (EPDs) for its entire product range. eco-balances and EPDs on a voluntary basis Based on the European Construction Products Regulation (CPR) and the work of the European standardization body CEN TC 350, such declarations will become mandatory for all building material producers in the coming years. In Belgium, this obligation has been in effect since 1 January 2014. EPDs of brick products have already been published in a number of countries in recent years. Most of Wienerberger’s brick In countries such as France, Germany, Belgium or Great Britain, most of the EPDs were pubproducts are covered by EPDs lished by the respective industry associations. In Austria, the first industry EPDs were finalized in the fall of 2014. Within the framework of these measures, environmental product declarations have been issued for the majority of Wienerberger’s brick products either individually or within the framework of industry solutions. Wienerberger played a leading role in all the aforementioned countries and actively participates in the design of eco-balances and EPDs and in the harmonization of national provisions at European level within the framework of Tiles and Bricks Europe (TBE), the European umbrella organization of the brick industry. The documents made available by TBE as a basis for the preparation of EPDs for bricks (product category rules, CPR) support the objective of harmonizing EPDs in Europe. In the plastic pipes industry, most of the environmental product declarations are published Plastic pipe producers’ by the producers’ association. The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association (TEPPFA), association takes the lead in the preparation of EPDs drawing on the results of lifecycle analyses (LCAs), publishes environmental product declarations for the various functional areas on the basis of ISO 14025. For heating applications, for example, a functional area is defined as all the plastic pipes and fittings required to heat a residential unit with a surface of 100 m². The members of the organization have the right to refer to the EPDs for these functional areas. TEPPFA has already prepared 20 environmental product declarations. All ceramic pipes and fittings produced by Steinzeug-Keramo have been successfully cerAll Steinzeug-Keramo tified according to the Cradle to Cradle® product standard. This means that our products are products have Cradle to Cradle® certification not disposed of as waste at the end of their service life, but are returned into the production cycle as feedstock for new products. Other essential prerequisites for certification are the use of renewable energy and a commitment to biodiversity. Regular recertification ensures continuous development in all essential aspects. Among the outcomes of these developments are Steinzeug-Keramo’s climate-neutral pipes, which are produced in the modern fast-firing facility at Bad Schmiedeberg and already account for over 10% of revenues. Essential Product Qualities In the course of the materiality analysis, the product qualities outlined below were identified as essential for the Wienerberger Group. We take this as confirmation of our efforts undertaken in the area of innovative product management. Back to contents Products Page 80 Wienerberger AG Essential Product Qualities Sustainability Report 2014 Long service life, cost-effectiveness and contribution to the preservation of cultural heritage Wienerberger products are durable, strong and easy to maintain in good condition. This helps to increase their service life, preserve natural resources, and reduce the carbon footprint of the products. Wienerberger products offer the advantage of easy maintenance. Wienerberger products help Moreover, our products actively contribute to the preservation of historical monuments to preserve cultural heritage and classified buildings. Roofs are integral parts of buildings and testify to the design preferences, architectural styles and engineering methods characteristic of individual periods in history. Wienerberger roof tiles, which have a service life of over 100 years, help to preserve the original appearance of buildings of historical interest. “Trophées Aléonard” for the Our Aléonard roof tiles, for example, can be adjusted to regional traditions through their preservation of historical various sizes and colors; they are well suited for new construction, for the renovation of historical heritage buildings such as palaces, old villas or monasteries, and for entire roofscapes in towns. Since 1872, this roof tile has contributed to the preservation of cultural heritage. To promote the use of Aléonard roof tiles and support the preservation of historical buildings, our Wienerberger colleagues in France created the “Trophées Aléonard”, a prize awarded since 2004. The award honors roof-setters for their skilled use of Aléonard roof tiles. In 2014, a total of 35 projects were entered for the award in five categories: historical buildings, renovation, first-time use of the product, new buildings, and the special prize of the jury. Energy efficiency and climate action Energy efficiency and climate Anthropogenic climate change is a central challenge for the future. Wienerberger has set action as core tasks itself the goal of promoting the transition to a competitive, resource-efficient and energyefficient economy. We support the transition to a “low-carbon economy” with our energy-saving building material and infrastructure solutions and our energy-efficient building design concepts. In our opinion, the building materials of the future must contribute to the goal of slowing down climate change and to support climate change adaptation. Pipelife contributes In order to promote alternative and sustainable forms of energy generation, Pipelife investto sustainable energy ed in the improvement of its geothermal energy system and launched its own probing system in generation 2014. Ground probe systems and collectors for almost all applications are sold under the brand names of DUETA and GEOLIFE. In combination with Pipelife’s underfloor, wall and ceiling heating and cooling systems, energy generation from the earth is an important component in the sustainable and environment-friendly development of heating systems. KeraBase and KeraPro Steinzeug-Keramo’s climate-neutral pipes are an excellent illustration of the company’s vitrified clay pipes are commitment to climate and environmental protection. KeraBase and KeraPro vitrified clay climate-neutral pipes, produced by means of the future-oriented fast-firing process, are completely climateneutral – from the extraction of raw materials to delivery to the construction site. The total emissions caused throughout the process are calculated and compensated through climate action projects audited and registered on the basis of internationally recognized standards and guidelines. The importance attributed to sustainability and environmental protection at Steinzeug-Keramo is also reflected in the technology of trenchless installation by means of jacking pipes, and the company’s Cradle to Cradle® certification. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 81 Products Sustainability Report 2014 Essential Product Qualities The energy consumption of buildings also plays an important role in the fight against Clay blocks help to combat climate change. The European Union has therefore adopted a Directive requiring that, from climate change 1 January 2021, all new buildings meet the standard of a “nearly zero-energy building”. The Clay Building Materials Europe Division offers building material solutions to meet these future requirements, such as special bricks for external walls with a particularly high thermal insulation value. A clay block filled with insulating material is an innovative combination of a brick with high-quality insulating material in the perforations, which ensures excellent thermal insulation. Clay blocks without infill material also have excellent thermal insulation properties, as their heat conductivity is extremely low on account of the special ceramic material used and the design of the block geometry. When external walls are made of such innovative products, the façade does not require an additional insulating layer. As a result of global climate change, extreme weather events are occurring more and more Raineo® helps to avoid frequently in many parts of the world: we are experiencing excessive rainfall, long periods flooding and water pollution of drought, extreme heat and floods. Raineo®, Pipelife’s innovative rain water management system, helps to avoid flooding and water pollution, above all in urban areas. The Stormbox is a sophisticated modular system of plastic containers that serves as an underground water reservoir. It holds large quantities of rain water, which can later be used in the household or for irrigation purposes. One of the crucial challenges for a growing world population in times of climate change Pipelife products for is to increase agricultural yield. Irrigation is one way of addressing this challenge. However, in irrigation and drainage in agriculture order to maintain the quality of the soil, measures must be taken to prevent soil salination, e.g. through drainage. Moreover, the quantity of water drawn for irrigation must not exceed the natural recharge. Pipelife offers solutions for irrigation and drainage in agriculture. Drainage systems also help to prevent landslides, which tend to occur more frequently under the impact of heavy rainfall. Through the introduction of upon-rafter insulation systems for thermal rehabilitation, Sturmfix makes roof tiles Wienerberger is positioning itself as a full-range supplier in the roof segment. Due to extreme storm-proof wind and weather conditions, roofs have to meet more demanding requirements in terms of storm resistance. With this in mind, Wienerberger launched its patented Sturmfix system. Roof tiles fastened by means of special storm hooks resist even the worst storm. Tightness and avoidance of leakage Our plastic and vitrified clay pipes have excellent mechanical properties, such as high Infrastructure solutions for a compressive strength, abrasion resistance, bending tensile strength, resistance to biological and variety of applications chemical substances, and frost resistance, and meet the most demanding tightness requirements. Moreover, products by Pipelife and Steinzeug-Keramo are absolutely corrosion-proof and guaranteed to be leak-free. Thanks to these properties, plastic pipe systems by Pipelife and vitrified clay pipe systems by Steinzeug-Keramo are suited for a broad range of applications, such as rain and waste water disposal, sanitary and heating installations, sewage systems, and gas and drinking water supply systems. The ceramic coupling, an accessory manufactured by Steinzeug-Keramo, ensures the perKERAPORT sets new fect connection of vitrified clay pipes, regardless of whether a building is newly erected or standards of tightness and corrosion resistance retrofitted. Steinzeug-Keramo’s new KERAPORT manholes supplement the range of ceramic system solutions in the vertical dimension and set new standards of tightness and corrosion resistance. The manholes are available in nominal widths from DN 600 to DN 1200 and are lined with a tailor-made channel.

Soluforce Heavy, a steel-mesh-reinforced pipe of extremely high compressive strength, was developed for high-pressure applications in the oil and gas industry. Pipelife has continuously enlarged the Soluforce product range in recent years. Health and safety Healthy indoor climate: an Creating a healthy indoor environment is one of the most important issues for the future of essential quality feature for modern residential construction. In western industrialized countries, people spend about 90% Wienerberger of their time indoors. Usually, indoor air quality leaves a lot to be desired: pollutants, dry air, dust and mold have a negative impact on the indoor climate and constitute a health risk. It is for good reasons that bricks have been in use as a building material for thousands of years – brick buildings have excellent properties and guarantee a good quality of life for their inhabitants. Bricks create excellent Bricks qualify as a particularly healthy building material. Bricks are open to vapor diffusion, conditions for a healthy which means that air humidity in the room is ideally balanced and the indoor climate is both and comfortable indoor healthy and comfortable. Due to their high accumulation capacity, brick walls keep rooms atmosphere pleasantly cool in summer and warm in winter. Thus, our bricks score high in terms of indoor air quality and indoor climate.¹ Brick products for safety in As regards safety, our brick products offer a high level of protection in the event of a fire the event of natural disasters or an earthquake. Wienerberger’s Sturmfix system, for example, enables our roof tiles to resist extreme windstorms and prevents them from being blown off and hitting people. Our pipes, which are used for high-quality water supply and disposal systems, also have a positive impact on human health. Used for water supply systems, they ensure access to clean water. In sewage systems they improve urban hygiene, as they ensure safe waste water disposal. Pipelife’s Gas-Stop device Damage to gas supply lines in the course of civil-engineering work, incorrect installation of makes gas supply networks gas pipes in buildings, and natural disasters are the most frequent causes of gas leaks. Gas-Stop safe by Pipelife, a self-actuated, fast-closing valve for gas supply lines, makes gas supply lines safer. Compliance with all legal In order to avoid pollution by hazardous substances, each business unit takes responsiprovisions bility for compliance with the legal provisions in effect, such as REACH, the EU Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. Having observed all national and international legal provisions, we are not aware of any incidents of infringements of health-related rules in 2014. Recycling of near-natural materials All Wienerberger products can be recycled to a certain extent, but the percentage of recycled materials used in production depends on the material and the technical maturity of the re-use process. Therefore, the actual rate of recycling depends on the business unit concerned. 1 See also: Passive House Study, Part 3 Indoor Air Quality, Department for “Bauen und Umwelt” Donau-Universität Krems, on behalf of Wienerberger AG, Krems 2008. Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 83 Products Sustainability Report 2014 Essential Product Qualities, Targets and Future Measures Relating to Products Clay, a recyclable raw material, is the most important input material in ceramic production Ceramic production: (clay blocks, facing bricks, roof tiles and ceramic pipes). This results in a high rate of recyclabirecycled materials are added to the raw material mix lity of our ceramic products. Internal production residues, such as broken products or scrap, are returned into the production process after the necessary preparation. This holds, in particular, for Steinzeug-Keramo’s pipes and fittings, which are certified according to the Cradle to Cradle® standard. For certain product groups, recycled materials from external sources are used as additives to the raw material mix in the preparation process. Typical recycling materials from biogenic sources used as pore-forming agents in clay blocks are saw dust, straw, sunflower husks and paper fiber. In the production of ceramic pipes we also use stone meal from gravel production as well as ceramic residues from the production of clay pavers, roof tiles, sanitary tiles and other ceramic products which cannot be re-used there. As a prerequisite for the use of recycled materials from external sources, clearly defined Prerequisites for recycling: separation of materials from demolished buildings is essential. Wienerberger therefore makes a clearly defined separation of materials and awareness special effort to build awareness for the issue of recycling in the construction industry. Morebuilding in the construction over, we advocate the adoption of legal provisions and standards designed to make the use of industry recycled building materials easier and more economical in the future. We thoroughly study the possibility of re-using ceramic residues from building construction either in brick production or other applications (e.g. in landscaping). Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) granulates are the Percentage of recycled most important raw materials used in the production of plastic pipes. Increasing the percentage material to be increased at Pipelife of secondary raw materials in the raw material mix and, at the same time, maintaining the high level of product quality are among our research priorities. The percentage of secondary raw materials used depends on the production mix. In 2014, Pipelife used 58.9 kg of secondary raw materials per ton of products produced. This is to be increased to 70 kg/t by 2020. Recycled materials from external sources have to be collected and processed. Through Pipelife acts as collection its membership in the Austrian Working Group on Plastic Pipe Recycling (Österreichischer center for used pipes and fittings in Austria Arbeitskreis Kunststoffrohr Recycling, ÖAKR), Pipelife actively supports awareness building. Moreover, Pipelife production sites in Austria serve as collection centers for used plastic pipes and fittings. Sustainability during construction Various environmental aspects have to be taken into account during the construction Environmental aspects need phase. A high quality of construction work increases the durability of the product, minimizes to be taken into account during the construction the need for repairs, and helps to save natural resources. For example, trenchless methods of phase … installing Steinzeug-Keramo products avoid excavation work. The consumption of natural resources and the carbon footprint over the entire life cycle … in order to increase are reduced. Thorough planning of construction work also reduces the volume of scrap and the service life and avoid repairs quantity of products to be returned, which in turn diminishes the need for transport. Accident prevention, safety and health are other important aspects to be considered during the construction phase.

The decisions were taken on the basis of the materiality matrix developed in 2014 for the individual business units and at Group level. The measures foreseen are part of the Wienerberger Sustainability Roadmap 2020. Innovative Products Innovative products and In 2014, innovative products and system solutions accounted for about 25% of total resystem solutions account venues, compared with 24% in 2013. So far, however, there has been no Group-wide definition for 24.9% of total revenues of the term. Based on current market requirements, a definition will be agreed upon in 2015. Business-unit-specific targets for innovative products will therefore be communicated only in the reporting year 2015. Other measures will focus on the further development of building material and infrastructure system solutions and the related improvement in cost-effectiveness. Our efforts include the efficient organization of construction work and the development of solutions for modern, energy-efficient building in urban areas. Sustainability during the construction phase and during demolition has been identified as an essential aspect for the Wienerberger Group. In 2015, Semmelrock, for example, will continue to work on the development of paving systems that allow water to seep into the ground. Recyclability, recycling and re-use Further development of At Group level we commit to the use of secondary raw material, provided it is technically system solutions in building feasible. The availability of such material, production processes to ensure a uniform level of materials and infrastructure quality, possibilities of transport, and adequate processing will have to be evaluated. Clay Building Materials Europe (CBME) will perform a feasibility study in 2015, to be followed by an evaluation of potential roll-out to other local companies. North America has already introduced a production system based on a closed resource cycle. This means that scrap or waste is re-introduced into the production cycle. A pilot line for the use of fly ash in production is to be installed by 2016. Top priority will always be given to the quality of the finished product. Pipelife intends to increase the amount of recycling material per ton of product produced from 58.9 kg in 2014 to 70 kg in 2020. Semmelrock will analyze the recycling potential in its various fields of production in 2015 and subsequently evaluate the possibilities of substitution in the production process. Steinzeug-Keramo will undergo the periodic process of Cradle to Cradle® re-certification in 2015. Ease of installation Ease of installation has been identified as an essential aspect for Pipelife. For years, Pipelife has been working on solutions that facilitate the installation and use of plastic pipe systems. This issue will remain at the focus of Pipelife’s research and development activities.

For this reason, training sessions on issuer compliance are organized regularly in Vienna for the top management of the Wienerberger Holding and the top management of each business unit. Wienerberger’s Corporate Governance Report is contained in the 2014 Annual Report and published on the company’s website. Prevention of corruption Wienerberger is committed to upholding the principle of free and fair competition, which includes a firm stance against any form of corruption. We have always pursued the target of zero corruption incidents. A Group-wide guideline on business gifts informs our employees on what is considered to be lawful behavior. It provides orientation regarding the circumstances under which giving or accepting gifts constitutes a criminal offence. The guideline defines the term ‘business gift’ and explains the difference between a business gift and other forms of expression of appreciation. Moreover, it distinguishes between gift-giving in the public and the private domains and speciBack to contents Wienerberger AG Page 91 Social Responsibility Sustainability Report 2014 Business Ethics fies the corresponding rules of conduct. Finally, the guideline requires reports to be submitted to the Managing Board and/or the local management if a business gift has been either given or received. Anti-corruption training for employees of the local companies has to be provided by the local management and is subject to regular review by the holding company. The Wienerberger guideline on business gifts, which has been in force since 2010, is to be revised in the course of this year. The revision has become necessary on account of the transition to a division-based corporate structure and the associated shift of responsibilities to the business units. Monitoring compliance with legal provisions and internal guidelines is one of the functions Monitoring by the internal of the internal audit unit. In 2014, audits were performed in 20 companies, with a special focus audit unit prevents corruption on organization, purchasing, materials management, sales, human resources, corruption and anti-trust legislation. This corresponds to about one third of all operating companies of the Wienerberger Group. In the course of these audits it was found that all internal guidelines had been implemented in the countries audited and the employees concerned had been informed accordingly. Deviations from the guidelines, if any, were reported to the Managing Board and the Audit Committee, and the necessary measures, such as improvements in documentation, were agreed upon with the respective local management. The application of the four-eyes principle in business transactions with third parties is anFour-eyes principle in other important instrument for the prevention of corruption. For each transaction establishing, business transactions modifying or terminating rights and obligations, two signatures of authorized signatories of the local unit are required. This requirement is laid down in international Group guidelines and helps to prevent corruption at international level. We expect all employees of the Wienerberger Group to act in conformity of the law. Any Sanctions in the event infringement constitutes a breach of official duty. Confirmation of a suspected infringement of unlawful conduct entails labor law or civil law consequences, depending on the extent of damage caused. In the period under review, no charges were brought against Wienerberger for suspected corruption, and no penalty payments were due. Compliance with anti-trust legislation Anti-trust legislation serves to ensure free and effective competition. The management of Fair competition as a basis the company is convinced that a business policy based on fair competition is best suited to serve of our business policy the interests of the company as well as the interests of its shareholders and employees. For this reason, some years ago Wienerberger already introduced an anti-trust compliance Anti-trust compliance program. Through the provisions of the anti-trust guideline, our employees are made aware of program problems that may arise in the field of anti-trust law. The rules of conduct laid down in the guideline provide orientation on sensitive issues of competition law and are to be strictly observed. Among other issues, the guideline contains strict rules regarding contacts with competitors, especially with regard to market behavior, information exchange, prices and delivery conditions, Back to contents Social Responsibility Page 92 Wienerberger AG Business Ethics Sustainability Report 2014 and other forms of cooperation. As regards contacts with customers, distributors and suppliers, there are rules governing the determination of selling price ranges and other restrictions for distributors as well as exclusivity agreements. The guideline also includes provisions on intellectual property rights and mergers. Internal audit unit monitors Within the framework of the anti-trust compliance program, all local companies of the anti-trust compliance Wienerberger Group are obliged to organize regular training sessions. As a rule, anti-trust training events are organized once a year and conducted by a national anti-trust expert or our inhouse legal counsel. The local management is responsible for the organization of the training event and the selection of employees to be trained. The internal audit unit verifies that training programs have been held and monitors compliance with the guideline. Price-fixing is prohibited On account of the market position held by the Wienerberger Group in individual markets, and entails sanctions the price policies of our subsidiaries are followed attentively by the anti-trust authorities. There were no negative findings by the authorities in charge in 2014. This confirms the effectiveness of our compliance regime. We wish to point out that price agreements are not part of Wienerberger’s business practice; our internal guidelines explicitly prohibit such agreements and provide for severe sanctions in the event of violations. Compliance with national guidelines and rules Environmental, health In many countries, Wienerberger has to meet extensive and increasingly stringent requireand safety rules ments in the areas of environmental protection, health and safety. Compliance with such provisions, which may require investments in optimization measures, is a matter of course for Wienerberger. Responsibility lies with In accordance with Wienerberger’s decentralized structure, responsibility for the enforcelocal management ment of national rules and regulations and for compliance monitoring lies with the respective local management bodies. In line with national legal provisions, compliance officers have been appointed at country level, who evaluate legal compliance and report to the local authorities and the Wienerberger Managing Board. The internal audit unit regularly verifies compliance with this process and reports its findings to the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board. Guideline on compliance with sanction laws New: Guideline on A new guideline on compliance with economic and financial sanction laws, applicable to compliance with Wienerberger AG and all companies of the Wienerberger Group, was issued by the Managing sanction laws Board in December 2014. The objective of this guideline is to ensure compliance with sanctions imposed on certain countries and/or their nationals within the Wienerberger Group by 1 January 2015. Deliveries to and business contracts with individuals and/or organizations under sanctions are prohibited.

Therefore, different stakeholder groups are addressed by different departments or organizational units within Wienerberger, and our communication instruments vary accordingly: In addition to personal meetings, we communicate and provide information through regular newsletters and information brochures, Internet-based information platforms and information events. We adjust our contacts with neighbors, local politicians and associations to local traditions – sometimes opting for strictly formalized stakeholder committees as a framework for structured exchanges, sometimes choosing a more informal setting. Regardless of the specific mode of contact, the most important point for Wienerberger is to present itself as a company that is open and transparent in its relations with stakeholders and takes their concerns seriously. Our employees are kept informed of corporate targets and strategies as well as current deCommunication with velopments and measures in a timely and comprehensive fashion, the aim being to provide a our employees motivating working environment and stimulate personal initiative.

Wienerberger’s interest lies in with suppliers the long-term and sustainable supply of the required natural resources, materials and products in accordance with the principles of sustainability. Within the framework of our business relations, we make sure that our suppliers comply with our ecological and social standards, which we clearly communicate to them. Pipelife, for instance, has laid down these standards in the “Pipelife Code of Conduct” to be signed by suppliers upon conclusion of a contract. Communication The media expect targeted and timely information on strategic and current issues. We, for with the media our part, expect to be given fair media coverage.

We continuously support a large targeted help for the needy number of social projects and organizations in almost all the countries we operate in. In accordance with the Wienerberger donations guideline, we support people in need in a targeted manner through product donations. We are convinced that we can help best in our fields of core competence, i.e. the provision of solutions in the fields of building materials and infrastructure and the transfer of sustainable construction know-how. Successful cooperation with We regard affordable housing as a fundamental human right. In 2012, Wienerberger thereHabitat for Humanity fore began to cooperate with Habitat for Humanity, an international non-profit organization focusing on the provision of housing for families in need on the basis of the principles of selfhelp, self-awareness and individual responsibility. The objective of the current cooperation is to build 155 houses for socially underprivileged families in Bulgaria and Romania. As an expert in building material solutions, Wienerberger contributes to the improvement of living conditions for people with insufficient means through donations in kind. Building materials for a total of 47 houses were donated. For two days, the participants of Ready4Excellence, a training program for young employees to be prepared for international key positions in Wienerberger AG, provided hands-on support for the construction of houses for poor families in Bulgaria. Support for construction of Wienerberger also supported the construction of the Casa Sperantei Hospice in Romania Casa Sperantei Hospice in with donations in kind and by assuming logistics costs. The hospice, which was opened in the Bucharest fall of 2014, provides an adequate and dignified environment for terminally ill children and adults, as well as their relatives, in the most difficult time of their life. Aid for Western Balkan flood Besides planning and implementing non-profit projects in cooperation with humanitarian victims in cooperation with organizations, we also want to render instant and non-bureaucratic assistance in the event of charity organizations natural disasters. When large parts of South-Eastern Europe were devastated by a disastrous flood in the spring of 2015, the Pipelife and Clay Building Materials Europe (CBME) business units, together with Tondach Gleinstätten, decided to help the flood victims rebuild their homes. In cooperation with Caritas Switzerland, a humanitarian organization with many years of experience in the construction of homes for victims of the civil war in the region, Wienerberger erected for example about 30 houses in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Clay blocks from CBME, clay roof tiles from Tondach Gleinstätten and installation pipes from Pipelife were donated for this purpose. Distributing the donations was a considerable logistic challenge, but further projects are already being prepared within the framework of this aid campaign. Round two of WISBA In addition to a range of charitable projects, in-kind donations and aid campaigns, Wienertraining program berger has organized and financed the Wienerberger Sustainable Building Academy (WISBA) successfully completed since 2013. Round two of this international training program was successfully completed in 2014 with 24 participants from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Hungary and Switzerland. The objective of the program is to support students of architecture and construction engineering through additional, practice-relating training in sustainable building. Architects and construction engineers who have internalized the principles of sustainability and bear them in mind throughout the construction phase, are an essential prerequisite if a building is to meet the most advanced standards of sustainability and remain functional over a long period of time. The 2014 training program focused on a wide range of subjects, such as resource-efficient wall systems, prevention of overheating of buildings in summer, and environmental certification of buildings.

The decisions were taken on the basis of the materiality matrix elaborated in 2014, which was subsequently evaluated at business unit level and at Group level. They form part of the Wienerberger Sustainability Roadmap 2020. At Group level, we strictly pursue the target of “zero incidents of corruption” and expect all our employees to act accordingly. Relevant indicators, such as the number of departments audited, the number of incidents or the number of hours spent in ethics training, are to be defined and subsequently evaluated in the course of 2015. Moreover, quantitative investments in social projects will be defined in 2015.

Such companies therefore bear a special responsibility and should act in an exemplary manner. The minimum standards to be complied with include, above all, the principles of the UN Global Compact regarding human rights, labor, environmental protection and the fight against corruption¹. Through its accession to the UN Global Compact in 2003, Wienerberger officially committed to the ten principles and undertook to foster their implementation within the framework of the company’s possibilities. Once a year, we report on progress achieved in this respect. The 2014 Communication on Progress in respect of the Global Compact forms part of our 2014 Sustainability Report. In order to ensure maximum transparency and to make it easier for our readers to find the individual examples, we have aggregated the most important statements on the ten principles and, in addition, marked the corresponding indicators of the GRI Index and added references to the pages concerned. Global Compact Principles – Human Rights Principles 1 and 2: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, and make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Commitment Within its sphere of influence, Wienerberger guarantees the protection of basic human rights. By adopting the Wienerberger Social Charter, Wienerberger committed itself to comply with the conventions and recommendations of the International Labour Organization (ILO). This includes providing safe and healthy working conditions. The safety of its employees is a matter of top priority for Wienerberger. Progress in 2014 Through the Group-wide Wienerberger Safety Initiative, uniform safety standards were implemented in 2010 in order to minimize the frequency and severity of accidents. For example, our American colleagues at General Share in Georgia (belonging to the North America Division) have not lost a single working day in production through occupational accidents for ten consecutive years. Two other production sites of General Shale have been accident-free for more than five years. The Pipelife production sites in Greece, Ireland, Austria, Poland, Russia and Sweden also reported a track record of zero accidents in the year under review. In 2014, the “zero accident” target was incorporated into the Sustainability Roadmap as a Group-wide target. Moreover, the existing health and safety standards were further developed for the entire Wienerberger Group; the scope of activities within the framework of the Safety Initiative was broadened, in particular through intensified safety training measures. In the year under review, the Clay Building Materials Europe (CBME) Business Unit implemented the Safety Alert, a standardized process of dealing with occupational accidents, at all CBME production sites; 1 Please click here to view the ten principles of the UN Global Compact: www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles Back to contents UN Global Compact: Page 104 Wienerberger AG Communication on Progress Sustainability Report 2014 2014 Global Compact Principles – Human Rights moreover, the Business Unit honored outstanding achievements in the field of safety through the Safety Award introduced in 2014. For years, Pipelife has made special efforts in accident prevention with its STOP™ Program (Safety Training Observation Program). In addition, Pipelife introduced the Safety Call measure in 2014, which is to be implemented in 2015 on the basis of experience gained to date. Semmelrock has been working with its new safety program “Safety@Semmelrock” since 2013. The program is based, in particular, on the so-called AIRS document (“Accident Investigation Report Semmelrock”), which is used to centrally record, analyze and communicate all accidents and/or incidents. The main purpose is to build awareness among employees by documenting and communicating the measures taken, for instance on the occasion of the Safety Day, which was organized in 2014 with all plant managers and heads of engineering in attendance. In Poland, a “safety culture” was implemented through the display of guiding principles, the introduction of a bonus system, and visualization techniques. Steinzeug-Keramo, having optimized its production facilities, now focuses on training and awareness-building in the areas of safety and avoidance of occupational hazards by issuing targeted safety instructions for each individual workplace. Health is a human right. Wienerberger therefore ensures safe and healthy working conditions at all its production sites. In 2014, the average number of sick leave days per employee declined slightly in almost all segments; a reduction from 9.7 to 9.2 days was achieved at Group level (excluding the North America Division). Moreover, Wienerberger is making every effort to reduce the exposure of its employees to potentially hazardous substances. In our core business, i.e. the production of ceramic building materials, attention is focused, above all, on the exposure of employees to respirable crystalline silica. At Group level, the target of rolling out respirable crystalline silica measurements to at least 95% of all Wienerberger ceramic plants by 2020 was reached already in 2013. The CBME Business Unit increased the percentage of potentially exposed employees subject to dust exposure monitoring to 95.6% and the percentage of potentially exposed employees having received training to 93.8% in 2014. Given the fact that Tondach Gleinstätten, the producer of roof tiles which was taken over fully by Wienerberger in 2014 but is not yet included in the above indicators, we continue to pursue this target. North America (excluding the Pipelife production site) will roll out measurements of exposure to respirable crystalline silica to its non-ceramic plants in 2015. Additionally, in 2015 all full-time employees of North America will be covered by a health insurance regime which in certain respects is broader in scope than the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Wienerberger has also begun to monitor observance of the principles of the Global Compact along its supply chains and will further step up its efforts in this respect. Today already, Pipelife suppliers, for example, have to comply with the “Pipelife Suplier Code of Conduct”.¹ ¹ www.pipelife.com/media/com/about_pipelife/Supplier_Code_of_Conduct.pdf Back to contents Wienerberger AG Page 105 UN Global Compact: Sustainability Report 2014 Communication on Progress 2014 Global Compact Principles – Labor Standards Global Compact Principles – Labor Standards Principles 3, 4, 5 and 6: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; the effective abolition of child labor; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Commitment Zero tolerance of child labor and discrimination is an absolute must for Wienerberger. Even before its accession to the UN Global Compact in 2003, Wienerberger committed itself, by signing the 2001 Social Charter, to ensure that employment and working conditions throughout the Group comply with national legislation and/or are based on collective bargaining agreements as a minimum standard. Thus, Wienerberger operates in accordance with the recommendations of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Besides adequate and safe working conditions, fair remuneration and the right of assembly and collective bargaining are high priorities for us. In our effort to combat discrimination in recruitment and employment, we consider it essential to offer our female employees an attractive working environment and the same opportunities as their male colleagues. At the same time, we want to make sure that our male employees benefit from the same flexible solutions that enable them to reconcile work and family obligations as their female colleagues. Progress in 2014 Approximately 80% of all Wienerberger employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Agency and temporary workers as well as employees under limited employment contracts accounted for 4% of the total workforce in 2014. Companies with a primary focus on the production of building materials traditionally have a high percentage of male employees. In 2013 already, Wienerberger reached its target of 45% female employees in administration. In sales, marketing and warehousing, Wienerberger was able to increase the percentage of women by 0.2% to 24.2% in 2014. In production, the percentage of women decreased by 0.2% to 4.3%. At senior management level, Wienerberger succeeded in increasing the percentage of women from 7% in 2013 to 8% in 2014. Back to contents UN Global Compact: Page 106 Wienerberger AG Communication on Progress Sustainability Report 2014 2014 Global Compact Principles – Environmental Protection Global Compact Principles – Environmental Protection Principles 7, 8 and 9: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Commitment Our goal is to minimize the environmental impact of our production processes and our use of raw materials. A responsible way of operating our clay extraction sites, the best possible conservation of resources, and an increase in the percentage of recycled materials used: these are the central principles governing our production activity. We are well aware that industrial production processes always involve a certain degree of interference with the natural environment. Therefore, production in harmony with the environment is a matter of great importance to us. Progress in 2014 Specific energy consumption and specific CO2 emissions are two of the essential indicators of environmentally friendly production technologies. Wienerberger has set itself the target to reduce these parameters by 20% each in ceramic production by 2020, as compared with 2010. At Group level, Wienerberger succeeded in lowering its specific energy consumption in 2014 by 4% from the previous year’s level and by 11% as compared with the reference year 2010. CMBE, for example, reached the reduction target for specific energy consumption in clay block production already in 2014 (-21%) and is well on track in roof tile production (-6%). In facing brick production, a 3% reduction from the previous year’s level was achieved. As regards specific CO2 emissions, reductions of between 2% and 8% were reported by the three product groups. Steinzeug-Keramo was able to lower its specific energy consumption by 1% in 2014, whereas specific CO2 emissions from fuel remained at the previous year’s level. A highly satisfactory development was reported by Semmelrock, where specific energy consumption in concrete paver production declined by 11% as compared with the reference year 2010 and by 6% as compared with 2013. The Group-wide target of reducing the volume of water drawn from public networks to 40% of total water consumption was reached ahead of schedule in 2013, and reduction efforts continued throughout 2014. Pipelife, the production segment with the highest specific water consumption, redefined its target in 2014 and now aims at lowering its water consumption from public networks to 0.55m³ per ton of product produced. In support of the precautionary approach to environmental challenges, Wienerberger has, for many years, worked intensively on the drafting of eco-balances and the preparation of environmental product declarations (EDPs) for its entire product range on a voluntary basis. Moreover, all ceramic pipes and fittings produced by Steinzeug-Keramo have been successfully certified according to the Cradle to Cradle® concept. Our initiatives aimed at developing a higher level of awareness for environmental issues include, in particular, the Wienerberger Sustainable Building Academy (WISBA). This international training program for students of architecture and construction engineering was launched by Wienerberger in 2013 and rolled out to six countries in 2014; 24 students from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Hungary and Switzerland participated in the program.

Commitment Wienerberger is committed to fair and free competition; this implies a firm stance against any form of corruption. We have always pursued the target of zero incidents of corruption and expect all our employees to act accordingly. Progress in 2014 No charges for suspected corruption were brought against Wienerberger in 2014, nor were any penalty payments imposed. Wienerberger expects all employees of the Wienerberger Group to act in full compliance with the law. Any infringement constitutes a breach of duty. Should a suspicion of unlawful behavior be confirmed, the employee concerned will be sanctioned under labor law or civil law, depending on the extent of damage caused. In the course of 2014, the internal audit unit audited 20 companies with a special emphasis on organizational structures, purchasing, materials management, sales and human resources as well as corruption and anti-trust legislation. In all, the audit covered approximately one third of the operational companies of the Group. The audit showed that all internal guidelines have been implemented in the countries audited and brought to the knowledge of the employees concerned. Deviations from the guidelines, if any, were reported to the Managing Board and the Audit Committee, and appropriate measures, such as improvements of documentation processes, were taken in cooperation with the management of the company concerned.

This engagement is subject to the “General Conditions of Contract for the Public Accounting Professions” (AAB 2011) as amended February 21, 2011, issued by the Austrian Chamber of Public Accountants and Tax Advisors. Our liability towards the Company and also towards third parties is limited in accordance with Section 8 of the AAB 2011. Responsibility of the management The preparation of the Sustainability Report 2014 in accordance with the criteria set out in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI criteria”) • Stakeholder inclusiveness • Comparability • Sustainability context • Accuracy • Materiality • Timeliness • Completeness • Clarity • Balance • Reliability is the responsibility of the management of Wienerberger AG. This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods for preparing the Sustainability Report 2014, making assumptions and estimates of individual sustainability disclosures that are plausible under the given circumstances as well as designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes, where relevant for the preparation of the Sustainability Report 2014. Limitation of the scope of the engagement Our responsibility is to give an assessment, based on our work, on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the quantitative disclosures in chapter “Employees” on the GRI aspect of “Occupational Health and Safety” (page 43 to 48, GRI LA6, LA7) as well as in chapter “Environmental Protection in Production” on the GRI aspects of “Energy” (page 64 to 66, GRI EN3, EN5) and “Emissions” (page 66 to 68, GRI EN15, EN18) of the Sustainability Report 2014 have not been prepared in accordance with the GRI criteria as set out in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4. Our review was limited to the headquarters in Vienna. Responsibility of the independent auditor We have performed our engagement in accordance with Expert Opinion KFS/PG 13 for assurance engagements. This standard requires us to comply with our professional standards and to plan and perform the engagement in a way that enables us to draw conclusions in accordance with KFS/PG 13. Engagement approach In a limited assurance engagement, the work performed is less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement and, therefore, less assurance is obtained. We performed our work, using appropriate random samples, based on our due judgment and to the extent required to obtain limited assurance. In the course of our engagement, we therefore obtained relevant evidence based on risk and materiality assessments in order to obtain this limited assurance on the compliance of the disclosures according to the scope of the engagement with the GRI criteria mentioned above. In doing so, our work performed at the headquarters of Wienerberger AG in Vienna, Austria, particularly included the following: • Inspection of relevant documentation of the process for preparing the Sustainability Report 2014 as well as of existing documents and systems on the sustainability management and their sample testing. • Interviewing employees materially involved in the preparation of the contents of the report from the departments of Corporate Sustainability Management (CSO), Corporate Reporting, Controlling, Corporate Public Affairs, Corporate Engineering and Corpoarte Human Resources of Wienerberger AG in Vienna. • Telephone calls with data providers for Occupational Health and Safety from CBME country organizations in France and Poland. • Sample comparison for a selection of disclosures included in the Sustainability Report 2014 according to the scope of the engagement with centrally provided records by country organizations as well as any side calculations. Conclusion Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the quantitative disclosures in chapter “Employees” on the GRI aspect of “Occupational Health and Safety” (page 43 to 48, GRI LA6, LA7) as well as in chapter “Environmental Protection in Production” on the GRI aspects of “Energy” (page 64 to 66, GRI EN3, EN5) and “Emissions” (page 66 to 68, GRI EN15, EN18) of the Sustainability Report 2014 have not, in any material aspects, been prepared in accordance with the criteria of stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality, completeness, balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity, and reliability of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 4 of GRI.
