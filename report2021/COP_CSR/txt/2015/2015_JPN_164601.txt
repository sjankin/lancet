Annual Report 2015 Year ended March 31, 2015 Overview of Marubeni To All Our Stakeholders The year ended March 31, 2015, was a difficult one for Marubeni due to the rapid deterioration of the natural resources market. We were consequently forced to recognize impairment losses, and profits fell as a result. However, I would like to focus on the fact that these impairment losses effectively removed several concerns which had been plaguing us. Looking ahead, the year ending March 31, 2016, will be the final year of the three-year medium-term management plan, Global Challenge 2015 (GC2015). We have thus positioned this year as a time for making a new start with an eye to the future, and are undertaking widespread structural reforms to facilitate this effort. Under the new organizational structure, all members of the Marubeni Group will unite in the pursuit of further value and growth. At the Marubeni Group, we are committed to contributing to social and economic development as well as to the betterment of people’s daily lives by helping resolve social issues through business activities as a responsible member of the global community. We believe that it is our mission to provide higher value in this way. Going forward, we will relish great challenges, working always to maintain a harmonious state of coexistence with the ever-changing world as we build a Marubeni Group that is more ambitious, stronger, and flexible.  August 2015 Fumiya Kokubu President and CEO Company Creed: “ Fairness, Innovation, and Harmony” (formulated in 1949) Calligraphy by Shinobu Ichikawa, first President of Marubeni Co., Ltd., now Marubeni Corporation Marubeni Annual Report 2015 Overview of Marubeni Marubeni’s Ambitions Marubeni’s Business Stance Toward Business Development Marubeni Management Philosophy (formulated in 2003, revised in 2008) Financial Information In accordance with the spirit grounded in “Fairness, Innovation, and Harmony,” the Marubeni Group is proudly committed to social and economic development and safeguarding the global environment by conducting fair and upright corporate activities.

Marubeni Annual Report 2015 3 What We Do—Marubeni’s Business Model The Marubeni Group has continued to evolve as a general trading company, advancing in step with the development and maturity of the Japanese economy. Acting ahead of the times, we have pursued constant innovation within the Company, and are now creating new value on a global scale. After the conclusion of the second World War, Japan’s economic development was fueled by a form of addedTrading value trade in which materials would be imported into the country and then exported as finished products. In the Grain Business midst of this trend, general trading companies utilized their Based on facilities for grain procurement, storage, and transaction intermediary functions to grow their busiexport owned by Marubeni’s subsidiaries and affiliates in producing countries, Marubeni is committed to realizing nesses by serving as somewhat of an “advance guard” for efficient and stable supply, and will further enhance its national exports. Later, in the 1980s, general trading comability to ship and distribute to the world market. panies entered a difficult era, the so-called “Winter of General Trading Companies,” in which the meaning for their very existence was called into question. Adversity continued into the 1990s, when the collapse of Japan’s bubble economy forced these companies to deal with massive quantities of bad debt. To overcome these U.S. and South American farmers ordeals, Marubeni pushed forward with the strengthening of its financial bases, strategically selecting businesses to which attention would be focused as part of this process. At the same time, we ambitiously advanced into new businesses, conducting investments in numerous fields. These efforts led us to our current business model, which entails both trading and business investment. In the grain field, for example, we have established a solid global value chain that encompasses upstream grain procurement, midstream storage and transportation, and downstream sales operations. In natural resource and Major Operating Companies energy fields, Marubeni participates in the development Gavilon Holdings, LLC (U.S.) and production of natural resources to contribute to a Columbia Grain, Inc.

However, we at Marubeni believe that general trading companies have a duty to society in the midst of such change, and we therefore see changes as business opportunities. At the same time, we realize that it is absolutely essential for Marubeni to coexist with society and the environment if it is to continue growing sustainably. Each member of the Marubeni Group must address changes head-on as we strive to adopt a more global perspective on the issues faced in different countries and regions, and then work to resolve these issues through our business activities.

However, the country is faced with the need to develop basic industries other than oil. In Angola, Marubeni is undertaking the rehabilitation and modernization of three textile factories, and also engaging in projects related to sugar, bioethanol, and other industrial plants. Two of these factories have been completely rehabilitated, and Marubeni will continue to provide technical guidance to these facilities for several years after the rehabilitation project has finished. Our activities in this country are playing an important role in restoring its production capabilities, which were devastated by civil war, and in creating employment.

Marubeni is actively supporting the reconstruction effort while also undertaking renewable energy projects in this region. As one such project, the Company has been contracted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry to participate in a floating offshore wind farm demonstration project that will take place approximately 20 km off the coast of Fukushima. In addition, we have commenced commercial operation at the Iwanuma Rinku Mega Solar Power Plant, which takes advantage of farmland that was damaged by the earthquake, and the hydropower plant, which draws water from rivers in Shimogo Town, Fukushima. These projects not only play an important role in the proliferation of eco-friendly renewable Turbine at Fukushima FORWARD floating power but are also contributing to revitalization of the quakeoffshore wind farm demonstration project stricken Tohoku region and the reconstruction of its industries.

Marubeni invested in a grain export terminal on the west coast of the United States in the 1970s, and has been conducting grain procurement, storage, and export operations since then. Marubeni will enlarge its grain shipment capacity, and thereby contribute to the realization of worldwide food security by providing a stable supply of grain. In the agricultural material field, meanwhile, we offer services that incorporate state-ofthe-art agricultural management techniques and are fine-tuned to the needs of farmers in order to help boost crop production volumes. Grain harvesting (U.S.) Stable Supply of Natural Resources Supporting Economic Growth In the resource-rich region of South America, Marubeni is conducting natural gas liquefaction operations in Peru while also collaborating with Antofagasta plc of the United Kingdom to jointly develop and operate three mining projects in Chile: the Los Pelambres Copper Mine, the Centinela Copper Mine, and the Antucoya Copper Mine. We also export copper cathodes mined in Chile and other parts of South America to Japan and all areas of Asia. Through these activities, we aim to contribute to the realization of a stable, long-term supply of copper, which is indispensable to economic growth, through both resource development and trading operations.

However, China, which Financial Information had previously been a major driving force behind the global economy, saw the pace of its economic growth decline. These factors contributed to the rapid deterioration of conditions in the natural resources market that began during the second half of the fiscal year. This resulted in a substantial drop in the prices of crude oil and copper, both of which have a particularly large influence on the Company’s performance. As such, the year ended March 31, 2015, was a ­difficult one for us. Due to these factors, we were forced to record impairment losses on resource projects centered on oil and gas interests. At the same time, we took an impairment loss on the goodwill of Gavilon Holdings, LLC, a U.S. grain and fertilizer distributor, after reviewing this company’s business plans. These factors caused profit attributable to owners of the parent for the year Corporate Information ended March 31, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as “net profit”), to decrease ¥105.3 billion year on year, to ¥105.6 billion. This concentrated recording of losses was an immense disappointment for our shareholders, and we fully acknowledge the gravity of this situation. Marubeni Annual Report 2015 15 Message from the President and CEO However, I would like to focus on the fact that these impairment losses effectively removed several concerns which had been plaguing us. Moving forward, we will cut a fresh start, and devote our efforts to strengthening Marubeni’s earnings base and financial position to realize further growth and heightened corporate value.

Operating profit is the sum of gross trading profit and SGA expenses, and provision for doubtful accounts. Profitability Improvement Centered on Non-Natural Resources-Related Businesses When the impacts of the one-time losses are excluded, net profit actually increased ¥5.0 billion year on year, to approximately ¥230.0 billion, and it can therefore be said that the Company’s base profitability improved. Looking more closely at this increase, we see that the ¥15.0 billion decrease in profit from natural resources-related businesses was outweighed by a ¥20.0 billion rise in profit in non-natural resources-related businesses. This situation illustrates the steady growth in earnings in the machinery and food operations, which have traditionally been areas of strength for Marubeni.

This was largely a result of favorable foreign currency adjustments from overseas business activities due to the depreciation of the yen as well as higher retained earnings stemming from the accumulation of income. Net interest-bearing debt increased ¥396.6 billion, to ¥2,887.6 billion, due to previously planned new investments, and the net debt–equity (D/E) ratio rose to 1.72 times as a result. We therefore failed to achieve our initial Marubeni’s Ambitions goal for this ratio, which was 1.60 times. This outcome was mainly because of the recording of one-time losses. Nevertheless, we maintain our basic policy of reducing the net D/E ratio to continually improve the Company’s financial position.

There are three main points in these reforms. (For details, please refer to Structural Reforms on page 24.) The first point is strengthening our business divisions. By separating these into smaller units, we effectively strengthened the capabilities of our business on the frontlines. Now above these smaller business divisions, we established business groups. Each business group was appointed Financial Information a chief executive officer (CEO), who is responsible for managing their group in a flexible manner from a broad perspective based on Company-wide management policies and issues. The second point is introducing a vertically-structured global accounting system. By consolidating all of the Company’s budgeting and accounting functions within each business division, we aim to more effectively advance global strategies in each business area in order to strengthen and expand our overseas business. Corporate Information Marubeni Annual Report 2015 17 Message from the President and CEO The third and final point is reinforcing our risk management systems. When shifting to the current organizational structure, a group planning and strategy department was installed in each business group. These departments will be staffed by employees belonging to the Corporate Staff Group—our planning and administrative management departments—and will help reinforce risk management systems at frontline operations in Japan and overseas. Under this new organizational structure and with these new systems in place, all members of the Marubeni Group will unite in our relentless pursuit of higher levels of growth. New Investments to Underpin Sustainable Growth Over the three-year period of the current medium-term management plan, Global Challenge 2015 (GC2015), which was commenced in April 2013, we planned to carry out new investments totaling ¥1.1 trillion to ensure that Marubeni sees robust ongoing growth into the future. Approximately ¥900.0 billion of this amount has already been invested during the past two years. Major natural resources-related investments conducted in the year ended March 31, 2015, included phased investments in the Roy Hill Iron Ore Project in Australia and the Antucoya Copper Mine in Chile made in conjunction with the progress of these projects. In non-natural resources-related businesses, investments in the electric power field—an area of strength for the Company—included those in the Sur Combined Cycle Power Plant project in Oman and a natural gas-fired thermal power plant project in the United States. Also in non-natural resourcesrelated areas, we conducted two major food and consumer product investments in the United States, namely the acquisition of Eastern Fish Company, a major seafood distributor, and investment in an agricultural material retailing business. These new investments have contributed to the steady strengthening of the Company’s earnings base.

At the same time, we hope to achieve a positive free cash flow in the year ending March 31, 2016. While we had not originally intended to make positive free cash flow a priority of GC2015, we Marubeni’s Ambitions have changed our policy in consideration of the recent impairment losses and subsequent massive revision to performance targets. Under this new policy, we will practice exhaustive cash flow management, rapidly pursuing improvements in the efficiency of working capital utilization, while also collecting the returns from past investments and advancing asset replacement. New investment candidates will be selected based on rigorous evaluations with the aim of improving the Company’s financial position. However, our basic stance of ambitiously entering into new businesses will remain unchanged. Performance Forecasts and Shareholder Returns The operating environment remains uncertain with regard to the future of the natural resources Marubeni’s Business market and domestic and overseas economic conditions. We had initially targeted net profit in the ¥250.0 billion to ¥300.0 billion range in the year ending March 31, 2016, the final year of GC2015. However, we now believe that accomplishing this target may not be possible. Given the current difficult environment, we are now forecasting a net profit of ¥180.0 billion. In natural resources-related businesses, we are projecting an increase in profits in the year ending March 31, 2016. However, this will be largely due to the rebound from impairment losses recorded in the year ended March 31, 2015. In the midst of a market slump, we expect that the operating environment for these businesses will remain challenging. Non-natural resourcesStance Toward Business Development related businesses, meanwhile, will continue to post strong earnings, particularly in the electric power, transportation machinery, and food fields. The large contributions from these businesses are expected to support the overall earnings of the Company. Turning to finances, we expect net interest-bearing debt to amount to ¥2.9 trillion and total equity to come to ¥1.8 trillion. As result, the net D/E ratio will decrease to 1.6 times. New investments will continue, but we intend to first maintain our financial health in order to strengthen the Company’s financial position. As for shareholder returns, we had initially intended to examine the possibility of raising the dividend ratio after confirming that GC2015 was progressing smoothly. However, as I have mentioned, we now expect that we will be unable to meet our profit targets for the year ending March Financial Information 31, 2016, due to the substantial deterioration of conditions in the natural resources market. This market slump is expected to continue over the foreseeable future, and the Company’s business environment will likely remain uncertain going forward. Considering these factors, we have chosen to forgo increasing the dividend payout ratio. In the year ending March 31, 2016, we will continue to target a payout ratio of 20%, and therefore plan to issue dividend payments of ¥21 per share. In April 2016, we will launch the next medium-term management plan, and we expect to formulate a new policy for the dividend payout ratio at this time. As for the year ending March 31, 2016, it is possible that net profit could surpass our forecast of ¥180.0 billion, and we therefore would raise dividends from the currently planned level of ¥21 per share. Corporate Information Marubeni Annual Report 2015 19 Message from the President and CEO Reinforcing the Management Foundation Strengthening Corporate Governance To realize sustainable growth, the Marubeni Group places strengthening corporate governance among its top management priorities. The Company’s Board of Directors consists of 12 directors, two of which are outside directors, and the Board of Corporate Auditors consists of five corporate auditors, three of which are outside corporate auditors. Each of the outside directors and corporate auditors has accumulated extensive experience and insight in their respective industries, and discussions at meetings of the Board of Directors and Board of Corporate Auditors are lively, with all officers providing suggestions and advice without being confined by the Company’s corporate culture and customs. At the same time, introducing an outside perspective into management will allow for more appropriate restraint and supervisory functions. In Japan, circumstances surrounding corporate governance have been undergoing immense change due to the enactment of Japan’s Stewardship Code and Corporate Governance Code, and the resulting drive by companies to adapt to these codes. The Marubeni Group, as well, is committed to providing an earnest and proper response to these and other changes in governance policy. Compliance at Marubeni is spearheaded by the Compliance Committee, which reports directly to me. In the year ended March 31, 2015, we established the Compliance Control Department as a full-time internal organization. Today, we continue to reinforce compliance systems and programs to prevent bribery and other forms of misconduct on an ongoing basis. We also implemented a variety of other initiatives, including publishing the 12th edition of the Marubeni Group Compliance Manual and formulating activity plans based on the plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle. Going forward, we will continue to develop more comprehensive corporate governance ­systems to further improve corporate value. Human Resource Development and a Workplace Environment that Supports Employee Success We see human resources (HR) as our most valuable asset. Based on this belief, the HR Strategy Committee, which I chair personally, guides the Company in developing HR that are capable of responding to the diversification of our business models and aggressive expansion on the global stage. One of the key measures of GC2015 is to “further top management-led human resources strategy,” and accordingly we are advancing HR initiatives through a three-pronged approach emphasizing practical experience, assessment and incentives, and training. In regard to diversity management, we have established a team within the Human Resources Department, and are developing a workplace environment to promote the advancement of female employees and to support senior-citizen employees. To make the environment even more conducive, Marubeni has also developed internal healthcare management systems to ensure its employees are both highly energetic and productive. These efforts have earned prominent recognition, and Marubeni was selected for inclusion in the Nadeshiko Brand and Brand of Companies Enhancing Corporate Value through the Health and Productivity Management Selection indexes created jointly by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). 20 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 Overview of Marubeni Realization of Dreams and the Marubeni Spirit When I greet the latest group of ambitious new employees each spring, I always explain to them that the most important quality of a general trading company employee is to have big dreams. I then encourage them to work to realize their dreams, while asking that they remain highly motivated toward making contributions to customers and local communities through Marubeni’s business. Marubeni’s Ambitions Marubeni is rich in monetary and information resources, and has developed corporate functions and know-how that are ideal for supporting businesses. We also have a robust network of connections. I think these tangible and intangible assets can serve as infrastructure for employees to use as they boldly pursue their dreams. As leader of the Company, I want our employees to dream big. Marubeni must be the type of company that inspires its employees and enables them to realize these dreams. The world continues to face countless issues, such as those related to natural resources, food supplies, and the environment. These are issues that Marubeni should strive to help resolve as a general trading company. We will address these issues while always maintaining a forwardlooking stance and boldly testing the limits of our potential. This is the philosophy encapsulated Marubeni’s Business in the Marubeni Spirit. Our business should spread the seeds of prosperity in the regions of the world where we operate, changing them for the better, while also driving social and economic development in Japan. Recognizing this, we will continue growing our business with a strong sense of commitment. The Marubeni Group will never cease advancing its quest to always be a good corporate citizen and a company deemed trustworthy by its stakeholders. Stance Toward Business Development Marubeni Spirit The Marubeni Spirit summarizes the corporate culture and values of the Marubeni Group and informs the attitudes and actions of its employees.

Marubeni Annual Report 2015 23 Structural Reforms If the Company is to increase its competitiveness in the global market and flexibly implement aggressive strategies and measures, its operating base and organizational structure will both need to be strengthened. Aware of this, Marubeni began operating under a new business organizational structure on April 1, 2015, and is pursing further growth and improved corporate value with this new structure.

Stance Toward Business Development Financial Information Corporate Information 9 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 105 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Business Overview Marubeni Corporation (the “Company”) is a corporation domiciled in Japan. The Company and its domestic and overseas subsidiaries, which are controlled by the Company mainly through direct or indirect holdings of the majority of voting rights (together the “Companies”), engage in import and export trades of domestic and overseas products and commodities, including domestic and offshore trades in fields which cover extensive types of commodities such as agri­marine products, chemicals, energy, metals, machinery, textile, forest products and general merchandise, paper and pulp, finance, logistics, information industry, development and construction and others. In addition, the Companies offer various services and engage in diversified business such as investments in domestic and foreign businesses, exploration of natural resources and others.   The translation of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts for the year ended March 31, 2015 and at March 31, 2015 is included solely for the convenience of readers outside of Japan and has been made at ¥120 to $1, the exchange rate prevailing on March 31, 2015. The translation should not be construed as a representation that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 2. Basis of Presentation (1) Statements of Compliance The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. As the Company meets the requirements of a “Specified Company”, pursuant to Article 1­2 of the Ordinance on Terminology, Forms and Preparation Methods of Consolidated Financial Statements (Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance No. 28 of 1976, the “Consolidated Financial Statements Ordinance”), it has applied the provisions of Article 93 of said Ordinance. (2) Functional Currency and Presentation Currency The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are presented in Japanese yen, the functional currency of the Company, and amounts of less than one million yen are rounded to the nearest million yen. (3) Use of Estimates and Judgments Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make accounting estimates and assumptions, as necessary that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions due to their inherent uncertainty. Accounting estimates and assumptions that could significantly affect the Consolidated Financial Statements are as follows: ・ Write­down of inventories (Note 5 “Inventories”) ・ Impairment of property, plant and equipment(Note 6 “Property, Plant and Equipment”) ・ Impairment of intangible assets (Note 7 “Intangible Assets”) ・ Provisions (Note 8“Provisions”) ・ Defined benefit obligation (Note 11 “Employee Benefits”) ・ Recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 13 “Income Taxes”) ・ Impairment of investments in associates and joint ventures (Note 14 “Associates and Joint Ventures”) ・ Valuation of financial instruments (Note 15“Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures”) ・ Contingent liabilities (Note 24 “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities”)   Information related to judgments made by the Company that could significantly affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in the process of applying the accounting policies are as follows: ・ Scope of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (Note 3 “Significant Accounting Policies”) ・ Classification of non­current assets or disposal groups as held for sale (Note 9 “Non­current Assets or Disposal Groups Held for Sale) ・ Accounting for leases (Notes 10 “Leases”) ・ Derecognition of financial assets (Note 15 “Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures”) 10 106 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Overview of Marubeni 3. Significant Accounting Policies (1) Basis of Measurement The Consolidated Financial Statements, as stated in the accounting policies below, have been prepared on an historical cost basis, with the exception of certain current assets, financial instruments, and assets and liabilities relating to the post­employment benefit plan, which are measured at fair value. (2) Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of all domestic and foreign subsidiaries under the Marubeni’s Ambitions control of the Company either through direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest or by other means. Intercompany transactions and accounts between the Companies are eliminated. To align the reporting periods of subsidiaries that have a financial year end that is different from the financial year end of the Company (March 31) due to unavoidable reasons such as compliance with the local legal system of the country in which they operate, subsidiaries prepare additional financial statements as of the financial year end date of the Company and similar such adjustments. (3) Business Combinations The Companies use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations. The acquisition cost is the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value, plus any previously held equity interest in the acquiree Marubeni’s Business remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any non­controlling interest in the acquiree. The amount of any non­controlling interest is measured as elected for each business combination either at fair value or at the proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree.   Any difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the equity interest in the acquiree previously held at the time control is obtained is recognised in profit or loss. Further, any other comprehensive income that had been previously recognised in connection with the equity interest in the acquiree is treated in the same way as a disposal of the equity interest. Acquisition costs incurred are recognised in profit or loss.   The Companies perform any necessary classification and designation of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Stance Toward Business Development based, in principle, on the contractual terms, economic conditions, business or accounting policies, and other appropriate conditions that exist on the acquisition date. (4) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Associates refer to investees over which the Companies have the ability to exercise significant influence through such factors as the ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting interest in the entity and other factors.   A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the Companies, as the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Financial Information   The Companies account for investments in associates and joint ventures under the equity method. Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are normally recorded at cost, adjusted for the Companies’ share of the change in the net assets of these associates and joint ventures since the acquisition date. Any dividends received from these associates and joint ventures are subtracted from the carrying amount of investments in associates and joint ventures.   The Companies’ share of the profit or loss of the associates and joint ventures is included as “Share of profit of associates and joint ventures” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Companies’ share of any change in other comprehensive income recognised by the associates and joint ventures is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any unrealised profit arising from the transactions between the Companies and the associates and joint ventures is eliminated against Corporate Information the Companies’ interest in associates and joint ventures. Certain adjustments are made to achieve unification of the accounting policies of the associates and joint ventures with those of the Companies. 11 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 107 Marubeni Corporation

Such a reversal is recognised to the extent that it does not result in the financial asset having a carrying amount that exceeds what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised at the date the impairment is reversed. The amount of reversal of impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. (ii) Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Marubeni’s Ambitions Financial liabilities to which IFRS 9 applies, are classified as follows: financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost unless they are financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss (“Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL”). The Companies determine such classifications at the initial recognition of the financial liabilities.   Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value at initial recognition and financial liabilities classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are measured at fair value less transaction costs at initial recognition.   Financial liabilities of the Companies include corporate bonds and loans payable, notes and trade accounts payable, Marubeni’s Business derivative financial liabilities, etc. Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured according to their classification as follows: Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL Financial liabilities designated as Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value. Stance Toward Business Development   After initial recognition, changes in the fair values of Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL together with the related interest expense are mainly recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. However the amount of changes in the fair value of the financial liabilities that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of the entity is recognised as other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Financial liabilities not classified as Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost.   After initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortisation using the effective interest method is recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Financial Information Derecognition The Companies derecognise a financial liability only when the underlying obligation specified in the contract is performed, discharged, cancelled or expires.   An exchange of financial liabilities with substantially different terms or a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as the derecognition of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability, and the difference between the carrying amount of these liabilities is recognised as part of finance income (or expenses) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Corporate Information Financial guarantee contracts The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries, in the normal course of their business, issue various guarantees for obligations owed by associates and general trade partners (“guaranteed parties”). These are issued to third parties to guarantee the repayment, mainly of loans which the guaranteed parties have borrowed from external parties. When a guaranteed party fails to perform its obligations, the Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries are obligated to perform the obligations in accordance with the relevant financial guarantee contract. 15 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 111 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Liabilities recognised for such financial guarantee contracts are measured at initial recognition at the present value of the total guarantee premiums to be received by the guarantor over a future period under the financial guarantee contract adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, these liabilities are amortised over the financial guarantee period on a systematic basis and the amortised amounts are recognised in profit or loss. However, if the estimated amount required to settle any such current guarantee obligations at the reporting date exceeds the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, the balance of any such liability is recognised at the estimated amount required to settle such current guarantee obligations at the reporting date, and any resulting difference is recognised in profit or loss. (iii) Offsetting of financial instruments A financial asset and a financial liability are offset and the net amount is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Companies currently have a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intend either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. (iv) Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments at the end of each reporting period is measured based on the market price in an active market. If the market in which a financial instrument is traded is not active or no active market exists for the financial instrument, fair value is determined by using an appropriate valuation technique. (8) Derivatives and hedge accounting Initial recognition and subsequent measurement The Companies recognise derivatives as assets or liabilities at fair value. For derivatives designated as qualifying hedging instruments, subsequent changes in fair value are recognised according to the objective and designation of the hedge. Subsequent changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as qualifying hedging instruments are recognised in profit or loss. Fair value hedges If the objective of holding a derivative is to hedge the exposure of changes in the fair value of the hedged item (as a fair value hedge), changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised in profit or loss and are offset against the changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments.   When financial instruments measured at amortised cost are designated as hedged items, after recognising the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of such hedged items in profit or loss, the adjusted financial instruments are amortised through profit or loss using the recalculated effective interest rate.   The Companies use fair value hedges mainly for hedging the exposure of changes in the fair value of goods or firm commitments to purchase goods and the exposure of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities with a fixed interest rates arising from changes in interest rates. Cash flow hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, which are held to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows of the hedged items, are recognised in other components of equity until changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recognised in profit or loss. However, the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised in profit or loss. The Companies use cash flow hedges for hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows of forecast purchases of goods, sales of goods, etc. arising from changes in prices and exchange rates and the exposure to variability in interest cash flows of a floating rate interest bearing assets and liabilities arising from changes in interest rates.   The amounts that have been recognised in other components of equity relating to such hedging instruments are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. However, if a hedged item is a recognised non­financial asset or non­financial liability, the amounts that have been recognised in other components of equity relating to the hedging instrument are reclassified as adjustments to the initial carrying amount of the non­financial asset or non­financial liability. 16 112 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Overview of Marubeni   If a forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the Companies discontinue hedge accounting. Accordingly, any amounts that had been recognised in other components of equity while the hedge was effective are reclassified to profit or loss when hedge accounting is discontinued. Changes in the fair value of the derivative after hedge accounting is discontinued are recognised in profit or loss prospectively as it is no longer a hedging instrument. However, to the extent that such a previously hedged forecast transaction continues to be expected to occur even if hedge accounting is discontinued, amounts that had been recognised in other components of equity before the discontinuation of hedge accounting remain in other components of equity until the forecast transaction occurs. Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation Marubeni’s Ambitions Where the objective of holding a derivative and other non­derivative hedging instruments, such as loans payable, is to hedge the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation (as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation), changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments attributable to changes in exchange rates are recognised in other components of equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. Of the changes in the fair values of derivative and other non­derivative hedging instruments which are due to exchange rate movements, the portions related to any ineffectiveness or any parts outside the hedge effectiveness assessment are recognised in profit or loss.   The cumulative amount of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments attributable to changes in exchange rates that have been recognised in other components of equity under a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is reclassified to Marubeni’s Business profit or loss when the underlying foreign operation is disposed of. (9) Inventories Inventories, which mainly consist of commodities, merchandise, and real estate held for sale, are measured at the lower of cost (mainly specific or moving average cost) and net realisable value. If the net realisable value is lower than cost, the difference is expensed as a write­down and the amount of the write­down is directly deducted from the carrying amount of inventories. Stance Toward Business Development   Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.   When the cause of a write­down no longer exists, or when there is clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value due to changes in economic conditions, reversals of such write­downs are recognised. The carrying amount after reversal is recognised at the lower of cost or the revised net realisable value, and the amount of the reversal of write­downs is recognised in profit or loss.   Inventories held for generating profits from short­term fluctuations in market prices are measured at fair value less costs to sell, with fluctuations in fair value less costs to sell recognised in profit or loss in the period in which such fluctuations occur. Financial Information (10) Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are recognised initially at acquisition cost including transaction costs. Acquisition cost includes borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, etc. of assets requiring a considerable time period before they can be used as intended. The present value of the estimated costs for the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment at the end of its useful life is included in the acquisition cost of the item if the recognition criteria for provisions are met, and are recognised as an expense through depreciation over the useful life of the item.   After initial recognition, the Companies apply the cost model to items of property, plant and equipment and measure such assets at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. The depreciable amount of items of Corporate Information property, plant and equipment is allocated over each period for the useful life of each item through depreciation, mainly on a straight­line basis over the useful life of each item (buildings and structures from 2 to 60 years, machinery and equipment from 2 to 45 years), or the units of production method based on reserve estimation. Land is not depreciated. If an item of property, plant and equipment includes one or more significant parts, each significant part is individually depreciated. 17 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 113 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   The Companies derecognise an item of property, plant and equipment when they have disposed of it or when it is no longer expected to produce any future economic benefits through use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of the item and its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss when the item is derecognised.   The basis of depreciation of property, plant and equipment, such as residual value, useful life, and depreciation method, is reviewed at each reporting date. When there is a change in the basis of depreciation, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate. (11) Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at initial recognition at acquisition cost. The acquisition cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is measured at the acquisition date fair value. After initial recognition, the Companies apply the cost model to intangible assets and measure such assets at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Internally generated intangible assets are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, unless they satisfy the criteria for capitalisation.   Intangible assets are classified as either intangible assets with finite useful lives or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.   The amount of intangible assets with finite useful lives subject to amortisation is allocated as an expense over each period for the useful life of each asset (franchises and customer relationships approximately from 3 years to 45 years, software approximately from 2 years to 20 years) through amortisation, mainly on a straight­line basis. The basis of amortisation of these intangible assets, such as useful life and depreciation method, is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. When there is a change in the basis of amortisation, the amortisation charge is adjusted prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.   Intangible assets judged to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation, and the Companies review, at the end of each reporting period, whether the events or circumstances supporting such a judgment continue to exist. If the judgment that the useful life is indefinite is no longer valid, the intangible asset is reclassified from an intangible asset with an indefinite life to an intangible asset with a finite useful life, with amortisation charges adjusted prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.   The Companies derecognise an item of intangible assets when they have disposed of it or when it is no longer expected to produce any future economic benefits from its use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds of an intangible asset arising from its derecognition and its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. Goodwill Goodwill is recognised as the excess of (a) the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value, the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree remeasured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non­controlling interest in the acquiree (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the aggregate amount of consideration”) over (b) the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The amount of non­controlling interest is measured for each business combination either at acquisition date fair value or at the acquirer’s proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree. If the total amount of consideration is less than the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.   After initial recognition, goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is measured at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment loss. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, on or after the acquisition date, allocated to cash­generating units or groups of cash­generating units that are expected to receive benefits from the business combination. 18 114 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) � Overview

As a result, the Company reduced the carrying amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition of Gavilon to its recoverable amount and recognised an impairment loss of ¥48,053 million ($400,442 thousand) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended March 31, 2015.   The recoverable amount used in impairment testing was calculated based on value in use which was measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on the revised business plan approved by the management. The business plan represents the management's estimate of a range of economic conditions including such significant assumptions as quantity, price and margin based on past experience, which was also consistent with external evidence. The business plan used on the most recent 10 years forecasts in order to average market conditions. For the period beyond 10 years, the Company calculated the terminal value based on a steady growth rate 2%. The growth rate was determined by considering the market in which Gavilon operates or the long­term average growth rate in the U.S.A.. Weighted average cost of capital used in value in use calculation was 8.25%, which reflects current market assessments of time value of money and risks specific to the assets. 8.

Employee Benefits (1) Post­employment benefits The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries have cash balance plans based on the Japanese Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan Act and other defined benefit pension plans. These plans cover substantially all employees other than directors. In addition to the pension plans, the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries have lump sum retirement plans to be paid upon retirement or severance based on the years of service and compensation level.   The Company, pursuant to the Japanese Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan Act and other laws, has the obligation to make contributions to the Marubeni Corporate Pension Fund (the “Fund”), which pays out pension benefits. The Director of the Fund has the fiduciary duty to comply with laws, the dispositions of the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare made pursuant to laws, the bylaws of the Fund and the decisions of the Board of Representatives, and to faithfully perform duties for the Fund including the management and operation of the contributions. Additionally, a code of conduct has been articulated, which prohibits the Director of the Fund from entering into asset management agreements for the purpose of benefiting a third party and from acts that constitute conflicts of interest.   The pension plan is operated by the Fund, which is legally independent from the Company. The Board of Representatives comprises an equal number of Representatives elected from the management side (Assigned Representatives) and Representatives elected from the employee side (Mutually Elected Representatives), while the chair of the Board of Representatives (the “Chairman”) is elected from the management side.   Proceedings of the Board of Representatives are decided by a majority vote of the members attending. In the case of a tied vote, the Chairman has the power to decide the vote. However, with regard to particularly important matters, the bylaws provide that the decision be made by a majority that exceeds the above.   The Representatives hold exclusive power to decide important matters including investment policy. The actual management of the assets is conducted by investment managers on the basis of an entrustment contract, and the Representatives are prohibited by law from giving instructions, such as instructions on specific investments.   The Company is required to make contributions to the Fund, and the contributions are reviewed regularly to the extent allowed by law. While it is under obligation to make contributions stipulated by the Fund into the future, the Company, in addition to these contributions, also funds a retirement benefit trust on a voluntary basis.   With regard to the lump sum retirement plan, the Company is under obligation to pay benefits directly to the beneficiaries. Although the Company is not under any legal obligation regarding the funding of this plan, fund assets exist, which have been voluntarily contributed by the Company to the retirement benefit trust. 36 132 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Overview of Marubeni   Changes in the present value of defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets of the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Thousands of U.S. Millions of yen dollars March 31, 2015 March 31, 2014 March 31, 2015 Balance at beginning of year of net defined benefit liability ¥68,701 ¥67,404 $572,508 Changes in the present value of defined benefit obligation: Marubeni’s Ambitions Balance at beginning of year 292,351 282,345 2,436,258 Current service cost 11,791 10,251 98,258 Past service cost 65 271 542 Interest expense 6,482 5,458 54,017 Remeasurements: Actuarial gains (losses) arising from changes in demographic assumptions 3,801 4,346 31,675 Actuarial gains (losses) arising from changes in financial assumptions 15,226 (2,601) 126,883 Marubeni’s Business Other 2,022 750 16,850 Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 10,973 6,229 91,442 Benefits paid (17,953) (21,636) (149,608) Effects of business combinations and divestitures (172) 6,938 (1,433) Balance at end of year 324,586 292,351 2,704,884 Changes in the fair value of plan assets: Balance at beginning of year 223,650 214,941 1,863,750 Stance Toward Business Development Interest income 5,301 4,575 44,175 Remeasurements: Return on plan assets 20,902 8,872 174,184 Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 7,413 5,395 61,775 Employees’ contributions 400 3,918 3,333 Employer’s contributions 6,897 3,003 57,475 Benefits paid (15,525) (19,471) (129,375) Effects of business combinations and divestitures – 2,417 – Balance at end of year 249,038 223,650 2,075,317 Balance at end of year of net defined benefit liability ¥75,548 ¥68,701 $629,567 Financial Information   Actuarial assumptions used for the present value calculation of defined benefit obligations at March 31, 2015 and 2014 were mainly as follows: March 31, 2015 March 31, 2014 Discount rate 1.0% 1.3% Rates of salary increase 4.8% 4.8%   Sensitivity analyses are conducted at the year end based on reasonably estimable changes in assumptions. Although sensitivity analyses assume that the actuarial assumptions other than those that are subject to the analyses are held constant, in Corporate Information reality, it is possible for the sensitivity analyses to be impacted by other actuarial assumptions.   If, for example, the discount rate rose by 0.5%, and the other assumptions were held constant, defined benefit plan liability at March 31, 2015 and 2014 would decrease by ¥12,032 million ($100,267 thousand) and ¥11,463 million, respectively.

The primary investment policy is to analyse the risk/return characteristics by asset class and to invest in a diversified portfolio taking into consideration the correlation among asset classes.   The Company sets an asset mix policy with investments in equity securities, debt securities and other assets. Based on this policy, the Company selects multiple investment managers who execute the strategy. When selecting an investment manager, the Company gives consideration to management philosophy and content, investment management policy and investment style, investment control systems including information collection mechanisms and decision­making processes, compliance systems, investment experience and the track record of the investment manager as well as the professionals in charge of managing Marubeni’s Ambitions pension assets.   Plan assets are invested 30%, 60% and 10% in equity securities, debt securities and other, respectively, at March 31, 2015.   The investments executed by investment managers are outlined as follows:   Equity securities are selected mainly from stocks that are listed on securities exchanges. Prior to investing, the Company investigates the business conditions of the investee companies and appropriately diversifies investments by type of industry and other relevant factors. Debt securities are selected mainly from government bonds, public debt instruments and corporate bonds. Prior to investing, the Company investigates the quality of the issuing conditions, including issuers, rating, interest rate and repayment dates, and appropriately diversifies the investments. Pooled funds are selected using strategies consistent with the Marubeni’s Business equity and debt securities described above. For investments in life insurance company general accounts, contracts with insurance companies include a guaranteed interest rate and a return of capital. With respect to foreign investments vehicles, the Company investigates the stability of the underlying governments and economies, the market characteristics, such as settlement systems, and the taxation systems. For each such investment, the Company selects the appropriate investment country and currency.   The performance of certain plan assets by the cash balance plan is matched with the related pension benefits to a certain extent. Stance Toward Business Development   Funding of the Marubeni Corporate Pension Fund is conducted by taking into account various factors including limits on deductible expenses under the tax rules, the funding status of plan assets and actuarial calculations. Contributions to plan assets are intended to cover benefits for services to be rendered by employees in the future as well as services already rendered.   In accordance with the Japanese Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan Act, the bylaws of the Marubeni Corporate Pension Fund provide for the re­calculation of the contribution amount at five­year intervals with the year end as the base date for the purpose of maintaining balanced finances into the future.   The re­calculation process reviews the basic rates relating to the contribution (the guaranteed rate of return, expected rate of mortality, expected withdrawal rate, expected salary increase, expected new enrollment rate, etc.) and verifies the adequacy of the contribution amount.   Additionally, the Company, in order to ensure sufficient funding of the pension plan, may also contribute marketable equity Financial Information securities and cash to the retirement benefit trust in the amount of the unfunded portion of defined benefit obligation.   The amount of contributions expected to be paid to plan assets for the year ending March 31, 2016 is approximately ¥12,800 million ($106,667 thousand).   The weighted average duration of defined benefit obligation at March 31, 2015 and 2014 was 14.6 years. (2) Employee benefit cost The aggregate amounts of employee benefit cost included under “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Corporate Information Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were ¥291,483 million ($2,429,025 thousand) and ¥260,428 million, respectively. 39 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 135 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 12. Other­net For the year ended March 31, 2015 Net exchange differences recognised in profit or loss classified as “Other­net” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income were net gains of ¥17,430 million ($145,250 thousand). These net exchange differences (net gains) were mainly offset by profits or losses on derivatives held for hedging purpose.   On September 30, 2014, the Company integrated its grain export business in the U.S.A. by contributing the grain export operations including elevator facilities at Terminal 5 in the Port of Portland, Oregon (hereinafter “T5”) through one of its subsidiaries, Columbia Grain, Inc., to Pacificor, LLC (formerly, Kalama Export Company LLC) in the Port of Kalama, Washington, a joint venture of Gavilon and Archer Daniels Midland Company, U.S.A..

This impairment loss was included in “Gains (losses) on investment securities” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Additionally, this segment recognised impairment losses of ¥15,832 million ($131,933 thousand) from investments in certain copper mining projects in Chile and coal mining projects in Australia due to the anticipated decrease in the estimated future cash flows following the decline in commodity prices. The impairment losses were calculated using the recoverable amounts measured at value in use based on discounted future cash flows, and the total amount of the recoverable amounts was ¥291,538 million ($2,429,483 thousand). Weighted average cost of capital used in the value in use calculation ranged from 7.5% to 8.2% and reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the assets.

Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures (1) Policy for managing capital The fundamental policy of the Companies is to maintain an optimal mix of funding in line with the requirements of the asset portfolio. Funding sources include indirect financial procurement firstly from banks and other financial institutions, as well as direct procurement through the issuance of bonds, commercial paper and other means. The Companies utilise such management indicators as net D/E ratio (Note 1) and risk assets (Note 2) and strengthen the financial base to establish a strong earnings structure and a solid financial footing that can withstand changes in the business environment while attaining sustainable growth. Marubeni’s Ambitions Note 1 Net D/E ratio = Consolidated net interest bearing debt / Total consolidated equity. Consolidated net interest bearing debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits from the total bonds and borrowings (current and non­current). Note 2 The Company defines risk assets as the exposure of its portfolio to the maximum possible loss that could be incurred on a consolidated basis, measured using the Value at Risk method. The Company conducts computer simulations on all group assets including the assets of the consolidated subsidiaries that take into account the risk attributes of each type of exposure such as country risk, industry risk, credit rating of the customers, and scheduled due dates of receivables. Marubeni’s Business   At the group level, the management regularly monitors net D/E ratio, which was targeted at approximately 1.5 times by the end of the year ending March 31, 2016 under the three­year mid­term management plan, “Global Challenge 2015”, which commenced April 2013. However, reflecting the announcement of “Notice Regarding Revision of Consolidated Financial Results Forecast and Recognition of Impairment Loss” dated January 26, 2015, and the various factors such as the recent global economic trends, resource price trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations, the management revised the target net D/E ratio to approximately 1.6 times.   The Companies are not subject to any significant capital restrictions (with the exception of general restrictions pursuant to Stance Toward Business Development laws such as the Companies Act of Japan). (2) Policy for managing risks The Companies conduct business activities in various countries including Japan and are, thus, subject to the effects of interest rate risks, exchange rate risks, credit risks, commodity price risks, liquidity risks and stock price fluctuation risks described below. The Companies evaluate these risks through monitoring on a regular basis and manage these risks under an identical risk management policy, regardless of the application of hedge accounting, in order to hedge all or part of these risks. In principle, the hedged items and the hedging instruments are based on the same underlying and have an economic relationship. Additionally, the hedge ratio is on a one­to­one basis so that the risk exposure of the hedged items is effectively reduced. (i) Management of interest rate risks Financial Information Since the Companies have raised certain funds at floating interest rates, they are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest expense in the event of a hike in market interest rates. The majority of liabilities at floating rates correspond to notes, trade accounts and loans receivable, which are positively affected by changes in interest rates. Interest insensitive assets such as certain fixed assets and investment securities will also possibly produce an increase in dividends and other income because of a rise in market interest rates. The Companies cannot completely avoid interest rate risks, however, risk exposure is limited by the portfolio of assets and liabilities held.   In addition, among the liabilities used to fund interest insensitive assets, such as certain fixed assets and investment securities, that portion with floating rates is categorised as “unhedged” based on the Group’s asset­liability management. Monitoring market movements in interest rates, the Group utilises interest rate swaps and takes other measures to mitigate the Corporate Information risk of interest rate fluctuations. 45 Marubeni

The inputs used in the fair value measurement are categorised into three levels based upon the observability of the inputs in markets. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Companies can access at the measurement date Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities Marubeni’s Ambitions   The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value by the Companies on a recurring basis at March 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars March 31, 2015 March 31, 2014 March 31, 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Non­derivative Financial assets measured at FVTPL: Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable ¥– ¥42,302 ¥12,228 ¥54,530 ¥– ¥72,631 ¥– ¥72,631 $– $352,517 $101,900 $454,417 Marubeni’s Business Investment securities – – – – – – – – – – – – Other Investments (equity) 3,498 – 8,430 11,928 – – 113 113 29,150 – 70,250 99,400 Other Investments (debt) – – 7,487 7,487 – – 11,382 11,382 – – 62,392 62,392 Other financial assets – – 15,079 15,079 – – 13,834 13,834 – – 125,658 125,658 Non­derivative Financial assets measured at FVTOCI: Other Investments 170,470 834 213,047 384,351 141,776 1,025 289,863 432,664 1,420,583 6,950 1,775,392 3,202,925 Derivative instruments: Stance Toward Business Development Interest rate contracts – 25,825 – 25,825 – 20,601 – 20,601 – 215,208 – 215,208 Forward exchange contracts – 26,318 – 26,318 – 13,550 – 13,550 – 219,317 – 219,317 Commodity contracts 8,360 49,018 1,187 58,565 1,250 48,481 663 50,394 69,667 408,483 9,892 488,042 Other – – – – – – – – – – – – Liabilities: Derivative instruments: Interest rate contracts – (2,934) – (2,934) – (1,701) – (1,701) – (24,450) – (24,450) Forward exchange contracts – (40,348) – (40,348) – (15,567) – (15,567) – (336,233) – (336,233) Commodity contracts (3,789) (43,055) (123) (46,967) (10,055) (32,733) (152) (42,940) (31,575) (358,792) (1,025) (391,392) Financial Information Other – – – – – – – – – – – – Corporate Information 55 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 151 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Other investments categorised as Level 1 mainly consist of marketable equity securities in active markets. Derivative instruments categorised as Level 1 consist of derivatives related to commodity contracts. These assets are measured at quoted prices in active markets without adjustment. Notes, trade accounts and loans receivable categorised as Level 2 consist of notes and trade accounts receivable that are settled at future market prices; and other investments categorised as Level 2 consist of equity securities traded on markets that are not active. Derivative instruments categorised as Level 2 consist of interest rate swaps, forward exchange contracts and derivatives related to commodity contracts. These assets and liabilities are mainly measured based on quoted prices of identical assets not categorised as Level 1 in markets that are not active or similar assets or liabilities in active markets, and measurement is based mainly on a market approach using observable inputs, such as prices in commodity markets, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Other investments categorised as Level 3 mainly consist of equity securities in inactive markets; and derivative instruments categorised as Level 3 consist of derivatives related to commodity contracts. These assets and liabilities are measured mainly based on an income approach using inputs that are reasonably available or inputs many market participants use with reasonable confidence because observable inputs are not available due to a lack of similar assets or liabilities in active markets or distortive market prices resulting from dramatic liquidity decreases and such like. Significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of investments whose fair values are measured on a recurring basis categorised as Level 3 are discount rates. Fair value decreases (increases) as the discount rate rises (declines). At March 31, 2015 and 2014, discount rates used in fair value measurement by the Companies range from 4.7% to 16.2% and 1.4% to 13.0%, respectively. The Companies recognise transfers of assets and liabilities between Levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of each quarterly period. During the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2. Changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the Companies for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Millions of yen Non-derivative Financial assets measured at Non-derivative Financial assets measured at FVTPL FVTOCI Derivative instruments Notes, trade accounts and loans Investment Other Other financial Other Commodity Other March 31, 2015 receivable securities investments assets investments contracts contracts Balance at beginning of year ¥– ¥– ¥11,495 ¥13,834 ¥289,863 ¥511 ¥– Gains (losses) in profit or loss 193 – 6,921 1,098 – 1,509 60 Gains (losses) in other comprehensive income – – – – (88,993) – – Purchases 10,993 – 8,116 – 2,301 – 11 Sales/Redemptions – – (10,485) (1,995) (7,734) – – Settlements – – – – – (1,087) (71) Transfers – – 4,481 – (4,818) 4 – Effects of acquisition and divestitures – – – – – – – Net transfers in and/or (out) of Level 3 – – (4,032) – (42) – – Other 1,042 – (579) 2,142 22,470 127 – Balance at end of year ¥12,228 ¥– ¥15,917 ¥15,079 ¥213,047 ¥1,064 ¥– Gains (losses) in assets and liabilities held at end of year ¥193 ¥– ¥1,970 ¥1,098 ¥– ¥973 ¥– 56 152 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Overview of Marubeni Thousands of U.S. dollars Non­derivative Financial assets measured at Non­derivative Financial assets measured at FVTPL FVTOCI Derivative instruments Notes, trade accounts and loans Investment Other Other financial Other Commodity Other March 31, 2015 receivable securities investments assets investments contracts contracts Marubeni’s Ambitions Balance at beginning of year $– $– $95,792 $115,283 $2,415,525 $4,258 $– Gains (losses) in profit or loss 1,608 – 57,675 9,150 – 12,575 500 Gains (losses) in other comprehensive income – – – – (741,608) – – Purchases 91,608 – 67,633 – 19,175 – 92 Sales/Redemptions – – (87,375) (16,625) (64,450) – – Settlements – – – – – (9,058) (592) Transfers – – 37,342 – (40,150) 33 – Effects of acquisition and divestitures – – – – – – – Net transfers in and/or (out) of Level 3 – – (33,600) – (350) – – Marubeni’s Business Other 8,684 – (4,825) 17,850 187,250 1,059 – Balance at end of year $101,900 $– $132,642 $125,658 $1,775,392 $8,867 $– Gains (losses) in assets and liabilities held at end of year $1,608 $– $16,417 $9,150 $– $8,108 $– Millions of yen Non­derivative Stance Toward Business Development Financial assets measured at Non­derivative Financial assets measured at FVTPL FVTOCI Derivative instruments Notes, trade accounts and loans Investment Other Other financial Other Commodity Other March 31, 2014 receivable securities investments assets investments contracts contracts Balance at beginning of year ¥– ¥– ¥14,452 ¥11,732 ¥286,320 ¥(4) ¥– Gains (losses) in profit or loss – – 2,370 2,644 – 3,300 (459) Gains (losses) in other comprehensive income – – – – (19,686) – – Purchases – – 1,879 1,658 11,285 – – Financial Information Sales/Redemptions – – (7,795) (3,289) (4,119) – – Settlements – – – – – (1,067) – Transfers – – – – 233 3 – Effects of acquisition and divestitures – – – – 139 (1,732) 459 Net transfers in and/or (out) of Level 3 – – – – – – – Other – – 589 1,089 15,691 11 – Balance at end of year ¥– ¥– ¥11,495 ¥13,834 ¥289,863 ¥511 ¥– Gains (losses) in assets and liabilities held at end of year ¥– ¥– ¥1,833 ¥2,325 ¥– ¥500 ¥– Corporate Information   Gains and losses on the above assets and liabilities, gains and losses on other investments are included in “Gains (losses) on investment securities”, gains and losses on other financial assets are included in “Sales of goods” or “Cost of goods sold”, and gains and losses on derivatives are included in “Cost of goods sold” or “Other­net” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 57 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 153 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   Additionally, “Other” above mainly consists of “Foreign currency translation adjustments” in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.   The relevant division of the Company, upon determining the valuation method of the applicable assets and liabilities, measures the fair value of assets and liabilities categorised as Level 3, according to valuation policies and procedures stipulated by the Company. Additionally, appropriate third­party valuations are obtained, as necessary. The results of fair value measurements are then reviewed by the Corporate Staff Division, which is independent from the division responsible for the fair value measurement.   If the inputs used to measure “Other investments measured at FVTOCI” among the assets categorised as Level 3 were to be changed, there were no significant changes of the fair value at March 31, 2015 and 2014.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries enter into long­term purchase contracts for certain goods and products in metal and machinery industries at either fixed or variable prices. The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries generally enter into sales contracts for such purchase contracts with customers. The total amounts of the long­term purchase contracts were approximately ¥908,000 million ($7,566,667 thousand) and ¥784,000 million at March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries had commitments to make additional investments or loans in the aggregate amounts of approximately ¥345,000 million ($2,875,000 thousand) and ¥325,000 million at March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of which capital expenditures in property, plant and equipment were approximately ¥48,000 million ($400,000 thousand) and approximately ¥71,000 million, respectively, while commitments to joint ventures were approximately ¥101,000 million ($841,667 thousand) and approximately ¥124,000 million, respectively.   The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries provide various types of guarantees for the obligations of their associates and customers in the ordinary course of business. The guarantees mainly relate to the repayment of borrowings to third parties. Should the guaranteed associates and customers fail to fulfill their obligations, the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries would be required to fulfill the obligations under these guarantees.   Outstanding guarantees were ¥391,630 million ($3,263,583 thousand) and ¥329,647 million, including ¥282,033 million ($2,350,275 thousand) and ¥194,159 million to associates and joint ventures, at March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Outstanding guarantees (total of guarantee payable) represent the maximum potential amount of future payments under the contracts without any consideration of the likelihood of such obligations being incurred.   Therefore, such amounts do not represent the anticipated losses on these guarantees and indemnifications, and they greatly exceed anticipated losses. Some guarantees are secured by counter guarantees provided for the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries by third parties.   The amounts of counter guarantees provided for the Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries by third parties were ¥24,685 million ($205,708 thousand) and ¥24,044 million, including ¥23,289 million ($194,075 thousand) and ¥22,516 million relating to the associates and joint ventures at March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   The liabilities recognised for the guarantees were ¥4,150 million ($34,583 thousand) and ¥1,435 million at March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   The Company manages the risk of fulfillment of obligations under the guarantees by setting the appropriate line of credit and by undertaking provisional measures in accordance with the credit risk rank to which each guaranteed customer belongs. The Company determines the rank of each customer before entering into the guarantee agreements according to the customer’s credit risk which is estimated and reviewed based on the customer’s financial information.   The likelihood of such obligations being incurred under the guarantees which would have a material effect in the Consolidated Financial Statements were estimated to be remote at March 31, 2015. A provision for loss on guarantees was recognised for the amount that was considered probable.   The Companies conduct business activities on a global scale and are involved in transactions which are subject to the oversight by various types of authorities, both in Japan and abroad. Such business activities are exposed to risk and, from time to time, may involve legal actions, claims or other disputes. Although there are certain outstanding litigations such as those relating to infrastructure construction projects overseas at the end of the fiscal year, the outcome of these cannot be determined at this time. The Company provides no further disclosures on these litigations since the Company believes that such disclosures would prejudice seriously the outcome of the proceedings. 76 172 Marubeni Annual Report 2015 Marubeni Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Overview of Marubeni 25. Structured Entities The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries hold subordinated investment securities and other interests without voting rights in structured entities engaged in real estate developments, and include such structured entities in their scope of consolidation.   The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in structured entities engaged in asset management, financing and leasing, through investments and financing, but do not include such structured entities in their scope of consolidation. Total assets of these unconsolidated structured entities at March 31, 2015 and 2014 were ¥441,780 million ($3,681,500 thousand) and ¥441,094 million, respectively.

Therefore, such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated amounts of losses through the involvement in the structured entities. 26.
