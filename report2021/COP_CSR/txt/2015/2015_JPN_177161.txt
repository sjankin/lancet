EIZO Corporation CSR REPORT 2015 09 The Competitive Advantages of EIZO Competitive Advantage of EIZO as Described by Employees What is the competitive advantage of EIZO, a company that has always pursued cutting-edge technologies and created pioneering products? Employees of the planning, development and quality assurance departments discussed this topic. Our unique strength was developed in the course of our business centered on monitors Greater strides forward as a Visual Technology Company Miyata: I am planning industrial and consumer products in the Product Planning Department. The Miyata: We have grown with monitors as a hardware focus, but I think one role of a competitive advantage of EIZO as seen from the perspective of planning is the experience of engaging Visual Technology Company is to look beyond monitors toward other elements and in the monitor business across a wide variety of markets, including medical care, graphics, ships, consider what else we could add to our products in order to provide a new imaging railway and games in addition to general use. Knowledge of a wide range of settings gained through environment. In the future, we may also consider using the products of other experience in an array of markets has expanded our horizons, enabling us to develop new proposals for companies rather than continuing to limit ourselves to our own. applying proven technologies in one field to a completely different field. For example, the technology used for game monitors to improve the visibility of darker image areas can be redirected to monitors Yoneda: We are also discussing what we should do as a Visual Technology Company Koichiro Miyata Product & Business for the security market, which requires clearly distinguishing darker areas as well. This I think is a major, in the R&D Department. We could expand the scope of our activities beyond the Development differentiating advantage. boundary of a monitor manufacturer, but we should maintain a stable axis for Department EIZO.
