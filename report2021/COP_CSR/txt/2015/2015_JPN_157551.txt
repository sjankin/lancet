Attitude as a researcher Tanaka: How do you stay motivated over such a long period Tanaka: Corporate research requires experimental results to be of research? reproducible. We also need to be swift. It’s important to provide good things to our customers as quickly as possible. I Takao: We just steadily perform each experiment, moving think that’s a big difference from university research. At from one stage to the next. As a leader, I have to look ahead university, my motivation for research was curiosity to elucidate to the next hurdle, and discuss with the team how we can phenomena with chemistry. Now I’m always focused on how overcome it. I try to stay focused on the quality of our to provide good products that meet the needs of our research. We do a lot of joint research with universities. It’s a Working as a researcher, working as a woman in the Asahi Kasei Group the perspective of the residents when making proposals. And Asahi Kasei Fibers and Asahi Kasei Homes. It was a good since my research results are conveyed to the customers experience that provided many examples of solutions from through the salespeople, I have to describe things in a way fibers that matched needs in homes. It’s exciting to discover that the salespeople can clearly understand. If I used the new things. I’m doing research focused on comfort. Both specialist words and phrases that we researchers use among fibers and homes are concerned with comfort. It would be ourselves, the salespeople would be overwhelmed. I’m always great if we could establish technology to evaluate comfort in thinking about how to describe things in a way that is easily its entirety. The Asahi Kasei Group is now seeking synergy. If understood. This is probably because of my own experience. we had more opportunities for casual interaction, and not just When I first transferred to Asahi Kasei Homes after researching official interaction, I think we could achieve even more synergy fibers, I was dumbfounded by the technical jargon in this field. in our R&D departments. Tanizaki: In contrast to a consumer-oriented business like that, Advantages of being a female researcher, my customers are other manufacturers. Their requirements are satisfaction in research becoming more and more demanding. While achieving the necessary performance characteristics, we also need to balance Takao: In both daily life and in the research lab, I think women the cost, development period, and timing of product launch. are better at coming up with incisive little ideas. For example, I know a woman researcher who, upon learning about the Interaction among personnel within the technical collaboration between Asahi Kasei Homes and Asahi Asahi Kasei Group, and “synergy” Kasei Medical in the HH2015 demonstration house, thought “Why not develop a system in the home to enable Tanizaki: Since the Asahi Kasei Group has four business consultation with a pediatrician?” But when working in sectors, I think we should do more to leverage internal research there’s a tendency to take costs and profits too lightly. connections. I try to maintain active interaction with We need to be good at financial numbers, too. researchers in fields related to mine. It’s easy for the R&D For me, in long-term research as a team with each organizations of different businesses to become secluded. But individual working in a professional manner, the greatest when you’re hitting a dead end, it’s often possible to find a satisfaction is when we obtain reliable data that enable clear breakthrough by talking to someone in a different field. judgment. It really was a great feeling when Teribone™ was Greater interaction among different sectors will increase the approved after a twenty-year effort. We were not only likelihood that you will know someone who can help when congratulated within the company, but researchers at other you get stuck. I think it’s a great advantage to be able to companies said “Good work!” when we met at scientific discuss things with researchers from different core operating conferences. There is a camaraderie among researchers, even companies. those working for different companies, because we have all experienced similar challenges. It’s a special feeling when even Tanaka: There is a networking initiative among young your competitors offer a kind comment like that. researchers of the Asahi Kasei Group. Even if it doesn’t bear fruit immediately, I think having various acquaintances will be Tanaka: I’m only in my fourth year, and still have many useful across the course of one’s career. experiences to look forward to, but the most rewarding moment for me so far was when a production process I research when I’m at home. Sometimes I even try little experiments! I have applied my personal experience to my research on hanging laundry to dry inside a room. I’d like to continue to apply a woman’s perspective to my research work. It’s rewarding to know that the results of my research are provided directly to Hebel Haus™ customers. Tanizaki: I think the feeling I get from knowing that a product I developed is being used around the world is something that only a researcher can understand. Another satisfying experience I had was when I traveled alone to a customer’s facility to help start up a production line. It gave me the chance to apply my technical knowledge without anybody’s help. My most memorable experience, though, has to be a difficult customer complaint we got when I was section chief in technical service. A solution required close coordination among sales, production, QA, and R&D. In the end the customer was satisfied, and we maintained our supply relationship. Everybody involved with the product pulled together and worked with a single purpose to solve that problem. We were all relying on each other. That case really showed me what great teamwork can do, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the value of the trust that customers place in us. As General Manager, I try to constantly keep these lessons in mind, and instill them in my people. Tanizaki: To accommodate diverse working styles, I think male personnel also need to make adjustments. Many years ago, my An atmosphere that allows different ways of supervisor told me “We don’t discriminate against women, but working, maintaining a career while raising we do make distinctions.” I took this to mean that they would children provide a fair workplace while giving due consideration to our needs, which I thought was reasonable. When I was pregnant, Tanaka: I think it must be difficult to keep working as a I hesitated to tell the overseas customer whose account I was researcher when you have a small child. If you reduce your responsible for. I was afraid they would resent being working hours, it must be hard to continue research. What’s it inconvenienced by my leave of absence. But when I met them really like? later after returning to work, they were very supportive. I think we do tend to try to do too much as working Takao: For me, the hardest thing was to come to a mothers, but when raising a child it’s okay to slow down a compromise with myself that I couldn’t do everything. One little. It takes persistence to find the best way. part of me wanted to keep trying harder and harder in order to do everything by myself. But I learned that it’s better not to Tanaka: I always feel it’s regrettable when I see women try too hard, and instead let yourself ask other people for help. researchers quit working when they get married or when they Once I realized that, things became better for me, and better have a child. I’m afraid if this happens too often, our male for my daughter, too. Every day is still trial and error, but I think colleagues and supervisors will get the impression that women my daughter is more understanding than anyone else. won’t continue working for long. Women need to have a First of all I think we need to change preconceptions certain will to keep working, I think it requires determination Takao: “Sincerity” is listed first among our Group Values, and I feel that we are organizationally very thorough about compliance. I think that “Challenge” means we not only respect personnel who try new things, but also encourage them to do so. Tanizaki: I feel that we are an enterprise that manufactures things with sincerity. And not content with the status quo, the company has continued to uphold “Creativity” as part of its culture. Prospects for the future as a researcher Tanaka: My task at hand is to help start up a new plant, and I’m completely focused on this now. As a next step, I want to develop new chemical products with higher added value. I feel that Asahi Kasei is an appealing place to do research because we operate in various different business fields. Someday I hope that my research will enable the launch of a whole new business. It would be fantastic to be able to create the kind of new product that opens a whole new avenue of business for the company. Working in the field of chemicals, I feel that there are endless possibilities. I will continue to hold this ambition in the years ahead. women to continue working. I hope more women will choose to do so, believing in their own possibilities. Tanizaki: As I am now in a position of responsibility for R&D in electronic materials, I need to keep looking toward future Tanaka: After hearing about your experiences, I think I could business needs even as I continually try to provide the best continue working as a researcher even if I get married and possible research environment for the personnel I supervise.

As in our Group Vision of “harmony with the natural environment,” the Asahi Kasei Group considers environmental preservation as one of the most important tasks. Our major focuses are on 1) prevention of global warming, 2) promotion of a recycling-oriented society, 3) management of chemical substances, and 4) preservation of biodiversity. For prevention of global warming, we have established new indexes and targets to curtail greenhouse gas emissions to be achieved by fiscal 2020. Regarding promotion of a recycling-oriented society, we achieved zero emissions of industrial wastes in fiscal 2010 and are working to maintain this. Furthermore, as a chemical company, we are working to promote safe handling of chemical substances and actively provide safety information. We are also making efforts to reduce the impact of our business activities on biodiversity.

Product safety To ensure the provision of products that the customer can use safely and reliably, the Asahi Kasei Group constantly strives to improve product safety and product quality, while maintaining consistent production control. In fiscal 2013, we once again met our target of no serious product safety incidents. Prevention of product safety incidents Product safety guidelines Consumer satisfaction and safety Group-wide product safety guidelines have been prepared to Products sold by the Asahi Kasei Group range from industrial secure product safety and prevent the occurrence of product materials to consumer products. Many of the materials we sell are safety incidents. The guidelines specify matters to be controlled used in products which are purchased by ordinary consumers. throughout the process from material purchase through use and Consumer satisfaction is therefore the ultimate measure of our disposal. The guidelines are centered on risk assessment during success in the provision of safe, high-quality products. We strive the development stage to ensure product safety prior to to maintain product quality and safety through continual marketing. Specific product safety measures for individual attention to production control to ensure that the products used products are applied by each core operating company in by consumers are completely free of safety defects. accordance with the guidelines. Managing chemical substances To ensure the safety of products and production processes in the Asahi Kasei Group, we maintain awareness of the properties of the chemical substances we use, and manage them strictly and appropriately throughout each phase from materials procurement to production, use, and disposal. Outline of efforts for product safety and chemical (GHS) has been introduced in Japan in accordance with a United substance management Nations advisory. We have revised our SDSs for compatibility with Operational safety To achieve safe operations, it is essential to build highly safe plants based on process hazard assessment prior to construction, to perform sound plant maintenance, and to operate facilities in a stable and safe manner. The Asahi Kasei Group avoids industrial accidents through risk assessments prior to the construction of new plants, periodic inspections of existing plants performed by auditors specialized in fire and explosion prevention, process reviews from the perspective of preventing abnormal reactions and ensuring interlock functions, and process reviews corresponding to the age of facilities. In fiscal 2013, we completed a program of on-site confirmation from the perspective of preventing abnormal reactions and ensuring interlock functions. There were no industrial accidents during fiscal 2013.

Provision for retirement benefits Upon terminating employment, employees of the parent company and its major subsidiaries in Japan are entitled, under most circumstances, to lump-sum severance indemnities and/or pension payments determined by reference mainly to their current basic rate of pay and length of service. Additional benefits may be granted to employees depending on the conditions under which termination of employment occurs. Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or defined contribution plans. The obligation for these severance indemnity benefits is provided for through accruals, contributory funded defined benefit pension plans, contributory funded defined benefit enterprise pension plans and non-contributory funded tax-qualified pension plans.

In accordance with this change, the statutory effective tax rate applied in calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities is changed from 38.0% to 35.6% from the fiscal year beginning on or after April 1, 2014. As a result of this change, net unrealized gain on other securities increased by ¥2 million (US$19 thousand) and deferred gains or losses on hedges decreased by ¥2 million (US$19 thousand) in the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2014, income taxes-deferred increased by ¥1,464 million (US$14,230 thousand) in the consolidated statements of income for the year then ended, and deferred tax assets, (after netting deferred tax liabilities) decreased by ¥1,463 million (US$14,220 thousand) in the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2014. 15. Asset retirement obligations (a) Outline of asset retirement obligations Due to commitments pertaining to restoration to original state before vacating in accordance with land lease agreements such as for offices, and due to commitments to dismantle leased buildings upon termination of lease period, etc., in accordance with lease agreements for model home parks, relevant asset retirement obligations are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with building lease agreements such as for the head offices, commitments pertaining to restoration to original state before vacating are recognized as asset retirement obligations. However, instead of recording them as the relevant asset retirement obligations under liabilities, the amount of lease deposit that cannot ultimately be expected to be collected was estimated in a reasonable manner, and of that, the amount corresponding to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, was recorded under operating expenses. (b) Method of calculating the amount of relevant asset retirement obligations The calculation of asset retirement obligations is based on the following: expected term of use of 4 to 55 years, inflation rate of 0.0% to 4.1%, and discount rate of 0.2% to 5.4%. (c) Increase (decrease) in the total amount of asset retirement obligations in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.
