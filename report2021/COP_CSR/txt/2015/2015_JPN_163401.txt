ORIX Corporation ANNUAL REPORT 2015 02 Brand Slogan Answers, Custom Fit. One of the unchanging factors that has been respected at the ORIX Group since its foundation is our approach to “breakthroughs.” It is our innate approach to think through a problem to provide an answer that matches our clients’ needs. We promise to take this approach with all our stakeholders as expressed in our brand slogan, “Answers, Custom Fit.” Support air travel via aircraft leasing An aircraft may cost from several billion to 10 billion yen or more. It is not easy for airlines to purchase aircraft when they want to increase the number of flights or change the aircraft size. With leasing, airlines do not need to secure large funding for a purchase as leasing companies will purchase and lease aircraft to the airlines. The leading Japanese airlines currently use approximately 200 aircraft. Currently, the total number of aircraft that ORIX owns and/or manages amounts to approximately 130 aircraft, which are leased to airlines worldwide. Adding new value to the aquarium experience ORIX’s involvement in the aquarium business started with our participation in the PFI* business for Enoshima Aquarium. The know-how cultivated through our engagement in business administration via project financing has been utilized effectively in the operation of our aquariums such as Kyoto Aquarium. Through that experience, we have concluded that “aquariums should not exist only for academic purposes and that the creation of new value will lead to business opportunities.” So we figured out ways to make visitor wish to come back again and consequently, the Sumida Aquarium was born. The Aquarium values communications with visitors and show tips to enjoy seeing animals and knowing their charm through the keepers’ words. Achieving 100% recycling A waste recycling facility operated as a PFI business in cooperation with Saitama Prefecture is a waste disposal facility which “produces resources” by ensuring 100% recycling. Our environment business started with intermediary services to connect the waste disposal needs of our customers, with which we had leasing and finance transactions, to waste disposal companies, also our clients, at appropriate quality and cost. On the other hand, as an owner of leased properties, ORIX has carried out appropriate disposal of several tens of thousands of properties annually for which the lease life was completed. Through these processes, we have accumulated knowledge and know-how in the new market of recycling, thereby establishing a network in the industry. Thus, a challenge in waste disposal and recycling resulted in the creation of a new business area. *PFI: Private Finance Initiative; a private-initiative facility management method to highly leverage private funds and/or know-how in the operation of public facilities. 03 Solar power generation realized through Introduction cooperation of diversified human resources Solar power generation converts sunlight into electric power, which is essential for comfortable lives. Running a solar power generation business involves much more than securing project sites and installing solar panels on them. Expertise is also required in funding, legal matters, and other areas such as design, construction, and maintenance. ORIX has been able to successfully build its presence in this business due to its collective human capital comprising of experts from many different fields that resulted from its business diversification from the original leasing business to neighboring business fields such as finance, real estate, environment and energy. As a result, ORIX has now become one of Japan’s top solar power business operators. Renting technologies Precision measuring equipment is used to measure whether various electronic devices such as televisions and smartphones achieve the specified standards. The purchase and ownership of such equipment, which may cost as much as tens of millions of yen and be used only for a fixed period, is a considerable cost burden for electronic device manufacturers. Thus was born the need for precision measuring equipment rental. We not only rent the measuring equipment but also deliver the equipment after having “calibrated” it. Calibration is an important process to ensure precision measurement. We provide equipment with services in which “technologies” are integrated to ensure reliable use by customers. Value change from “Ownership” to “Utilization” ORIX’s auto-related businesses started with automobile leasing. Automobile rentals started in 1985 as an adjacent field of automobile leasing to meet the customer needs of using cars only as necessary. Currently, we also offer car sharing services which allows automobile usage calculated at an even shorter time interval than that of conventional car rentals. ORIX is not the only company that provides car leasing and rental services on the market, but only ORIX can create new customized services which fit customer needs without being limited by existing ideas. As a professional company offering automobile-related services, we will continue to address new challenges. n the ORIX Group website, there is a section introducing real stories explaining the logic and aspirations behind the varus unique businesses and services that ORIX engages in.

ORIX Corporation ANNUAL REPORT 2015 42 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance at ORIX Approach to Corporate Governance ● ORIX believes that a robust corporate governance system is essential for ensuring objective management and carrying out appropriate business activities in line with its core policies. We have therefore established a sound and transparent corporate governance system. ● Corporate governance is a system for management oversight. It involves setting management objectives for managers, performance analysis and evaluation, and supervision in order to ensure that the management strives to attain outstanding results. The tension inherent in corporate governance encourages management to perform to the best of its ability and facilitates innovation in pursuit of corporate objectives. Such an approach is conducive to the achievement of a consistently high ROE. ● Outside Directors have a crucial role to play in corporate governance. From various perspectives reflecting their diverse professional backgrounds, Outside Directors are able to objectively evaluate the management’s performance in ways that transcend the industry’s conventional wisdom and the company’s ingrained practices. Moreover, by virtue of their external perspectives, Outside Directors are in the position to objectively evaluate the risk of the management not taking adequate levels of risks. Evolution of Corporate Governance Since its founding in 1964, ORIX has endeavored to help investors in Japan and 1964 overseas to accurately understand ORIX’s performance and businesses. ORIX has been preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Adopted the U.S. GAAP U.S. GAAP since 1964 and issuing its annual report in English since 1970. In 1970, six years after ORIX was founded, its shares were listed on the Second Section of the Osaka Securities Exchange. Going public reflected our belief that 1970 a company should fulfill its responsibilities as a member of society. Listed on the Second In the 1970s, Tsuneo Inui, then president of ORIX, became an Outside Director of U.S. Leasing International Inc., and Yoshihiko Miyauchi, who succeeded Inui Section of the Osaka as the president of ORIX, also served as an Outside Director of U.S. Leasing. Inui Securities Exchange and Miyauchi’s first-hand experience as Outside Directors for U.S. Leasing has enabled them to understand the benefit of constructive tension created from a third person perspective to a company’s corporate governance. Such experi1997 ence gained at an early stage of ORIX’s development, has been ingrained in the formulation of ORIX’s own ideology toward corporate governance. Established Advisory Board Having established an Advisory Board in 1997 and introduced the Corporate Executive Officer System in 1998, ORIX has been a spearhead in Japan in implementing various initiatives for strengthening corporate governance. 1998 Listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1998 was prompted by the need to Introduced Corporate enhance convenience for the growing number of foreign shareholders and also Executive Officer System based on our belief that the more stringent disclosure requirements by the U.S. Listed on the New York Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would lead to strengthening of corStock Exchange porate governance. ORIX introduced the Outside Director System in 1999 and adopted the “Compa2003 ny with Committees” board model* in 2003. All of our current Outside Directors Adopted the “Company with satisfy the “Conditions for Director Independence” as determined by the NomiCommittees” board model (currently nating Committee and are thereby registered as Independent Directors as per “Company with Nominating the rules imposed by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Committees, etc.” board model) * Adopted the new “Company with Nominating Committees, etc.” board model in line with the amendment of the Companies Act of Japan in 2015. In this way, ORIX has actively strengthened functions aimed at monitoring its management. This is a strict framework for management, but at the same time, we believe that it is the safest framework from the point of view of both management as well as ORIX as a whole. 43 ORIX’s Vision of Corporate Governance Desirable Undesirable Viewpoints of Supervision of management pursuing supervision and ● ● Supervision of legal compliance only operation at the Board enhancement of corporate value ● Operation led by Outside Directors ● Operation led by Executive Officers of Directors meetings ● Productive debate with a healthy degree ● Unproductive discussion lacking a degree Orientation of the way of tension of tension ● Lack of innovation due to excessive risk ● Healthy risk appetite to facilitate innovation the Board of Directors ● Risk evaluation from an objective aversion ● Excessive risk appetite lacking an meetings are perspective objective perspective ● Appointment of management and ● Appointment of management and conducted determination of compensation from determination of compensation entirely shareholders’ viewpoint from an internal perspective Result High ROE sustainable over the long term Low ROE over the long term Corporate Governance Framework (As of July 1, 2015) General Meeting of Shareholders Corporate Governance Board of Directors Executive Officers Reporting Board of Directors CEO and CFO Supervision Reporting Investment and 6 Outside Directors 7 Internal Directors Disclosure Disclosure Credit Committee Committee Control Monthly Strategy Meeting Instructions Group Executive Officer Committee 22 Executive Officers* Information Technology Nominating Committee: 6 Members (5 Outside Directors) 2 Group Executives Management Committee *excluding CEO and CFO Audit Committee: 4 Members (4 Outside Directors) Reporting Instructions/ Audit Compensation Committee: Internal Control-related Operations Requests Committee Monitoring 5 Members (4 Outside Directors) Secretariat Compliance Department Accounting Department IT Planning Department Sales Support Departments Sales Headquarters Other Internal ControlCredit Department Group Companies Reporting Internal Audit Department related Departments Instructions/ Requests Independent Public Accountants Reporting/Supervision Financial Auditing Differences with Respect to the New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Standards ORIX’s ADSs have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1998. As an NYSE-listed company, ORIX is required to comply with certain corporate governance standards under Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. However, as a foreign private issuer, ORIX is permitted to follow home country practice. Our corporate governance practices differ in certain respects from those that U.S. listed companies must adopt. A summary of these differences is as follows: ● ORIX is not required to meet the NYSE’s independence requirements for individuals on its Board of Directors or its Nominating, Audit and Compensation committees. ORIX’s Nominating Committee has determined its own “Conditions for Director Independence.” ● ORIX is not required to have the majority of its Board of Directors comprised of Outside Directors nor is ORIX required to compose its committees exclusively of Outside Directors. Of ORIX’s thirteen directors, six are Outside Directors. In addition, the Audit Committee consists solely of Outside Directors and five of the six members of the Nominating Committee and four of the five members of the Compensation Committee, respectively, are Outside Directors. ORIX Corporation ANNUAL REPORT 2015 44 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance at ORIX Board of Directors The Board of Directors makes business decisions on items that, either as a matter of law or pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation, cannot be delegated to executive officers and important items as determined by the regulations of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is mainly responsible for regular monitoring and approving corporate planning proposals, which includes basic policies on capital management, funding and personnel strategies and policy of internal control. Aside from these items, the Board of Directors delegates business decision making to the representative executive officers for greater efficiency in decision making and execution. The Board of Directors also receives reports from executive officers and committees regarding the status of the execution of their duties. During FY2015.3, the Board of Directors meetings were held seven times. The attendance rate of directors at these meetings was 99%. Members of the Board of Directors (As of July 1, 2015) 13 Directors (including 6 Outside Directors) 7 Directors 6 Outside Directors Name Name ● Makoto Inoue ● Eiko Tsujiyama ● Kazuo Kojima ● Robert Feldman ● Yoshiyuki Yamaya ● Takeshi Niinami ● Tamio Umaki ● Nobuaki Usui ● Katsunobu Kamei ● Ryuji Yasuda ● Yuichi Nishigori ● Heizo Takenaka ● Hideaki Takahashi Nominating Committee, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee ● The Nominating Committee decides and produces proposals to appoint or dismiss directors, which are then submitted at the general meeting of shareholders (appointment and dismissal of directors are subject to resolution at the general meeting of shareholders). The Nominating Committee also deliberates on the appointment or dismissal of executive officers, although this is not required under the Companies Act of Japan. The Nominating Committee has determined the “Conditions for Director Independence.” ● The Audit Committee monitors the execution of the duties of the directors and executive officers and creates audit reports. The Audit Committee decides the content of proposals to appoint, dismiss or refuse the reappointment of the Company’s independent Certified Public Accountants, which are submitted to the general meeting of shareholders. The Audit Committee Secretariat (three members) was established to assist the Audit Committee regarding the execution of its duties. ● The Compensation Committee formulates the policy for determining compensation of each directors and executive officers (“Policy for Determining Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers”) and also decides the specific compensation for each individual directors and executive officers.

The fundamental policy is to ensure that compensation is designed in the way that provides effective incentives to directors and executive officers. Based on this principle, the Committee then establishes specific policies for each director and executive officer in accordance with his/her respective role. Compensation Policy for Directors (who do not concurrently serve as Executive Officers) ● The compensation consists of fixed compensation and share-based compensation*. ● Fixed compensation is, in principle, a specified base amount that is adjusted with additional compensation relating to the position of chairperson and committee member. ● Share-based compensation reflecting mediumto long-term performance is granted in the form of ORIX’s shares, which is calculated based on the number of points earned and accumulated by the individual while in office until retirement. Compensation Policy for Executive Officers (including those who concurrently serve as Directors) ● The compensation consists of fixed compensation, performance-linked compensation and share-based compensation*. ● Fixed compensation is decided based on the standardized base amount for each position followed by an adjustment in accordance with each position’s respective role. ● Performance-linked compensation is derived from the standardized base amount for each position that is adjusted within the range of 0% to 200% based on the attainment level of the consolidated net income target for the current fiscal year as a performance indicator. ● Share-based compensation reflecting mediumto long-term performance is granted in the form of ORIX’s shares, which is calculated based on a certain number of points with standard amount for each position earned and accumulated by the individual while in office until retirement. * Share-based compensation is a program in which points are annually allocated to directors and executive officers based upon prescribed standards while in office, and the actual Corporate Governance number of ORIX’s shares calculated based on the number of accumulated points is provided at the time of retirement. Points granted to the individual directors and/or executive officers are determined based on title and seniority in accordance with guidelines set by the Compensation Committee.

In FY2015.3, no persons serving concurrently as directors and executive officers were remunerated as directors. The total remuneration figure for six people serving concurrently as directors and executive officers is shown in the Executive Officers and Group Executives line. 3.

This compensation amount equals to the accumulated number of points multiplied by the stock price at the time of retirement.

A U.S. holder of the shares or ADSs of the Company is therefore subject to special rules generally intended to eliminate any benefits from the deferral of U.S. federal income tax that a holder could derive from investing in a foreign corporation that does not distribute all of its earnings on a current basis. Investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to such rules, which are summarized under “UNITED STATES TAXATION” in the Company’s Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Presentation of Financial Information The Company’s fiscal year ends on March 31. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, is referred to throughout this Annual Report as the “FY2015.3” and other fiscal years are referred to in a corresponding manner.
