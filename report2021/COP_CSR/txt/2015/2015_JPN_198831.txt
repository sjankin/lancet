Sojitz Group Slogan Sojitz Guiding Principles The Sojitz Group aims to create value for our stakeholders by aligning our strong, capable individuals under the following 5 principles: 1. Trust: Build enduring trust. 2. Innovation: Innovate with foresight. 3. Speed: Strive for speed. 4. Challenge: Take calculated risks. 5. Perseverance: Persevere until successful. United Nations Global Compact Sojitz signed the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) to clarify its ideals in its global operations, including respect for the environment and human rights through businesses that comply with international standards as well as the laws of countries and regions. The UNGC calls for businesses to exercise leadership as members of the international community and pursue sustainability. Sojitz joined the UNGC in 2009. We support the ten principles of the UNGC in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption, and practice these principles through our business activities. Editorial Policy Publication of the Integrated Report This report communicates our goal of creating prosperity as stated in the Sojitz Group Statement, the capabilities we exercise to create value in cooperation with our partners, and our value creation targets. For this report, the Sojitz Group organized its business model with a set of processes for creating value over the medium to long term, and clarified that its people are the starting point of value creation. We now call our annual report an integrated report because we produced it with reference to the international framework and guidelines of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) to communicate how we create value through key financial and non-financial information. Accordingly, the report provides stakeholders worldwide with multifaceted, easily comprehensible coverage of issues including our approach to value creation, management strategies, business summaries, financial condition, diverse capabilities, competitive strengths and relationship with society in the first year of Medium-term Management Plan 2017 – Challenge for Growth, which significantly shifts the Sojitz Group’s emphasis to growth. Previous annual reports presented the relationship of our business activities with society and the environment in a separate corporate social responsibility (CSR) section. With the integrated report for the year ended March 31, 2015, we shifted to an approach, based on the two types of value, that incorporates reporting on this relationship in sections including management strategies, business summaries and corporate governance. We would like to further improve the content of the integrated report in line with the opinions of stakeholders. The IIRC’s emphasis on materiality is representative. We plan to upgrade our existing key themes with a new concept of materiality in value creation. Please visit our website for additional details. http://www.sojitz.com/en/ Notes: 1.

Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 7 Sojitz’s Value Creation Model Prosperity The World Determine Value for society needs • Development of local economies • Environmental preservation and respect for human rights through business activities Our people Exercise Create value capabilities Speed up Strategies Value for Sojitz • Enhanced business foundation • Sustained growth Domestic Business Governance and overseas expertise bases Relationships Brands with Human customers Finances resources Business Foundation Trust 8 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 The essence of Sojitz’s value creation model: improving the capabilities of its people Sojitz delivers value to stakeholders and society through a value creation process that draws on highly effective strategies and comprehensive corporate governance to determine needs, exercise capabilities and create value. A trading company is all about its people, and people are the core of our value creation model. Sojitz’s businesses are not limited to delivering goods and services and importing and exporting commodities. We link these activities with global needs to create value, which makes our people, who create that value, critically important. Enhancing their capabilities through our value creation model is the source of our ability to create value. Increasing corporate value with a rapid value creation cycle Sojitz’s value creation process has three steps. The first is determining needs by understanding the evolving needs of stakeholders around the world. The second is exercising our capabilities through trading, investment in interests and business investment. The third is creating value that meets the needs of stakeholders by exercising our capabilities. In addition, we use governance to unite the elements of our business foundation, which is required for setting strategic directions with our value creation process, implementing our strategies and exercising our capabilities. Sojitz operates globally in a diverse array of businesses, so speeding this process up is essential for increasing its corporate value over the medium to long term given the swift pace of change in the external environment and the diversification of needs. Maximizing two types of value through our value creation cycle Our objective in our value creation cycle is to maximize two types of value: value for society and value for Sojitz. We believe that the way to create value and prosperity according to the Sojitz Group Statement is to maximize the value we share with society. To do so, we must first clarify the value that we return to society and the value we gain for ourselves, with an awareness of the difference between the perspective of society, which expects national and local economic development as well as consideration of the environment, and the perspective of companies, which aim for greater competitiveness in business. One type of value we create is returned to society as solutions that meet social needs. This value leads to greater stakeholder trust for Sojitz. The other type of value enhances our human resources and business expertise, which form our business foundation. This type of value leads to greater competitiveness and more new business opportunities for Sojitz. As our business foundation is enhanced, the value creation cycle continues, further increasing the trust we gain from society and Sojitz’s unique strengths and identity. Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 9 Creating Two Types of Value (Case Studies) Sojitz creates two types of value by exercising its capabilities to meet needs. In this section, we use representative businesses to illustrate how the value created by Sojitz is returned to society, and the value that Sojitz gains for itself.

In addition, the main assumption used to determine such forecast was the growth rate of gross profits through such terms, such growth rate being consistent with the forecasts of the nominal GDP growth rate or the like of the countries in which such cash-generating unit groups are situated. The discount rates before tax and ultimate growth rates which were used in calculating the value in use of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, respectively, were as follows. (a) Discount rate before tax 2014 2015 Chemicals Parent company’s chemical business ............................................................................................. 8.7% 6.7% Consumer Lifestyle Business The domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business ............................................................................. 6.8% 6.8% (b) Ultimate growth rate In regards to cash flows for the terms beyond the five-year forecast period that was approved by management, the value in use is calculated with a growth rate of 0% for each such term. With respect to goodwill that has been allocated to cash-generating unit groups, the recoverable amount of such goodwill sufficiently exceeds its carrying amount. Thus, even if major assumptions are changed to a reasonable extent, the probability of such recoverable amount becoming less than the carrying amount is unlikely.

These appraisals are calculated based on either the public offering price, a sales comparison approach or discount cash flow approach. Upon an acquisition from a third party or at the time of the most recent appraisal, if there is no significant fluctuation in the index, which is believed to reflect a certain appraised value (market or assessed price) or appropriate market value, the fair value is adjusted using such appraised value or index. As set forth under “2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments”, fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. Investment property is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. 132 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (2) Profit or loss relating to investment property Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2014 2015 2015 Rental income from investment property .................................................................... 4,725 4,600 38,333 Expenses arising from investment property ................................................................

Certain domestic subsidiaries have welfare pension funds and/or lump-sum payment plans that are primarily defined benefit plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans. Payments by these plans are calculated using criteria including employee rank and salary level. In some cases, employees receive severance pay upon retirement. 2) Defined benefit plan (a) Net defined benefit liability (asset) Changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 were as follows.

(894) (945) (7,875) (e) Maturity profile for the defined benefit obligation The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 was 10.8 years and 10.7 years, respectively. (f) Expected contribution to the plan for the year ending March 31, 2016 The Group expects to contribute 463 million yen (U.S.$3,858 thousand) to plan assets for the year ending March 31, 2016. 148 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 3) Defined contribution plan Expenses recognized for the defined contribution plan for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 were 2,338 million yen and 1,624 million yen (U.S.$13,533 thousand), respectively. 4) Multi-employer plans Certain subsidiaries participate in the “Sojitz Group Pension Fund”, which is a multi-employer plan established jointly by a group of businesses. In addition, Group subsidiary Nissho Electronics Corporation participates in the “Tokyo-to Electric Industry Employee’s Pension Fund Organization”, which is also a multi-employer plan. The contributions for each fund are calculated as a fixed percentage of the average salary or the like of participating employees. In addition, each fund ensures future solvency by revising the contribution a minimum of every five years in accordance with relevant regulations. If the funds are dissolved and liquidated, they will charge participants to cover deficits or distribute residual assets calculated by minimum funding standards based on regulations or the like. In addition, companies that elect to withdraw from the funds are subject to a charge to cover any liabilities and deficits projected to result from their withdrawal. The Sojitz Group Pension Fund is a defined benefit plan, but does not determine discrete contribution rates and proportional contributions for past service costs for each participating employer. The Group therefore accounts for its contributions to this fund as a post-employment benefit expense because the plan assets that correspond to the contribution of each participating subsidiary cannot be reasonably calculated. The Tokyo-to Electric Industry Employee’s Pension Fund Organization is a defined benefit, multi-employer plan. The Group accounts for its contributions to this fund as a post-employment benefit expense because the plan assets that correspond to the contribution of Nissho Electronics Corporation cannot be reasonably calculated.

Because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of such temporary differences, and it is probable that such temporary differences will not be reversed within the foreseeable future, the Group did not recognize deferred tax liabilities with respect to such temporary differences.

In Japan, following the promulgation of the “Act for Partial Revision of the Income Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 10 of 2014), the “Act for Partial Revision of the Local Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 4 of 2014), the “Local Corporate Tax Law” (Act No. 11 of 2014) on March 31, 2014 and effective from fiscal years beginning on and after April 1, 2014, the corporate tax rate, etc. were amended. Accordingly, the effective tax rate used to calculate the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will be changed from 38.0% to 35.6% for temporary differences or the like expected to be reversed for the fiscal year beginning from April 1, 2014. In addition, following the promulgation of the “Act for Partial Revision of the Income Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 9 of 2015), the “Act for Partial Revision of the Local Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 2 of 2015) on March 31, 2015 and effective from fiscal years beginning on and after April 1, 2015, the corporate tax rate, etc. were amended. Accordingly, the effective tax rate used to calculate the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will be changed from 35.6% to 33.1% for temporary differences or the like expected to be reversed in the fiscal year beginning from April 1, 2015, and to 32.3% for those expected to be reversed from the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2016. 31 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (1) Classes of financial instruments The breakdown of financial instruments per class was as follows.

Its headquarters includes business sections that handle merchandising, trading, product manufacturing, services, project planning and management, investments and financing activities, both domestically and internationally. Such businesses are inherently exposed to various risks. The Group defines and classifies risks per risk item and manages each of them in accordance with its nature. (3) Credit risk management The Group assumes credit risk by extending credit to many domestic and foreign customers through a variety of commercial transactions. The Group mitigates such credit risk by objectively assigning credit ratings to the customers to which it extends credit based on the Company’s credit rating system. The Group also controls credit risk by setting rating-based credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus set. The Group employs other safeguards (e.g., collaterals and guarantees) as warranted by the customer’s creditworthiness. Additionally, the Group has a system for assessing receivables, in which customers are extracted based on a certain criteria, then assessed for their creditworthiness. With respect to such selected customers, the Group also checks for existence of any receivables, protection measures or the like. Through the above, the Group endeavors to more rigorously ascertain credit risk and calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts for each account receivable. Please note that the Group does not carry any excessive credit risk with respect to any specified customer. In regards to derivative transactions, the Group only deals with financial institutions with high credit ratings, as assigned by internationallyacknowledged rating agencies, so as to minimize the credit risks. The Group also periodically reviews the credit ratings of counterparties to such derivative transactions and re-evaluates credit limits so as to minimize credit risks based on non-performance by such counterparties. 1) Maximum exposure to credit risk Other than guaranteed obligations, the Group’s maximum exposure with respect to credit risks without taking into account any collaterals held or other credit enhancements is the carrying amount of financial instruments less impairment losses under the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. On the other hand, the Group’s maximum exposures to credit risks concerning guaranteed obligations as of March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 were 30,172 million yen and 27,092 million yen (U.S.$225,766 thousand), respectively. 2) Financial assets that are past the due date The analysis of aging of trade and other receivables that were past the due date but not impaired as of the end of the year was as follows. The amounts below include amounts expected to be collected through acquisition of security, insurance coverage or the like.

Trade and other receivables that were individually determined to be impaired as of the end of the year were as follows.

Accordingly, in the event of a disruption to the financial system or financial/capital markets, or a major downgrade of the Group’s credit rating by a rating agency, the Group’s fundraising becomes constrained and consequently there is a possibility that the Group will not be able to carry out the payment on the date of payment. The Group has a long-term commitment line agreement in the amount of 100 billion yen and a multi-currency commitment line agreement in the amount of U.S.$300 million dollars for the securing of liquidity/stability of funds. The Group makes efforts to maintain good relationships with each financial institution, including each of the counterparties to the commitment line agreements. 1) Non-derivative financial liabilities The breakdown of non-derivative financial liabilities by due date was as follows. 2014 Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 504,770 19,305 1,593 525,669 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 241,860 647,744 228,150 1,117,755 Total ............................................................................................ 746,630 667,050 229,743 1,643,425 2015 Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 483,086 16,421 1,484 500,992 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 210,571 635,574 253,061 1,099,207 Total ............................................................................................ 693,657 651,996 254,545 1,600,199 2015 Thousands of U.S. dollars Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 4,025,716 136,841 12,366 4,174,933 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 1,754,758 5,296,450 2,108,841 9,160,058 Total ............................................................................................ 5,780,475 5,433,300 2,121,208 13,334,991 Other than the above, the guarantees for obligations as March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 were 30,172 million yen and 27,092 million yen (U.S.$225,766 thousand), respectively. 154 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2) Derivatives The breakdown of derivatives by due date was as follows. 2014 Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Currency-related derivatives Cash inflows .................................................................................... 295,999 7,734 — 303,733 Cash outflows .................................................................................

(19,666) (1,100) (3,566) (24,341) (5) Market risk management The Group is exposed to market risks, such as exchange rate fluctuation risk associated with transactions denominated in foreign currencies in connection with international trade or business investments, interest rate fluctuation risk associated with financing, investments or the like, commodity price fluctuation risk associated with purchase and sale agreements/commodity inventories arising from operating activities and price fluctuation risk associated with the ownership of listed securities (i.e., stock price fluctuation risk). The Group’s basic policy is to minimize such market risks by matching assets and liabilities (e.g., long and short commodity exposures) and through hedge transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, commodity futures/forward transactions and interest rate swaps. Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 155 1) Exchange rate fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policy for managing, exchange rate fluctuation risk The Group engages in import and export transactions and offshore transactions, both denominated in foreign currencies, as its principal business activity. Whereas the revenues and expenditures associated with such transactions are mainly received/paid out in foreign currencies, the Group’s consolidated reporting currency is Japanese yen. The Group is, therefore, exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the yen’s value against foreign currencies. To prevent or limit losses stemming from such risk, the Group hedges its foreign currency exposure through forward exchange transactions or the like. 2. Sensitivity analysis of exchange rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, that would result from 1% appreciation of yen against each of the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. In addition, such analysis does not include the affected amounts based on translations (into Japanese yen) of financial instruments denominated in functional currency, income and expenses denominated in foreign currency and assets and liabilities of foreign operations. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2014 2015 2015 Profit before tax U.S. dollar ........................................................................................................... 363 716 5,966 Australian dollar ...................................................................................................

Content of, and policy for managing, interest rate fluctuation risk The Group’s finances include credit terms for trade and other receivables, purchases of investment securities, and expenditures for property, plant and equipment that are primarily funded with loans from financial institutions and bond issues, and the Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risks arising from financing, investments or the like. Since borrowings with floating rates are exposed to interest rate risk, the Group hedges a part of such borrowings through interest swap transactions. 2. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amount affecting profit before tax, as reported in the consolidated financial statements, in the case that the interest rate increases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. Under such analysis, the amount affecting profit before tax is calculated by multiplying the net balance of the financial instruments affected by the interest rate fluctuation at the fiscal year-end by 1%. Please note that other than financial instruments with floating rates (excluding those that are considered to be financial instruments with fixed rates in substance due to interest rate swaps), the Group deals with, among others, the following financial instruments that are also affected by interest rate fluctuations: cash and cash equivalents; time deposits; trade notes and accounts receivable; and, trade notes and accounts payable. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2014 2015 2015 Profit before tax .................................................................................................... 830 1,811 15,091 3) Commodity price fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policies for managing, commodity price fluctuation risk As a general trading company, the Group deals in a wide range of commodities through its various businesses. As such, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk due to price fluctuations or the like. For market-traded commodities, the Group manages exposures and controls losses by setting (long and short) position limits and stop-loss levels per internal organizational unit. The Group also prescribes and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., an internal organizational unit must promptly liquidate losing positions and be prohibited from initiating new trades for the remainder of the fiscal year if losses, including valuation losses, exceed the stop-loss level). Even with such controls, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid commodity price risk. The Group’s management performance and/or financial conditions may be adversely affected by unanticipated market movements. With respect to commodity inventories, the Group implements measures, such as monthly monitoring by business or the like, in order to control inventory levels. 156 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 2. Sensitivity analysis of commodity price fluctuation risk In regards to derivatives related to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, in the case that the commodity price decreases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.

Content of, and policies for managing, stock price fluctuation risk The Group has large holdings of marketable securities and, therefore, is exposed to stock price fluctuation risk. Against such risk, the Group makes efforts to understand market prices and financial conditions or the like of issuers and, especially with respect to listed stocks, the Group reviews their portfolios on a periodic basis. 2. Sensitivity analysis of stock price fluctuation risk In regards to listed stocks held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, in the case that prices of such listed stocks decrease by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.

As set forth under “2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments”, fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. 1) Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars 2014 2015 2015 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value amount value Financial assets Trade and other receivables Trade notes and accounts receivable ............................... 493,556 493,463 521,720 521,479 4,347,666 4,345,658 Total ......................................................................... 493,556 493,463 521,720 521,479 4,347,666 4,345,658 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables Trade notes and accounts payable .................................. 441,241 441,241 413,707 413,705 3,447,558 3,447,541 Bonds and borrowings Bonds payable (including current portion) ........................ 89,755 91,047 99,688 101,229 830,733 843,575 Long-term loans (including current portion) ...................... 844,442 866,981 835,936 857,463 6,966,133 7,145,525 Total ......................................................................... 1,375,438 1,399,269 1,349,333 1,372,398 11,244,441 11,436,650 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 157 The fair values stated above are calculated as follows. (a) Trade notes and accounts receivable Each receivable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk. (b) Trade notes and accounts payable Each payable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk. (c) Bonds and borrowings The fair value of bonds payable is the market price when available. The fair value of long-term loans is the present value of total principal and interest discounted using an assumed interest rate on equivalent new borrowings. Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2. 2) Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value ① Analysis of fair value by hierarchy level The following tables provide analysis by level reflecting the significance of inputs used when measuring fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that are measured at fair value. No financial assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 2014 Millions of yen Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Recurring fair value measurements Other investments Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss ............ — 316 583 900 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ................................................................. 84,321 — 48,403 132,725 Derivative financial assets and liabilities ................................................ 144 (2,871) — (2,726) Total ............................................................................................ 84,465 (2,554) 48,987 130,898 2015 Millions of yen Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Recurring fair value measurements Other investments Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss ............ — 343 643 986 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ................................................................. 120,126 — 53,678 173,805 Derivative financial assets and liabilities ................................................

(a) Other investments The fair value of listed shares is the quoted price on an exchange, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. The fair value of unlisted shares is calculated using valuation methods including discounted future cash flow, market prices of comparable companies, net asset value, and other valuation methods, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. Measuring the fair value of unlisted shares involves the use of unobservable inputs such as discount rate and valuation multiples, as well as any necessary adjustments including discounts for a lack of liquidity or a non-controlling interest. The Group’s corporate departments determine the policies and procedures for measuring the fair value of unlisted shares, and validate their approach to measuring fair value, including the valuation model, by periodically confirming issues such as the operating circumstances associated with particular equities, the availability of relevant business plans, and data from comparable public companies. (b) Derivative financial assets and liabilities Currency-related derivatives The fair values of foreign exchange transactions, spot/forward transactions, currency option transactions and currency swap transactions are calculated based on the forward exchange rate as of the closing date. Interest rate-related derivatives The fair value of interest-rate swaps is the present value of future cash flow discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to settlement and credit risk. Commodity-related derivatives The fair value of commodity futures transactions is calculated using final prices on commodities exchanges as of the fiscal year-end. The fair values of commodity forward transactions, commodity option transactions and commodity swap transactions are calculated based on the index prices publicly announced at the fiscal year-end. Commodity futures transactions are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. All other derivative financial assets and liabilities are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2. ② Recurring fair value measurements categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 The increases/decreases in financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 were as follows.

Total gains or losses recognized as profit or loss included losses of 47 million yen and gains of 79 million yen (U.S.$658 thousand) on financial instruments held as of the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, respectively. Gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income are included in “Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income” in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. “Others” of “Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income” includes the transferring from fair value hierarchy Level 3 to Level 1 due to the fact that the securities of an investee began to be publicly traded for a six-month period in the year ended March 31, 2015, which amounted to (3,629) million yen (U.S.$(30,241) thousand). Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 159 (7) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income With respect to investments made in equity instruments held for the purpose of maintaining and strengthening relationships with business partners, the Group has designated such investments as financial assets to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in consideration of such purpose. 1) Fair values per name (of investment) The fair values per name of the main investments made in equity instruments designated as financial assets to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income were as follows. 2014 Millions of yen Name of investment Amount NHK Spring Co., Ltd. 10,858 Kansai Paint Co., Ltd. 6,818 Kobe Steel, Ltd. 6,167 ANA Holdings Inc. 3,152 Yamazaki Baking Co., Ltd. 2,931 Braskem S.A. 2,764 Japan Airport Terminal Co., Ltd. 2,265 Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. 2,239 Tokuyama Corporation 2,191 PT.

The fair values of such financial assets at the dates of the sales transactions and the cumulative gains (before taxes) concerning such sales were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2014 2015 2015 Fair value at the date of sale ...................................................................................... 1,877 6,412 53,433 Cumulative gains ....................................................................................................... 774 861 7,175 160 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2015 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 4) Reclassification to retained earnings The Group reclassifies to retained earnings cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in either of the following cases: when an investment is disposed of; and, when there is a significant decline in the fair value. Such cumulative other comprehensive income totals (net of taxes) that were reclassified to retained earnings for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 were losses of 1,400 million yen and gains of 687 million yen (U.S.$5,725 thousand), respectively. (8) Hedge accounting 1) Types of hedge accounting (a) Fair value hedges A fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. The Group designates commodity futures and commodity forwards as hedging instruments to hedge the changes in fair values of firm commitments or inventories. With respect to a fair value hedge, gains or losses from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value are recognized as profit or loss, and gains or losses on hedged items attributable to hedged risks are also recognized as profit or loss. Gains and losses recognized as profit or loss relating to hedged items for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 were (275) million yen and 394 million yen (U.S.$3,283 thousand), respectively, and gains and losses recognized as profit or loss relating to hedging instruments for the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 were 275 million yen and (394) million yen (U.S.$(3,283) thousand), respectively. (b) Cash flow hedges A cash flow hedge is a hedge of exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a scheduled transaction that is most likely to occur. The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows relating to floating-rate borrowings and designates forward exchange transactions as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows concerning firm commitments in foreign currency. With respect to a cash flow hedge, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income. For the years ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, accumulated amounts of other comprehensive income that were expected to be reclassified to profit or loss within one year due to cash flow hedges (before tax effect adjustments) were profit of 1,199 million yen and profit of 570 million yen (U.S.$4,750 thousand), respectively. (c) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The group designates forward exchange transactions and foreign currency borrowings as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of change in exchange rate concerning net investments in foreign operations. With respect to a hedge of net investments in foreign operations, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income. 2) Fair values of hedging instruments by type of hedge accounting Fair values of hedging instruments by type of hedge accounting were as follows.
