Corporate Responsibility Overview & Governance Statement of Support It is my pleasure to present to you Treasury Wine Estates’ (TWE) United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress which reports on the work undertaken against the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (the Compact) for the 2014 and 2015 financial years. I am pleased to confirm TWE’s continuing support of the Compact Principles, in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and AntiCorruption. Progress on the fulfilment of our commitment to the Compact is led by the Company’s Corporate Responsibility Program and TWE’s Global Corporate Responsibility Council, which I chair. The Principles are incorporated throughout the businesses operations, with an aim to ensure TWE is a positive force in the communities in which we operate. Our achievements in progressing the principles of the UN Global Compact during the 2014 and 2015 financial years are presented in this report, and build on those reported in previous Communications on Progress. I invite you to read through our recent achievements, and encourage you to provide your thoughts and feedback on our progress to date via email at csrprogram@tweglobal.com. Michael Clarke Chief Executive Officer 3 Treasury Wine Estates Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) is a global wine company with a leading international portfolio of wines. Publically listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), TWE is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia. TWE owns or leases over 11,000 hectares of vineyards in Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Italy, where we also produce and package wine. In FY15, we sold approximately 30 million cases of wine, with revenue in the order of AU$1.85 billion from across our brands, which include Penfolds, Lindeman’s, Wolf Blass, Rosemount, Beringer, Gabbiano, and Matua. TWE directly employs approximately 3,000 winemakers, viticulturists, sales, distribution and support staff across 16 countries and our wines are sold in more than 70 countries globally. 4 Human Rights Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Our Approach TWE values and respects the diversity of our employees and is committed to a workplace where everyone is treated equally, and in which no-one is discriminated against on the basis of gender, age, race, religion, sexual orientation or marital status, and where no-one is subject to or commits any act of harassment. These expectations our detailed in our Code of Conduct and within our Diversity & Inclusion Policy which are available on our website. In FY12, TWE launched its Diversity and Inclusion Council to accelerate focus on our diversity goals and objectives. Since December 2013, the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) have operated as the Diversity Council, replacing the initial cross-functional group. This change reflected the need for the ELT to lead the Diversity and Inclusion agenda. The Council determines TWE’s annual measurable objectives, progress against which is reported in TWE’s Annual Report. The CEO and all ELT members have diversity and inclusion measures and targets in their individual Key Performance Objectives. The Policy and associated targets are overseen by the Human Resources Committee of the Board, and the Diversity and Inclusion Policy is reviewed annually by the Board. 6 Human Rights, cont’d The Code of Conduct commits employees to behave in accordance with outlined principles which include that they maintain a work environment free of discrimination, harassment and bullying. These Policies are supported by online or face to face training with new employees when they commence in the business. This training covers harassment, discrimination and bullying, amongst other topics (some of which are covered below). Employees are encouraged to raise any concerns via the mechanisms outlined in TWE’s issue resolution processes or via the Whistleblower process. In addition, all employees have access to free confidential and professional counselling through our Employee Assistance Program (EAP). To ensure the Company is not complicit in human rights abuses, TWE launched its Responsible Procurement Code in 2009, detailing TWE’s expectations of its suppliers in relation to social and environmental practices. The Responsible Procurement Code specifically refers to our commitment to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and internationally proclaimed human rights. This Code has been embedded through tender and supplier on-boarding processes and contractual obligations. Finally, to enable our staff to contribute to global human rights efforts, we provide a program to match fundraising efforts and volunteer leave for all employees. The ‘1124 Gift’ program matches employees fundraising to a total of $1124AUD. Each employee is also entitled to one day of volunteer leave per year. 7 Human Rights, cont’d Achievements in FY13: •Surveyed our employees globally on matters relating to diversity and inclusion to assist in determining FY14 focus areas; •Established a global women’s networking group, Women in Wine, with the aim of inspiring, connecting and motivating women at all levels of our organisation; •Updated the TWE Diversity and Inclusion policy; and •Incorporated the Responsible Procurement Code and evaluation process into requests for tender during FY13. 8 Human Rights, cont’d In addition to the framework outlined above, TWE has taken the following measures in FY14 and FY15 to protect against human rights violations in its business: •Further embedded the TWE Responsible Procurement Code incorporating it into all tenders and the partner engagement process, and consequent contractual arrangements. •Updated the Diversity and Inclusion Policy. •Agreed new diversity and inclusion targets, which are overseen by the Board and reported in the Annual Report. •Expanded the Procure to Pay Policy, which references the Company’s commitment to the UNGC and human rights, to cover the entire company, and included it as part of compliance training.

Our company owned and operated vineyards, wineries and packaging centres are located in regions governed by a wide range of labour laws and standards which are reflected in our employee and contractor agreements and workplace conditions. TWE respects employees’ freedom of association in the workplace by ensuring that persons are free to become, or not become, members of industrial associations, are free to be represented, or not represented, by industrial associations, and are free to participate, or not participate, in lawful industrial activities, to join a union or engage in other forms of collective bargaining if they so choose, to the extent permitted by law. In these cases, TWE will engage with trade unions where employees are represented by such, to negotiate employment frameworks. In support of the need to recognise peoples’ individual circumstances, TWE has a Flexible Work Practices Global Policy which establishes the framework through which employees can apply and have approved flexible work practices. Flexible work can be formal or informal, depending on the circumstances. 11 Labour, cont’d TWE also provides leave to all employees globally, in line with regional legislative requirements and standards. Various leave types are provided including annual/vacation leave, sick/carers leave and volunteer leave. The safety of employees, and all who visit TWE locations, is governed by our Workplace Health and Safety Policy, which outlines our goal for zero harm or injury to our employees, contractors, visitors and others who visit our operations. TWE has its own occupational health and safety management program which defines the minimum standards all business units are expected to achieve in eliminating or minimising risk. TWE employs specialist occupational health and safety staff and management to oversee the program, which includes a system to report actual or near miss incidents, hazards and observations and manage them and corrective actions. New employees are required to undertake online or face to face training on health and safety, including safe systems of work, duties of employees, employers, contractors, labour hire and managing safety incidences. TWE’s commitment to labour rights is outlined in its Responsible Procurement Code, which states TWE’s expectation that suppliers comply with all legislative and ratified ILO conventions on the treatment of the supplier’s workforce. 12 Labour, cont’d It also requires that suppliers: •ensure that their workforce receives legally mandated benefits in the form of a relevant minimum wage; •ensure that working hours comply with local laws and suppliers do not require their workforce to work excessive hours to a degree that may impact personal health and safety; •treat their workforce fairly and provide them with workplaces free of harassment, abuse, intimidation, and corporal punishment; •ensure their workforce is appropriately authorised and permitted to perform the work that they are engaged to do; •ensure Health and Safety policies exist that, at a minimum, comply with local laws; •ensure a Health and Safety system exists that aims to reduce hazardous working conditions and work related injury and illness; and •allow employees the freedom to join a union or engage in other forms of collective bargaining if they so choose, to the extent permitted by law. 13 Labour, cont’d Achievements in FY13: •Finalised the BSCI Code of Conduct fact sheets and guidelines for Australia. •Incorporated the Responsible Procurement Code and evaluation process into requests for tender during FY13. •Achieved a 14.8% improvement in our reportable case injury frequency rate reducing this from 14.9 to 12.7. 14 Labour, cont’d In addition to the framework outlined above, TWE has taken the following measures in FY14 and FY15 to promote labour rights in its business: •Developed a new three year Health, Safety and Environment plan which will improve health and safety leadership and auditing of the health and safety framework. •Reviewed the Workplace Health and Safety Policy to include a reference to both physical and mental wellbeing. •Undertook initiatives to promote mental health awareness in the Australia business. •Made improvements on TWE’s primary safety indicator (now lost time injury frequency rate, previously reportable case injury frequency rate), which has reduced from 7.2 in FY13 to 4.2 in FY15. •Developed a number of leading indicators such as near miss reporting ratio and corrective action close out. •Further embedded the TWE Responsible Procurement Code incorporating it into all tenders and the partner engagement process, and consequent contractual arrangements. •Undertook a review of labour hire contractors in Australia, and introduced improved processes and controls to ensure labour hire contractors understand their obligations relating to providing their employees with appropriate benefits. 15 Environment Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.
