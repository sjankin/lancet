Supply quality incadicators In 2014, Copel invested R$50 million in the project, totaling R$350 million, planned for the years 2010 to 2014. 14.01 11.62 10.25 8.92 7.84 8.06 Distributed generation is a concept that has been studied and developed in the 2012 country with the goal of transforming small consumers, located near other end 2013 consumers, in power generators. For example, a building starts to generate energy from solar panels, which supplies its own consumption and returns to the 2014 system the surplus energy. 2.08 1.51 1.49 The potential benefits of distributed generation, when the project achieve greater DEC (hours)(1) FEC (outages)(2) Waiting time scale, include minimizing technical losses in transmission and distribution lines, (hours) power generation with lower costs and environmental impacts compared to (1) DEC measured in hours and hours centesimal. traditional generation and higher system stability and reliability. (2) The FEC indicator number has been corrected in relation to the published in the Company’s Financial Statements, since the need for reprocessing that generated the change was identified. However, the difference between the indicators has already been rectified with the regulatory authority (Aneel). In 2014, a number of factors contributed to the DEC and FEC indicators exceeding Copel’s limit, which included the following: • Increased severity of weather events compared to previous years, including the months that are normally considered “dry”. An example was the floods that occurred in June, causing 147 municipalities to declare an emergency or disaster. • Load Record (5,668 MW) in February, with high demand value causing “stress” in networks, in addition to operating restrictions and contingencies. • Increased outages to carry out improvement works related to the expansion of investment. 2014 COPEL Sustainability Report Operational and Economic Performance 62 / Copel’s targets for 2015 are: 11.13 (hours and centesimal hours) G4-EU30 for the DEC and 8.06 (outages) for the FEC.
