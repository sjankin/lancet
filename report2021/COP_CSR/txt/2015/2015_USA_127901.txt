Sincerely, Jim Goodnight CEO of SAS Governance & Management Solid management, performance and compliance for a sustainable enterprise Robust regulatory compliance practices ensure that SAS conducts business in an honest, respectful, fair and safe manner. Guided by the Code of Ethics (PDF), SAS’ compliance practices have earned the company its exceptional reputation as an ethical and responsible employer and business partner. SAS is committed to maintaining this reputation and conducting all aspects of the business in a way that promotes and reflects ethical practices. Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 2 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 Ethics SAS is committed to demonstrating honesty, fairness and accountability in every decision and action, including each interaction with employees, customers, suppliers and competitors. The SAS Code of Ethics helps the company define and maintain highest standards for respect, honesty, fairness and accountability. This SAS Code of Ethics applies to every employee – at every subsidiary and in every region – as well as all members of the board of directors, officers appointed by the board of directors and agents. 2013 Data: In 2013, SAS did not have any substantiated incidents with regard to public policy, privacy, corruption, ethics, bribery, anti-competitive actions, anti-trust violations or monopoly practices, or negative impacts on society. Nor were there any fines for noncompliance with laws and regulations. Training The Ethics and Compliance group at SAS has developed courses to help employees abide by the SAS Code of Ethics and applicable external rules and regulations. SAS provides this training to equip all employees to make the right choices when ethical and regulatory challenges arise. Online trainings were developed under the management and oversight of the vice president and general counsel for ethics and compliance, with input from many departments across SAS, and with ultimate approval by the chief legal officer. All trainings since 2012 are available in English, simplified Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish. How SAS monitors completion and renewal of training varies, depending on relevant policies, strategies, trainings and codes. Online training completions are tracked by the third-party vendor that helped to create them, as well as by the company’s internal learning management system. Automated reminders are sent to those who have not completed training as the deadline approaches, and managers are contacted as trainings become overdue. Employees and certain contract workers are required to take some or all of the following training: • Code of Ethics • Information Security • Export Controls Awareness • SAS Business Ethics in Selling • Buying and Competing • Respect in the Workplace • Foreign Corrupt Practices Act • Privacy and Data Protection for Global Companies SAS provides specialized training for personnel as needed. For example, California employees take Sexual Harassment: Promoting Appropriate Behavior, as required by California law. Employees who work with military and intelligence sector government customers take Defense Export Controls (ITAR). In-person, targeted compliance training is conducted periodically. These trainings are developed by the Ethics and Compliance group in the Legal Division with input from the relevant functional business units. For example, in 2013, SAS conducted anti-corruption training for government sales and marketing Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 3 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 groups, privacy training for IT staff, and HIPAA training for employees interacting with data in the company’s health care center or associated with its health care industry solutions. Employee Feedback Employees are responsible for immediately communicating concerns regarding suspected unethical or illegal conduct to a supervisor, Human Resources or the general counsel. Specific procedures for reporting concerns are displayed on the Legal Division's internal website. Employees may submit comments via email, telephone help line, or an anonymous report or online form. SAS does not retaliate against anyone who reports suspected violations in good faith. All reports of misconduct are investigated in a timely fashion. Unless the complaining individual chooses to remain anonymous, he or she receives feedback on the results of the investigation, to the extent allowed by applicable law. Anti-­‐Corruption & Export Controls Anti-Corruption SAS has an anti-corruption program to provide training and monitoring across the company. As part of this program, all employees take an online anti-corruption course upon hire. 2013 Data: In 2013, SAS updated its anti-corruption program and added anti-bribery, gift, campaign contribution and donation policy documents, along with other policy and process guidance. These documents are available to all employees on the Ethics and Compliance internal website. In addition, SAS enhanced its advance due diligence program to cover subcontractors (in addition to partners) and began to build a program for engaging in transaction-by-transaction due diligence measures. SAS prohibits the use of corporate funds for political contributions to individual candidates. Corporate contributions may be made to political parties or national or state political party organizations if approved through established procedures. SAS records and reports all corporate political contributions in accordance with applicable local laws. Export Controls SAS maintains an export management system complete with product licensing and screening processes that include checking employees, customers and suppliers against the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list and certain other government lists of prohibited parties. SAS classifies our products according to US export laws and makes such classifications available to our customers at the SAS Current Export Designation Information page. Privacy The Ethics and Compliance group in the SAS Legal Division ensures that SAS’ use of personal data complies with applicable laws, SAS policies and customer expectations. SAS Global Information Security Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 4 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 establishes processes and deploys technologies to protect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data in the custody or control of SAS. These groups work closely to manage data privacy issues and security by, among other things, establishing information governance policies, standards, guidelines and processes based on regulations, business needs and industry best practices. Periodic privacy and security-related assessments and compliance reviews include privacy impact assessments for newly developed or modified applications that may affect individual privacy interests. The Ethics and Compliance group ensures that SAS’ externally posted Privacy Statement accurately reflects its information collection and use practices. SAS’ Privacy Statement is global, covering SAS US and its foreign subsidiaries and other business units. Translated versions of the Privacy Statement with country-specific requirements are linked to the English version. SAS has obtained an employee data safe harbor to safeguard the movement of employee data into and out of its US headquarters. The company also adheres to applicable privacy and information security requirements for the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. SAS requires all its employees to complete training on privacy and information security. A monthly information security awareness newsletter, Security Sense, informs employees about information security and privacy issues. Supply Chain SAS’ supply chain includes both direct and indirect suppliers. Direct suppliers provide products or services used in creating the services SAS sells. This can include software, hardware, consultants or IT infrastructure. Indirect suppliers in areas such as food vendors, legal and accounting, or travel provide support for running the business. Supply Chain Management SAS builds long-term relationships with both direct and indirect suppliers. There are a wide range of best practices, tools and policies to ensure the supply chain remains strong and the company is identifying the best fit for all procurement needs. SAS uses mechanisms such as service level agreements, benchmarking and supplier relationship management to monitor and manage suppliers’ results. Suppliers are subject to advance and ongoing anti-corruption due diligence, which screens prospective suppliers and relevant or high-risk individuals within those organizations. The program consists of contractual requirements for anti-corruption and ethics rules compliance for all contractors and consultants. SAS also conducts in-person and online training, expense record and expenditure reviews, and audits, as well as global outreach through organizations like the UN Global Compact. The company also has an advance due diligence process for engaging with new suppliers and potential acquisition targets, and ongoing due diligence screening of suppliers. The process involves investigating the supplier’s background, qualifications, conflicts of interest, financial condition and history of regulatory violations. Supplier Diversity Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 5 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 As part of the Corporate Services Division, the manager of supplier diversity is responsible for SAS’ supplier diversity process, including: • Reviewing RFPs and contracts and responding to customers with diversity requirements. • Preparing and providing diversity spending reports to customers. • Providing information and access to SAS’ procurement opportunities by supporting and conducting various diversity activities and events (e.g., sponsorships, education and attendance). By developing and maintaining effective relationships with suppliers, the company aims to create value throughout the life of each contract based upon economy, quality, environmental preservation and social values. SAS is a member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and the Women's Business Center of North Carolina (WBC-NC). SAS is also represented on the boards of various minority supplier development councils and economic development initiatives. SAS uses competitive bidding to help ensure competition and fairness in the marketplace for suppliers. SAS also supports local business: 48 percent of SAS’ US spending in 2013 was with suppliers whose remit-to address is in North Carolina. SAS’ supplier diversity program has earned several accolades and service awards, including: Small Business Administration’s 2012 North Carolina Veterans Business Champion of the Year; Small Business Administration’s 2011 North Carolina Minority Small Business Champion of the Year for both North Carolina and SBA’s Southeast Region IV; Advocate of the Year by the Carolinas Minority Supplier Development Council; and Woman Business Advocate of the Year by the Women’s Business Center of North Carolina. Supplier Diversity Policy Statement SAS customers represent a wide range of industries, people and locations – and the company seeks this same level of diversity in its supplier community. Unlike a typical manufacturing environment, the creation of SAS products does not require purchasing materials or component parts, but rather relies on a highly skilled staff of technical professionals. SAS complies with the federal laws and regulations that prohibit discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability or veteran status. As a federal contractor, SAS complies with Executive Order 11246, as amended, and the implementing rules and regulations of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistant Act of 1974, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In the area of professional services offered to its customers, SAS provides small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and woman-owned small businesses the opportunity to participate in the subcontracts it awards to the maximum practicable extent, consistent with efficient performance of the contract. Regarding the procurement of goods and services to support corporate operations, SAS continually seeks ways to make business opportunities available to small businesses and businesses that are: • Minority-owned. • Woman-owned. • Disabled-owned. Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 6 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 • HUBZone-certified. • Veteran or service-disabled veteran-owned. Continuity of Business At SAS, continuity of business (COB) is paramount, addressing any threats or hazards that may affect our employees and customers and disrupt our business operations. COB planning incorporates corporate governance, information security and corporate social responsibility. Customers can trust us with the viability of their operations because of the company’s ability to provide vital customer-facing services and continue core operations. Even if SAS never experiences a business disruption, the organization continues to improve and standardize processes through planning and training on how to respond and recover from one. SAS’ global business continuity program goals are to: • Prepare employees to know what to do in a crisis. • Provide timely communications between local offices and SAS world headquarters. • Put plans in place to recover SAS’ most critical business operations that support our customers. This includes annual qualification of key partner and supplier dependencies to support strategies for continued operations. • Develop backup strategies, such as providing support to customers from another office until the affected office can resume normal operations. • Avoid and minimize business interruptions through greater awareness and risk management. SAS’ COB initiative extends to all SAS offices, involving response and recovery teams from Security, Facilities, IT and Communications. These business units work together proactively to develop resilience and mitigation strategies, and, in the event of a business disruption, coordinate to execute recovery plans. Through business continuity planning, SAS exercises operational controls to ensure our long-term viability and meet the expectations of our customers in an increasingly risk-conscious regulatory environment. More information on SAS’ COB program can be found in the Continuity of Business white paper (PDF). Environmental Program Stewardship for today, preservation for tomorrow SAS is committed to minimizing the environmental impacts of our business. This commitment is not just good will – it makes good business sense. Investments in environmentally responsible practices and technologies deliver returns for SAS in three significant ways: • Reducing costs through intelligently managed resource consumption. • Growing new markets through inventive, eco-friendly business practices. Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 7 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 • Responsibly meeting the expectations of customers, government and the public. We reduce the company’s environmental footprint with multiyear programs focused on energy conservation and solar projects, emission management, pollution mitigation, water conservation, waste reduction and recycling, procurement and green building. SAS uses its own software to collect, manage, calculate and report its global environmental footprint. ® View SAS Visual Analytics reports on SAS Environmental Program Top Six Achievements From 2013 1. Energy: Generated 3.6 million kWh of clean, renewably sourced power from rooftop and groundmounted solar energy systems; SAS now has eight solar photovoltaic and solar hot water systems globally. 2. Emissions: Limited greenhouse gas emissions increase to only 3 percent, despite 5 percent growth in data center operations and increasing office space by 4 percent. SAS improved its Carbon Disclosure Project score to 83 with a B performance rating, 6 percent better than 2012. 3. Waste management: Diverted 50 percent – almost 2,000 tons – of waste from landfills globally; diverted 88.2 percent of more than 500 tons of construction waste at world headquarters. 4. Water conservation: Increased use of reclaimed water by 221 percent ® 5. Green building: Achieved LEED certifications for buildings in Cary, NC, and a retrofit in São Paulo, Brazil, and LEED Gold certification for the construction of a new building in Sweden. 6. Employee commute: Encouraged employees to consider electric vehicles by installing six new charging stations and dedicating premium parking for electric vehicle plug-in stations globally. Through 2013, world headquarters employees accounted for approximately 5 percent of all registered plug-in vehicles in North Carolina. Environmental Governance The SAS Executive Sustainability Council, formed in 2008, reviews metrics of SAS’ sustainability performance and provides guidance on conducting global operations in a sustainable manner. This group includes senior-level executives, including co-founders and company owners Jim Goodnight, CEO, and John Sall, Executive Vice President. The Executive Sustainability Council – and the steering committee that reports to it – is chartered to act on an environmental policy statement and mandates. Implementing environmental strategies is largely the domain of the SAS Corporate Services Division Environmental Management Program. The program facilitates environmental efforts at company headquarters in the US, collects and reports key environmental indicators for global operations, and provides guidance and support to offices worldwide. Offices around the globe have personnel who manage site-specific environmental initiatives. Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 8 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 Members of the Environmental Management Program are part of the CSR Task Force that meets regularly to address environmental and social responsibility initiatives throughout SAS’ business operations. Environmental Policy SAS is an active and committed partner in communities where employees live, work and conduct business. SAS recognizes that environmental sustainability is a continuous effort that requires prudent use and preservation of natural resources. The company encourages business operations around the world to minimize environmental impacts by exceeding all environmental regulations. To accomplish this, all employees are asked to adhere to the company’s environmental mandates, integrate environmentally responsible practices, and seek innovative solutions to optimize operational efficiencies. Environmental Mandates The following corporate mandates provide guidance for adhering to policy and establishing priorities for environmental initiatives. • Corporate priority. Establish policies, programs and practices for conducting operations in an environmentally sound manner. • Integrated management. Integrate environmental policies, programs and practices into all functions, business units and global offices. • Continual improvement. Continue to raise the bar on performance, aligning with technological developments, scientific understanding and stakeholder expectations. • Employee education. Educate, train and motivate employees to conduct activities in an environmentally responsible manner. • Assessment. Conduct impact assessments before starting a new activity or project and before decommissioning a facility or leaving a site. • Products and services. Provide products or services that have no undue environmental impact throughout the product life cycle – from development to delivery, use and disposal. • Customer support. Advise and educate customers, distributors and the public in the safe and environmentally responsible use, transportation, storage and disposal of SAS products. • Facilities and operations. Develop, design and operate facilities and conduct activities with continual consideration for minimizing resource consumption, adverse environmental impact, and waste. • Research. Conduct or support research on the environmental impacts of SAS activities and how to minimize adverse impacts. • Contractors and suppliers. Promote these principles to SAS contractors and suppliers, encouraging and (where appropriate) requiring improvements. Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 9 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 Precautionary Approach SAS supports a precautionary approach to minimizing anthropogenic impacts from business operations. This aligns with SAS’ philosophy in five meaningful ways: 1. To ensure our business operations do not expose the public and environment to harm. 2. To comply with all environmental regulations. 3. To encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 4. To promote environmental awareness via increased transparency and access to meaningful data so analytics can be used to make intelligent and responsible decisions. 5. To show that environmental responsibility is not just good will; it makes good business sense. ISO Compliance The Environmental Management Program applies best practice ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) processes and structure to include: • Using SAS® software solutions and other tools to measure and improve environmental performance. • Ensuring environmental affairs are addressed by executive management. • Addressing immediate and long-term impacts of products, services and processes on the environment. • Providing global direction about addressing environmental concerns through the allocation of resources, assignment of responsibility, and ongoing evaluation of practices, procedures and processes. • Enabling continual improvement of environmental processes. Naturally, SAS uses its own technology to measure and analyze the performance of its sustainability initiatives. SAS software calculates the company’s global carbon footprint and the impacts of business processes and mitigation initiatives. SAS solutions support the application of global standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Global Reporting Initiative. Adherence to global standards provides for measurement and reporting in 57 countries in which SAS operates. Supply Chain The environmental impact of business activities extends beyond the SAS campus and workspaces to the entire supply chain, from suppliers to distribution channels to product use. The Environmental Management Program researches ways to incorporate corporate social responsibility into procurement and reduce the environmental impact of supply chain processes. To accomplish this, SAS: • Strongly encourages employees to give consideration and preference to suppliers with environmental practices and programs. • Promotes the adoption of environmental principles by contractors and suppliers, encouraging or requiring improvements. Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 10 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 • Completes the annual Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) supply chain questionnaire related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory and related climate change management. • Makes extensive use of green products, such as environmentally friendly cleaning supplies and lowemissions paints and products for campus buildings. The procurement teams routinely assist with finding the most efficient and earth-friendly options. • Maximizes investments by eliminating unnecessary purchases, extending the life of assets through repurposing, selling outdated equipment to employees, and donating materials to educational institutions. Only then are materials processed for responsible recycling. As a software company, SAS has limited risks and concerns in regard to raw materials, hazardous wastes and supplier practices. Because the primary input to SAS products is intellectual property, SAS does not currently collect data on GHG emissions and climate change strategy from suppliers. 2013 Supply Chain Achievements In 2013, SAS continued its ongoing research of options for incorporating corporate social responsibility elements into procurement processes and for reducing the environmental impact of supply chain processes. As in years past, SAS completed its annual CDP supply chain questionnaire related to greenhouse gas emissions inventory and related climate change management for 2012. SAS achieved a CDP disclosure score of 83 and a B performance rating, a 6 percent disclosure score improvement from 2011. The average score/rating of more than 2,400 supplier responses was 48/C. Energy & Emissions SAS’ Environmental Management Program assigns top priority to minimizing energy consumption and related emissions from our operations. The energy and emissions management program includes energy sourcing, conservation and generation, policy compliance, and employee education and engagement. SAS software improves processes for collecting, understanding and managing energy and emissions requirements for facilities worldwide, increasing the ability to report and proactively influence consumption trends. The program uses SAS to identify reduction strategies, develop and monitor performance indicators, understand relationships between measures, determine initiatives with the greatest effect, and communicate strategy, goals and objectives to facilitate execution. Key energy and emissions mitigation initiatives include calculating and reporting global carbon footprint, building and maintaining buildings to LEED guidelines, investing in renewable energy, pursuing leadingedge, energy-efficient technologies for operating buildings and data centers, and proactively maintaining facilities to the highest efficiency standards. • View SAS Visual Analytics reports on SAS Energy • View SAS Visual Analytics reports on SAS Emissions 2013 Data: In 2013, SAS improved environmental performance reporting by applying its own in-memory analytics to global data and delivering analysis and visualization-enabled dashboards to SAS mobile devices. Global energy use and related emissions remained relatively flat in 2013, with energy Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 11 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 consumption increasing by 0.3 percent and carbon emissions 3 percent, despite significant growth in operations. Contributors to energy and emission growth included: • Increased customer demand and a major expansion project contributed to a 4.6 percent energy increase for data center operations. • Global headcount increased by 5.3 percent and office space increased by 3.9 percent. • A slight increase in emissions is attributable to updated global warming potentials (GWP) from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The environmental footprint for physical growth was mitigated by ongoing investment in energy-efficient technologies, solar, retrocommissioning of primary office buildings, and adoption of LEED best practices. Gains in energy efficiencies for office buildings globally reduced energy consumption five percent in 2013 – despite increased space and headcount. Use of renewable energy remains a priority for SAS as an integral part of a strategy to reduce emissions. In 2013, SAS added a solar rooftop system on its LEED Gold certified building in Sweden, bringing the worldwide total to eight solar energy systems. Clean, renewable energy generation totaled more than 3.6 million kWh this past year. In addition to countless tours of the solar farm, campus and LEED-certified buildings, SAS fields numerous requests for sharing environmental data and best practices, and helping solar projects get started. In 2013, SAS hosted a STEM Career Day teacher conference and demonstrated how solar data could inspire student interest in renewable energy, statistics and data exploration. SAS continued support for electric vehicles by installing six new charging stations and dedicating premium parking for electric vehicle plug-in stations. Through 2013, employees at the world headquarters campus represent approximately 5 percent of registered plug-in electric vehicles in the state of North Carolina. Renewable Energy Since 2008, when SAS broke the solar energy 1-megawatt barrier for the southeastern US, the capacity of solar installations in North Carolina has grown to 557 MW, ranking third nationally in 2013. SAS proved solar was viable, and the community responded. At a combined 2.2 MW in capacity, SAS’ solar farms are located on 12 acres at world headquarters in Cary, NC. The photovoltaic (PV) solar arrays generate 3.6 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy each year, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 2,000 tons annually – the amount of emissions produced by consuming more than 367,000 gallons of gasoline. • Solar Farm I (December 2008): 1 MW in capacity, 5 acres, 5,040 panels; generates 1.7 million kWh of clean renewable energy each year. • Solar Farm II (July 2010): 1.2 MW in capacity, 7 acres, 5,236 panels; generates 1.9 million kWh of clean renewable energy each year. • Building C: 405 roof-mounted panels, 74 KW-capacity solar PV system; generates 100,000 kWh of electricity annually. Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 12 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 • Building R: 702 roof-mounted panels, 169 KW-capacity solar PV system; generates 200,000 kWh of electricity annually. • SAS Sweden: 80 roof-mounted panels, 20 KW-capacity solar PV system generates 25,000 kWh of electricity annually. • Building T: 24 roof-mounted 4-by-10-foot solar thermal panels provide hot water for on-site cafeteria. • Building G: 42 roof-mounted 4-by-10-foot solar thermal panels provide hot water for showers and laundry for the campus gymnasium. • Building C: Eight roof-mounted 5-by-6-foot evacuated-tube type solar thermal panels produce hot water for on-site cafeteria. The system works in concert with a building HVAC chilled water system and uses additional heat extracted from water-to-water heat pumps. Eco-Commuter Program SAS encourages employees to mitigate the environmental impacts of daily commutes by providing: • Preferred parking spaces for low-emission, fuel-efficient vehicles and carpools. • Subsidized employee vanpools. • Bike racks at all office buildings. • Electric vehicle charging stations with premium parking locations and free charging. Employees share the charging station infrastructure by following the SAS EVSE Use Policy and Guidelines. View SAS’ participation in the Department of Energy’s Workplace Charging Challenge Data Center Operations Energy for data center operations is the largest contributor to SAS’ environmental footprint. Over the past decade, the challenge of delivering timely information to support enterprise analytics has increased exponentially. Additional computing and storage solutions, combined with IT globalization, has increased demand for energy and data center space. To maintain the support expected by customers, SAS invested in high-efficiency technologies and design to construct a new, dedicated computing facility, emphasizing efficiency, flexibility and sustainability. Data center operations regularly achieve an average power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.35 or better. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power consumed, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power. Thus a PUE closer to 1.0 indicates greater efficiency. Landfill Diversion The SAS Waste Management Program at world headquarters measures and monitors the waste stream, with significant environmental benefits resulting from efforts at individual or local levels. For example: • SAS provides on-site recycling for aluminum, batteries, cardboard, electronics, magazines, glass, newspaper, pallets, paper, plastic bottles, printer cartridges, scrap metal and more. Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 13 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 • SAS strives for 100 percent e-waste recycling by repurposing equipment for internal use, recycling with responsible vendors, and donating to educational institutions. • Polystyrene-based disposables have been replaced with compostable options. • Cafeteria food waste is composted and used by SAS landscapers; waste vegetable oil is recycled and converted into biodiesel fuel. • Online resources reduce paper consumption globally. • SAS strongly encourages the use of biodegradable and recyclable materials. • Building construction projects regularly exceed 85 percent waste diversion from landfills. • Grassroots programs for employees reduce waste and encourage recycling efforts. • Since 2009, operational waste diverted from landfills has increased from 26 to 50 percent. 2013 Data: Globally, SAS disposed of 3,492 tons of operational waste in 2013 – paper, food, cardboard, composting, aluminum and plastic, and other nonconstruction waste material – 9.6 percent more than 2012. This increase is directly related to global growth. Highlights from 2013 include: • SAS diverted 50 percent of waste (nearly 2,000 tons) from landfills through recycling and waste management worldwide – a 13 percent increase across all operations. • Construction projects at world headquarters achieved an astounding 88.2 percent landfill diversion rate on more than 500 tons of waste. • SAS diverted 100 percent of e-waste from landfills by repurposing equipment for internal use, recycling and donating to educational institutions. • Since 2008, the employee electronics recycling program (US) has collected more than 60 tons of personal electronic hardware for recycling. In 2013, a record 14 tons of equipment was collected from environmentally responsible employees. • SAS improved environmental performance reporting by applying in-memory analytics to global data and delivering enhanced analysis and visualization-enabled dashboards to SAS mobile devices. • In 2013, SAS had no hazardous material, oil, fuel, waste or chemical spills, and no fines for noncompliance with environmental regulations. View SAS Visual Analytics reports on SAS landfill diversion program Hazardous Materials As a software company, SAS does not handle raw materials, conflict minerals, hazardous wastes or related supplies typical of traditional manufacturing. While risks are minimal, SAS places the utmost importance in abiding by industry best practices and governing regulations, including: • Compliance with all Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations for handling hazardous materials. Prism > GENERAL_CorporateSocialResponsibility_2015-­‐02-­‐09_CB Page 14 of 30 SAS Corporate Responsibility L ast S aved: 2 /9/15 • Plans for Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) that meet US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. Water Conservation SAS’ 900-acre headquarters in Cary, NC, and 13 owned sites globally use water for office and data center cooling, cafés, gymnasiums, landscaping and employee consumption. Water conservation is of paramount importance to SAS, with many facilities operating in communities where water shortfalls and water use restrictions are standard. At SAS headquarters, coupling water-saving technologies and practice with increased employee awareness has resulted in significant savings. For example: • Low-flow and electronically activated plumbing fixtures greatly reduce employee water consumption, saving 63 percent more compared to standard fixtures. • Rooftop rainwater collection systems capture water for use in bathrooms. • Cooling towers are replaced with high-efficiency models that use reclaimed water. • Wastewater options such as reclaimed and gray water lower potable water consumption. • Reducing and customizing irrigation schedules avoids over-watering plants. • Collecting rainwater in retention ponds and cisterns minimizes stormwater runoff and provides water for landscape irrigation. • Native and drought-resistant plants and warm-season grasses require less frequent irrigation. View SAS Visual Analytics reports on SAS water conservation 2013 Data: Globally in 2013, SAS’ water use increased by 5.1 percent, consistent with operational growth, and reflects efficiency gains over recent years. SAS’ expanding use of reclaimed and wastewater helps reduce the impact on local reservoirs and minimize the energy needed to treat water to potable quality. In 2013, extending a reclaimed water line to additional buildings increased reclaimed water usage 221 percent – from 8,135 to 26,113 cubic meters. SAS US operations used 140,519 cubic meters of municipal water, 26,113 cubic meters of reclaimed water, and 44,182 cubic meters of groundwater from 15 wells in 2013. SAS’ 13 other owned facilities worldwide used 83,006 cubic meters of municipal water. Global municipal increase is tied to expanded leased office space in China and India and growth in office space in Sweden, Netherlands and Belgium. SAS reduced the use of global surface water by using wastewater for irrigation. In 2013, SAS improved environmental performance reporting by applying in-memory analytics to global environmental data and delivering enhanced analysis and visualization-enabled dashboards to SAS mobile devices.

Around the world, SAS is committed to making a difference. To achieve this goal, SAS embraces Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) guidelines for new construction and remodeling and retrofitting existing buildings. SAS’ five LEED-certified buildings include Platinum-level certification for the Executive Briefing Center at world headquarters. Platinum is the highest level awarded by the US Green Building Council. SAS holds a Silver level national membership with the US Green Building Council. For offices located in countries that do not use LEED, SAS is incorporating country-specific best practices and pursuing equivalent certifications for new construction and maintenance. Examples of our commitment to green building practices include: • SAS US, Cary, NC, Headquarters: Building C – LEED Platinum Certified Office Building Building C includes the Executive Briefing Center, café and an office tower for employees. The Executive Briefing Center uses cutting-edge technologies to help customers learn about SAS software. Building C achieved LEED Platinum certification for water and energy conservation, the first for any building in Wake County and only the fifth in North Carolina at the time. The building consumes 40 percent less energy and 50 percent less water by integrating highly efficient technologies and sustainable features: • Photovoltaic panels generate 100,000 kWh annually to support lighting and building systems. • Solar thermal panels provide hot water for the café. • Thermal slab floor cooling uses water cooled in off-peak hours by building chillers to help maximize air conditioning efficiencies. • Radiant floor heating is used in the atrium for greater occupant comfort and minimizes heat loss through the roof. • Highly efficient HVAC systems integrate economizers, enthalpy wheels, variable speed drives, and various heat recovery systems to increase energy savings. • Regenerative drive elevators produce power for the building on descent. • T5 fluorescent and LED lighting fixtures – along with individual lighting controls, motion sensors and automatic timers – save energy. • A 1-acre sedum green roof minimizes stormwater runoff and insulation, significantly reducing the heat-island effect for this microclimate. • Low-flow and electronically activated plumbing fixtures greatly reduce employee water consumption, saving 63 percent more compared to standard fixtures. • A rainwater collection system with two 20,000-gallon cisterns captures water for use in bathrooms. • A 655,000-gallon retention pond collects stormwater runoff for landscape irrigation. • SAS US, Cary, NC, Headquarters: Building D – LEED Gold Certified Data Center The 38,660-square-foot facility includes two server farms, providing additional data handling for expanded SAS OnDemand offerings, hosted solutions and continued R&D growth. Environmental technology designed into the building, which earned LEED Gold certification by the USGBC, include a reclaimed water system and mechanical and electrical systems emphasizing efficiency of operation.

The facility features geothermal energy wells for efficient heating and cooling, rooftop solar photovoltaic panels, a sedumcovered green roof, and even on-site beehives, which provide natural honey for the cafeteria. • SAS Toronto, Canada: LEED Silver Certified Office Building SAS Toronto was the first LEED-certified new office building in Canada. With rainwater harvesting and energy conservation measures saving more than 6 million kWh of energy per year, the SAS building has served as an inspiration for many other new buildings in Toronto. 2013 Data: Green building highlights from 2013 include: • LEED certification for an existing office building at the world headquarters. • Advanced retrocommissioning for two buildings to ensure systems are operating as efficiently as designed. • LEED certification for an office renovation in São Paulo, Brazil. • LEED Gold certification for SAS Sweden’s new office building. Biodiversity SAS is careful to minimize impact on biodiversity and surrounding habitats as it grows and expands its operational footprint. SAS adheres to the US Green Building Council LEED guidelines for protecting natural environments and promoting biodiversity in areas where the company operates. Of approximately 900 acres at SAS headquarters, about 100 acres feature buildings, roads or other impervious surfaces. The remaining 800 acres are retained as old growth woodland, lakes and streams, farmland, natural areas and approximately 60 acres of maintained lawns, primarily for employee recreation and landscaping. The company applies LEED best practice guidelines for new and existing building projects, smart land use planning and campus landscaping, such as: • Preserving large areas of open space in construction projects to minimize disruption to local ecosystems. • Reducing the heat island effect by installing white reflective materials and planting sedum on rooftops. Sedum increases insulation, minimizes stormwater runoff and provides habitat for wildlife. • Collecting rainwater from rooftop systems, retention ponds and cisterns to minimize stormwater runoff and provide water for landscape irrigation. • Harvesting timber from construction sites so artisans can craft unique pieces of furniture and accent walls for buildings. • Restoring land disturbed by construction projects with native and adaptive drought-tolerant plants that help local ecosystems thrive and reduce dependence on water and chemicals. • Growing local produce for SAS cafeterias in the on-site culinary farm.
