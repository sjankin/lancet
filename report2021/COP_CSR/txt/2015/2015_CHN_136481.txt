China Unicom takes the lead to have a resale business model featuring centralized operation and unified services, which realizes one-point access, one-point service and one-point settlement for virtual operators and build up the institution to guarantee operation and service in an all-around manner. Regarding the unfamiliarity of virtual operators with telecom operation, China Unicom exerts its own influence and capability to help virtual operators solve actual difficulties. Other operators are coordinated to address the issue of resale interconnectivity and financial institutions like banks and large Internet websites are coordinated to solve the problems with identification of resale numbers. Virtual operators are offered some extended services like recharge cards and some help to deal with customer complaints. In 2014, we worked with 25 enterprises to grow the on-line users of resale business to 1.79 million, with the total revenue exceeding RMB 47 million, marking double 51 top within the industry in terms of resale user base and settlement revenue. The virtual operators and media all commended China Unicom for our cooperative attitude and advanced business model.

Strictly enforcing energy conservation and emission reduction measures in major energy consuming links China Unicom has accelerated energy conservation and emission reduction through the application of energy-saving technologies. It invested a total of 800 million yuan in the year in energy conservation and emission reduction projects, and promoted suitable and effective energy-saving technologies that generate quick effect in key areas including base stations and telecom machine rooms to increase the coverage of the energy-saving technologies and ensure energy conservation. By the end of 2014, the total energy consumption amount accumulated to 2.0625 million tons of standard coal, down by 1.06% year on year; the comprehensive energy consumption per TB of information flow accumulated to 15.89 kg of standard coal, down by 39.4% year on year; the comprehensive energy consumption per the comprehensive energy consumption per RMB 10,000 yuan of operating revenue accumulated to 0.0707 tons of standard coal, up by 3.36% year on year; the comprehensive energy consumption per RMB 10,000 yuan of added value accumulated to 0.1538 tons of standard coal, down by 17.13% year on year ◆ Promoting the wide application of energy-saving technologies In 2014, China Unicom focused on promoting energy-saving technologies including fresh air conditioner, heat pipe exchanger and heat reflective and thermal insulation coatings, and mainly promoted energy-saving air conditioner with dual cycle cooling system and airflow organization optimization in telecom machine rooms and IDC rooms. The company carried out centralized testing and purchasing of 11 energy saving products including intelligent fresh air conditioning, heat pipe exchanger, switching power supply module sleep, and heat reflective and thermal insulation coatings. The coverage rate of energy saving technologies in base stations reached 57%, and the figure for telecom machine rooms was 52%, with energy efficiency greatly enhanced. China Unicom Cloud Data Co., Ltd. promoted green and energy saving technologies, and adopted multiple energy conservation measures. The company built energy-efficient machine rooms that qualify for Level A according to the National Standards in Hohhot, Langfang, Gui’an, Wuxi, Deqing and Harbin. The PUE of these machine rooms is no more than 1.5. CO2 emission was cut by 94 tons a year by installing solar photovoltaic systems on the roof of each building. Amorphous alloy dry-type transformers were used to replace ordinary ones to reduce energy consumption. And amorphous alloy can be degenerated and then recycled with zero environmental pollution and low noise. The adaptive system was adopted for CRAC in machine rooms of IDC, EDC and cloud computing center to have brought down the energy consumption by over 10%. Energy-efficient self-control system was adopted for the concentrated refrigerating station to have brought down the energy consumption by over 20%. 52 Refrigerating Unit Low-voltage switch box To evaluate the effect of energy-saving ventilating and refrigerating technologies for base stations in different regions, China Information Technology Designing & Consulting Institute Co., Ltd. developed the “base station energy conservation Social Responsibility Practice evaluation system”. They use computers to model a certain energy-saving ventilating and refrigerating technology and apply different regions, environments and equipment configurations to analyze the corresponding amount of power saved. The results are then put to the evaluation system to evaluate whether the energy-saving technology is feasible and available under a certain circumstance. ◆ Reinforcing the management of energy-saving measures The Company has constantly reinforced the management of energy-saving measures. Taking the energy conservation and emission reduction plan as its mandatory guideline, and bringing energy consumption growth into control as its goal, the Company launched several campaigns including network streamlining and renovating, direct power supply to base stations and power tariff settlement for IDC machine rooms. It also improved its appraisal, reward and punishment mechanism for energy conservation and emission reduction, and stepped up the comparison of energy consumption indexes with the benchmarks to ensure efforts put into energy conservation and emission reduction generate actual effect. The Hohhot Branch of China Unicom strengthened management and control of energy consumption and energy expenses. It initiated benchmarking management of energy consumption of base stations, picking out 9 base stations as energy consumption benchmark and acquire basic data through power environment monitoring and manual meter reading. By doing so, the Branch discovered 25 base stations with abnormal energy consumption in 2014 and helped the sub-branch of Tuo County to reduce RMB 1.05 million yuan in power tariff. The Branch also replaced old lighting in the office building with 160 energy-efficient LED tubes, and upgraded the switches in 3 communication center buildings and 2 office buildings into sound-control ones. The Branch followed the principle of frugality in office supplies, and only change or buy new ones when necessary, so as to peel the consumption to the core. ◆ Carrying out energy conservation campaigns In 2014, the Company held Energy Conservation Week and sent short messages about energy conservation to advocate energy-saving and low-carbon life; organized energy-deficient experiencing activities to initiate low-carbon transportation; and spread energy-saving knowledge to raise the staff’s energy-saving awareness. The Company also organized an essay competition under the theme of energy conservation and emission reduction, as well as a suggestion-soliciting activity named “My Idea For Energy Conservation”. ◆ Paying attention to ecological environmental protection On December 26th, an activity themed “Communication Base Station Construction and Environmental Protection” sponsored by the Communication Administration Bureau of Guangxi Autonomous Region and organized by the Guangxi Branch of China Unicom was held in Nanning. During the activity, our colleague from the Guangxi Branch introduced equipment in the base station and relevant information, and showed user representatives around the iron tower base station. Through the specialized knowledge explained by the technical personnel and on-site radiation check in the base station, user representatives came to understand that the actual radiation of base stations is below the national standard level for electromagnetic radiation, thus their misgivings about the radiation hazards was dispelled. The activity was well received. 53 ◆ Pushing forward with the co-construction and sharing of communications infrastructure In 2014, the Company continued to push ahead the con-construction and sharing of communications infrastructure, with a total of 9,515 newly built iron towers in the year, among which 8,027 were co-constructed (including the 1254 towers that were build by China Unicom but reserved capacity for other operators), and that translates to a co-construction rate of 84.46%. A total project investment of RMB 3.226 billion yuan has been saved through co-construction and sharing in 2014.
