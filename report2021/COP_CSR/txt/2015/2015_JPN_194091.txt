As of June 30, 2015, CIM is in use at around 70 construction sites, including tunnels, bridges, and mega-solar power stations—the highest number of CIM applications in the domestic construction industry. By collating measurements and other construction information in a 3D model, CIM helps people to grasp the status of the construction work easily, and enables gains in quality and construction management efficiency. We are promoting new initiatives such as using state-of-the-art technology in a wide range of project phases from measurement through to maintenance management. These include unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), 3D laser scanners, and sensors. Using CIM in Rebuilding Disaster Area Sites Yamada Town in Iwate Prefecture was damaged by the tsunami that followed the Great East Japan Earthquake. Obayashi’s joint venture* is undertaking major land development work there, such as relocating houses to higher ground or elevating lowlying areas. We are using CIM in this project to provide a 3D visualization CIM model of the high-ground CIM in use at a public information of the process at each stage. relocation plan at Yamada Town meeting In the land development process, there are impacts on daily life for local residents, such as changes to roads. At public ­information meetings, we use a CIM model to help explain these processes. By providing a visual representation of the construction process and the completed result with the explanation, we have been able to give the public a much clearer image of the construction work than before. This has contributed greatly to increasing acceptance within the local community. * Members of the joint venture include Obayashi Corporation, TODA ­CORPORATION, TOBISHIMA CORPORATION, CTI Engineering Co., Ltd., and The construction process for land development shown with Fukken Gijyutsu Consultants Co., Ltd. a CIM model TOPICS JSCE Awards Fiscal 2013 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement (OCEA) Award Group I At the JSCE Awards*1 Fiscal 2013, Obayashi’s “Kawajiri Tunnel at Sagami Longitudinal Expressway Project—Rapid Construction of Road Tunnel Using Flat Sectional Shield Tunneling by Shallow, Ultra-Close Conjoint Construction” was selected for an award.

Promoting Obayashi Green Vision 2050 Related information In February 2011, Obayashi formulated “Obayashi Green Vision 2050,” a mediumto long-term vision for achieving a sustainable society by resolving global environmental issues through its business activities. To realize our vision for society in 2050, we implement an action plan to expand from our main construction business to other peripheral businesses as well. Obayashi’s Vision for Society in 2050 ■ A low-carbon society that stabilizes greenhouse gas density at a level that does not impact on climate change 2050 ■ A recycling-oriented society that minimizes further extraction of natural resources and creates superior recycling systems ■A  society that respects the natural world and conserves biodiversity to preserve the gifts of nature for the future Obayashi’s Vision for ■A  safe and secure society that integrates the elements of low-carbon, recycling, and respect for the natural world, Society predicated on safety ing cast 2030 Back Goals Present conditions Action plan We have set specific numerical targets for the urgent task of realizing a low-carbon society and continue our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.

We held numerous discussions with outside experts at our conference “Future Vision for the Environment.” As a result of these discussions, we will now work to realize our vision for society in 2050 from the following three perspectives. 1. 3 + 1 Society We have created our vision for society in 2050, adding “a safe and secure society” to the previous three aspects of “a low-carbon society,” “a recycling-oriented society,” and “a society that respects the natural world.” Based on this vision, we will work to realize a sustainable society. 2. Integrated approach To address environmental issues and social needs, we will combine the elements of the 3 + 1 Society approach to propose solutions, for example combining initiatives for a low-carbon society with initiatives for a safe and secure society. We will also take an integrated approach to considering business activities. 3. Promoting partnerships In our initiatives to realize our vision for society in 2050, we will look beyond the Obayashi Group and examine opportunities for collaboration with other companies, governments, and research facilities. 31 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2015 To Contents p3–10 p11–16 p17–24 p25–50 p51–58 p59–102 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR-Based Management Corporate Governance Corporate Data Specifically, we have formulated action plans in each of our three business areas, and we will promote initiatives using an integrated approach.

For example, we need to make our cities more compact and efficient, while taking steps to promote green infrastructure for creating natural environments and mitigating disasters. Obayashi’s Future Vision for the Environment (Obayashi Green Vision 2050) is a bold initiative that aims to integrate low-carbon, recycling, and respect for the natural world in society atop a foundation of safety and security from a corporate and social value creation (CSV) perspective. I have great expectations for the future development of this project for mainstreaming these initiatives within the construction industry. Kazuhiko Takeuchi, Director and Professor, Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science, University of Tokyo It is important for Obayashi to take initiatives throughout the value chain as a general contractor, and to leverage its strengths as a construction business to proactively introduce its urban development expertise at the urban concept stage. Participating in urban development from the upstream stage enables Obayashi to consider the elements and methods that will be required for final urban development efficiently, and to incorporate post-construction aspects such as management and maintenance from the initial stage. Ultimately, Obayashi needs to realize urban development that meets public demand, and the construction industry should advance its efforts to increase the value of cities through proposal, dissemination, commercialization, and maintenance. Miki Muraki, Professor, Graduate School of Engineering, Department of Urban Environment Systems, Chiba University I believe the central theme of the Future Vision for the Environment is “consider specific measures for achieving a sustainable society through urban development, and implement them through our business in collaboration with various stakeholders and partners.” This is a declaration of Obayashi’s endeavor to innovate its business model by surpassing conventional industry boundaries and focusing on social value. I hope that Obayashi will continue striving to realize its vision for society in 2050 by taking the lead in the creation of sustainable societies and urban development, and promoting innovation.

In addition to reducing and recycling construction waste through our net zero emission construction site initiative, we are also developing technologies for reducing resource use, such as reusing piles and underground frame work as well as extending the service life of infrastructure. Developing Technology to Extend the Service Life of Infrastructure We are working on development of technology to extend the service life of civil engineering structures such as dams, tunnels, and bridges. Examples include developing methods to remove sediment efficiently from dams where it has accumulated more quickly than estimated, and remote foundation survey robots that will alleviate the workload on employees in performing pre-inspections of infrastructure. Using these life-extending technologies can reduce the use of resources compared to a complete rebuild of civil engineering structures, helping to create a recycling-oriented society.

Sedimentation pond A demonstration test of using large-diameter (600 mm) sediment removal pipe to remove sediment that has accumulated at the bottom of a river Reuse of Existing Frames Growing demand is anticipated for rebuilding office towers constructed during Japan’s high economic growth period. Reusing the existing underground frames when rebuilding office buildings can alleviate environmental impact by reducing the volume of scrap and excavated earth involved in demolition, as well as curtailing building time and cost. It also reduces the impact on adjacent buildings around tightly spaced inner-city sites. We have established technologies for evaluating and ­controlling deterioration of existing concrete underground frames to promote their reuse. We applied these technologies in our plan for rebuilding the headquarters building of DIC Corporation, (design and construction by Obayashi; Chuo Ward, Tokyo). By reducing the amount of scrap from demolition, we achieved a 4,500 t reduction in CO2, and at the same time, the construction period was shortened by about one year compared to the option of demolishing the underground frame and rebuilding from scratch.

We consider ways to preserve nature at every stage, including planning, design, and construction. We are also working on regenerating ecosystems and ecosystem-friendly urban development. Use of Technologies that Reduce the Impact on Ecosystems Making reference to the local flora, we work to regenerate the original ecosystems for each area, planting shrubs and other foliage to encourage birds and insects. By creating rooftop gardens in consideration of the natural environment, we will provide a­ bundant green spaces that are friendly to people and the environment.

We took particular care to ensure that bottom-dwelling organisms that provide food for the birdlife were not affected by water pollution from construction activities. Specifically, we eliminated the need to stop the flow of the river, which can cause pollution, by adopting a hybrid pier construction method. In this method, caissons were built in factories on land beforehand to sidestep processes such as assembling steel frames or concrete molds in the river. Nikko River Lock Gate To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2015 36 Overview of Environmental Impact of Obayashi’s Business Activities CO2 Our main input of energy and resources is in construction projects. Since the bulk of our energy use is for motive power for ­construction machinery and vehicles, leading to CO2 emissions, it is important to reduce emission at construction sites. Of the CO2 emitted in connection with the construction business, a large proportion is from building operations and production of construction materials, which corresponds to Scope 3*1. Therefore, we offer proposals for energy-saving designs and renewals, while promoting the spread and development of Clean-Crete (p. 34) to reduce CO2 emissions from fresh concrete, which accounts for around 60% of our material production. Items related to our direct and indirect initiatives to reduce CO2 under Obayashi Green Vision 2050 are enclosed by the dotted lines ( ) in the chart below. Construction Waste Construction materials become buildings and structures, while scrap materials, packaging and the like are discharged as waste.

Consolidated net sales achieved a record high, mainly due to firm orders from both public and private sectors in the domestic construction market. On the earnings front, earnings increased significantly year on year due to an increase in gross profit on completed construction contracts following an increase in net sales in the construction business, as well as an increase in gross profit in the real estate business and other. Under Obayashi Group Medium-Term Business Plan ’12 ( the previous medium-term plan”), which ended in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we had planned to invest ¥135.0 billion over the three years of the plan in order to diversify our earnings base. However, due to proactive investments in property in the real estate development business, the final investment amount was ¥181.3 billion. We started the new Obayashi Group Medium-Term Business Plan 2015 (“the medium-term plan”) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016. Under this plan, we will further promote diversification of our earnings base, continuing this theme from the previous mediumterm plan. To this end, we plan to invest a total of ¥180.0 billion over the three years of the plan, focusing on the real estate development business, primarily on properties for lease; new businesses, where we are working on commercialization of the renewable energy business; and on research and development of construction technology. By continuing to invest for growth, we aim to establish an earnings structure that can flexibly adapt to changes in the business environment. We expect to make further progress on reducing the balance of interest-bearing debt, projecting a balance at the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 of around ¥390.0 billion. In addition to Increasing enterprise continuing to make investments for growth, we will also closely monitor and control the level of interest-bearing debt so as to value by balancing maintain and improve our financial soundness. In addition, we hold investment securities to maintain and investments for strengthen business relationships with our customers. We have a well-entrenched practice of periodically reviewing our shareholdgrowth and financial ings based on their background and transaction status. Over the past 10 years, we have sold around ¥100.0 billion worth of shares. soundness We intend to continue reviewing our shareholdings and taking steps to make more efficient use of our asset holdings by transferring money from investment securities into properties for lease and the renewable energy business. We are targeting ROE of 8% over the medium to long term by Shozo Harada increasing our gross profit margin. Representative Director With regard to shareholder returns, we are targeting a consoliExecutive Vice President dated dividend payout ratio of 20% to 30%, giving top priority to maintaining stable long-term dividend payouts. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we recorded consolidated operating income of ¥48.3 billion. Since we became able to expect stable operating income of around ¥45.0 billion, we increased our year-end dividend by ¥2 to ¥6 per share, for an annual dividend of ¥10 per share. We will continue to return profits to shareholders in line with our business performance, based on our existing dividend policy. We will continue promoting efficiency and transparency in our company activities, aiming to increase our corporate value sustainably. 61 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2015 To Contents p3–10 p11–16 p17–24 p25–50 p51–58 p59–102 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR-Based Management Corporate Governance Corporate Data Analysis of Business Performance, Financial Position and Cash Flows Overview of the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015 (3) Cash Flows During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, the Japanese econDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, net cash provided by omy continued to make a moderate recovery as corporate profits operating activities amounted to ¥74.6 billion (net cash provided showed an improvement, primarily due to the effect of the govby operating activities was ¥37.9 billion in the previous fiscal year). ernment’s economic policies.

Further details Financial Statements http://www.obayashi.co.jp/english/ir/financial_statements/ To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2015 68 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements OBAYASHI CORPORATION For the year ended March 31, 2015 1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the accounts maintained by OBAYASHI CORPORATION (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Companies”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial ­statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan. Certain amounts in the prior year’s financial statements were reclassified to conform to the changes made for the latest fiscal year. 2. U.S. Dollar Amounts The accounts of the consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen by rounding down to the nearest million. The U.S. dollar amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto were translated from the original Japanese yen into U.S. dollars on the basis of ¥120.17 to US$1, the rate of exchange prevailing at March 31, 2015, and were then rounded down to the nearest thousand. The approximate rate of exchange prevailing at May 31, 2015 was ¥123.73=U.S.$1. These U.S. dollar amounts are not intended to imply that the Japanese yen amounts have been or could be converted, realized or settled in U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (1) Scope of consolidation and application of the equity method The Company had 84 subsidiaries at March 31, 2015. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 included the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in all affiliates (28 companies for 2015) are accounted for by the equity method. (2) Business year for consolidated subsidiaries Certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (30 companies) and a domestic consolidated subsidiary (1 company) have a fiscal year that ends on December 31. Certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (5 companies) have a fiscal year that ends on February 28. The consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the financial statements as of the same date or provisional settlement based on the latest quarterly financial statements. Necessary adjustments for consolidation were made on significant transactions that took place during the period between the fiscal year-end of the subsidiaries and that of the Company. Consolidated subsidiaries other than those referred to above have the same business year as the Company, which ends on March 31. (3) Goodwill Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 5 years. However, goodwill that is not material is charged to income in the year of acquisition. Differences between the cost and underlying net equity of investments in affiliates accounted for by the equity method are charged or credited to income as they occur. (4) Foreign currency translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The balance sheet accounts of the foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding minority interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign ­currency translation adjustments and minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. 69 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2015 To Contents p3–10 p11–16 p17–24 p25–50 p51–58 p59–102 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR-Based Management Corporate Governance Corporate Data (5) Cash equivalents All highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are so near maturity that they represent only an insignificant risk of any change in value attributable to changes in interest rates, are considered cash equivalents. (6) Short-term investment securities and investment securities Securities are classified into two categories: held-to-maturity and other securities. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. (7) Inventories Real estate held for sale, costs on uncompleted construction contracts, costs on real estate business, inventories for PFI and other projects and costs on other business are all stated at cost determined by the specific identification method. Raw materials and supplies are stated at cost determined by the first-in first-out method. The net book value of inventories in the balance sheet is written down if the net realizable value declines. (8) Property, plant and equipment The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries mainly calculate depreciation by the declining-balance method, while straight-line method is applied to the buildings, excluding building fixtures, acquired on or after April 1, 1998. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries mainly apply the straight-line method. The useful lives and residual values of depreciable assets are estimated mainly in accordance with the Corporate Tax Law. (9) Intangible assets Intangible fixed assets are amortized by the straight-line method. Computer software for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years. (10) Leased assets Depreciation of leased assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased assets to the lessee is calculated by the straight-line method over the lease period with a residual value of zero. (11) Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on the historical experience with respect to write-offs for the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and based on an estimate of the amount for specific uncollectible accounts for the Companies. (12) Provision for warranties for completed construction The provision for warranties for completed construction is provided to cover expenses for defects claimed concerning completed work, based on the estimated amount of compensation to be paid in the future for the work completed during the fiscal year. (13) Provision for loss on construction contracts The provision for loss on construction contracts is provided at the estimated amount for the future losses on contract backlog at the balance sheet date which will probably be incurred and which can be reasonably estimated. (14) Provision for loss on real estate business and other The provision for loss on real estate business and other is provided for the estimated losses to be incurred in liquidating real estate and restructuring the real estate related business. (15) Provision for environmental measures The provision for environmental measures is provided based on an estimate of costs for disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) waste, which the Company and its domestic subsidiaries are obliged to dispose of by the Act on ­Special Measures Concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Waste. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2015 70 (16) Retirement benefits In calculating retirement benefits obligations, the benefit formula method is used to allocate expected retirement benefit payments in the period until the end of the current fiscal year. Actuarial differences are amortized commencing in the following year after the differences is recognized primarily by the straight-line method over periods (5 years to 10 years) which are shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees. Prior service cost (PSC) is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years which is shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees, while PSC of certain subsidiaries is expensed as incurred. (Additional Information) The Company adopted the defined contribution pension plan partially instead of the defined benefit pension plan on or after April 1, 2014. This transition is accounted for in accordance with the “Revision of Accounting Standard for Accrued Retirement Benefits (Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standards; Guidance No. 1)” and “gain on transition of retirement benefit plan” of ¥2,450 million (US$20,388 thousand) is posted for the year ending March 31, 2015. (17) Derivatives and hedge accounting (a) Method of hedge accounting Hedging instruments are valued at fair value and accounted for using the deferral method of accounting. The monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, for which foreign exchange forward contracts or currency options are used to hedge the foreign currency fluctuations, are translated at the contracted rate if the foreign exchange forward contracts or currency options qualify for hedge accounting. The interest rate swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria, are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is charged to income (short-cut method). (b) Hedging instruments and hedged items To hedge foreign exchange risks related to the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and projected future foreign currency transactions, foreign exchange forward contracts and non-deliverable ­foreign exchange forward contracts are employed as hedging instruments. To hedge the interest-rate risks and foreign exchange risks related to loans payable, interest rate swaps or interest rate/currency swaps are employed as hedging instruments. (c) Hedging policy The Companies utilize derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of hedging future risks of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates in accordance with internal rules. (d) Assessment of hedge effectiveness Hedge effectiveness is not assessed when substantial terms and conditions of the hedging instruments and the hedged transactions are the same. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under the shortcut method. (18) Recognizing revenues and costs of construction contracts Revenues and costs of construction contracts of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is calculated at the cost incurred as a percentage of the estimated total cost. The completed-contract method continues to be applied for contracts for which the percentage of completion cannot be reliably estimated. Revenues from construction contracts and the related costs of the overseas subsidiaries are mainly recorded on the percentage-of-completion method. (19) Revenues and expenses associated with finance lease transactions Sales and cost of sales are recognized upon receipt of lease payment. (20) Consumption taxes Consumption tax and local consumption tax are accounted for under the tax-exclusive method. 71 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2015 To Contents p3–10 p11–16 p17–24 p25–50 p51–58 p59–102 About Obayashi Corporation Management Policy Business Overview CSR-Based Management Corporate Governance Corporate Data (21) Income taxes The Companies apply deferred tax accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of income taxes by the asset/liability method. Under the asset/liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. (22) Consolidated taxation system The Companies adopted the consolidated taxation system. 4. Change in Accounting Policies The Company adopted Section 35 of “Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Statement No. 26 of May 17, 2012) and main clause of Section 67 of “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Guidance No. 25 of March 26, 2015) effective from April 1, 2014. As a result, the methods for calculating the retirement benefit obligation and service cost have been revised in the following respects: the method for attributing projected benefits to each period has been changed from the straight-line method to the benefit formula method, and the method for determining the discount rate has been changed to use a single weight-average discount rate reflecting the expected timing and amount of benefit payments. The cumulative effect of changing the method for calculating the retirement benefit obligation and service cost was recognized by adjusting retained earnings at April 1, 2014, in accordance with the transitional treatment provided in Paragraph 37 of Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits. As a result, the liability for retirement benefits increased by ¥7,128 million ($59,320 thousand) and retained earnings decreased by ¥4,134 million ($34,409 thousand) at April 1, 2014, and operating income, and income before income taxes and minority interests for the year ended March 31, 2015 increased by ¥1,191 million ($9,913 thousand), respectively. Accordingly, the liability for retirement benefits and retained earnings at March 31, 2015 were ¥51,231 million ($426,327 thousand) and ¥199,296 million ($1,658,454 thousand) respectively, after reflecting the effect of the accounting policy change above and the change for the year ended March 31, 2015 (the liability for retirement benefits decreased by ¥13,682 million ($113,862 thousand) and retained earnings increased by ¥24,765 million ($206,091 thousand)). The effect on net assets per share is listed in the relevant section. 5.

Financial Instruments (1) Overview (a) Policy for financial instruments The Companies raise funds by borrowing from banks and issuing commercial paper or corporate bonds. Also, the Companies restrict temporary excess fund management to highly secure assets, time deposits and other short-term investments. The Companies use derivatives in order to avoid the risks, fluctuations of particular assets and liabilities, and fluctuations of interest rates. The Companies do not use derivative transactions to gain short-term profits or for speculative purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments related risks and risk management “Notes receivable, accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other,” “Electronically recorded monetary claims” and “Accounts receivable-other,” which are operating receivables, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. In order to mitigate the risk when orders are received, the Companies conduct a strict screening and determine project plans so that potential risks are minimized. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2015 78 Short-term investment securities and investment securities mainly consist of stocks. While short-term investment securities and investment securities are exposed to market risk, the Companies monitor market prices of these securities. “Notes payable, accounts payable for construction contracts and other,” “Electronically recorded obligations” and “Deposits received,” which are operating liabilities, are due within one year. “Short-term loans payable,” “Long-term loans payable,” “Commercial paper” and “Bonds payable” are used for operations or capital investment. “Nonrecourse loans” are used for enterprise funds related to particular PFI projects and other. The floating rate loans are exposed to fluctuation in interest rates. In order to hedge against the interest rate risks and fix the payment of interest, the Companies utilize derivative transactions (interest rate swaps) for each contract of certain long-term loans payable. Regarding interest rate swaps, the Companies utilize the short-cut method if they meet the certain criteria under the short-cut method. In case of utilizing the short-cut method, the evaluation of hedge effective is omitted by the judgement of the short-cut method. The transactions of derivative financial instruments are carried out in accordance with the Companies’ internal rules, and the status of the transactions is reported regularly to the Board of Directors. The Companies trade derivative transactions with major financial institutions and therefore consider there is no credit risk underlying those transactions. While operating debt and borrowings are exposed to liquidity risk, the Companies manage the risk mainly by ­preparing quarterly and monthly cash management plans. (c) Supplementary explanation of fair values of financial instruments Notional amounts of derivative transactions, disclosed in “(2) Fair value of financial instruments,” do not indicate market risk in derivative transactions. (2) Fair value of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying values and fair values of financial instruments as of March 31, and any ­differences.

Note 1. Method to determine the fair values of financial instruments, and other information related to marketable securities and derivatives Assets Cash and deposits Since deposits are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Notes and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other and Electronically recorded monetary claims The carrying value of the items that will be retrieved within a year approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. The items that will be retrieved later than a year are determined based on the present value of carrying value, grouped by term of settlement, discounted at an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of those and credit risk. Short-term investment securities and investment securities The fair value of stocks is determined based on quoted market price and the fair value of debt securities is ­determined based on either quoted market price or prices provided by financial institutions making markets in these securities. Information on securities classified by holding purpose is disclosed in Note 12 “Securities.” Accounts receivable—other Since “Accounts receivable—other” is settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable for construction contracts and other, Electronically recorded obligations, Shortterm loans payable, Current portion of nonrecourse loans, Commercial papers, Current portion of bonds and Deposits received Since these accounts are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The ­carrying value is the same as fair value. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2015 80 Bonds payable The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of bond and current credit risk. Long-term loans payable and Nonrecourse loans For fixed rate loans, the fair value is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into. For floating rate loans, since the market interest rate is reflected in the interest rate set within a short period of time, the carrying value is the same as the fair value.

Segment Information (1) Segment information (a) Overview of reportable segments The reportable segments of the Companies are components for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resource ­allocation and to assess performance. The Building Construction, Civil Engineering and Real Estate Development divisions at the Company are responsible for strategic planning and business development of the building construction, civil engineering and real estate ­development businesses, respectively. Business operations of the building construction and civil engineering ­divisions are classified geographically with headquarters and each branch as separate operating units and evaluated individually. The Company’s subsidiaries are also evaluated on an individual basis. The building construction and civil engineering businesses are segmented based on domestic and overseas areas. The Companies therefore have five reportable segments: “domestic building construction,” “overseas building ­construction,” “domestic civil engineering,” “overseas civil engineering” and “real estate.” The overview of each reportable segment is as follows: Domestic building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses within Japan Overseas building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses outside Japan Domestic civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related businesses within Japan Overseas civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related businesses outside Japan Real estate: Purchase, sale and rent of real estate properties, development of land parcels and related businesses (b) Accounting treatment for net sales, income (loss) , assets, liabilities and others by each segment The accounting methods of the segment are substantially the same as those described in “3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Segment performance is evaluated based on operating income or loss.
