The report summarizes our sustainability performance for 2014 and serves as our Communication on Progress in implementing the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Despite our continued commitment to the safety of our workforce, I am saddened to report that in June we lost one of our colleagues, Kofi Amponsah. Mr. Amponsah, a pump attendant, drowned when attempting to relocate a pit pump at Bogoso. The incident was tragic and, I believe, avoidable. This report Sam Coetzer provides details of what we have done to improve safety practices at our President and CEO operations. This year’s report builds on our theme of ‘Partnerships for WHILE OUR CORE BUSINESS IS Development’. Our case studies demonstrate that as our THE PRODUCTION OF GOLD, partnerships mature and strengthen, so does our ability to deliver on our corporate responsibility objectives and build sustainable WE RECOGNIZE THE ROLE value for stakeholders. WE CAN PLAY IN BEING A While our core business is the production of gold, we recognize the CATALYST FOR SUSTAINABLE role we can play in being a catalyst for sustainable development in DEVELOPMENT IN the communities in which we operate. By collaborating with our THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH partners, our combined resources and capacity can bring real WE OPERATE change and benefit where it is most needed. Through partnership, we truly are more than the sum of our parts. The year 2014 was one of continued transformation for Golden Star, as we continue to deliver efficiency improvements, and our business evolves in the challenging financial environment. We have several exciting development projects in our pipeline, including the Wassa Underground project (combining the open pit and underground operations), and the Prestea Mine that will be developed in 2015. We look forward to working with our stakeholders to achieve continued success.

GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 5 OUR PEOPLE At Golden Star, we are proud of our employees and their efforts, as we work together to overcome the challenging economic environment in which we are currently operating. We recognize that skilled, engaged, and hard-working employees are fundamental to our business. PROMOTING THE STATUS OF WOMEN The Golden Star Ladies Clubs were formed in 2010 by a group of motivated women in our workforce. The clubs dedicate themselves to women’s advocacy and action in the workplace and in the broader community. Following their successful 2013 programme, the club intensified their efforts in 2014, with a major programme for International Women’s Day, International Pink Ribbon Day and the International Day of the Girl Child. Programmes included fundraising of GH¢ 13,000 for Breast Care International, awareness presentations, and a breast cancer screening clinic. Nearly 2,500 women were screened at 12 6 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 locations across our catchment areas with 81 women identified for follow-up assessment. The clubs raised a further GH¢ 20,000 to continue to assist breast care education and advocacy. The successes of the Ladies Clubs were made possible by the generous contributions of DHL Global Forwarding Ghana, Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), International SOS, Ghana Health Service, Golden Star, and others. In our region, where 26% of women have never attended school, and nationally less than 25% of rural girls go to secondary school (Ghana Statistical Service 2014), we support girl child education by: • Celebrating the International Day of the Girl Child and promoting education for young women • Providing educational scholarships to over 700 children from 2008 to 2013 • Providing bussing to school for some 300 children from our catchment areas • Providing educational subsidies to almost 3,000 dependents of our employees • The Golden Star Development Foundation, which has to date built six schools, school dormitories, school bus stops, and provides school supplies and teachers’ allowances COMMUNITY OUTREACH The Golden Star Ladies Clubs continued their community outreach with support from their ‘sisters’ at our head office in Toronto, Canada to assemble packages of learning materials, music, and sports/play equipment for donation to 186 children for end-of-year celebrations. The initiative is a small, yet important example of the ways in which our employees support and give back to the communities in which they live, and we operate. GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 7 HEALTH AND SAFETY We strive to create a culture of safety excellence at our operations. Our focus includes injury and accident prevention, safety and awareness training, and general health and well-being initiatives. In 2014, we continued to make great strides in improving health and safety outcomes, in conjunction with local and international health experts as well as our health services provider, International SOS. EBOLA PREPAREDNESS During 2014, several West African nations were affected by an outbreak of Ebola, a highly contagious and life-threatening virus. While there have been no documented cases of Ebola in Ghana, we undertook a wide scale programme of preparation and awareness in conjunction with our health services provider, International SOS. The measures include: • Avoidance – restricting our travel to affected countries, and avoiding unnecessary travel • Emergency preparedness – convening our Crisis Management Team, development of an Ebola Management Plan, and leadership in National/ District health management teams • Situation monitoring – use of international networks to track the outbreak • Education and sensitization – comprehensive awareness training for our workforce and community, using educations sessions, posters and pocket cards to raise awareness • Hygiene and sanitation – upgraded sanitation infrastructure • Medical/Clinical preparation – construction of two isolation centres, purchase of medical resources and training of medical staff • Site access control – preventing access to site by contractors and personnel known to have been in Ebola-affected areas, and temperature screening at site access points While the Ebola outbreak continues in West Africa, we remain on alert and will escalate our preparedness for any expansion of the outbreak. 8 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF DROWNING In 2014, the World Health Organization indicated that drowning was the third most common cause of unintentional injury-related death, and in the African region the drowning death rates are 10-13 times higher than in European countries. In 2014, we were saddened by the loss of our colleague Kofi Amponsah in a drowning-related incident. The following measures have been instituted or strengthened to reduce risk of future drownings: • Actions to relocate equipment away from water where possible • Continued provision of life vests for team members required to work near water • Upgraded pool rules, pool access restrictions, and supervision • Additional water rescue equipment and first aid signage • Installation of signage on first response and first aid • Provision of swim instruction training to interested employees GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 9 LOCAL CONTENT Golden Star seeks, wherever possible, to share the value derived from our operations with local communities, and to help ensure that the value is sustained over time. Key aspects of this approach are: LOCAL EMPLOYMENT • Advertising all employment opportunities locally • Sourcing unskilled labour solely from local communities • Programmes to enhance the ability of local community members to gain employment, such as the pilot Community Youth Apprenticeship Programme LOCAL PROCUREMENT PARTICIPATION • Agreements on local supply chain opportunities, such as select construction materials for resettlement projects • Programmes to develop local youth capacity to support development projects including masonry, carpentry, and building electrical skills • Capacity-building programmes to establish small and micro-sized enterprises to provide services and supplies, such as commercial cookery ventures • Capacity-building programmes to strengthen local procurement participation, including microfinance schemes and business development skills LIVELIHOODS DIVERSIFICATION AND ENHANCEMENT • Sustainable livelihoods programmes, in support of vibrant local communities beyond the life of our operations, including: o Golden Star Oil Palm Plantation (see page 11) o Golden Star Skills Training and Employability Programme (see page 18) o Community water supply businesses o Market, garden and fish farming ventures, including agricultural extension support o Support for cultural and traditional programmes, such as batik, tie-dying, and sandals o Non-traditional agricultural production, such as snail rearing, livestock (pigs and poultry), and mushroom growing 10 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOLDEN STAR OIL PALM PLANTATION The Golden Star Oil Palm Plantation was established for local communities in 2006 as a non-profit subsidiary of Golden Star. The programme, which is funded with $1 per ounce of gold produced, adopts the smallholder concept of sustainable agribusiness, which helps to balance community and company needs related to local economic development, community empowerment, and site rehabilitation and closure. In 2014, 25 new farmers were added to the programme, bringing the total number of farmers to 298. Year-over-year palm fruit production increased by 28.3% to 7,508 tonnes. As part of the 2014 National Farmers’ Day celebrations, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture awarded the Golden Star Farmers’ Association (Bogoso) the ‘Best Farm-based Organization’ award for the District. A participant farmer – Mr. Tuffour Quaicoe – was awarded the ‘Best Oil Palm Farmer’ in the District. GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 11 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT Golden Star recognizes the importance of our role as a catalyst for sustainable community development within our catchment communities. By combining our resources and influence with those of our partners, we strengthen and sustain value for stakeholders and our business. GOLDEN STAR DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION We established the Golden Star Development Foundation in 2006 and fund it with $1 for every ounce of gold produced plus 0.1% of pre-tax profit. Since its inception the fund has financed over $2.4 million in catchment community development projects. The Foundation funds a variety of community projects, including health, education, and community infrastructure initiatives that are selected by local Community Mine Consultative Committees. 12 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 HEALTH STEWARDSHIP AND PROMOTION Through our partnerships with the German development agency, Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), Project C.U.R.E., a US-based NGO, International SOS, and Ghana Health Services, we have delivered a range of health-focused projects to our catchment communities. • Health infrastructure – as part of our Health Stewardship partnership with GIZ, the Golden Star Development Foundation funded the construction of a mini-clinic at Brakwaline. The clinic was opened by Ms. Sherry Ayittey, the Minister for Health, with the Ghana Health Service accepting the clinic, that will service some 1,000 residents from Brakwaline, Sekunde, Bogyir-Ano, and Ebieni. • Medical equipment – since 2006 Golden Star has partnered with the Ghana Health Service and Project C.U.R.E. to bring much needed medical equipment to local facilities. Project C.U.R.E. staff complete needs assessments to ensure local needs are met. In 2014, 13 local health facilities benefited from equipment valued at almost half a million dollars. • Preventative health screening – in 2014 our partnership with GIZ supported preventative health screening for over 700 people, as well as breast cancer screening for almost 2,500 women. GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 13 ENVIRONMENT RECLAMATION AND CLOSURE In 2014 we commenced a process of external and independent review of our asset retirement obligations. The asset retirement obligation is an account of the work and resources required to bring an operation from its production phase to the completion of the closure phase. By completing an external review, we ensure that the assumptions we make about machinery costs, technology, and the areas of land requiring attention, are all fully assessed and deemed as appropriate by a qualified external party. As at the end of 2014, the review of the Bogoso obligations was completed, and the Wassa study was well advanced. ACHIEVING NEXT LAND USE In 2014 our Bogoso operations applied to our regulators to have 36 areas of reclaimed land, including backfilled pits and waste dumps, recognized as achieving its next land use. The land areas, which cover over about 100 hectares, are now fully functioning re-forested land, agricultural land and water resources. This means that these lands are no longer considered to be disturbed mining lands. On 21 January 2015 these lands were deemed as achieving final completion, a major milestone for Golden Star. 14 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 HUMAN RIGHTS SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, Golden Star supports the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, a set of human rights guidelines designed for the extractives sector. In 2014, security personnel at Bogoso and Wassa were provided training on the Voluntary Principles. The training culminated with a human rights “dos-and-don’ts” handbill. The handbill was initiated by Golden Star and was adopted by the Ghana Chamber of Mines, as well as other institutions. All security personnel working at our operations – including government military periodically detailed to the operations – are required to participate in inductions related to the Voluntary Principles. Personnel are required to sign a certificate confirming their participation in the programme. To date, over 740 personnel have participated in the programme. In 2015, the programme will be extended to security personnel operating at Golden Star Exploration sites. Additonally, our private security contracts and Memoranda of Understanding with public security require adherance to the voluntary principles. HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN ALL SECURITY PERSONNEL WORKING AT OUR As part of the ‘Respect, Protect, and Remedy’ framework of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, OPERATIONS ARE REQUIRED companies are required to conduct human rights due diligence to TO PARTICIPATE IN assess actual and potential human rights impacts, including INDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE those arising from business relationships. Consequently, in 2013, Golden Star initiated a due diligence process for its suppliers and VOLUNTARY PRINCIPLES service providers. In 2014, and in line with our 2013 United Nations Global Compact goals, we conducted our second review of human rights within our supply chain. Where human rights concerns were uncovered, dialogue was initiated with affected parties. The report was submitted to the Board Sustainability Committee. GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 15 ANTI-CORRUPTION Golden Star works against corruption in all its forms. We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and with the highest ethical standards. We work to integrate these values into our business operations and decision-making processes.

The main objectives are to avoid or minimize the adverse impacts of resettlement, and to restore or improve the livelihoods of displaced persons. In 2014, our resettlement activities focused on implementation monitoring for the Awunakrom and New Togbekrom resettlements as well as progressing the implementation of our other resettlement projects. Through our previous resettlements, we have recognized that for communities to obtain more of the value that a resettlement project brings, there is often the need for community members to acquire new skills to enable their participation in the various phases of project work. As part of the negotiated resettlement process, local content agreements may be established. Key features of the approach include traineeships to enable community youth to be employed directly in the project and associated construction, the opportunity for community women to provide catering services for construction workers, and providing opportunities for local companies to actively participate in procurements and services provision. To help support local businesses within our supply chain, Golden Star also provides entrepreneurship programmes with topics including customer relations, bookkeeping, and profit maximization. GOLDEN STAR SKILLS TRAINING AND EMPLOYABILITY PROGRAMME Since its inception in 2009, the Golden Star Skills Training and Employability Programme (GSSTEP) has been conducted on seven occasions for our catchment communities. The programme seeks to provide employable skills to youth, diversify and expand employment opportunities, and provide reliable alternatives to reduce reliance on unauthorized activities, such as galamsey. Since its inception, the programme has provided skills and training to 84 masonry, 102 commercial cookery, 54 carpentry, 43 mobile phone repairs, 38 building electrical, 57 beads and jewellery making, 29 hair dressing, 22 local fabric bags and sandal making, and 94 other trainees. At the Dumasi resettlement project, many of the trainees are now employed at the site, and many have reported that they have been offered employment with larger Ghanaian construction firms, but for now are choosing to stay and use their skills for the betterment of the community. 18 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 YEAR AT A GLANCE OUR PEOPLE METRIC 2013 2014 # of workforce 2,633 2,486 % of workforce from western region 58.6 60.5 Wages paid (US$M) 54 42 Expenditure on training (US$M) 0.78 0.33 # of employee education scheme participants 16 11 % of workforce that are women 6.7 7.3 HEALTH AND SAFETY METRIC 2013 2014 # of inspections (hazard and workplace) 457 576 LTIFR per million hours worked 0.38 0.15 Workforce malaria cases 982 682 ENVIRONMENT METRIC 2013 2014 ML of water abstracted 465,034 448,365 ML of water released 995,620 793,844 ML of water recycled 4,503,470 5,295,051 % of water samples to guidelines 98 98 Litres of waste oil recycled 313,721 430,182 Ha of land being rehabilitated 104 65 Total environmental expenditure (US$M) 4.4 4.6 MWH of electricity consumed 254,632 251,357 ML diesel consumption 38.8 28.7 % of blasts achieving over pressure limit 100 99 % of blasts in achieving vibration limit 96 99 COMMUNITY RELATIONS METRIC 2013 2014 # of consultations (formal and meetings) 467 460 # of community complaints 69 38 Development Foundation contributions (US$M) 0.33 0.27 Oil palm plantation contributions to date (US$M) 4.2 4.9 % local procurement of total procurement value 79 79 GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2014 19 NOTES DISCLAIMER The forward-looking statements made in this report are based on assumptions and judgments of management regarding future events and results.
