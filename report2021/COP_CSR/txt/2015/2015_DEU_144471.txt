Full support of the UN Global Compact Since 2005 E.ON has been committed to upholding the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact. With more than 12, 000 participants from over 145 countries, the Global Compact is the world’s largest sustainability initiative. Basis for company policies and standards As a signatory we affirm our commitment to respect human rights, uphold labor and environmental protection standards, and fight against corruption. Our own policies and standards – as well as our Sustainability Work Program, compliance systems, and prequalification criteria for new suppliers – are based on the ten principles. In addition, we participate in international Global Compact networks as well as in national networks in Germany, Sweden, and other countries. These networks promote collaboration across industries, enabling us to be even more effective in addressing challenges we have in common. Reporting on the principles of the Global Compact Participants in the Global Compact commit to issue an annual Communication on Progress (COP) disclosing their progress in implementing the ten principles. We issue our COP as part of this report. The table below specifies which sections of the report address the various principles.
