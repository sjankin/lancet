This should catalyze still more vigorous international movement of airline passengers and cargo. In addition, the Japanese government is implementing regional vitalization policies that could create more opportunities to export Japan’s traditional arts and crafts as well as agricultural and fishery produce. This could also add new vitality to Japan’s regional cities. As Japanese society continues to face concerns of the low birth rate and aging society, the domestic market for air travel is maturing. However, it is expected that regional vitalization will help to create demand for domestic air travel by overseas visitors for tourism purposes.

The maintenance divisions have adopted assertion as a keyword for building strong teams. To illustrate with an example, aircraft are made of tens of thousands of parts. One missing part, or a problem with a single part, can be enough to potentially compromise flight safety. Every member of every maintenance division strives to foster a culture in which everyone feels free to speak up and share anything they might notice, no matter how small, so that they can prevent maintenance issues from arising. The assertion cycle involves requesting the attention of others, speaking up and thanking others based on interpersonal and interorganizational awareness of issues. Going forward, we intend to further instill the assertion cycle in every worksite.

In 2013, the ANA Group opened the ANA Discovery Center for employees to review and consider the principles of Challenge and Endeavor in the group’s DNA.

To date, the ANA Group has produced many accomplishments through Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) initiatives such as promoting the employment of people with disabilities and women’s success in the workplace. However, as globalization advances rapidly, D&I are becoming increasingly crucial. With this declaration as a starting point, we will encourage all of our employees to understand the significance of and actively engage in D&I. In doing so, we seek to shape an ANA Group that is able to generate new value by respecting the diversity of organizations and groups and by harnessing the differences between individuals as a source of strength. ANA Group Diversity & Inclusion Declaration We will: Respect the diversity of employees based on the belief that D&I will serve as a new source of value creation (innovation).  Strive to create workplaces that maximize the strengths of individuals, where every individual is able to fully demonstrate his or her strengths.  Create an ANA Group that enjoys unwavering trust and generates constant innovation by enabling everyone to work energetically and positively. Promoting Women’s Success Moreover, the ANA-Women’s Innovative Network for Diversity (ANAthrough Positive Action* WINDS), a network of the ANA Group’s female managers, was set up to help transform the mindset of women across group companies The ANA Group considers itself a group that truly utilizes diversity and and departments. encourages frank discussion and mutual enhancement regardless of race, age, gender, assignment, role, values or any other differences, and one that aims for a corporate culture that will empower the entire group. The ANA Group has announced its support for the aim of the Positive Action Promotion created by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, as well as set its own numerical targets for promoting women’s success. * Positive Action refers to voluntary and proactive measures undertaken by companies to eliminate disparities that have effectively arisen between male and female workers due to entrenched notions regarding gender-based roles and related precedents. ANA Clinches 3rd Place Overall in the Nikkei Woman’s Ranking of the “Best 100 Companies for Women to Work for in Japan” At ANA, where female employees represent 55% of all employees, women already fulfill crucial roles and serve as a major competitive force that underpins quality in many worksites. However, as the airline industry experiences increasingly fierce competition, promoting women’s success will be vital to rising above the next stage of competition, which will require the group to harness diversity as a strength. Therefore, the ANA Group will continue to advance career development support and reform working methods as part of efforts to develop an environment and culture where it is easy for women to form the core of the organization. Initiative Example The ANA Group sees D&I and a sound work-life balance as sources of corporate competitiveness. Accordingly, we are advancing a variety of initiatives to achieve these priorities. The ANA Group is a founding member of the Ikuboss Alliance, a corporate network that aims to develop supervisors (“Ikubosses”) who are able to support the careers and personal lives of subordinates and staff with whom they work based on work-life balance considerations, while ensuring that their organizations produce the best possible results. At the same time, Ikubosses are able to enjoy both their own professional and private lives. The ANA Group participates in the “Father’s Day Off” project involving both companies and NPOs. Based on the theme of “first birthdays,” this project seeks to celebrate a child’s first birthday by having the father take that day off, as well as marks a heartfelt celebration of the parents’ first year as mother and father. 46 ANA HOLDINGS INC.

It is also vital for us to build human relationships as a foundation Mr. Shinobe I believe that we must now pay closer attention to for all that we do. Ultimately, this will help us to jettison the notion how we gauge individual talent. For example, the main thrust of that “there is only one correct answer.” We need to positively affirm personnel assignments should be to find a place for each employee our differences in thinking, personality, and ability, and ensure that to reach their full potential. We should not merely increase the every individual involved in the ANA Group can perform to their number of women in a workplace because we think it has too few fullest.

Annual Report 2015 85 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ANA HOLDINGS INC. and its consolidated subsidiaries 1. Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of ANA HOLDINGS INC. (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan. In preparing the accompanying financial statements, certain reclassifications have been made to the financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include information which is not required under accounting principles and practices generally accepted in Japan but is presented herein as additional information. 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (a) Principles of consolidation and accounting for investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its significant subsidiaries (64 subsidiaries for 2015 and 62 subsidiaries for 2014). All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in certain subsidiaries and significant affiliates (18 companies for 2015 and for 2014) are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. The difference between the cost and the underlying net equity in the net assets at dates of acquisition of consolidated subsidiaries and companies accounted for by the equity method of accounting is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 5 to 15 years. Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates which are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method (79 companies for 2015 and 81 companies for 2014) are stated at cost. The equity in undistributed earnings of these companies was not significant. Certain subsidiaries have fiscal years ending on December 31 and February 28, and necessary adjustments for significant transactions, if any, are made on consolidation. (b) Foreign currency translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except payables and receivables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts, and differences arising from the translation are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The balance sheet accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding minority interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect during the year. Differences arising from the translation are presented as translation adjustments and minority interests in the Consolidated Financial Statements. (c) Marketable securities and investment securities The accounting standard for financial instruments requires that securities be classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity or other securities. Under the standard, trading securities are carried at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. See Note 4. (d) Allowance for doubtful receivables Allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on past experience for normal receivables and on an estimate of the collectability of receivables from companies in financial difficulty. (e) Inventories Inventories include aircraft spare parts, supplies and stock in trade of consolidated subsidiaries. These are stated at cost principally based on the moving average method. Net book value of inventories in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is written down when its net realizable value declines. 86 ANA HOLDINGS INC. (f) Property and equipment and depreciation (excluding leased assets) Property and equipment excluding leased assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Ground property and equipment includes ¥51,813 million ($431,164 thousand) and ¥50,999 million of land at March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed based on estimated useful lives by the following methods: Aircraft.................................................... Straight-line method Buildings................................................. Straight-line method Other ground property and equipment.... Straight-line method The Company and certain subsidiaries employ principally the following useful lives, based upon the Company’s estimated durability: Aircraft.................................................... 9–20 years Buildings................................................. 3–50 years Major additions and improvements are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs, including minor renewals and improvements, are charged to income as incurred. The Company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The assets of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries are grouped by individual property in the case of rental real estate, assets expected to be sold and idle assets, and by management accounting categories in the case of business assets. An impairment loss is required to be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets significantly exceeds their recoverable amount. See Note 18. (g) Intangible assets and amortization (excluding leased assets) Intangible assets included in other assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method. Cost of software purchased for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method over five years, the estimated useful life of purchased software. (h) Stock issuance costs New stock issuance costs are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over a period of three years. (i) Bond issuance costs Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over the period of redemption of bonds. (j) Business commencement expenses Business commencement expenses are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over the period of five years. (k) Retirement benefits The retirement benefit plans of the Company and certain subsidiaries covers substantially all employees other than directors, officers and audit and supervisory board members. Under the terms of this plan, eligible employees are entitled, upon mandatory retirement or earlier voluntary severance, to lump-sum payments or annuity payments based on their compensation at the time of leaving and years of service with the Company and subsidiaries. The Company and certain significant domestic subsidiaries have trustee employee pension funds to provide coverage for part of the lump-sum benefits or annuity payments. The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries adopt defined contribution pension plans as well as defined benefit pension plans. For defined benefit pension plans, accrued retirement benefits for employees at the balance sheet date are provided mainly at an amount calculated based on the retirement benefit obligation and the fair market value of the pension plan assets as of the balance sheet date, as adjusted for unrecognized net retirement benefit obligation at transition, unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and unrecognized prior service cost. The retirement benefit obligation is attributed to each period by the benefit formula method over the estimated service years of eligible employees. The net retirement benefit obligation at transition is being amortized by the straight-line method. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized in the year following the year in which the gain or loss is recognized primarily by the straight-line method over periods which are shorter than the average remaining service years of employees. Prior service cost is amortized as incurred by the straight-line method over periods which are shorter than the average remaining service years of employees. See Note 7. Financial / Data Section Annual Report 2015 87 The assumptions used in accounting for the above plans as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows: 2015 2014 Discount rates 0.8%~1.6% 1.2%~2.0% Expected rates of return on plan assets 1.5%~3.8% 2.5%~5.5% ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD., which is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company in Japan, has transferred a part of its defined benefit pension plan (excluding the portion for current pensioners) to a defined contribution pension plan applying “Accounting for Transfer between Retirement Benefit Plans” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan; hereinafter, “ASBJ” Guidance No. 1 of January 31, 2002) and “Practical Solution on Accounting for Transfer between Retirement Benefit Plans” (ASBJ, PITF No. 2 of March 29, 2002, revision issued on February 7, 2007) and the retirement pension plan corresponding to the transferred portion to the defined contribution pension plan is terminated partially. As a result, ¥9,945 million ($82,757 thousand) is recorded as extraordinary income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. (l) Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements with respect to the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of the assets and liabilities, and were measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 9. (m) Leased assets and amortization Leased assets arising from transactions under finance lease contracts which do not transfer ownership to lessees are amortized to a residual value of zero by the straight-line method using the term of contract as the useful life. (n) Derivatives The Company and its subsidiaries use derivatives, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, commodity options and swaps, to limit their exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Company and its subsidiaries do not use derivatives for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains or losses charged or credited to operations, except for those which meet the criteria for deferral hedge accounting under which an unrealized gain or loss is deferred as an asset or a liability. Receivables and payables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts are translated at the corresponding foreign exchange contract rates. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses or income. (o) Appropriation of retained earnings Under the Corporation Law of Japan (the “Law”), the appropriation of unappropriated retained earnings of the Company with respect to a financial period is made by resolution of the Company’s shareholders at a general meeting to be held subsequent to the close of the financial period and the accounts for that period do not therefore reflect such appropriation. See Note 12. (p) Net income per share The computation of net income per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year. Net income per share assuming full dilution is not disclosed due to the nonexistence of dilutive shares. (q) Revenue recognition Passenger revenues, cargo and other operating revenues are recorded when services are rendered. (r) Cash equivalents For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are treated as cash equivalents. See Note 17. (s) Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2014 financial information in the accompanying financial statements to conform with the 2015 presentation. (t) Frequent flyer program The Company accrues a frequent flyer liability for the mileage credits that are earned and to be used based on assumptions including analyses of previous experience under the program, anticipated behavior of customers, expectations of future awards to be issued, and analysis of current accumulated mileage balances. 88 ANA HOLDINGS INC. (u) Trust Type Employee Stock Ownership Incentive Plan The Company introduced a “Trust Type Employee Stock Ownership Incentive Plan” (the “Plan”). The purposes of the Plan are to: increase incentives for the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to accumulate their own property as a part of the Company and its subsidiaries’ benefit plan and to endeavor to enhance the ANA Group’s corporate value, as well as to ensure stable provision of the Company’s shares to the Employee Stock Ownership Group (the “ESOP Group”). Under this plan, the “Employee Stock Ownership Trust” (the “ESOP Trust”), which was established for the purpose of transferring the Company’s shares to the ESOP Group, acquires the Company’s shares in advance in a quantity sufficient for the ESOP Group to obtain for the next four years, and subsequently sells those shares to the ESOP Group. Taking a conservative view and focusing on the economic substance, the accounting treatment for the acquisition and sale of the Company’s shares is based on the assumption that the Company and the ESOP Trust form substantially a single entity given that the Company guarantees the ESOP Trust’s liability. Therefore, the Company’s shares owned by the ESOP Trust as well as the assets and liabilities and income and expenses of the ESOP Trust are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Net Assets and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the Company. (v) Changes in accounting policies Application of Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits Effective from April 1, 2014, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries adopted Section 35 of “Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Statement No. 26 of May 17, 2012) and the main clause of Section 67 of “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits” (ASBJ Guidance No. 25 of March 26, 2015). As a result, the methods for calculating the retirement benefit obligation and service cost have been revised in the following respects: the method for attributing projected benefits to each period has been changed from the straight-line method to the benefit formula method, and the method for determining the discount rate has been changed to use a single weighted-average discount rate reflecting the expected timing and amount of benefit payments. The cumulative effect of changing the method for calculating the retirement benefit obligation and service cost was recognized by adjusting retained earnings at April 1, 2014, in accordance with the transitional treatment provided in Paragraph 37 of Accounting Standard for Retirement Benefits. As a result, net defined benefit liabilities decreased by ¥5,719 million ($47,590 thousand) and retained earnings increased by ¥3,715 million ($30,914 thousand). The effects of these changes on operating income, recurring profit, and income before income taxes and minority interests were immaterial in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Application of Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts The Company applies “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts” (Practical Issues Task Force (PITF) No. 30 of March 26, 2015) as of April 1, 2014. For accounting treatment of trust contracts concluded before April 1, 2014, the Company does not apply the revised Practical Solution but continues to apply the accounting treatment that was applied previously. Changes in basis of recording sales amounts ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. (hereinafter referred to as “ANA”) had recorded sales and cost of sales for jet fuel sales transactions involving airlines that have a strong business relationship with ANA on a gross basis. However, from April 1, 2014, ANA changed its recognition method to a net basis, offsetting the sales and cost of sales amounts. Due to the increasing significance of this sales transaction, ANA changed to a net method to better reflect its business performance. This change in accounting policy is applied retroactively, and the figures on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 are retroactively adjusted. As a result of this change, sales and cost of sales amounts decreased by ¥30,868 million ($256,869 thousand) each compared with the figures that would have been recognized prior to the retroactive adjustment. However, gross sales amount, operating income, recurring profit, Financial / Data Section and income before income taxes and minority interests were unaffected. Annual Report 2015 89 (w) Transactions of delivering the Company’s own stock to employees etc. through Trusts The Company has been conducting transactions that involve delivering its own stock to the ESOP Group through a trust for the welfare of its employees. The Company introduced the Plan on July 12, 2013 as an incentive for the Group employees to work in unison to overcome the current harsh business environment and achieve further growth, and as a measure to advance their welfare. The aim of the Plan is to promote employees’ asset building by encouraging their stock acquisition and holding through the expansion of the “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. Employee Stock Ownership Association,” “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Association” and “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS TRADING Co., Ltd. Employee Stock Ownership Association” (the “Stock Ownership Association”). The Plan is an incentive plan for all employees who participate in the Stock Ownership Association. Under the Plan, the “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Trust” (the “ANA Group ESOP Trust”), which was established to transfer the Company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association, acquires the Company’s shares all at once in advance to the extent that the Stock Ownership Association plans to acquire them over a certain period of time. If a gain on sale of shares is then accumulated within the ANA Group ESOP Trust through the sale of the Company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association by the termination of the trust, it is distributed to the Group employees who meet the beneficiary requirements (all individuals who have participated in the Stock Ownership Association during the trust period, including retirees) as residual assets. The Company guarantees the borrowings for the ANA Group ESOP Trust’s acquisition of the Company’s shares, and will repay any borrowings outstanding at the termination of the trust pursuant to the guarantee agreement. Although the Company applies “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts” (Practical Issues Task Force (PITF) No. 30 of March 26, 2015), such transactions have been accounted for by the method prior to the application. The book value of the trust is ¥3,346 million ($27,843 thousand) as of March 31, 2015 and ¥4,449 million as of March 31, 2014, and the Company’s own stock held by the trust is recorded as treasury shares in shareholders’ equity. The number of shares at the end of the current fiscal year is 15,859 thousand shares, the average number of shares during the current fiscal year is 17,914 thousand shares, the number of shares at the end of the previous fiscal year is 21,085 thousand shares, and the average number of shares during the previous fiscal year is 22,167 thousand shares. For the purpose of calculating per share information, the number of shares at the end of the periods and the average number of shares during the periods are included in the number of treasury shares that are deducted. Book values of borrowings by application of the gross method are ¥3,292 million ($27,394 thousand) as of March 31, 2015 and ¥4,638 million as of March 31, 2014. 3.

Annual Report 2015 95 8. Asset retirement obligations 1. Asset retirement obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (a) Overview of asset retirement obligations The Company and its subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts for the Head Office, sales branches, airport branches and some other offices. As the Company and its subsidiaries have restoration obligations for such properties at the end of each lease period, related legal obligations required by law and the contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as asset retirement obligations. (b) Calculation of asset retirement obligations The Company and its subsidiaries estimate the expected period of use as 1 to 30 years and calculate the amount of asset retirement obligations with a discount rate of 0% to 2.27%. The following table indicates the changes in asset retirement obligations for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014: U.S. dollars Yen (Millions) (Thousands) 2015 2014 2015 Balance at beginning of year ¥1,492 ¥1,500 $12,415 Liabilities incurred due to the acquisition of property and equipment — 88 — Accretion expense 25 327 208 Liabilities settled (721) (448) (5,999) Other 29 25 241 Balance at end of year ¥ 825 ¥1,492 $ 6,865 2. Asset retirement obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet The Company and its subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts for land and office at airport facilities including Tokyo International Airport, Narita International Airport, New Chitose Airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, Osaka International Airport, Kansai International Airport, Fukuoka Airport and Naha Airport. The Company and its subsidiaries have restoration obligations when they vacate and clear such facilities. However, as the roles of the above airports are especially important in public transportation, it is beyond the control of the Company alone to determine when to vacate and clear such facilities, and it is also impossible to make reasonable estimates as there are currently no relocation plans for the above properties. Therefore, the Company and its subsidiaries do not record asset retirement obligations for the related liabilities. 96 ANA HOLDINGS INC. 9. Income taxes The Company is subject to a number of taxes on income (corporation tax, inhabitants taxes and enterprise tax) which in aggregate resulted in normal statutory tax rates of 35.64% in 2015 and 38.01% in 2014. The Company is subject to the consolidated taxation system for consolidated taxation purposes, and has consolidated all qualified, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. The tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to a significant portion of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows: U.S. dollars Yen (Millions) (Thousands) 2015 2014 2015 Deferred tax assets: Net defined benefit liabilities ¥ 51,842 ¥ 64,163 $ 431,405 Loss on evaluation for hedging exchange 13,107 — 109,070 Unrealized gain on inventories and property and equipment 11,563 11,703 96,222 Accrued bonuses to employees 10,070 9,527 83,797 Tax loss carry-forward 7,539 8,883 62,736 Long-term unearned revenue 2,595 309 21,594 Valuation loss on investments in securities 1,900 2,108 15,810 Depreciation of property and equipment 1,874 1,722 15,594 Accrued enterprise tax and business office tax 1,704 1,359 14,179 Other 9,606 10,817 79,936 Total gross deferred tax assets 111,800 110,591 930,348 Less valuation allowance (12,221) (11,561) (101,697) Total net deferred tax assets 99,579 99,030 828,651 Deferred tax liabilities: Gain on evaluation for hedging exchange (15,794) (8,310) (131,430) Unrealized holding gain on securities (14,478) (5,594) (120,479) Special taxation measures law reserve (1,009) (1,764) (8,396) Other (3,026) (1,639) (25,180) Total gross deferred tax liabilities (34,307) (17,307) (285,487) Net deferred tax assets ¥ 65,272 ¥ 81,723 $ 543,163 “Long-term unearned revenue,” included in “Other” of deferred tax assets in the previous fiscal year, is reported separately in the current fiscal year due to an increase in materiality. To reflect this change in presentation the amount for the previous fiscal year was reclassified. As a result, ¥309 million in “Other” of deferred tax assets in the previous fiscal year is included in “Long-term unearned revenue.” A reconciliation of the difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows: 2015 2014 Statutory tax rate 35.64% 38.01% Reconciliation: Decrease in deferred tax assets due to tax rate change 7.11 4.06 Changes in valuation allowance 2.13 4.26 Entertainment expenses not qualifying for deduction 0.99 1.82 Adjustment for foreign income 0.60 — Financial / Data Section Exclusion of dividend income from gross revenue 0.44 0.14 Inhabitants tax per capita levy 0.24 0.46 Other 1.52 1.97 Effective income tax rate 48.67% 50.72% Annual Report 2015 97 “Exclusion of dividend income from gross revenue,” included in “Other” in the previous fiscal year, is reported separately in the current fiscal year due to an increase in materiality. To reflect this change in presentation, the percentage for the previous fiscal year was reclassified. As a result, 0.14% in “Other” in the previous fiscal year is included in “Exclusion of dividend income from gross revenue.” “Amortization of goodwill,” reported separately in the previous fiscal year, is included in “Other” in the current fiscal year due to a decrease in materiality. To reflect this change in presentation, the percentage for the previous fiscal year was reclassified. As a result, 2.91% in “Amortization of goodwill” in the previous fiscal year is included in “Other.” The “Act for Partial Amendment of the Income Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 9 of 2015) and the “Act for Partial Amendment of the Local Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 2 of 2015) were promulgated on March 31, 2015 and, as a result, the effective statutory tax rate used to measure the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities was changed from 35.64% to 33.10% and 32.34% for the temporary differences expected to be realized or settled in the year beginning April 1, 2015 and for the temporary differences expected to be realized or settled from April 1, 2016, respectively. The effect of the announced reduction of the effective statutory tax rate was to decrease deferred tax assets, after offsetting deferred tax liabilities, by ¥5,179 million ($43,097 thousand), and increase deferred income tax expense by ¥5,538 million ($46,084 thousand), unrealized holding gain on securities by ¥1,474 million ($12,265 thousand), deferred gain on hedging instruments by ¥224 million ($1,864 thousand), and remeasurements of defined benefit plans by ¥(1,339) million ($(11,142) thousand) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2015. 10.

In accordance with the Law, the Company provides a legal reserve which is included in retained earnings. The Law provides that an amount equal to at least 10% of the amounts to be disbursed as distributions of earnings be appropriated to the legal reserve until the total of the legal reserve and the additional paid-in capital account equals 25% of the common stock account. The Law provides that neither additional paid-in capital nor the legal reserve is available for the payment of dividends, but both may be used to reduce or eliminate a deficit by resolution of the shareholders or may be transferred to common stock by resolution of the Board of Directors. The Law also provides that, if the total amount of additional paid-in capital and the legal reserve exceeds 25% of the amount of common stock, the excess may be distributed to the shareholders either as a return of capital or as dividends subject to the approval of the shareholders. Under the Law, however, such distributions can be made at anytime by resolution of the shareholders or by the Board of Directors if certain conditions are met. 13. Commitments and contingent liabilities At March 31, 2015, commitments outstanding for the acquisition or construction of property and equipment amounted to ¥1,619,220 million ($13,474,411 thousand).

The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable as guarantor of loans, principally to affiliates, amounting to ¥688 million at March 31, 2014. 100 ANA HOLDINGS INC. 14. Financial instruments Overview (a) Policy for financial instruments The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “group”) limit their fund management to short-term time deposits and raise funds through borrowings from financial institutions including banks. The Company and its subsidiaries use derivatives for the purpose of reducing risk described below and do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments, related risk and risk management Trade receivables (accounts receivable) are exposed to credit risk in relation to customers. In accordance with the internal policies of the group for managing credit risk arising from receivables, the group monitors credit worthiness of their main customers periodically and monitors due dates and outstanding balances by individual customer, thereby making efforts to identify and mitigate risks of bad debts from customers who are having financial difficulties. Marketable securities and investments in securities are exposed to risk of market price fluctuations. Those securities are composed of mainly the shares of other companies with which the group has business relationships. The group periodically reviews the fair values of such financial instruments and the financial position of the issuers, thereby making efforts to identify and mitigate risks of impairment. Substantially all trade payables (accounts and notes payable) have payment due dates within one year. Borrowings are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments and certain long-term debt with variable interest rates is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. However, to reduce such risk for long-term debt-bearing interest at variable rates, the group utilizes interest rate swap transactions as a hedging instrument. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses or income. For derivatives, in order to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk arising from the receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, the group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts for specific receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, mainly for aircraft purchase commitments. In addition, to reduce the interest rate fluctuation risk associated with financial assets and liabilities, the group uses interest rate swap transactions for specific financial assets and liabilities. Furthermore, the group enters into commodity derivative transactions such as swaps and options to mitigate the fluctuation risk of commodity prices of fuel and stabilize operating profit. 1) Management of Credit Risks (risks such as breach of contract by customers) The group, with respect to trade receivables, exercises due date management and outstanding balance management in accordance with internal policies. The group makes best efforts to identify and mitigate risks of bad debts from major customers with financial difficulties by periodically monitoring their creditworthiness. As for derivatives, the group believes that the credit risks are extremely low, as it enters into derivative transactions only with reputable financial institutions with a sound credit profile. 2) Management of Market Risks (fluctuation risks such as exchange rate and interest rate) In order to reduce the foreign currency exchange risks, the group, in principle, utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts for receivables and payables in foreign currencies. In order to mitigate the interest rate fluctuation risks of the debts, the group utilizes interest rate swap transactions. As for marketable securities and investment securities, the group periodically reviews the fair values and the financial conditions of the issuers to identify and mitigate risks of impairment. There are internal policies for derivative transactions which set forth authorization levels and maximum upper limits on transaction volumes, and the group enters into the derivative transactions in accordance with such policies. Moreover, meetings are held principally on a monthly basis with attendance of board members responsible for derivatives to determine methods and ratios for offsetting risks as well as to report and confirm results of derivative transactions. 3) Management of Liquidity Risks Related to Financing (risks that the group cannot meet the due date of payables) Financial / Data Section The group manages the liquidity risks by setting a financial plan in order to procure and invest funds, which are necessary for the operation of the group for a certain period of time, in accordance with the business operating plan and the budget. (c) Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price available, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives in Note 15. Derivatives and hedging activities are not necessarily indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions. Annual Report 2015 101 Estimated fair value of financial instruments Carrying value of financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2015 and estimated fair value are shown in the following table. The following table does not include financial instruments for which it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value (Please refer to Note 2 below). Yen (Millions) As of March 31, 2015 Carrying value Estimated fair value Difference Assets: Cash on hand and in banks ¥ 43,901 ¥ 43,901 ¥ — Accounts receivable** 144,321 144,321 — Marketable securities and investments in securities** 365,928 379,131 13,203 Total assets ¥554,150 ¥567,353 ¥13,203 Liabilities: Trade notes and accounts payable** ¥182,198 ¥182,198 ¥ — Short-term bank loans 200 200 — Bonds and notes 140,000 143,287 3,287 Long-term loans 652,666 672,524 19,858 Total liabilities ¥975,064 ¥998,209 ¥23,145 Derivatives* ¥ 8,195 ¥ 8,195 ¥ — U.S. dollars (Thousands) As of March 31, 2015 Carrying value Estimated fair value Difference Assets: Cash on hand and in banks $ 365,324 $ 365,324 $ — Accounts receivable** 1,200,973 1,200,973 — Marketable securities and investments in securities** 3,045,086 3,154,955 109,869 Total assets $4,611,383 $4,721,253 $109,869 Liabilities: Trade notes and accounts payable** $1,516,168 $1,516,168 $ — Short-term bank loans 1,664 1,664 — Bonds and notes 1,165,016 1,192,369 27,352 Long-term loans 5,431,189 5,596,438 165,249 Total liabilities $8,114,038 $8,306,640 $192,602 Derivatives* $ 68,195 $ 68,195 $ — * The value of assets and liabilities arising from derivatives is shown at net value, and with the amount in parentheses representing net liability position. ** Accounts receivable, marketable securities and investments in securities, and trade notes and accounts payable in the above table are not reconciled to those accounts indicated in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and notes since certain reclassifications have been made to those accounts while the above table represents amounts that are directly compiled from the notes to consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan. Notes: 1. Methods to determine the estimated fair value of financial instruments and other matters related to securities and derivative transactions Assets 1) Cash on hand and in banks and 2) accounts receivable Since these items are settled in a short period of time, their carrying value approximates fair value. 3) Marketable securities and investments in securities The fair value of stocks is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of debt securities is based on either quoted market prices or prices provided by the financial institutions making markets in these securities. For information on securities classified by holding purpose, refer to Note 4. Marketable securities and investments in securities of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liabilities 1) Trade notes and accounts payable and 2) short-term bank loans Since these items are settled in a short period of time, their carrying value approximates fair value. 3) Bonds and notes The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is the present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of each bond and current credit risk. 4) Long-term loans The fair value of long-term loans is based on the present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by the interest rate to be applied if similar new borrowings were entered into. 102 ANA HOLDINGS INC. 2. Financial instruments for which it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value U.S. dollars As of March 31, 2015 Yen (Millions) (Thousands) Unlisted stocks ¥29,791 $247,907 Because no quoted market price is available and it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value, the above financial instruments are not included in the above table. 3.

Derivatives and hedging activities The group operates internationally and is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices of fuel. In order to manage these risks, the group and its subsidiaries utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions related to purchase commitments, principally of flight equipment, and foreign currency receivables and payables. Also, the group utilizes interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to its outstanding debt. In addition, the group also enters into a variety of swaps and options in its management of risk exposure related to the commodity prices of fuel. The group and its subsidiaries do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The group has developed internal hedging guidelines to control various aspects of derivative transactions, including authorization levels and transaction volumes. The group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with these internal guidelines. Derivative and hedging transactions initiated by respective operational departments have been examined by the accounting department and these transactions, including their measures and ratios, have been monitored by management generally on a monthly basis. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is examined at inception and, on an ongoing basis, periodically. The consolidated subsidiaries have adopted the same procedures for hedging activities as the group. The group is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but it is not expected that any counterparties will fail to meet their obligations, because most of the counterparties are internationally recognized financial institutions. Summarized below are the notional amounts and the estimated fair values of the derivative instruments outstanding at March 31, 2015 for which hedged accounting has been applied.
