In order to overcome such problems as vulnerability to external shocks including policy changes and huge variability in operating profits, KRC needs to increase management independence from the mid-to-long term perspective. Its creation of economic value will act as an important financial source to boost management independence. To this end, the corporation is continuously exploring new businesses and expanding its own projects such as overseas projects to become a global public corporation, fostering future-growth engines.
