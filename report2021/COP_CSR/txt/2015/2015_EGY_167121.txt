LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN It has been a challenging period for the Mansour Group over the past few years. The volatile and unstable climate in Egypt in the period following the 4 25th of January Revolution, 2011, and its follow up on 20th of June 2013 has tested the mettle not only of Egypt’s business community, but the very social fabric of the country as a whole. As Egypt has transitioned through this period to one of greater stability, optimism and national pride, so too has Mansour Group. We have reaffirmed its commitment to continued growth at all levels. If nothing else, the past few years have clearly demonstrated the critical relevance of sustainability. As a family-owned business, we continue to adhere to the social, ethical and moral standards instituted by our founder over 60 years ago. Our core values are based on integrity, efficiency, profitability, innovation, shared value, and last but definitely not least, employee development. For Mansour Group, a fundamental component of our sustainability is to focus on our greatest asset: our employees. Investing in our employees is not only about ensuring high performance, or training an efficient workforce. It flows from our sense of responsibility to our stakeholders, and every person working at Mansour Group is a vital and valued stakeholder. Employee development is one way of empowering our staff, providing them with essential business and social skills they can leverage on the career journeys they chose. Moreover, Mansour Group has instituted a number of mechanisms to ensure an ethical management process that respects staff at all levels. Following international best practices, standardized policies and procedures are in place to ensure fair compensation, equitable treatment, transparency, communication, recognition of achievement, and health and safety at all of our offices and facilities. Another cornerstone of our sustainability is the recognition that we are part of a wider community, one which believe we are obligated to support. Mansour Group is actively engaged in a variety of social investment initiatives, implemented through our own foundation, as well as by supporting other programs nationwide, through social investments, event sponsorships and social awareness campaigns. Poverty alleviation, education, healthcare, and capacity building are some of the sectors we target. In terms of environmental sustainability, we continue to advance in terms of efficient and ethical resource utilization, responsible waste management, and energy conservation. As Mansour Group continues to diversify, grow and expand to ever more challenging markets, locally, regionally, and internationally, our dedication to our core values ensures that we remain a visible example of the success of responsible business conduct. We at Mansour Group remain committed to the implementation of the 10 principles of the global conduct. 5 2. ABOUT AL MANSOUR HOLDING COMPANY FOR FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS The seeds of the Mansour Group were planted by Lotfy Mansour in the early 1950s, when he established the Mansour & Sons Cotton Trading Company. His entrepreneurial vision created a legacy that is carried on to this day by his sons. His eldest son, Ismail Mansour, succeeded in steering the family business to its current position as one of the leading companies in the region. Ismail is succeeded by his three brothers, who each have an influential role in managing the group and continuing its tradition of business innovation and diversification. Divisions of Mansour Group The Mansour Group’s continuing growth is a result of its ability to effectively identify new business opportunities, by exploring new areas of diversification, and forging successful joint ventures with global brands; something it has been doing successfully since the 1970s. Mansour Group is currently a key regional player in various industries including manufacturing, marketing and distribution. Employing over 40,000 people, Mansour Group currently achieves a turnover of over 4 billion USD. With a constant focus on geographic market diversification, Mansour Group has a presence in 120 countries, and operates ventures in 13 countries (Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Angola, and Russia) via our headquarters in Cairo, and main office in London. The bulk of activities, however, remain in Egypt. Mansour Group is comprised of six holding companies, each of which is responsible for a number of quasi-independent companies. These holding companies are: Mantrac Group; Manfoods; Al Mansour Automotive; Al Mansour Holding Company for Financial Investments (MHCFI); Man Capital LLP (the Mansour Family Global Investment Arm); and El Mansour and El Maghraby Investment and Development (MMID). Together, these companies cover the following diverse array of economic sectors: automotive; banking; real estate; consumer goods; education; IT and telecom; equipment and machinery; media and advertising; oil and gas; and transportation and logistics. Al Mansour Holding Company for Financial Investments (MHCFI) is the main focus of this report. 6 AL MANSOUR HOLDING COMPANY FOR FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS (MHCFI) Al Mansour Holding Company for Financial Investments (MHCFI) – one of Mansour Group’s six main holding companies comprises eight large, semiindependent companies. Many of these companies have been created to manufacture and distribute local and international brands in Egypt. Our Start Mansour Group (MG) initially created MHCFI in 1992 to manage a license agreement with Philip Morris International (PMI) to produce and distribute PMI’s brands in Egypt. The partnership with PMI ended in 2014 after 23 years of collaboration. MHCFI later partnered with Imperial Tobacco in 2014, producing brands including Davidoff, Gauloises and P&S. MHCFI was established as an autonomous company, semi-independent from Mansour Group. This allows MHCFI the freedom and authority to rapidly respond to new business opportunities, including establishing new companies, without having to refer back to the group. Nevertheless, despite its quasi-independent status, MHCFI is bound by Mansour Group’s corporate policies and strategies, and is committed to the fulfillment of the group’s strategic goals and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Diversification As mentioned above, MHCFI was initially created to manage the PMI account. Over time, MHCFI began to diversify, extending its activities to the food production sector with the purchase of the Seclam dairy products processing factory. This was followed by the establishment of the Hayat-Siwa bottling plant, producing pure drinking water. MHCFI entered the food retail business with the establishment of Metro Market for Trading and Distribution, successfully introducing the high-end supermarket chain Metro Market (MM) in the 1990s. Leveraging the overwhelming success and continued growth of the Metro supermarket chain, MHCFI opened the Kheir Zaman (KZ) supermarket chain, catering to the lower income consumer market. Together, the Metro chain (catering to the A consumer segment) and the Kheir Zaman chain (catering to B and C consumer segments) constitute the largest food retail chain in Egypt; covering 12 governorates and serving more than 115,000 customers daily. Mansour for Trading and Distribution Company (AMTDC) is the company behind Sunshine Tuna Fish and Shrimps, Mario Tuna, Labanita dairy products, Redbull Energy Drinks, L'Oréal cosmetics and Henkel and Hayat drinking water. 7 MHCFI COMPANIES AND BRANDS MHCFI is comprised of several companies that distribute an extensive range of consumer goods to over 150,000 outlets nationwide, making it by far the largest distribution group in Egypt. The figure below outlines the eight companies that now make up MHCFI and the brands that they manufacture and/or distribute: Al Mansour International Imperial Tobacco Group Distribution Co (AMIDC) Sunshine Tuna Henkel Red Bull Al Mansour for Trading & Distribution (AMTDC) ASMAK Bonjorno Givrex MHCFI Labanita Alexandria for Dairy Products and Foods – Seclam Yes Mansour Courier Service UPS Metro Market/ Mini Metro Metro Market for Trading & Distribution Kheir Zaman Hayat Company for Industrialization & Hayat Development Mansour Manufacturing Company – Free Zone Mansour Distribution Company – Free Zone The revenues of MHCFI’s companies exceeded 9.5 billion EGP in 2014, with 270 million EGP in profit. MHFCI employs over 8,700 people, which translates 8 to roughly 22% of Mansour Group’s total work force. It is currently one of Egypt’s largest private sector employers. The following figures are estimates of the numbers of traders and key clients served by MHCFI companies/activities: Company Number of Total AMTDC Clients/Company Indirect Direct Coverage Coverage HAYAT 4,000 80,000 SECLAM 13,000 REDBULL 10,600 FOOD 20,000 Frozen 5,000 Non-Food (Henkel & L’Oreal) 8,000 Company Number of Clients/Company Total AMIDC Direct Coverage Indirect Coverage MID 34,000 90,000 Company Number of Clients/Company Direct Coverage UPS 720 MHCFI ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE Cairo is home to the headquarters of all of the MHCFI companies except for Hayat and Seclam, which are located in Siwa and Alexandria, respectively. However, MHCFI conducts operations all across Egypt. MHCFI manages its operations on two different levels: some activities, such as legal affairs, corporate affairs, external relations, human resources, and security and administration are dealt with at the headquarters’ level; while other activities are dealt with at the company level. This allows for semiindependent organizational structures and flexible support functions that meet each company’s specific needs. The figure below provides MHCFI’s organizational structure. 9 3. SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES AND APPROACH Egypt has faced numerous social and economic challenges following the Egyptian revolution. MHCFI was among many businesses negatively affected by economic instability, yet has managed to continue growing as the economic situation has begun to stabilize. One of the most significant challenges MHCFI faced after the revolution was the overall lack of security, particularly an increase in robberies. While the risk of robbery dropped significantly in 2013 and 2014, MHCFI has faced new challenges, highlighted below. 10 MAIN CHALLENGES Over the past few years, lack of security has been an issue of concern nationwide. In 2013, MHCFI was still struggling with the repercussions of the low levels of security that resulted in losses on the company’s behalf. However, MHCFI managed to overcome security obstacles in 2014, reporting a significant decrease in the number of robberies occurring in connection to the business. New challenges have certainly emerged, which we are planning on facing this upcoming year. The Economic Challenge: As of 2015, Egypt continues to experience many economic challenges. One of the most persistent problems is the steady increase in inflation. This increase reflects directly on the purchasing power of the consumer, putting pressure on more affordable brands appropriate to decreased consumer purchasing power. Despite the problems posed by increasing inflation, Egypt still lacks effective policies to counter this threat. There is also the issue of lack of availability of USD in the formal currency markets. This creates a situation where businesses like ours that require USD to purchase imported goods are forced to deal with the informal or ‘black’ market. This affects profitability due to the added cost of buying dollars at higher rates than the officially quoted price. The Energy Challenge: Electricity blackouts and fuel shortages represent a challenge to every business. In MHCFI’s case, the problem of energy supply affects all the production and distribution phases of our industry. The increase in the cost of diesel and gasoline naturally affects both transportation and manufacturing costs. This in turn translates into increases to the price of products, which directly impact the consumer’s ability to purchase these products. Increases in the cost of water and electricity also affects our manufacturing process in terms of our capacity to produce while maintaining a profit margin. Switching Partnerships: On July 1st 2014, AMIDC ended a long-term partnership with Philip Morris International (PMI) and cemented a new partnership with Imperial Tobacco Group (ITG). The new partnership entails a market share in tobacco manufacturing amounting to 0.02% market share and an actual raise to 0.6% market share by end of 2014. This represents a challenge as the partnership with PMI entailed a share amounting to 24% of the tobacco market share. To fill in the revenue gap, MHCFI has been looking into adding new tobacco-related businesses and retaining the workforce. As a first step, we are looking at restructuring the tobacco business to ensure more effective business management. 11 MANAGEMENT APPROACH The volatile situation in Egypt over the past few years has finally subsided, and the country is now turning its attention towards stabilizing the national economy. One strategy being actively implemented by the current leaderships is to stress a more attractive and supportive investment climate. Accordingly, MHCFI is committed to supporting the growth of the national economy through new investments and expansion. We are hopeful that the election of a new parliament will provide clear public policies regarding the types of investment needed for the economy to stabilize. While the company is aware that we remain in a transitional period, where uncertainties are present, MHCFI is equipped with a team of experienced professionals implementing a business plan that is designed to help us adapt to the challenges that lie ahead. This includes the installation of a new risk assessment mechanism that will enable MHCFI to foresee upcoming risks and develop effective strategies to minimize them. Our main priority remains our focus on capitalizing on MHCFI’s manpower. This is reflected by a management approach that seeks to address employees’ individual wellbeing, seen as of equivalent importance to that of the company’s own. MHCFI is committed to maintaining a solution-oriented approach to our management strategies, focusing on sustainable management techniques designed to help protect our employees the main asset and stakeholders of MG. In terms of environmental sustainability, we are determined to look for solutions to the energy crisis Egypt is facing. This comes hand in hand with the development of our own energy conservation and management plan, and the adoption of new approaches to how energy is used in all our activities: in our offices, outlets, and production facilities. The following table summarizes our sustainability approach by performance area: Performance Approach Area 12 Economic We are currently focused on maximizing efficiency, reducing production costs, and securing affordable and sustainable energy resources. Sustainability Social We continue to support an array of civil society organizations and social enterprises across the country. The company’s foundation, the Mansour Sustainability Foundation for Development, has pioneered a locally-driven and bold approach to social investments as it focuses on key social needs including research and programmatic interventions in the areas of education, poverty alleviation, civic engagement, social entrepreneurship, among other areas, in neighboring communities and beyond. We plan on maintaining and expanding our social investment portfolio, in an effort to contribute to Egypt’s sustainable development. Human Capital Our employees are one of our primary stakeholders; we continue to invest in their growth and development; to further their growth and the growth of the company. We plan on focusing on achieving a more gender-balanced managerial team by investing in the leadership potential of female middle management. Human Rights We continue to be committed to a zero-tolerance policy for child labor and the adoption of a minimum wage policy. Environmental The program focus this year revolved around mitigating the environmental impact of our operations. The scaling of usage for biodegradable plastic Sustainability bags and energy reduction have been the center focus of this year's program. Product & Together with our employees, our clients are another key stakeholders. We continue to focus on client satisfaction and safety through stringent safety Client and quality management systems. We also maintain an open Responsibility communication system with our clients through multiple feedback mechanisms. 13 4. ABOUT THIS REPORT MHCFI is pleased to present our third sustainability report, covering activities over the period from 2013 to 2014. The purpose of this report is to keep both the public and our family shareholders engaged and informed about our achievements and development. We have managed to overcome hardships affecting our business over the past few years, and we plan on moving forward by being mindful of our stakeholders and business partners. This report presents these updates against the measures and indicators of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-G3.1), level B. We have compiled the report at hand with a dual purpose in mind: to update the public about our performance, and to use the assessments and conclusions of the report to improve our performance in the future. We committed ourselves to undertake this reporting exercise on a biennial basis back in 2010, and have succeeded in publishing three reports to date. In the current report, we have made every effort to improve our analyses and expand the scope of the information covered, and we hope to continue improving our disclosure level in the future. SCOPE AND DATA The scope of this report is limited to Al Mansour Holding Company for Financial Investments (MHCFI), including the aggregate activities of the eight companies comprising MHCFI. Accordingly, the analyses presented here focuses on the direct community and stakeholders of MHCFI. The report thus addresses neither the practices of the rest of Mansour Group to which MHCFI belongs nor the universes of MHCFI’s suppliers and outsourced operations, on which we have little influence at the moment. We hope to be able to extend our monitoring and disclosure capacity to parts of these universes by the next reporting cycle. In compiling the data and the calculations disclosed below, the report followed basic international measurement standards. The information that we provide here is extracted from our databases, bills, internal reports, and externally audited statements. Also, some of the information provided has been extracted through interviewing relevant personnel from MHCFI. This allows us to cover most of the information that reflects on MHCFI’s indicators, as per the requirements of GRI level B disclosure standards and the general GRI reporting tradition. In reporting on the joint performance of the eight companies comprising MHCFI, we relied mostly on our consolidated statements and reports. The compilation of these statements and reports progressed smoothly, as these companies share several central departments and are governed by a common top management (please see the governance section for more 14 information). In other words, MHCFI’s companies utilize the same top management reporting system. Despite the tremendous challenges MHCFI faced since the revolution, we are proud to say that we managed not only to maintain but also to expand our sustainability reporting efforts. Like most companies, however, we are able to report only partially on some of the GRI indicators. We have highlighted these indicators in a summary disclosure table at the end of this report, and we hope to be able to report on them more systematically by the next report, in 2016. Nevertheless, this is unlikely to pose problems for future performance comparisons for two main reasons. First, the report labels estimates as such and explains the basis upon which we arrived at them. Second, we have not undergone any major re-statements of information provided in earlier reports. The only significant change from previous reporting periods lies perhaps in the fact that we have upgraded our reporting initiative from level C to level B. Furthermore, although our sustainability case requires rather straightforward measurements, a number of environmental indicators require capacities we have not yet acquired. Nevertheless, in comparison to previous reports, environmental data has been expanded to some degree. This includes the steps taken to counter any negative effects of MHCFI operations on the environment. Information disclosed on employee movement inside the company has been greatly expanded, compared to previous reports. The hiring and resignation disclosure is more detailed, and includes more information. Likewise, information on employee training conducted in 2013/2014 is more detailed. MATERIALITY AND LEVEL REQUIREMENTS We designed this report to satisfy GRI level B disclosure requirements. The disclosure level requires a company to report on all GRI profile indicators in addition to reporting fully on a minimum of any 20 performance indicators. These performance indicators include at least one from each of: economic, environment, human rights, labor, society, and product responsibility indicators. In addressing these requirements, we undertook a materiality exercise, as per the GRI’s methodology. The nature of the sustainability challenges that we are currently facing and the volatile business environment that we are living in led us to believe that some performance areas are of paramount relevance to us, overshadowing other areas The GRI summary disclosure table summarizes the results of our materiality exercise at the end of this report. 15 OUR TEAM Our Sustainability Department compiled this report with the support of an external consulting firm. To develop this year’s report, we developed a number of reporting mechanisms to monitor some of the basic indicators on a regular basis. We hope that by doing so we will be able to institutionalize our sustainability monitoring and improvement efforts at a deeper level. Our Corporate Affairs Manager, Seif El Batanouni, is happy to provide any additional information and elaborations when needed. 16 5. OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE MG remains one of the biggest private investment groups in the region, generating revenue up to 4 billion USD annually. This leaves us in an excellent financial situation. As mentioned in previous sections, MHCFI is made up of eight different companies. Taken as a whole, the consolidated financial performance of the company has been excellent since its inception; a performance that the company has been able to maintain despite postrevolution instability. Our current consolidated operation proceeds with 5 billion EGP of current assets and 1.35 billion EGP of non-current (or long term) assets. These assets are balanced, in part by 1.98 billion EGP worth of equity. On the other hand, in 2014, our consolidated revenues reached 9.5 billion EGP, and our profit reached 270 million EGP. Equity The Balance Sheet provided below demonstrates the values of MHCFI’s various assets, liabilities, and equity types, broken down by our different business units (companies), as of December 31, 2014.

For MHFCI, this means better financial performance, resulting in greater profitability, vis-à-vis MHFCI’s performance during Egypt’s instability over the past couple of years. This report dedicates a detailed chapter (above), to the challenges that emerged in the post-revolution era, and how they affected MHCFI. For the purpose of this section, however, we would like to outline our main financial results and highlight the impact of the post-revolution climate on them. MHCFI assets are balanced in part by 1.98 billion EGP worth of equity. On the other hand, our consolidated revenues reached 9.5 billion EGP in 2014, and our profit reached 270 million EGP for the same year.

MHCFI’s revenues and profits for the year 2011 were 6,649.3 million EGP and 222.7 million EGP, respectively. Between the years of 2011 and 2012, our revenues increased by 1,409.2 million EGP, and our profits by 71.5 million EGP. Mansour International Distribution (MID) accounted for the bulk of our sales and profit. Other MHCFI companies experienced mixed performance. While some companies demonstrated a trend of high sales and profitability, other companies experienced a drop in sales, and by extension profitability. The table below illustrates our consolidated income statement for the year 2013, broken down by business unit.

We are more proud of these payments than any other payments we previously made. The Egyptian government is suffering from an immense deficit problem, and we are happy to have contributed to narrowing it down by such an amount. Value Added MHCFI analyzes the value-added components of its operations along two different dimensions. First, we divide our commodities into (1) merchandise and services that experience some manufacturing and/or services transformation, and (2) merchandise and services that add only retail value. We can then classify our Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) according to these two categories. The table below summarizes our COGS classification by business unit into value-added and retail-based for the year 2014. EGP (000,000) FY 2012 MID MMTD MTDC MCS HCID MET MDC Value added COGS 3,839.18 132.75 Retail based COGS 1,677.76 817.04 17.41 30.55 0.80 576.93 Total 3,839.18 1,677.76 949.79 17.41 30.55 0.80 576.93 The second value-added dimension that we also track is our ability to add value to our production capacity. We generally reduce this type to our capital investments in a given timeframe. The following tables compare our capital investments in the year 2014 with their equivalent in the year 2013.

GOVERNANCE AND APPROACH Mansour Group is a private family business; and its shares are not listed in the stock exchange. As such, it is not obligated to any minority shareholders. However, Mansour Group is engaged in a number of joint ventures, and therefore needs to address the interests of its partners. Although these ventures do not necessarily affect MHCFI, the Mansour Group implements a system of forming a Board of Directors to govern each of its different divisions, and the companies that comprise them in such a way that a given board always contains independent members. The philosophy adopted is that independent board members bring a wider perspective and varied viewpoints into the governance of the group as a whole, and this includes MHCFI. Moreover, Mansour Group has standardized one management approach across all of its companies. Thus, while the approach listed below governs Mansour Group as a whole, it governs MHCFI by extension. Mansour Group’s Board Members and Managers are listed below. COMPANY BOARD MEMBERS AND MANAGERS Metro Market for Trading and Distribution Name Position Atef Abo Shady Chairman and Managing Director Youssef Mansour Managing Director for Financial Affairs Yasseen Mansour Board Member Mostafa Abboud Board Member Mohamed El Amin Ismail Mansour Board Member Mahmoud Lotfy Ismail Mansour Board Member Mansour International Distribution Name Position Atef Abo Shady Chairman and Managing Director Youssef Mansour Managing Director for Financial Affairs Mohamed Mansour Board Member Mostafa Abboud Board Member Mohamed El Amin Ismail Mansour Board Member Mahmoud Lotfy Ismail Mansour Board Member Mansour Trading and Distribution Name Position Atef Abo Shady Chairman Youssef Mansour Managing Director of Financial Affairs Mohamed Mansour Board Member Yasseen Mansour Board Member Nabil Barghash Managing Director Mostafa Abboud Board Member 20 Mohamed El Amin Ismail Mansour Board Member Mahmoud Lotfy Ismail Mansour Board Member Mansour Dairy & Food Company Seclam Name Position Atef Abo Shady Chairman Youssef Mansour Managing Director of Financial Affairs Mohamed Mansour Board Member Yasseen Mansour Board Member Nabil Barghash Managing Director Mohamed El Amin Ismail Mansour Board Member Mahmoud Lotfy Ismail Mansour Board Member Hayat Name Position Atef Abo Shady Chairman Youssef Mansour Managing Director of Financial Affairs Mohamed Mansour Board Member Yasseen Mansour Board Member Nabil Barghash Managing Director Mostafa Abboud Board Member Mohamed El Amin Ismail Mansour Board Member Mahmoud Lotfy Ismail Mansour Board Member Mansour Electronics and Technologies Name Position Youssef Mansour Managing Director of Financial Affairs Nabil Barghash General Manager Mansour Courier Service Name Position Youssef Mansour General Manager of Financial Affairs Tony Costa General Manager Free Zone Name Position Youssef Mansour General Manager of Financial Affairs Ahmed Essam Tawfik General Manager 21 OUR MISSION AND VALUES MHCFI’s governance approach rests on seven main pillars: customer satisfaction; employee development; integrity; quality in achievement; profitability and efficiency; innovation and creativity; and mutual benefit. MHCFI strives to abide by these elements and uses them as benchmarks whenever it evaluates the performance of any of its divisions. Our Mission MHCFI is committed to the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of high quality branded consumer products that meet the needs of a wide variety of consumers and their lifestyles. We accomplish this by ensuring that our talented and effective teams base their decisions on sound information and execute using updated and effective processes. We will fairly reward our people for their achievements, and will continue to pursue an active role in advancing the welfare of our community. Our future is inspired by the legacy of our founder, his compassion for his employees, and his drive for excellence and achievement. Our Values Customer Satisfaction – Our first and foremost responsibility is to satisfy our customers. We will focus our efforts on offering them high quality brands and services, which give them good value for their money, and this will be the driving force influencing our decisions. Our People – As a company, we recognize that our people are the building blocks of our success. We will work to develop a highly skilled and motivated team through rigorous selection, continuous development, and by offering fair opportunity for advancement, improved quality of life, and the chance to seize opportunities leading to personal and organizational triumph. Integrity – We will maintain the highest standards of ethics and integrity in all our dealings. We will work hard to maintain honest and open relationships built on mutual trust. We will honor all commitments, internal and external whether verbal or written. Quality in Achievement – We will focus not only on achievement, but also on the process which leads to that achievement, with the highest possible standard of quality. Through continuous improvement and collective effort, we will become the first or second in every market in which we compete. Profitability & Efficiency – Our profitability will determine our ability to grow. In our efforts to excel we will optimize the use of our resources and keep waste to the minimum. 22 Innovation & Creativity – We encourage initiatives based on creativity, and the innovations that will make us better at what we do. We will be flexible in our approach to work, and will allow for the brilliant exceptions that flourish in an environment of calculated risk. Mutual Benefit – We will conduct business in a fashion that benefits our company, and all its stakeholders. Where collective business benefits exist, we will work to promote them in a way that ensures that the benefits are maintained for the long-term. ORGANIZATION OF MHCFI Each of MHCFI’s companies has its own Managing Director (MD), who is endowed with full authority to lead his/her company. The MD represents the Chairman of MG, Youssef Mansour, in the company s/he manages. MG sets annual targets for each MD, and the performance of each company is later evaluated against these targets at the end of the year. In running its companies, MHCFI also adopts a matrix structure organizing the management of the company along two levels. On the one hand, the holding company centralizes several support functions that all companies share, including Human Resources, Policy formulation and Control, Supply Chain Management, Audit, Administration, Security, and Legal and Corporate Affairs. On the other hand, each company has its own operational structure, and when needed, its own support functions. For example, the Security function is organized in Metro Market on the company level; the corporate security thus deals with the security affairs of the remaining companies. CONTROL The mission and values listed above govern the work of all companies in MHCFI. On top of that, the corporate system that we adopt (please see the previous section) is laid out in a way that supplies our companies with the independence that they need, while assuring a reasonable level of corporate control at the same time. In addition to these elements, MHCFI is also governed by many internal and external standards which safeguard our performance and help us operate in a corruption-free environment. These standards are deployed and assured by rigorous internal and external financial and performance auditing systems. MHCFI has, in fact, an independent corporate department dedicated to undertaking such audits. Many of our companies have certified parts of their management systems, according to their needs, which differ from one company to another. Seclam and Hayat for example, have been awarded the following certificates: 23  ISO 9001  22000  18001  14001  17025 MHCFI is currently studying the development of anti-corruption policies. Given that all of our activities are carried out in transparent environments that provide little space for corruption, we generally didn’t consider such policies urgent in the past. Since the revolution, however, combating corruption has become one of the main aspirations of Egyptian society, and MHCFI is planning to honor this national goal. ASSOCIATIONS AND LOBBIES Before the protests began in January 2011, Egyptian government bodies used to meet regularly with business associations and representatives to discuss ways for solving their regular problems. Back then, we used to suffer from the complications and bureaucracy of procedures for obtaining permits and licenses. This mechanism collapsed after the protests and currently there is another system in the making. We are hopeful that after the election of a new parliament, we will be able to regain our position as active members in the meetings between the private and the public sector. As of today, we stand as active members in several business associations, including the following: 1. Chamber of Food Industries 2. Egyptian Chamber of Commerce in Alexandria 3. German Arab Chamber of Commerce 4. American Chamber of Commerce 5. UN Global Compact EXTERNAL RELATIONS MHCFI constantly engages with most of its governmental stakeholders, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Supply, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Health, the Tax Authority, the Customs Authority, and the Consumer Protection Agency, through its Corporate Affairs department on fiscal and regulatory matters. This is done in order to ensure a long term level playing field when it comes to proper and ethical market competitiveness. MHCFI also engages with many of these authorities in order to find common initiatives that serve both the nation and our core businesses. 24 ANNOUNCING OUR PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND POLICIES Given that our companies are not listed in the stock market, publishing our financial statements is not required. Nevertheless, we are always happy to share them with any stakeholder interested in such access. We regularly update our policies and communicate any changes and updates to our employees. Changes and updates are initially announced to everyone involved using our internal communication system, which operates via email. New updates are also highlighted in our internal newsletters. Moreover, announcements are addressed and communicated directly to the different department managers who in turn communicate them to their staff. The latest versions of all our policies and procedures are available on a regularly updated electronic database that all staff members involved can easily access. GAP ANALYSIS AND COMMITMENT TABLE Mansour Group is continuously seeking to improve its management of economic, environmental, and social performance in accordance with international and regional standards. To this end, the company’s management has identified the relevant gaps, with target dates regarding when they will be addressed, in order to mitigate risks, seize opportunities, and ensure the company’s compliance to standards and principles. We have highlighted the main commitments we are promising our stakeholders below, as well as the status of their progress from achievement to a commitment to achieve by 2015. Commitment Target date Develop an Internal Training Program for Managers on 2014 – 2015 Sustainability Issues Develop a comprehensive Anti-Corruption Policy and outline 20142015 anti-corruption goals 2014 Create an Internal Sustainability Committee achieved Create an Internal Sustainability monitoring and reporting 2014 – system for all involved departments achieved 2014 Develop a comprehensive Stakeholder Engagement Plan achieved Developing a uniform Waste and Energy Monitoring System for: 1, 2, and 3 1Monitoring the amounts of waste by type, weight, and achieved; volume generated; 4 & 5 to be 2Monitoring direct and indirect energy consumption; achieved in 3Tracking how contractors handle collected waste; 2015. 4Tracking the impact of energy saving initiatives; and 25 5Monitoring the portion of materials that are recycled.

OUR PEOPLE At MHCFI, we believe in our employees and staff and regard them as the company’s most important asset. We are proud to have developed a robust mechanism over time for attracting the high caliber workforce that we need, and to have developed a system that safeguards their interests and builds their capacities. As a matter of principle, we seek to develop our people from their point of entry to Mansour Group, preparing them to eventually become a part of our senior management. We have therefore developed a high quality capacity building system that has proved effective over the years. Our recruitment system is based, firstly, on a pull system, whereby recruitment ensues whenever a need for a certain job emerges in our companies. Secondly, we adopted a salary scheme that pegs our pay according to the middle pay in the market, while honoring our minimum wage policy. Thirdly, we are committed to safeguarding the interests of our employees, and this is ensured through our specially designed Human Resources (HR) policies and formal contracts. Finally, we intensively train our employees and staff to build their careers with the aim of keeping them indefinitely, if possible, or to qualify them for excellent jobs in the market if keeping them proves impractical. We are also adamant on providing our workforce with fair, transparent, and periodic performance evaluations. Recruiting Our People Mansour Group advertises for vacancies through national and local media, and through appropriate communities. Relevant staff members, in cooperation with the HR department, then screen all job applications, and the respective jobs are awarded to those most qualified for the job. All our recruitment activities are governed by publicized policies and procedures. With respect to pay, we determine salaries according to market surveys of the fast-moving consumer goods sector (FMCGs), our main field, conducted by third parties and specialized firms. We generally target a salary scale in the middle of the market spectrum for the same position, as per these external studies. These salaries are then modified according to the level of experience of the candidate, and our minimum wage policy. Given that Egypt doesn’t apply a minimum wage law, MHCFI went on to adopt a minimum wage of 1,000 EGP, which is 400 EGP more than the minimum wage in the governmental sector. Benefits In addition to our competitive salaries, MHCFI provides its staff and employees with other benefits, always trying to exceed the minimum requirements set forth by Egyptian law. Egyptian laws regulate the minimum 27 medical insurance for workers as well as their pension schemes. MHCFI honors these laws and provides its staff with further benefits including:  Mansour Medical Care unit – An internal Health Insurance system for Mansour Employees;  Meals or allowance for meals for manufacturing workers;  Transportation allowance when travelling, and a company car, according to grade;  Company transportation for our factories;  Mobile phone allowance, according to grade; and  Special rewards for outstanding performance. Details on the number of employees, their salaries, and their benefits are broken down by each company and can be found in the following table: Salaries Number of Employees Total Company without Incentives Transport Persons Expenditure Name Incentives (EGP) Vehicles ation with (EGP) (EGP) Allowance Disabilities MID 53,964,196 8,986,508 62,950,704 30 129 3 MTD 42,142,707 7,747,335 49,890,043 173 2 2 Seclam 25,141,707 4,934,250 30,075,958 7 2 16 Seclam Sales 7,129,995 1,389,327 8,519,323 38 0 0 Hayat 6,980,947 803,874 7,784,821 1 1 0 MMC 1,454,121 145,289 1,599,410 5 0 0 MET 84,755 7,141 91,896 0 1 0 MDC 700,979 133,917 834,896 0 0 0 Metro Market 128,965,857 20,105,740 149,071,598 75 136 59 Total 269,889,116 44,292,651 314,181,768 330 271 81 In accordance with our policy, MHCFI provides all its employees with formal contracts. This provides our workers with a level of job security that many lack in Egypt, where working informally without a contract has been endemic in recent years. MHCFI also follows the relevant labor laws: providing its female staff with three months maternity leave; awarding all employees with a one-month notice period; and following the Egyptian law with respect to penalties. 28 EMPLOYMENT LEVEL AND TURNOVER MHCFI currently employs 8,723 employees, up from 8,400 employees mentioned in the last report, making a turnover of 500 employees during the last year. The Metro Market/Kheir Zaman Company operates a labor-intensive activity based on regular entry of transient labor. It therefore accounts for 61% of our employment, even though it accounts for only 13% of our profits. Most of the 500 that left the company were workers at our supermarket chains: Metro Market and Kheir Zaman. The turnover rate in the supermarket business is generally high in Egypt, as it is worldwide, as many treat these jobs as temporary or transitional until they locate a more stable or long term job. With the exception of our supermarket chains, we have otherwise been able to retain our employees.

Career planning and training sessions are conducted by the company on a daily basis. We are committed to developing our employees and building their capacity, not only assisting them to reach their full potential, but also equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to allow them to advance up the management ladder. We divide our training programs by type and by managerial level. During the year 2013 we conducted 1,439 training sessions in total. This number was increased to 2,022 training sessions in 2014, the details of which are as follows: 32 Manager Subordi Manag MidSubordin Type of Training Mid-Level Totals Totals s nate ers Level ate Technical Skills 24 32 45 101 12 77 47 136 Soft Skills 16 61 23 100 45 180 237 462 Business Needs 13 115 116 244 15 17 30 62 Certificates & 17 17 10 1 11 Diplomas MBA & Mini MBA 3 3 3 Overseas Training 1 English Courses & 4 5 17 26 6 50 36 92 Microsoft Skills Induction (Product 1 10 45 56 6 40 25 71 Knowledge) Total 2013 547 Total 2014 763 Training Details: Technical Skills: Innovative Positive Mindset Workshop -Business Writing Fundamentals of Project ManagementEvaluation & Selection of Suppliers Programming in Visual Basic 2010 Logistics Management & Strategy Advanced Management Skills Project Management Preparation Business Decision Simulation Certified in Production & Inventory Management CPIM Advanced Certified International Trainer Project Planning & Controlling Techniques Management of Project Resources Project Bids & Contracts Project Budgeting & Financial Control FESTO Apples & Oranges Supply Chain Certificate Introduction to Java Script Material Handling & Warehousing Advanced Logistics Management Performance Management Labor Law Negotiation Skills Problem Solving & Decision Making Media & Public Relations – Inventory Management – Procurement Management Techniques.

Employee training was designed to address the high turnover in this sector, and to show our employees that we care about their careers. All of our current store managers started out at entry level as store workers. Those that demonstrated high performance received training, gained experience, excelled and were eventually promoted to store managers. We don’t need to recruit new store managers from outside our operations; they are all internally promoted workers. To do so, not only do we need to train our workers, but we also need to provide them with objective KPIs and appraise their performance periodically and transparently. Our end of year appraisals inform our staff about their points of strength and weakness, and provide us with the main instruments by which we determine staff annual bonuses and promotions. SAFETY All our employees are trained in evacuation, and facing crisis situations; the majority of employees have been trained in firefighting as well. Our activities generally do not put our employees at risk. Nonetheless, we have identified 36 jobs that require high safety precautions. Workers in these positions 35 received special training and were all provided with safety wear like goggles, gloves, helmets and safety shoes. MHCFI currently monitors only medium and serious work injuries, of which we have had none during the past two years. We are currently investigating the expansion of a monitoring system to include mild injuries as well. GENDER While we do not have a a written anti-discrimination policy, salaries are decided based upon qualifications; this leaves no room for gender biases . Nevertheless, there is a significantly larger number of males than females across our companies, which is something we are looking to address in the future. The reason behind the predominance of males in MHCFI is not a result of discriminatory policies on the part of our company, but rather reflects a cultural value system that dictates that females are not suited to work in heavy industries. We are currently working towards enhancing the management gender ratio; achieving a more balanced gender balance at the blue-collar level on the other hand requires longer-term shifts in socio-cultural values. The below table shows gender distribution figures across a number of our companies: Mansour International Distribution Co.

OUR COMMUNITY Mansour Group is highly committed to responsible business practices. It undertakes many activities to promote the welfare and socio-economic development of Egyptian society, through a variety of mechanisms. One of these is the Mansour Foundation for Development (MFD), which is dedicated to the eradication of illiteracy, poverty, and disease, by effectively working with and contributing to the development of local communities. Our community-related work has undergone a process of evolution over the years. The following section briefly highlights some of the milestones with regards to our community development initiatives. HISTORICAL MILESTONES ON OUR COMMUNITY-RELATED WORK Mansour Foundation for Development is an independent legal entity that is fully funded by the Mansour family. It has a separate budget from the Mansour Group and does not accept any financial aid from national or international donors. MFD has a separate Board of Directors and is fully dedicated to philanthropic activities. MFD works to centralize the community development efforts of all Mansour Group in order to maximize their impact. MFD is an expression of the gratitude felt by Mansour Group towards the Egyptian people, and expects no returns in terms of tax deductions. MFD’s strategy of sustainable management is based on shared value creation, meaning that the corporate success of Mansour Group and the social welfare of Egypt are interdependent. As a means of sustaining our foundation, we invest in a healthy, educated workforce, as well as sustainable resources to guarantee effective governance of the organization. For society to thrive, profitable and competitive businesses must be developed and supported to create income, wealth, tax revenues and philanthropy. MFD is dedicated to philanthropy. As a grant-making and co-executing foundation, it undertakes many activities to promote the welfare and socioeconomic development of Egyptian society, deploying to this end a variety of methods to eradicate illiteracy, poverty, disease and shape the public awareness of active citizens. MFD’s team identifies concrete goals and objectives, prioritizes issues to be addressed, and develops defined budgets for program implementation. Our strategic high priority areas in the field of human development are listed below: 1. Education 2. Health 3. Capacity Building 4. Academic Research 5. Arts & Culture 38 6. Human Relief 7. Social Entrepreneurship We have also identified four priority segments that we want to focus on, which are as follows: 1. Youth, 2. Women 3. Children 4. Inhabitants of remote areas Our Objectives are:  Leverage academic research in social entrepreneurship & youth engagement  Preserve & revive the Egyptian Identity  Bring creativity & innovation to big society by supporting youth entrepreneurship from core to shell  Upgrade public educational facilities and buildings  Support poor and/or disabled students  Provide educational scholarships in Egypt and abroad  Prevent girls from dropping out of school  Combat illiteracy  Develop health facilities that cater to underprivileged people  Support health activities in deprived hospitals  Provide medical treatment for people with disabilities  Provide technical support for NGOs’ staff  Provide educational, technical, and economic support to marginalized sectors  Support people with special needs in the field of sports. Our approach is simply integration and inclusion. Our pillars are passion, purpose, and people. We cannot fulfill our goals without adopting standard policies and procedures that ensure the delivery of utmost quality and trustworthiness throughout the lifecycle of our projects and activities. MFD’s approach is based on developing the human element in society, and is therefore based on community-driven projects. MFD seeks not only to apply Mansour Group’s business management model in its community development activities but also to transfer it to our recipients. 2013-2014 Portfolio of programs Corporate Volunteerism: At MFD, we engage community members in volunteerism as one of the most important cornerstones of promoting corporate citizenship. Employee volunteers are perhaps the greatest asset companies can leverage when seeking to affect surrounding communities. Corporate volunteerism provides 39 great benefits to a community while generating business value in the form of increasing employee engagement and expanding the opportunities for teambuilding. Civic Education: In its broadest definition, “civic education” means all the processes that affect people's beliefs, commitments, capabilities, and actions as members or prospective members of any given community. For civic education to achieve its utmost potential, its institutions present in the community need to act and behave in a certain manner that can later be transmitted to the members of the community overtime. Civic Education is certainly not limited to schooling and the education of children and youth. Families, governments, religious institutes, and mass media are just some of the institutions involved in the process of civic education, which we at MFD, understand as a lifelong process. As advocates and activists in the field of civic education, MFD has implemented the following: 1. Civic Manners Film Making Workshop 2. Children Values Workshop 3. Ways Forum for Youth Engagement in Development 4. Civic Education Egypt Conference 5. Development Road Show 6. Development Book Fair Social Entrepreneurship: Investment in social entrepreneurship is vital because it harnesses creativity and devises innovative solutions to deep rooted social problems. It represents a pool of future leaders who have ambitious dreams of change yet manage to stay rooted and solution-oriented. Their commitment to positively impacting society is central to the mission of the business and this is why we support social entrepreneurship from core to shell through: 1. Regional Study on Corporate Sustainability and Social Entrepreneurship 2. Entrepreneurs’ Stanford Scholarship Culture & Arts: The sign of a healthy community is its simultaneous ability to preserve and invent its culture — that is, to conserve its history and heritage and here is our contribution in this regard: 1. DCAF 2. ElFan Midan 3. Qabila Documentary Film Festival 40 4. Wanas Folklore Festival Health: MFD has systematic activities to prevent and cure health problems, and to promote positive health in Egyptians through the following: 1. Hepatitis A vaccination School Campaign 2. Annual Cure Support Program Capacity Building: Our aim is to create an enabling environment for appropriate NGOs via institutional development, human resources development and strengthening of managerial systems to maximize the capacity of NGOs to overcome the challenges of community development. MFD currently provides assistance to the following NGOs: 1. Dar Awladi Orphanage 2. Elgabal Elasfar (Yellow Mountain) Local Community Development Association 3. Elsaktiya Local Community Development Association, Upper Egypt 4. Bedaya (Start) Charitable Association, Elfayoum Governorate 5. Women’s Association for Better Health, Sohag governorate Advocacy, Awareness & Networking: One of MFD’s aims is to influence decisions within institutions relevant to development and social systems.

OTHER PROJECTS In addition to MFD’s considerable community development efforts, Mansour Holding also has separate projects aimed at contributing to Egyptian society. Furthermore, a number of projects were implemented through collaboration between Mansour Holding’s Corporate Affairs department and the MFD. For example, 35 trash bins were installed in Wadi Degla protectorate in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, and a clean–up campaign was implemented in the area. Additionally, since 2011, the Corporate Affairs department has been organizing bi-annual blood donation campaigns for company employees. Suez Canal Investment Certificates worth 10 million EGP for the Poorest Families in Luxor The Ministry of Social Solidarity and Mansour Group launched an initiative to bring happiness to people in Luxor governorate. The initiative comes in line with the implementation of the memorandum of understanding signed between the Ministry and Mansour Group under the patronage of Youssef Mansour, the Chairman of the Mansour Group, aiming at activating the partnership initiative to support the poorest families in Luxor governorate. Minister Ghada Waly indicated that the Ministry is adopting an approach that targets the sustainable development of the most marginalized of areas through partnerships with the private sector. She added that the memorandum of understanding signed with the Mansour Group is a successful implementation of such an approach emphasizing its success. 42 According to the memorandum, the Mansour Group will finance buying one thousand new Suez Canal investment certificates at EGP 1,000/certificate with a total value of 10 million EGP through the Ministry of Social Solidarity, which will distribute these certificates to the poorest families in Luxor governorate, especially widows who provide for children below 16 years of age and persons with special needs. The Social Solidarity Directorate in Luxor determined the target families based on its records and it selected Armant and Esna districts for being the closest to Banque Misr from where certificates were bought. Youssef Mansour said that the initiative is a part of the Mansour Group’s strategy to contribute to sustainable development and finding prompt solutions for poverty. He added that Luxor was selected because it is one of the governorates in Upper Egypt; a major tourist attraction worldwide. He also noted that it needs massive and continuous efforts to combat poverty, illiteracy, and all social challenges in order to rise up to its local and global aspired position. 43 9. OUR ENVIRONMENT AND PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY This section presents our environmental and product responsibility performance. We divided the section into two parts, dedicating one part to each of the two topics. We also structured our exploration of these two areas around the relevant material GRI performance, as in the previous chapter. ENVIRONMENT Our environmental footprint is not among our high impact areas; much of the GRI indicators that cover this area are therefore of moderate to low materiality for us. Most of our operations do not pose any threat to biodiversity or endanger listed species, are not located within or near protected or restored habitats, and produce little non-recyclable waste. Moreover, our operations are generally not energy intensive, nor do they emit large quantities of CFCs or greenhouse gases. The aspects of our environmental performance that might be of high materiality to our operations are, to put it briefly, our waste and transportation activities. Waste All of our companies deploy waste management systems that collect their waste and separate it by type. An external contractor (usually the supplier of the original material) then buys the majority of this waste from us, as most of the waste generated acts as inputs in other industries. The type of waste that we produce includes: plastic bottles (which are sold to plastic factories), paper, wood, dust tobacco, rolling paper, and unsold supermarket commodities. We also produce other production-related waste, but in very small quantities. Our indirect waste includes the packaging material that we use in our production or distribution, mainly paper and aluminum cans, and plastic bottles. To date we monitor the aggregate waste in our supermarket chains only; and we calculate the numbers in terms of a percentage of sales, rather than by weight and volume. We also don’t monitor the portion of materials used that are recycled by us or by others. Waste Management 44 Metro and Kheir Zaman Successfully Adopt 100% Biodegradable Plastic Bags One of the key objectives of the Corporate Affairs Department is to adopt environmentally sustainable practices in the areas of energy consumption, waste management, water use, and paper consumption in order to minimize environmental degradation. In line with this objective, the Corporate Affairs Department, in cooperation with the Procurement Department at Metro Market, began to examine ways to minimize environmental degradation through practical applications in 2013. They began by looking at the use of plastic bags at all 99 Metro and Kheir Zaman stores. The stores, located in 12 governorates, use approximately 80 million plastic bags per year. Accordingly, efforts began to convert all plastic bags to recyclable plastic bags. Through cooperation with Symphony Environmental Ltd., based in the UK, the D2W technology was adopted to convert old-fashioned plastic bags into 100% biodegradable plastic bags. The D2W mark was affixed on all plastic bags to encourage competitors to adopt the same technology in order to reduce the harmful effects that plastics have on the environment. Future Plans We are currently putting in place a new waste-monitoring system that monitors waste by type and weight or volume. This should supply us with crucial information that we still lack access to. We are also moving to expand this waste management system to the whole company. Furthermore, we are reviving the idea of giving away some of the finished commodities that we remove from our inventory well before their expiry date. This is an idea that we have been investigating for several years. ENERGY Electricity remains our primary source of energy, with all of our companies operating on electricity, and connected to the national electricity grid. Our Hayat Company is the only exception, as it generates all of its electricity in house because it operates in an area that lacks access to the national grid. Furthermore, to overcome issues of blackout, we have secured a number of generators for companies to operate on when the power is out. While all of our companies operate on electricity, and many of them own and operate emergency generators to cover electricity blackouts, we don’t have generators in our supermarket stores. We have expanded our reporting on all of our direct and indirect energy consumption. We still need to further expand the relevant data from our various databases. We have also started working on reducing our energy consumption by studying the advantages of converting all our conventional lights to LED. 45 In addition, we aggregate most of the fuel consumed by the fleets of our different companies, which represents our largest environmental impact. The following table summarizes our fuel consumption in EGP.

This increase this year was caused by an increase in the price of fuel. Emissions Our emissions are mostly limited to the fuel consumed by our transportation fleets and the fuel used to generate electricity in our Hayat factory, In addition to the electricity consumption of our 99 Metro and Kheir Zaman supermarkets. We have expanded our monitoring on greenhouse gas emissions compared to our previous report.

One of our companies – Seclam Dairy Factory –produced a comprehensive quality policy document that defined the international hygiene standards that are material and applicable to Seclam’s manufacturing sites. They stressed a strong focus on minimizing the opportunity for any forms of product contamination to take place, and to ensure that their products meet the high standards that customers expect, while avoiding any incidents of manufacturing deficiencies that might damage the quality of their products or that of the health of customers. The associates of Seclam share the objective of manufacturing safe, wholesome and high quality products. Below are some of these product quality policies: Premises & Maintenance To prevent product contamination and any adverse impacts, premises must be located away from environmentally polluted areas, areas subject to flooding, areas prone to pest infestations, or areas where wastes cannot be effectively managed. Adequate measures must be in place to protect the premises from any potential contaminants, and good hygiene practices must be maintained. The premises must be designed in a way so that it can be easily cleaned, adequately ventilated, and has sufficient pest control procedures. Also, staff facilities must be designed and operated in a way that minimizes the risk of product contamination. The factory must have regularly updated and documented cleaning programs. There must be an adequate system for the collection and disposal of wastes, which will not be allowed to accumulate in food handling, storage, or other working areas inside or outside the factory. Defined waste areas have to be established and segregated from production activities, and waste disposal must meet legislative requirements and thus be disposed of by licensed contractors. Control of Operation Raw, unprocessed material must be segregated from processed products to avoid contamination, and products must have an appropriate shelf-life control, with expired materials being segregated and scrapped. Furthermore, all raw materials must be purchased from approved suppliers in accordance to a 48 Vendor Assurance Program, and have to be stored in good condition that maintains their quality. For food safety, a risk assessment procedure (HACCP) is used to define food safety Critical Control Points (CCP). Moreover, recipes’ production operating procedures and specifications have to be controlled and available for reference in appropriate areas of the sites. Environmental and process monitoring programs must be in place to trace microbiological contamination. All facilities for heating, cooling, freezing, or any other process must also meet the specified conditions for ensuring food safety. Food safety checks are performed in accordance to biological, chemical, and physical specifications, with transport and storage quality specifications also existing for all finished products. Finished products are stored separately from raw materials, and rejected products or returned goods are labeled and stored separately. Furthermore, vehicles that move products must be appropriately temperature-controlled, hygienic and clean. Pest Control A comprehensive pest management program is in place to greatly reduce the risk to the products from pests. Monitoring for pest activity is frequent and regularly reviewed and pest control audits and treatments are recorded. Incoming raw materials are also thoroughly checked for pests. Personnel Each site has qualified personnel with the necessary education, training, background, and experience to ensure that all activities, including hygiene and protective clothing, are correctly performed. Procedures are established to identify training competency requirements for all associates to carry out their responsibilities. Managers and supervisors have sufficient knowledge of food hygiene to be able to judge potential risks and take the appropriate preventative measures and corrective actions, while ensuring that effective monitoring and supervision is taking place. This ensures that all personnel entering manufacturing areas have an appropriate level of training in basic food hygiene and company hygiene procedures. Furthermore, all personnel are made aware of their contribution to the quality and food safety of the finished products; and the consequences of error and lack of attention to detail. 49 10.
