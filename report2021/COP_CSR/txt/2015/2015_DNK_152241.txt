This has put us in a position where we can document an immediate, direct and measurable improvement on key sustainability indicators. However, it has also enabled us to identify areas where we need to improve. From 2005 to 2014, total sales of our energy efficient circulator pumps in the EU have saved 3.5 billion kWh of electricity. This is just one example of how Grundfos solutions are contributing to sustainable development. When it comes to our own operations, we have reduced our energy consumption by 3% and our water footprint by 6% compared to 2013. Nevertheless, as mentioned before, 6 / Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 / 7 Sustainability focus area status People competences Sustainable product solutions Workplace Responsible business conduct Environmental footprint Community 8 / Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 / 9 Sustainable product solutions At Grundfos, we strive to deliver product solutions which can benefit future Energy efficient product solutions generations. By this we mean products which have minimal impact on people and One of our most mature focus areas within sustainable product solutions is the use and the planet, and we want to improve living conditions for people everywhere. We do lifetime of our products, focusing specifically on energy efficiency. Grundfos delivers some so by working with five different focus areas: sourcing of materials, production, of the most energy efficient solutions in the market. The installed base of Grundfos high packaging and distribution, use and lifetime, and end-of-life. Besides striving to efficiency circulator pumps sold in the EU between 2005 and 2014 implies a total annual deliver sustainable solutions, we also want to be recognised as an important player energy saving of 3.5 billion kWh, which corresponds to the annual electricity consumption of in public policy accelerating sustainable development. 800,000 European households. During 2014, we have worked intensively on preparing for the introduction of the new ISO14001 standard and on restructuring our process of handling environmental High efficiency circulator pumps – electricity saved (kWh per year) product documentation requested from our customers. Furthermore, we have identified the need for a more systematic monitoring of environmental legislation 3.5 billion 3,5 to ensure a proactive approach to the increasing number of legal requirements affecting our products. All initiatives will continue into 2015 and beyond. 3 2.8 billion 2,5 Sustainable Product Solutions Toolbox In 2013 and 2014, Grundfos developed its own methodology (toolbox) to facilitate a 2 2.0 billion systematic approach to developing more sustainable products. This toolbox combines life-cycle thinking, eco-design principles and guidelines with our product development 1,5 and innovation processes. People, planet and business are integral elements in each of 1 the focus areas. 0,5 0 2012 2013 2014 In addition to energy efficient products, Grundfos has a portfolio of products contributing to solving problems related to water stress. With offerings such as Demand Driven Distribution (DDD), Grundfos LifeLink and Grundfos BioBooster, we offer solutions which can minimise water waste, provide water to remote rural areas and enable decentralised wastewater treatment and water re-use. Influencing the public sustainability agenda Grundfos has a strong history of influencing the political agenda to promote more energy efficient solutions – as in the case of the European ErP (Energy related Products) Directive. Grundfos is currently involved in several working groups which work on further advancing the environmental agenda, such as the Environmental Footprint Initiative of the European Commission or various working groups aiming to help expand the ErP Directive. The expansion of the ErP Directive involves changing the directive from concerning only energy efficiency to being instead a more holistic eco-design directive. This encompasses important areas such as resource efficiency, end-of-life treatment and common standards for documenting environmental information for products across the same product ranges. 10 / Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 / 11 People competences In order to live up to our purpose and our sustainability vision, we need the right The purpose of the EDD is to create a framework for discussing the employee´s tasks, people to match these ambitions, and we need to continuously develop their qualifications and motivation for doing her/his job and for discussing the employee´s competences. In relation to sustainability, our work with people competences at development ambitions. Grundfos focuses on two areas. The first is to create general awareness of sustainability at Grundfos. We want sustainability to be a natural part of the way we In previous years, data on EDDs and training hours has been collected manually via surveys conduct business and understand society at large. Secondly, we wish to continuously sent to all Grundfos companies. In 2014, data was extracted from the People Portal (SAP) develop our employee competences through education and training, so that Grundfos which has been our global system for documenting EDDs and training hours for the past 2 now and in the future can compete in a global business environment and remain the years. However, as the processes and the People Portal are not fully implemented yet, first choice workplace for the brightest talents. performance has dropped significantly. For the EDDs, this is particularly evident. For blue-collar workers, figures have decreased Awareness of sustainability from 76%* of all employees attending an EDD to only 36%*. It is estimated that actual At Grundfos, there is a saying: “sustainability is in our DNA”. Nevertheless, we continuously performance is higher than this as not all EDDs are yet registered correctly. raise awareness of what sustainable practices are, and how Grundfos with almost 19,000 The picture is the same for training. Training hours have dropped for both blue collar and employees can work towards being an ever more sustainable business. In 2014, Group white-collar employees, but we know for a fact that not all training activities are recorded Sustainability developed a sustainability e-learning module which focuses on giving in the People Portal and that the actual numbers are higher. Grundfos employees an understanding and insight into how sustainability is defined at Grundfos, and how they can contribute. The module will be implemented as a pilot project It is a high priority at HR to redesign and simplify processes and to establish a governance in 2015, and learnings will be gathered and analysed for the training to be rolled out in 2016. that will ensure global implementation of both processes and system. This will result in improved HR data. Building for the future 2012 2013 2014 At Grundfos, we want to nurture our talents so that Grundfos, now and in the future, can Employee Development compete in a global business environment. Our Talent Engine, which has been a strong Dialogue – blue collar 79 % 76 % 36 % contributor to identifying, developing, deploying and retaining talents at Grundfos, played Employee Development a significant role in 2014. The number of talents taking on greater responsibility or moving Dialogue – white collar 86 % 80 % 66 % to another area was stable compared to 2013, as were the annual employee turnover rates (less than 5 per cent). However, we have decided to redesign the talent programme in 2015 2012 2013 2014 and enlarge the scope to include a broader population of talents at our local companies. Furthermore, Grundfos has its own corporate academy, the Poul Due Jensen Academy. In Training – blue collar (hours) 24 h 17 h 10 h 2014, the academy delivered more than 72,000 training hours on global training programmes, focusing on leadership programmes and sales and technical training. The Training – white collar (hours) 35 h 27 h 19 h ability to handle change by understanding the mechanisms of change and employee reactions is key in today’s global business climate and also at Grundfos. Over the last couple of years, more than 700 leaders have attended “Embracing Change” classes and For global training activities, our focus in 2015 will continue to be on supporting workshops, and this has resulted in a consistent and global approach to change strategy deployment and execution power and balancing global consistency with management. local/regional proximity. The increasing amount of global teams and managers with remote employees raises a need for development programmes supporting the virtual working environment. We have therefore launched several new programmes like Strengthening employee competences “Virtual Team Collaboration” and “The Virtual Leader” which can be taken as selfIt is Grundfos´ objective that all employees with at least 6 months of service attend an study e-learning courses or be facilitated online. In this area, we expect to grow in Employee Development Dialogue (EDD) every year. the coming years. *please see Reporting principles on p. 22-25 for definition and scope 12 / Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 / 13 Environmental footprint At Grundfos, we want to take our own medicine and minimise our environmental Water footprint footprint. We focus on four specific footprint areas: energy and CO2 footprint, We are committed to reducing our total water consumption by 50% by 2025 compared water footprint, chemical footprint and waste footprint. It is Grundfos’ ambition with 2008 levels as well as improving water quality. In 2014, our water consumption was that all production companies have the ISO14001 Environmental Management reduced by 6%* compared to 2013. One initiative helping to reducing our water certificate. In 2014, another Grundfos production company received the consumption is the Water Efficiency Programme; a mapping process that has unveiled certification, increasing the percentage of Grundfos companies certified from 84% potential reductions. to 88%. Since 2009, Group Management at Grundfos has focused on innovative and 655,136 proactive ideas from Grundfos employees for reducing our environmental footprint through the Future Now Award. This was also the case in 2014 when three winners 474,580 445,704 were selected. At Grundfos’ production company in Hungary, a Green Lean project in production reduced the energy consumption of 22 washers. In one of our factories in China, a closed loop water system has been constructed which recycles water instead of disposing it as waste water. The third winner was Grundfos’ production company in Denmark where employees developed a system capable of 2008 2013 2014 reducing cooling lubricant wastage by up to 80%. All three projects were honoured with the Future Now Award; they are just three examples of how we at Grundfos Water usage (m )* 3 strive to minimise our own environmental footprint, and how we reward great initiatives. Chemical footprint Our chemical footprint includes chemicals used for manufacturing, raw materials and Energy and CO2 footprint service chemicals for cleaning and maintenance of buildings.

CO2 emissions are based on energy consumption and CO2 conversion factors. Every year, those factors vary according to local renewable energy output. This makes it Waste footprint interesting to look at the energy consumption as well.

So when Grundfos employee Mikael Lundgren, back in 2008, suggested that Grundfos employees collect funds in order to give fellow human beings living in some of the poorest areas in the world access to clean drinking water, the Grundfos employee programme Water2Life was created. In addition to its positive impact on the communities in which we operate, the Water2Life employee programme also includes an additional focus area: people competences. Through Water2Life, Grundfos strives to create a vibrant culture where employees are personally and actively engaged in taking responsibility for the world around them. From 2010 to 2012, Grundfos employees raised enough funds through Water2Life to set up 11 Grundfos LifeLink water systems in Kenya in collaboration with the Red Cross and World Vision. In 2013, the programme expanded to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam where water is everywhere, but there is not a drop to drink. The locals get water from the Mekong River which is heavily polluted; to get safe and clean drinking water, it is necessary to drill to a depth of 300-400 metres. Grundfos employees worldwide serve as ambassadors to promote Water2Life through campaigns and activities. The 2014 ‘Think Water Wise’ campaign was a major global campaign. Water-saving aerators for taps were given to Grundfos employees in return for donations to Water2Life, letting the employees save water at home while at the same time bringing clean water to Vietnam. Grundfos also contributed as a company by replacing existing aerators with water-saving aerators. The contribution made by the Grundfos employees resulted in 16,000 m³ of clean water made available for poor people in Vietnam, and Grundfos saved 3% of its total water consumption by installing water-saving aerators. In November 2014, four Water2Life ambassadors visited the Water2Life project in Vietnam to see the first water system being installed in the village of An Quoi in the Mekong Delta region. An additional four systems are scheduled to be set up during 2015, and four more employees will travel to Vietnam to follow the installation process and to experience everyday life of the locals in the Mekong Delta. While in Vietnam and afterwards, the employees will share their experiences with colleagues throughout the world. 18 / Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 Grundfos Sustainability Progress Report 2014 / 19 Responsible business conduct As an international company operating in more than 50 countries worldwide 2012 2013 2014 through more than 80 local companies, Grundfos has a commitment to live up to and adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and voluntary commitments.
