SOCIETE GENERALE SRBIJA PROJECTS THAT WE SUPPORT INCLUSIVE ACADEMY The Inclusive Academy is a successful project that reflects the seriousness with which the Bank employees accept voluntary activities, for which the Bank received a fifth award for the third year in a row. This project’s core is social inclusion, improving the educational profile of people with disabilities. In 2014, Societe Generale Bank Srbija a.d. Beograd has won the fourth prize for Inclusive Academy program allocated by Stanton Chase, an international company to locate and development managers. The program, managed and ran by the Human Resources Direction has been recognised as the most original approach to talent development and awarded based upon the assessment of the quality of the program. HYPPOTHERAPY Since 2008, Societe Generale Bank Srbija a.d. Beograd is supporting the humanitarian organization “Mali Veliki Ljudi” that takes care of mentally disabled and handicapped children through various projects. The activities of the organization are focused on fighting for improving the quality of lives of socially vulnerable and disabled children living in orphanages all around Serbia. Children, after joining the hypotherapy, have a more stable behavior, they demonstrate a greater intensity of attention, a decreasing aggressiveness and anxiety, a greater coordination of upper and lower extremities, better motor skills and balance of the body. This treatment has a positive impact on the further psycho motor development, as well as an open communication directed towards others. The Bank, as a socially responsible company recognized the importance of hyppotherapy and the need to support children with disabilities, along with its partner, a humanitarian organization “Mali veliki Ljudi”, which cares for children with disabilities through various projects. The activities of this organization are focused on the fight to improve the quality of life of socially vulnerable groups and children with disabilities who live in homes throughout Serbia. 25 COMMUNICATON ON PROGRESS REPORT 2015. SOCIETE GENERALE SRBIJA RAISING FUNDS FOR THE FERTILITY CENTRE AND PART OF THE GENERAL HOSPITAL IN VALJEVO Better conditions to the Fertility centre as a result of cross sectorial synergy Retail, Corporate Division, but also on the level of the whole bank, including the partner companies of the Bank, worked in synergy in collecting, raising funds for the Fertility Centre and part of the General Hospital in Valjevo. Mutual engagement of various banking sectors and the involvement of partner companies bank in humanitarian action, raised the amount of RSD 1.7 million or approximately EUR 14,500. The importance of the Fertility Centre in Valjevo lies in the fact that it is a regional center that covers 20 cities situated in the Central and Western Serbia. The Fertility Centre, established two years ago, is one of four heath institutions of this kind in Serbia that started working only 2 years ago but is gaining importance. In fact, additional argumentation to invite our partners to support this humanitarian action refers on the fact that Fertility Centre in Valjevo is the only one of four existing public health centres for this purpose (CC Novi Sad, GAC Visegradska and GAC Narodni Front in Belgrade) without waiting list, which is the reason why the couples from Vojvodina and Belgrade start to be redirected to the Fertility Centre in Valjevo. 26 COMMUNICATON ON PROGRESS REPORT 2015.
