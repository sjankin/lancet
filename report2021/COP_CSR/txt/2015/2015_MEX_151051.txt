Since the company’s inception in 1998, one of our most constant guiding principles has been to act ethically, while minimising our impact on the environment, and promoting the wellbeing of the people who, to a greater or lesser extent, rely on us. Like any successful business, our focus is on value creation: for our shareholders, but also for passengers, employees, and the members of the community in the locations where we operate. As the provider of key transport services, we are well aware that there are many people depending on us to do our job efficiently and appropriately: the passengers that use our airports and who deserve a smooth-running, stress-free travel experience, but also the people in the local communities who depend on those passengers for their livelihoods. We believe that in the long term, what is in the interests of our stakeholders is also beneficial to our shareholders: a solid company, one that is run according to high standards of business ethics, with a motivated workforce and good community relations, is ultimately more likely to be successful and to provide a good return for investors. 4 A S U R Our focus on sustainability issues is therefore a key element in achieving this strategic goal. In the coming years, we will continue to seek ways in which we can improve the financial performance of our company, while protecting the environment, supporting local communities and creating working conditions for our employees that guarantee their safety and respect for their human rights. The company’s strategic sustainability priorities for the short and medium term continue to be: mitigation of the effects of climate change, by maintaining energyefficient facilities and thereby reducing our indirect emissions of greenhouse gases, complemented by the protection of natural habitats; and support for initiatives that promote education, health and culture in the locations where we operate. During 2014, we have remained focused on the key issues of waste management, water management and energy efficiency in our airports. This was the first full year of a major project at Cancún Airport, aimed at recycling non-hazardous waste materials like glass, cardboard and aluminium: we reduced the amount of waste generated by the airport and disposed of in landfill sites by 71%. In terms of energy efficiency, our overall electricity consumption throughout the group rose by 8%. Due to a 10% increase in passenger figures this represented a 2% decrease on a per-passenger basis. Total water consumption increased by almost 27% in all the airports in the group during 2014, mainly as a result of dry weather conditions and several infrastructure expansion projects under way. We will be looking at ways to reduce consumption and recycle more water in the coming months. We have also recently been working on implementing a system to measure our direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases, which we expect to have in place for the 2015 reporting cycle. The main challenges that we anticipate for the next several years are all related to construction projects that are under way in our airports, principally in Cancún. Due to the need for greater capacity to handle increasing passenger numbers, we have had to undertake two major projects: the expansion of Terminal 3 and the construction of a completely new Terminal 4. In both cases, environmental-impact assessments are either complete or ongoing, and construction work is scheduled to begin in 2015. While both projects have been designed to minimise environmental impacts, we expect that entry into operation of this new infrastructure will have significant effects on the amount of electricity and water consumed at Cancún Airport, as well as on other environment parameters. As we have said on many occasions before, the goal of this report is to increase transparency and to encourage dialogue with all our stakeholders. We welcome any comments or observations about additional matters that our readers would like to see included, or suggestions as to how we can improve our reporting process. adolfo castro rivas, chief executive officer 6 A S U R SECTION 2.0 COMPANY PROFILE A N N U A L R E P O R T 7 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 2.0 COMPANY PROFILE Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V. operates a group of airports in the southeast region of Mexico under the brand name ASUR. These airports are located in the cities of Cancún, Cozumel, Huatulco, Mérida, Minatitlán, Oaxaca, Tapachula, Veracruz and Villahermosa. The company’s headquarters are located in Mexico City. In February 2013, the concession for the operation of Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was granted to Aerostar Airport Holdings, LLC, a company in which Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V. holds a 50% stake. These are the only operations outside of Mexico in which ASUR currently has an interest. 2.1 business activities The company’s core activity is to administer and maintain the infrastructure of its airports to ensure sufficient capacity for safe, efficient operations and a high standard of service. Basic infrastructure includes that required for aircraft takeoff and landing operations and for arriving and departing passenger flows, as well as facilities for the authorities involved in airport operations (air-traffic controllers, customs, immigration, etc.). 8 A S U R In addition to the above, the company enters into agreements with external providers for a range of additional services, including complementary services for aircraft (such as baggage handling and ramp services) and commercial services for passengers (such as restaurants, shops and car rental, among other business lines). The company’s aeronautical, complementary and commercial activities represent its three revenue streams. Consequently, there are facilities and personnel that, while located at ASUR’s airports, are not under the direct operational control of the company. These include all those corresponding to the government agencies, complementary service providers and commercial concession holders mentioned above, as well as the facilities and staff members of the various airlines that operate out of the company’s airports.

Under the privatisation scheme, an initial stake of 15% in the company’s capital stock (the BB series shares) was sold to a strategic partner, Inversiones y Técnicas Aeroportuarias, S.A. de C.V. (ITA), with expertise in Mexican business operations and in the international airport industry. The remaining 85% of the company’s shares (the B series) began trading on the stock exchanges of Mexico City and New York in two public offers in September 2000 and March 2005. ASUR is therefore a onehundred-per-cent privately owned company, subject to a series of national and international regulatory frameworks. 10 A S U R 2.3 shareholder structure In June 2007, the strategic partner ITA reduced its shareholding in the company from 15% to 7.65%. As of the 31st of December 2014, ITA is owned by Fernando Chico Pardo, a Mexican investor, who has a 51% stake in the company; and by Remer Soluciones a la Inversión, S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of the Mexican bus transport company Grupo ADO, S.A. de C.V., which has a stake of 49%. The 92.35% of ASUR’s shares that are not F2: Structure, Holding Company and Subsidiaries held by ITA are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: ASR) and the GRUPO AEROPORTUARIO DEL SURESTE, S.A.B.

FIGURES STATED IN MILLIONS OF MEXICAN PESOS ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 2.6 Significant Changes in Operations during Reporting Period During 2014, there were no significant changes regarding the size or structure of the company, including the location of its airports and the opening, closing or expansion of the facilities it operates. Although several infrastructure expansion projects were undertaken in the year 2014, mostly these did not involve major extensions to the built-up surface areas or “footprints” of the airports. The necessary capacity increases were mostly achieved by remodelling and optimising existing buildings and facilities, notably in the airports of Huatulco, and Veracruz. For Additionally, for the seventh year running, a more detailed discussion of mitigation we were awarded recognition as a measures for infrastructure expansion, Socially Responsible Company by the please refer to section 5.2.1 of this report.

The assessments monitor an active signatory of the United Nations performance in four key areas: quality Global Compact (UNGC) by complying with of life for company employees; business the UNGC’s reporting requirements. The ethics and anti-corruption practices; Global Compact is an initiative established community support and relations; and by the United Nations to promote the environmental protection. values of social responsibility and respect for human rights in businesses around the In the reporting period, ASUR received world. Environmental Quality Assurance certificates for five of its airports from the Mexican Environmental Protection Agency, PROFEPA. The certification in question represents official confirmation by the Mexican environmental authorities that the recipient has complied in full with all observations resulting from the audits conducted by the authorities to enforce Mexican environmental legislation. 14 A S U R The airports certified were Cozumel, Huatulco, Oaxaca, Tapachula and Villahermosa. Certificates are valid for a period of two years; the remaining airports in the Group—Cancún, Mérida, Minatitlán and Veracruz—are due for recertification in 2015. As of the 31st of December 2014, the environmental management systems in place in all of ASUR’s airports have valid ISO 14001 certification. The airports at Cancún, Huatulco and Oaxaca were recertified for the period 2012-2015, and those at Cozumel, Mérida, Minatitlán, Tapachula, Veracruz and Villahermosa were recertified for the period 2013-2016. Finally, with regard to ASUR’s passenger service standards, in 2014 Cancún Airport was ranked in second place in the Latin America and Caribbean region in the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) survey programme organised by Airports Council International. In ASQ surveys, passengers are asked to rate their degree of overall satisfaction with airports’ service levels, as well as performance in a wide range of specific areas, from efficiency and the standard of facilities to cleanliness and staff courtesy. 2.8 Description of Company’s Value Chain To maintain the facilities at its airports and a high standard of passenger service, ASUR contracts goods and services with a wide range of suppliers. Among the most important of these are: contractors hired to carry out construction work for the maintenance, extension or remodelling of airport infrastructure; technical supervision services to ensure that construction work is completed on time and in accordance with specifications; suppliers of equipment for air-conditioning, security and checkin systems, and so on; and the providers of certain services, such as cleaning, security and surveillance, passenger inspection, and refuse collection. ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 The vast majority of the companies in ASUR’s value chain are based in Mexico, with the exception of some suppliers of airport-specific equipment such as boarding bridges, specialised vehicles, and baggage-handling equipment. All contractors and subcontractors are required to adhere to ASUR’s Code of Ethics. Their employees have access to the company’s internal reporting system, and are encouraged to report any instances of unethical behaviour or violations of their fundamental rights. The company’s Internal Auditing Department also carries out random inspections to ensure that subcontractors adhere to the provisions of Mexican labour legislation, especially with regard to payment of social security contributions for their employees. During 2014, of the 20 biggest contracts for goods and services entered into by the company, 10 were for construction services, 5 were for the acquisition of equipment, 4 were service agreements, and 1 was for technical supervision services. 16 A S U R SECTION 3.0 REPORT PARAMETERS A N N U A L R E P O R T 17 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 3.0 REPORT PARAMETERS This Annual Sustainability Report relates to the company’s operations in the period between the 1st of January and the 31st of December 2014, and follows on from ASUR’s 2013 Annual Sustainability Report which can be consulted at www.asur.com.mx.

This analysis is prepared internally on an annual basis, and is presented to the company’s Audit Committee. Further details regarding the company’s risk analysis may be found in the reports submitted to the stock-market authorities in Mexico and the United States. The assessment in question covers both risks for the company itself, and those that might adversely affect stakeholder groups. In accordance with the precautionary approach, one of the guiding principles for the company’s operations is that it should avoid or minimise any activities that have the potential to negatively impact its own operations or the wellbeing of its stakeholders. 18 A S U R ASUR’s principal stakeholder groups have been identified based on internal assessments and external guidance, such as that provided by reporting frameworks, best practices, and the standards adopted by initiatives such as the United Nations Global Compact and the Mexico Stock Exchange Sustainability Index. ASUR’s internal stakeholders include the company’s employees, shareholders and the members of the company’s corporate governance bodies, and its main external stakeholders are local residents and business communities, and the passengers that travel through the airports. Below is a summary of the main stakeholder-engagement activities carried out by ASUR during 2014: F6 : Stakeholder Groups Engaged and Engagement Method STAKEHOLDER GROUP PRINCIPAL ENGAGEMENT METHOD .........................................................................................................................................................................................

A N N U A L R E P O R T 19 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 The engagement activities described above have allowed us to identify a series of material aspects to be reported on. In selecting the information to be included in this report, ASUR has applied the four principles of materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context and completeness established by the Global Reporting Initiative for defining report content. The material aspects identified, which F7: Material Aspects for Sustainability Reporting are all covered by this report, are listed in Figure 7 below.

All other indicators refer to the nine airports, the company’s head offices in Mexico City and other company subsidiaries, as described in Section 2.4. The report covers operations performed directly by the companies that form part of the ASUR business group. At this time, mechanisms are not in place to include the activities of clients, suppliers or subcontractors within the parameters of this report, unless otherwise stated. This report has been prepared on a consistent basis with ASUR’s Annual Sustainability Report for 2013 in terms of measurement methods, and contains no restatements or reinterpretations of data contained in that report, although the scope and boundaries of this report have been widened to cover certain aspects and indicators contained in the G4 Reporting Guidelines and the Airport Operator Sector Supplement published by the Global Reporting Initiative. At this time, it is not company policy to seek external assurance of our Annual Sustainability Report.

Shareholders’ meetings are held on at least an annual basis, in order to vote on the most important issues such as dividend payments and other matters that require shareholder approval by law. In addition, according to the company’s bylaws, any shareholder or group of shareholders representing at least 10% of the company’s capital stock has the right to convene a shareholders’ meeting at any time. The Board of Directors reports to the company’s shareholders, and is in turn reported to by four different committees: the Audit Committee, the Nominations and Compensations Committee, the Operations Committee and the Acquisitions and Contracts Committee. The Board of Directors is responsible for making strategic decisions regarding the company’s business operations. To do so, it receives reports from the company’s top management and corporate governance committees regarding such matters as the company’s financial performance, passenger figures, operations, compliance with investment commitments, and other important matters. On a yearly basis, the Board submits a report regarding its own activities and performance for the evaluation of the company shareholders. A N N U A L R E P O R T 25 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 4.2 Duties of the Corporate Governance Committees 4.2.1 Audit Committee The Audit Committee is responsible for verifying that the company has sufficient internal controls to ensure accurate financial reporting. It also supervises the company’s risk-management activities: on a regular basis risk-mapping activities are carried out, covering aspects such as risks relating to financial information, areas of the company that may be vulnerable to fraud or other acts of corruption, information technology, and environmental and social issues. Once the company’s 4.2.2 Nominations and Compensations risks have been mapped in detail, courses Committee of action are determined for them to be managed and the information is presented The Nominations and Compensations to the Audit Committee for discussion.

It also issues proposals raised were resolved. and recommendations to the Board of Directors in relation to such matters as the company’s budget, business plan, and dividends, among others. 26 A S U R 4.2.4 Acquisitions and Contracts Committee The Acquisitions and Contracts Committee is responsible for ensuring that appropriate standards are adhered to in the process of acquiring the goods and services that the company needs to carry out its operations successfully. Specifically, approval is required from the Committee for any acquisition or contract with a total value in excess of 400,000 US dollars, in one or more years; for extensions to existing contracts that represent an increase of more than 25% of the originally agreed timeframe or value; when a contract is put up for tender and a single bid is received, or when a contract is assigned directly and without tender to a given supplier, regardless of the contract value; and in cases when a contract is renewed with the same supplier on expiry. 4.3 Composition of Corporate Governance Bodies and Remuneration Board and Committee members are appointed in accordance with proposals presented by the Nominations and Compensations Committee, whose job it is to identify potential candidates, analyse their qualifications and expertise in the relevant strategic areas, and verify that they do not have any conflicts of interest with the company. Once a possible candidate has been identified for each vacant position, and this person has expressed his or her agreement to be appointed, the proposal is submitted for approval by either the company shareholders or the Board of Directors, as applicable. All Board and Committee members are paid a fixed fee for each session they attend, which is proposed each year by the Nominations and Compensations Committee in line with market standards and is submitted for the approval of the company shareholders. Compensation payable to the company’s executive officers is also analysed and approved by the Nominations and Compensations Committee, subject to ratification by the independent Audit Committee. This includes both base salary and the annual performance bonus, which is linked to a series of performance indicators, also determined annually by the Nominations and Compensations Committee in accordance with the process described in section 4.2.2 above. At this time, there are no female members on either the company’s Board of Directors or any of the corporate governance committees that report to it. 4.4 Code of Ethics ASUR has a Code of Ethics which is developed internally, and is applicable to all activities in all areas of all of the companies in the group. Staff members are given training in the rules of the Code of Ethics on a yearly basis, and each year are required to sign a statement to the effect that they have read and understand it, and have not incurred any violations. During 2014, an enquiry was received from a stakeholder regarding the company procedures in place to prevent facilitation payments and bribes to government officials. In response to this, the company developed and implemented a completely new Code of Ethics, which was approved by the Audit Committee. The new Code of Ethics incorporates stricter controls in a wide range of aspects and specific provisions according to which company employees, officers and board members are forbidden from offering payments, gifts or benefits of any other kind to government employees. 28 A S U R SECTION 5.0 ENVIROMENTAL RESPONSABILITY A N N U A L R E P O R T 29 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 5.0 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSABILITY 5.1 Significant Issues and Management Strategy ASUR has a written policy that expressly and formally sets forth the commitment of the company and its subsidiaries to take positive action in relation to the environment. This policy contains the stated goals of reducing the negative environmental effects of the company’s operations and promoting environmental protection and the economical use of natural resources. Among the most significant environmental issues identified by the company with the potential to impact our operations negatively are climate change, and the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity. ASUR is a company whose business depends largely on the tourism industry: our airports at Cancún, Cozumel and Huatulco serve primarily tourist markets, and significant numbers of tourists also travel through our airports at Mérida, Oaxaca, Veracruz and Villahermosa. Together, these airports accounted for over 98% of our passenger traffic in 2014. Therefore, it is clearly in the interests of the company to contribute as much as it can to the preservation of the natural beauty of these areas, in order for them to continue to be attractive to visitors. 30 A S U R Any combination of the effects of climate change widely predicted by the scientific community, including rises in sea levels with the corresponding loss of beaches, an increased risk of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and flooding, and the disappearance of land and marine habitats such as mangroves and coral reefs, has the potential to significantly impact the airports in ASUR’s group located in beach destinations (Cancún, Cozumel and Huatulco), as well as those serving low-lying or floodprone areas (Mérida, Minatitlán, Tapachula, Veracruz and Villahermosa). In the interests of limiting its carbon footprint, the company carries out regular analyses of its systems and facilities to identify areas where there are opportunities for the reduction of the amount of electricity consumed in the airports, thereby reducing indirect emissions of greenhouse gases. Although the facilities directly operated by ASUR produce few direct emissions of greenhouse gases, the company is also currently working on implementing systems that will accurate measure all greenhouse-gas emissions, in order to comply with Mexican legislation regarding the National Emissions Register (RENE), which will become effective in 2015. Additionally, the company has instituted programmes intended to ensure that the airports’ water consumption does not put excessive pressure on the water supplies for local habitats and populations; to protect and promote plant and animal biodiversity in the undeveloped areas surrounding the airports; and to ensure that the waste water discharged and storm water runoff do not constitute a source of pollution for local bodies of water. A N N U A L R E P O R T 31 Since ASUR’s business activities do not involve the manufacture or creation of any kind of physical product, the company’s consumption of materials is relatively insignificant. The principal consumable required on a consistent basis for our airports’ day-to-day operations is fuel, which is discussed in greater detail in section 5.2.5 of this report. Similarly, due to the nature of ASUR’s operations, the environmental aspects relating to products, services and transport are considered immaterial for the purposes of this report. Within the company’s overall strategic approach to environmental matters, each of the nine airports in the Group establishes its own specific goals in accordance with local conditions. These environmental objectives are available for consultation in Appendix A of this report. Responsibility for environmental issues within the organisation ultimately lies with our Chief Infrastructure and Compliance Officer, one of the six executive officers at the top level of management in the company. This position has responsibility for the oversight of infrastructure management (including infrastructure expansion), as well as all matters relating to the company’s compliance with the various regulations it is subject to. ASUR’s Operational and Safety Compliance Manager works below the Chief Infrastructure and Compliance Officer and manages a team of environmental coordinators, with members based in each of the airports in the Group. Each of ASUR’s airports has an Environmental Management System that establishes detailed guidelines and procedures for aspects such as training, monitoring, emergency response, and the environmental requirements for projects and contractors. Each airport’s Environmental Management System is currently certified under the ISO 14001 programme. In addition to ISO 14001 certification, ASUR’s airports have consistently been awarded with the Environmental Quality Assurance certification, which represents official confirmation by the Mexican environmental authorities that the recipient has complied in full with all observations resulting from the audits conducted by the authorities to enforce Mexican environmental legislation. For additional information relating to key environmental issues, such as performance against environmental objectives, specific risks and systems, and targeted strategies and procedures, please see the information contained in section 5.2 of this report. 32 A S U R ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 5.2 Overview of Principal Mitigation Measures 5.2.1 Mitigation of Infrastructure Expansion Large-scale infrastructure expansion at any of ASUR’s airports, which tend to be surrounded by undeveloped land, often necessitates the modification or destruction of natural habitats. 5.2.2 Energy Efficiency For this reason, projects of this type are only undertaken following careful consideration For several years, the most important front and analysis of the mitigation measures that that we have been working on in our airports can be applied, and when it is determined that to reduce the company’s carbon footprint there is ample justification, usually to eliminate is to moderate the amount of electricity we operational hazards or serious capacity consume. Beginning in 2008, the company constraints, which in turn may have negative achieved notable success in its energy consequences for both local economies and efficiency programme: from 2008 to 2009, the environment. total electricity consumption in the nine airports of the Group was reduced by 28.9%, In 2014, major expansion projects were and from 2009 to 2010 another reduction of ongoing in two of ASUR’s airports. At Huatulco 3.7% in overall consumption was achieved. International Airport, a project is nearing completion under which the terminal building Our focus in 2013 and 2014 has been to has been expanded by 4,468 square metres; maintain the progress made in terms of energy and a similar project is being finalised at efficiency in previous years. Due to increases Veracruz International Airport, in which the in traffic at our airports, and therefore a more terminal building has been expanded by 9,518 intensive use of our facilities, total annual square metres. electricity consumption across all the airports in the group increased in both years, by 0.9% In both cases, the required environmental in 2013 and by 7.7% in 2014. However, when impact assessments have been carried out. measured on a per-passenger basis to provide Where possible, the expansion projects are a more comparable parameter from year being carried out in such a way that they do to year, there was a reduction in electricity not expand the footprint of the airports’ consumption of 7.2% in 2013, and another infrastructure, for example by repurposing decrease of 2.0% in 2014 (despite a 9.8% areas that had previously been built on; where increase in passengers during this year). 1 this is not possible, the environmental impact mitigation measures established by the Mexican authorities have been adhered to. 1 Source: Internal ASUR data.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 33 These figures state only the intermediate energy produced by Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission and purchased by ASUR. At this time, data are not available that allow a calculation of the amount of direct energy from primary sources consumed in order to produce this electricity. ASUR does not produce any of the electricity it consumes; one hundred percent of the company’s electricity requirements are covered by purchasing from the Federal Electricity Commission. According to figures published by the International Energy Agency, in 2012 (the most recent data available), 85% of the electricity generated in Mexico was produced from non-renewable sources (natural gas, oil, coal and nuclear energy) and 15% was produced from renewable sources (hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass and wind power). 2 F9:Total Electricity Consumption vs. Passenger Growth 23 millions 21 millions 19 18 18 millions ,millions 17 millions 16 millions millions 88 63 61 62 68 69 74 gWh gWh gWh gWh gWh gWh gWh 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 TOTAL ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION PASSENGERS 2 Source: International Energy Agency website, at: http://www.iea.org/ stats/electricitydata.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=MX 34 A S U R 5.2.3 Water Management In addition to reducing the company’s carbon footprint through energy efficiency, ASUR has also been focusing on improving its systems for managing both our water consumption and waste water and other effluents produced in the airports. Eight of ASUR’s nine airports are equipped with treatment plants that receive all waste water from terminals and administrative buildings. In the case of Cozumel Airport, waste water is sent to the municipal drainage system and is treated at the municipal plant. The airports’ plants use biological, mechanical and chemical treatment processes to purify waste water to a standard where it is clean enough to be either reused or discharged without presenting a risk to other water sources. The water that is recycled is mainly used for watering green areas, which helps to reduce the demands placed by the airports on local resources. Any water that cannot be stored and used for this purpose is released into either the subsoil or into local wetlands, in accordance with the permits issued by Mexico’s National Water Commission (CONAGUA). ASUR also takes care to ensure that the quality of the storm water that runs off our airport facilities is in full compliance with local regulations. Given the weather conditions in the southeast region of Mexico, no de-icing or anti-icing fluids are used in any of the airports in the group. Furthermore, the company has equipment in place on the aircraft aprons of each of our airports to ensure that any spills of liquids such as fuels or oil are appropriately eliminated before they can be flushed into local water sources. Overall, in 2014 ASUR’s total water consumption in the nine airports increased by 26.7% from 717,969 to 909,949 cubic metres (m3). This was largely the result of an increase in consumption of 38.7% in Cancún Airport, the company’s largest, due to traffic growth and the reopening of Terminal 1 to handle increased passenger numbers. Water consumption on a per-passenger basis (measured in litres per passenger) increased by 15.4%. The amount of metered discharge increased by 12.0% in absolute terms (from 230,958 to 258,660 m3), and by 2.0% in litres per passenger. 3 F10: Total Water Consumption vs. Passenger Growth 23 ,million 21 ,million 19 18 18 million million 17 ,million 16 ,million ,million 423,190 569,624 555,939 596,197 701,660 717,969 909,949 m3 m3 m3 m3 m3 m3 m3 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 TOTAL WATER CONSUMPTION PASSENGERS 3 Source: Internal ASUR data. See tables in Section 5.3 Environmental Management System. 36 A S U R 5.2.4 Waste Management An important aspect in ensuring that our operations do not damage local environments and ecosystems is to make sure that all the waste materials generated in our airports are appropriately disposed of. Consequently, each airport has waste management facilities for hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The waste materials that are classified as hazardous under Mexican legislation include a series of toxic, inflammable and corrosive substances, as well as items of equipment that have come into contact and are contaminated with these materials. In our airports, all substances and articles of this kind are safely stored, appropriately labelled and eventually handed over to specialist waste disposal companies, in strict adherence to the applicable regulations. The waste disposal companies, which are required to be licenced by the Mexican authorities, eliminate the hazardous waste using methods that avoid pollution and provide ASUR with waste disposal certificates stating the methods used. Non-hazardous waste is handled in separate facilities at ASUR’s airports. It is sorted into organic waste (used for compost) and non-organic waste (materials such as glass, paper, cardboard and aluminium) before being collected by the local municipal refuse disposal service. As well as attempting to reduce the amount of waste produced, at several of our airports we have set ourselves the goal of reusing or recycling some or all of the non-hazardous, non-organic waste produced, to keep it from being disposed of in local landfills. ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 In 2014, these programmes began to pay significant dividends: the total amount of non-hazardous waste disposed of was reduced by 68.2%, from 5,179 to 1,648 tonnes. This was largely due to recycling and waste reduction efforts in Cancún, our largest airport, which reduced its nonhazardous waste disposal by 77.4%.4 5.2.5 Fuel Consumption 5.2.6 Biodiversity Issues Petrol (gasoline) and diesel fuels are consumed to operate a wide range of ASUR has several programmes in place that support vehicles, including shuttle buses are intended to promote and protect the for transporting passengers to various rich biodiversity in the areas that surround parts of the airports, utility vehicles, and many of our airports.

The purpose of the system is to establish environmental objectives for each airport, as well as a framework for the achievement of those objectives. The system creates a series of parameters that can be used to monitor and assess each airport’s performance in relation to the environmental objectives established, providing the company management with valuable information for the decision-making process. Environmental objectives are determined by each airport on an ad hoc basis, in order to ensure that local conditions are taken into consideration in ASUR’s environmental protection programme. The full details of the environmental objectives established in 2014 for the nine airports in the Group, as well as performance against those objectives, can be consulted in Appendix A. The Environmental Management Systems in each of ASUR’s airports are certified according to ISO 14001. The following tables provide an overview of the performance in all nine of ASUR’s airports with regard to some of the most relevant environmental parameters established by the System: TOTAL F11 : Summary FIGURES of Environmental Performance Indicators for All Airports PARAMETER UNIT MMT 2012 2013 2014 % CHANGE (´14 VS ´13) .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The airports at Cancún, Huatulco and Oaxaca were recertified for the period 20122015, and those at Cozumel, Mérida, Minatitlán, Tapachula, Veracruz and Villahermosa were recertified for the period 2013-2016. ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 Mexico’s Environmental Protection Agency (PROFEPA) also performs audits once every two years to ensure that ASUR’s airports are in full compliance with the country’s environmental legislation. Following the inspection procedure, provided that no violations of environmental legislation are identified, the individual airports are issued certificates confirming their compliance with the law. All nine of ASUR’s airports currently have valid environmental compliance certification: the airports at Cozumel, Huatulco, Oaxaca, Tapachula and Villahermosa were recertified during 2014, and those at Cancún, Mérida, Minatitlán and Veracruz are due to be audited during 2015. To date, no administrative or judicial sanctions, including fines or non-monetary penalties, have been imposed on the company for failure to comply with national, international or local environmental laws or regulations. 42 A S U R SECTION 6.0 QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EMPLOYEES A N N U A L R E P O R T 43 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 6.0 QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EMPLOYEES As a fundamental part of ASUR’s duty of care toward its employees, we aim to provide decent working conditions in all the subsidiaries that form part of the Group. The company’s main goal in relation to human resources is to ensure that our airports constitute a reliable source of safe employment for local populations. Between 2013 and 2014, the number of full-time employees in our organisation fell by 5.0%, while our agency-hired employees increased by 3.3%. During the period, we have maintained both a low level of staff turnover and an excellent occupational health and safety record. Further information on these aspects is available in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this report. Positive relations between the company’s employees and management are also a priority for ASUR. 37% of the company’s employees are unionised, and the company enjoys a good working relationship with the union. The company has a written “open-doors” communication policy, according to which all staff members are free to approach any member of management with consultations or complaints at any time. Employees are also given the option of submitting any grievances they have via the company’s internal reporting system; these reports are investigated confidentially by the Internal Auditing Department to identify any instances of inappropriate behaviour on the part of those involved and to reach amicable solutions whenever possible. 44 A S U R The company has a permanent training programme for employees in all ten locations where we have operations (the head offices in Mexico City and the nine airports). During 2014, training was provided to staff members in a wide range of areas, covering topics such as technical systems training, aviation security, fire safety and first aid. A total of 169,298 hours of training was provided for the company’s 934 employees during the year. 1 In addition to the professional development of staff members, the company plans a series of activities, to provide an opportunity for employees to socialise and to support local cultural traditions. Among the events organised in 2014 were sporting events, as well as celebrations of Children’s Day, Mothers’ Day, Father’s Day, Christmas and the traditional Mexican festivities of the Epiphany (Día de Reyes) and the Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos). The company has a series of written policies covering different aspects that relate to its human resources, such as recruitment practices, holiday entitlements, work-life balance and occupational health and safety. Additionally, company policy mandates the protection of employees’ human rights, such as the right to equal opportunity and non-discrimination, the right to personal and physical integrity and the right to exercise fundamental liberties, including freedom of association. Regular internal campaigns are carried out to ensure that all company employees are aware of these policies, as well as the provisions of ASUR’s Code of Ethics, which include information on the internal reporting system for grievances. 1 Calculated on the basis of the total duration of training courses, multiplied by the number of trainees. ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 On a day-to-day basis, labour issues within the organisation are the responsibility of the company’s Human Resources Manager, who is based at the company’s headquarters in Mexico City and oversees the human resources team in each of the airports. Certain labour relations issues, such as the renegotiation of the collective bargaining agreement with the union, are handled directly by the Chief Executive Officer. 6.1 Description of Workforce As of the 31st of December 2014, the majority of ASUR’s workforce was employed on a permanent, full-time basis; of a total workforce of 1,114 people, 934 (84%) had indefinite, written labour contracts for full-time employment. Among full-time employees, a staff rotation rate of 7.0% was achieved during the year; this is calculated on the basis of the number of people who left the company for whatever reason, including retirements, resignations and dismissals, as a percentage of total employees. The following table shows a breakdown of the 934 permanent employees of the company according to the location where they work: F12 : Breakdown of ASUR Workforce (Permanent Employees) on Geographic Basis CITY STATE Nº OF EMPLOYEES UNIONISED % NON-UNIONISED % ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

As of the 31st of funds savings accounts and, in some cases, December 2014, the geographic distribution of performance bonuses, that are in excess of ASUR’s 180 temporary workers was as follows: the minimum benefits required under Mexican 143 at Cancún Airport; 9 at Veracruz Airport; labour legislation. 8 at Mérida Airport; 7 at Villahermosa Airport; 6 at Cozumel Airport; 3 at Huatulco Airport; 2 In addition to the permanent employees and at Oaxaca Airport; and 2 at Tapachula Airport. the agency-hired personnel mentioned above, there are significant numbers of workers ASUR’s unionised workers all belong to the based at each of the company’s airports who National Airport Industry Workers Union are not directly employed by the company.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 47 6.2 Safety in the Workplace The right to physical integrity, and therefore a safe workplace that does not expose employees to unnecessary risks, is included in the company’s written policies. During 2014, the 934 permanent employees of ASUR worked a total of 2,680,984 hours, equivalent to 335,123 days (eight-hour shifts). In the period in question, there were in total fifteen cases of accidents in the workplace, affecting 1.7% of staff members, with no cases of occupational disease and no fatalities. During the year, the total number of lost days resulting from these accidents was 222, equivalent to 0.07% of total days worked. In accordance with the system used by the Mexican Social Security Institute, accidents in the workplace are defined as incidents leading to an injury that requires the staff member in question to miss one or more days of work. The total number of lost days includes all calendar days between the initial accident and the date on which the employee returns to work, even when these days are not working days. The date on which the accident occurs is counted as day one for this purpose. Minor accidents requiring first-aid treatment only are not included in the number of accidents in the workplace. 48 A S U R In the same period, the absentee rate (defined as the total number of days that employees were absent from work due to general, non-work-related illness or when no justification was presented for the absence) corresponded to a total of 759 days, or 0.23% of total days worked. These data refer exclusively to the 934 direct, full-time employees of ASUR as of the 31st of December 2014. At this time, there are no systems in place that require subcontractors, service providers or other parties with employees working at the airport to provide ASUR with accident, injury and absenteeism data. SECTION 7.0 COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPORT 50 A S U R ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 7.0 COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPORT The contribution that ASUR makes towards creating decent living standards for its employees and their families is undoubtedly one of the most important ways in which the company provides support for local communities. The basis for this is the financial success of our business, and we are therefore constantly seeking ways in which we can increase value for both our shareholders and other stakeholders. We are aware that the airports we operate play a significant role in facilitating business for other companies and individuals in the regions where they are located; our airports form a key part of local transport networks, and are therefore important for the promotion of regional economic development. As a matter of policy, ASUR undertakes a series of activities intended to raise the profile of the destinations where we operate. We have a dedicated Route Development team, whose job it is to promote our destinations with the world’s airlines. The goal of this is to bring in more flights to our destinations, and more visitors mean increased revenues for local businesses as well as our airports. We also participate in networking conventions and congresses around the world relating to the airport and tourism industries, often in coordination with the Mexican federal and state tourism authorities and local business groups. A N N U A L R E P O R T 51 In addition to any direct or indirect economic impacts created by our operations, however, we recognise that the success of our business also depends on establishing good relations with our local communities, and on ensuring that our operations are of mutual benefit to both the company and all its stakeholders. To this end, each of our airports provides support at the local level for a wide range of community projects. Our corporate policies also include stated commitments to run our business ethically and to avoid practices that promote corruption or are harmful to fair trade. Sections 7.2 and 7.3 of this report contain more detailed information on ASUR’s community involvement and anticorruption measures. 7.1 Direct Economic Benefits The table below provides a breakdown of the economic value generated, distributed and retained by ASUR in 2014.

These projects are selected and administered by each airport individually, to respond to local needs and to promote a sense of ownership and greater commitment. Support is provided monetarily and in the form of donations of goods and services, as well as volunteering. The total value of cash donations, donations in kind and man hours in 2014 is estimated at approximately $2.6 million pesos. During the period, the projects supported fell under four main categories: public health services, care for people with disabilities, education and culture, and the environment. A N N U A L R E P O R T 53 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 In relation to education, Huatulco Airport was very active in this field during 2014. The airport made a donation to a local rural school of equipment that was being replaced due to a remodelling project, and carried out outreach projects with several local institutions. The various airports in the group continued to organise guided tours of their facilities for local educational establishments. In the field of 7.3 anticorruption Measures culture, Mérida Airport made a donation to the Yucatán Symphonic Orchestra and ASUR has a written Code of Ethics that sets continued to organise art exhibitions in its forth the ethical standards the company terminal building. expects its employees, executives and corporate governance officials to adhere Finally, the airports at Cozumel and to.

Employees are encouraged to use this system to report instances of corruption or abuse, and they may choose to submit reports anonymously or not. In the event that they do confirm their identity, it is guaranteed that they will not be penalised in any way, even if the reports submitted prove to be baseless. 54 A S U R The Internal Auditing Department reports directly to the Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of independent members (that is, people who are not shareholders or executive officers in the company, or their related parties). As well as investigating all reports received via the company’s internal system, the Internal Auditing Department establishes a quarterly programme of audits to be carried out in different business units. The Audit Committee approves the work programme of the Internal Auditing Department and is informed of the results of the audits performed. During 2014, 100% of the company’s employees were provided with training relating to the Code of Ethics. ASUR’s Internal Auditing Department carried out audits in all nine airports in the Group, as well as several of the commercial concession holders operating at the airports. These audits resulted in a total of 11 relevant observations. A total of 34 reports were submitted via the internal reporting system during the year, if which 11 were considered to be of critical importance, 7 were of medium importance and 16 were of minor importance. Of the critical matters that came to the attention of the Internal Auditing Department during the year, most were related to internal procedural concerns and no disciplinary action was taken. In those cases where the investigations carried out by the Internal Auditors detected unethical behaviour by company employees, disciplinary or dismissal proceedings were initiated. SECTION 8.0 COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS 56 A S U R INFORME ANUAL DE SOSTENIBILIDAD 2014 8.0 COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS The goal of ASUR’s management in relation to human rights is to ensure that the company and its employees do not incur any human rights violations, and that in those cases where possible abuses are detected, the corresponding steps should be taken to resolve them quickly, efficiently and transparently. The Internal Auditing Department is entrusted with investigating any potential human rights abuses. The head of this Department reports directly to the Audit Committee, which is ultimately responsible for enforcement of the company’s policies on human rights. Internal campaigns are carried out on at least an annual basis, in which employees are encouraged to use the company’s reporting system to notify the Internal Auditing Department of any rights abuses. ASUR has a written policy in which the company formally sets forth its commitment to upholding and promoting human rights. This policy expressly states that the company will guarantee its employees the right to personal integrity, which means that workers may not be subjected to corporal punishment or verbal abuse of any nature, and that sexual harassment of any kind is strictly forbidden. A N N U A L R E P O R T 57 The policy also represents a statement of the company’s position on gender equality and non-discrimination: it contains a clause that guarantees equal opportunity for all in hirings, promotions, salary levels, training and day-to-day treatment, regardless of ethnicity, nationality, gender, marital status, physical ability, religion, sexual orientation, social circumstances or political affiliation. There were no complaints filed during 2014 in relation to human-rights abuses. The company has assumed the obligation to protect its employees’ right to freedom of association. As mentioned in section 6.1 of this report, the company management and the airport workers’ union adhere to a regular collective bargaining procedure to establish employment conditions and benefits for unionised employees. During 2014, no threats were identified to the freedom of association or collective bargaining rights of the company’s employees. 58 A S U R ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 According to the company’s policy on human rights, ASUR does not use or benefit from forced labour or child labour of any kind. All working agreements are governed by consensual, written employment contracts, and the company’s policy is not to employ anyone who is under 15 years of age. Currently, no one under the age of 18 is employed by ASUR and no situations involving forced labour have been identified. Finally, the company has the obligation to avoid any situations in which it might be complicit in human rights abuses; in practical terms this means that no investments should be made in, or products and services procured from, other companies that incur human-rights violations. During the period, no instances of human rights violations have been identified in the company’s supply chain. During 2014, a consultation was received from a stakeholder concerning the company’s policy and procedure regarding the trafficking of minors. While this particular issue falls under the direct responsibility of the governmental authorities that operate in our airports, specifically the immigration authorities, ASUR is currently assessing the implementation of an internal campaign to raise awareness of this issue among the members of its airport communities. SECTION 9.0 EXTERNAL PROGRAMMES 60 A S U R ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 9.0 EXTERNAL PROGRAMMES 9.1 Sustainability Indices In 2011, ASUR was selected as one of the first group of companies to be part of the Mexico Stock Exchange Sustainability Index. To be considered for inclusion in the index, companies’ practices and procedures in the areas of environment, governance and stakeholder issues are subject to a rigorous evaluation process, with the intention that the index can be used as a responsible-investment guide for ethical investors. As of the 31st of December 2014, ASUR continues to form part of the Mexico Stock Exchange Sustainability Index. In 2014, ASUR was also included for the first time in the New York Stock Exchange’s Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 9.2 United Nations Global Compact The Global Compact is a voluntary initiative established by the United Nations to promote the values of social responsibility and respect for human rights in businesses around the world. ASUR became a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in 2005, and the Chairman of ASUR’s Board of Directors, Fernando Chico Pardo, held a position on the UNGC’s Board of Directors between 2009 and 2012.
