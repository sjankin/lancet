Carlson believes in affording all employees basic human rights as defined in the United Nation Declaration of Human Rights, such as treating them with dignity and respect, providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees, not using workers under the legal age for employment, and protecting children from any type of labor that may be hazardous to their health or interferes with their education. Key human rights issues for the hotel industry include fair wages, women’s rights, ability to join trade unions and collective bargaining.

We work to rid prevalence of such problems, and strengthen local communities by running a responsible operation.

All hotels comply with local laws regarding work hours and payment, and employees are free to join trade unions if they so choose and bargain collectively in accordance with local laws. Our hotels have routines in place to ensure that discrimination due to age, race, religion, gender or disability does not take place and aligns with our Equal Opportunity Policy. 1 Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group Human Rights Policy Statement: Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group acknowledges and respects the principles contained in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, which are consistent with Carlson Rezidor’s core values and commitment to be a force for good.

Signatory of The Code: Carlson has been recognized by the Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism (known as The Code) as a top member for 2015. 3 The Code is an industry-driven, multi-stakeholder initiative with the mission to provide awareness, tools and support to the tourism industry in order to combat the sexual exploitation of children in contexts related to travel and tourism. In 2004 Carlson became the first North American travel and hospitality company to sign the Code of Conduct, which is aimed at protecting children against sexual exploitation in the travel and tourism industry. The Code was signed on behalf of Carlson during a United Nations ceremony at UNICEF headquarters in New York City by then Chairman and CEO Marilyn Carlson Nelson, an ardent supporter and pioneer of this effort. The Code employs the following six criteria which Carlson committed to adhere to as a signatory: 1. To establish a policy and procedures against sexual exploitation of children. 2. To train employees in children’s rights, the prevention of sexual exploitation and how to report suspected cases. 3. To include a clause in contracts throughout the value chain stating a common repudiation and zero tolerance policy of sexual exploitation of children. 4. To provide information to travelers on children’s rights, the prevention of sexual exploitation of children and how to report suspected cases. 5. To support, collaborate and engage stakeholders in the prevention of sexual exploitation of children. 6. To report annually on their implementation of Code related activities. Human Trafficking Awareness Signage in Hotels: Carlson Rezidor is the first company to partner with ECPAT-USA (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes) to promote human trafficking awareness by offering hotels signs, which provide the National Human Trafficking Hotline and BEFREE short code, to be displayed at front desks or lobby areas. Our goal is to raise awareness about the issue of human trafficking, to provide contact information for anyone who might suspect a case of human trafficking and for victims to reach out for life-saving services. The new Carlson Rezidor ECPAT signs have been made available to all Carlson Rezidor hotels in the United States; with plans to expand the program to other countries in 2016. Human Trafficking Awareness Training: To align with Carlson‘s commitment to the protection of children from sexual exploitation and trafficking, Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group has implemented a training module for all hotel employees as part of its larger “Living Responsible Business” training program. The 30-minute “Child Protection” training module is designed to provide employees with a better understanding of how they can positively impact and safeguard children in our communities. Today, Carlson Rezidor’s “Child Protection” training has been fully rolled out globally to all brands. Ongoing training is monitored by an independent auditing consultant. Language in Supplier Contracts: Carlson and Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group use the following language in new and updated contracts: Carlson supports a child’s right to a safe and secure childhood and condemns all forms of commercial sexual exploitation of children. Supplier will use its best efforts to assist in that support by: (1) not knowingly using any form of child or forced labor, including without limitation using subcontractors or suppliers who use child or forced labor; (2) not knowingly engaging in or supporting the business of, or doing business with companies who engage in or support, the commercial exploitation of children; (3) prohibiting the use of 4 all company equipment for the viewing, storage, distribution, promotion or other use of materials, which sexually exploit children and establishing procedures to enforce such policies; and (4) prohibiting the use of images or concepts in its marketing or on its premises which sexually exploit children. Carlson supports the values of human rights, labor standards, the environment and anti-corruption. Supplier will use its best efforts to assist in that support by: (1) affording all employees basic human rights by treating them with dignity and respect, providing a safe and healthy work environment and (2) protecting the communities and environments in which they operate by having effective environmental policies and complying with existing legislation and regulations regarding the protection of the environment. Carlson hosts international diplomats to raise awareness for combating human trafficking: Carlson supports the U.S. State Department’s International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) which focuses on combating the trafficking of persons. Partnering with the Minnesota International Center (MIC), Carlson regularly hosts delegations of IVLP visitors from around the world for several-day visits that:  introduce participants to U.S. policy and strategy to prevent and actively combat trafficking of persons, including prosecution and enforcement against traffickers;  provide a comprehensive overview of the trafficking issue domestically and abroad, and the power of local, national and international cooperation;  share information about initiatives to protect, assist and provide social reintegration of trafficking victims;  demonstrate how representatives from a variety of societal sectors can effectively work together to address this issue, and to encourage similar cooperation among program participants in their work abroad. This unique opportunity to raise awareness and share ideas with potential, future world leaders is a priority for Carlson as it works to eradicate this global problem. Sharing practical examples of the work it has initiated within the hospitality industry, Carlson works to build relationships with these international delegates, providing a framework they can use to foster partnerships with business, government, and nonprofit organizations within their own respective countries.

Other successful examples of responsible sourcing include the following: Our signature World of Radisson service attributes were enhanced with the addition of the nature-inspired Rituals body care line. Rituals products use only natural, renewable and organic ingredients and safe alternatives for anything nature cannot provide. All formulas are biodegradable with no parabens and no animal testing. Product bottles are made from 100 percent recycled plastic and packaging for ancillary items are made with 50 percent recycled content. All packaging is totally recyclable. Radisson Blu® has forged an alliance with British-based This Works® to give its guests natural-based bath amenities. Created exclusively for Radisson Blu hotels, the new products will solidify the brand’s holistic and earth conscious approach to travel by offering a natural indulgence free of harsh chemicals and packaged with recyclable materials. The product mirrors the commitment from Radisson Blu to reduce the carbon footprint. BD Imports, selected as Radisson’s in-room coffee supplier, is an importer of green coffee (un-roasted) from sustainable sources in coffee producing countries and is fully engaged in the fight to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger through its commitment to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, the principals of the UN Global Compact and the work of the International Women’s Coffee Alliance. A fabric, which uses 100 times less water than cotton, made its debut at Radisson hotels in the United States in the form of bed linens made from Tencel+Plus Lyocell. The fabric, produced by Austria’s Lenzing Fibers and sold by Valley Forge, is derived from eucalyptus trees grown in Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) forests which are protected from over-cutting. FSC is an independent, non-governmental not-forprofit organization established to promote responsible management of the world’s forests.

Linen and Towel Reuse Program: Carlson Rezidor hotels have linen and towel reuse program standards in place. A linen and towel reuse program can have a significant impact on the environment, saving 6,000 gallons of water and 40 gallons of detergent monthly at a 150-room property, according to Green Suites Hotel Solutions. These programs also reduce wear-and-tear on linens and towels. Country Inns & Suites By Carlson and Park Inn by Radisson allow hotels to choose to implement an environmentally friendly terry and linen reuse program in the guestrooms. The program enables participating hotels to change linens every third day for stay-over guests, but allows guests to opt out if they prefer to have their linen changed daily. More than 90 percent of these hotels comply with this standard. Radisson hotels must implement the environmentally friendly terry and linen reuse program in the guest rooms. The program enables the hotel to change linens every two days for stay-over guests. Guests opt out, if they prefer to have their linen changed daily. Brand audits show 93 percent of Radisson hotels are participating in the linen and towel reuse program in 2013. Radisson Blu in the Americas has a similar program with 100 percent compliance.

Gifts: (Please note: The following is not applicable to interactions and dealings with government and party officials and political parties. Please see that section of the Code with respect to all such matters.) The Company recognizes that gift-giving (including reasonable and infrequent meals and appropriate entertainment) to non-governmental customers, franchisees, owners or their employees may be appropriate and acceptable under very limited circumstances; that is, if it is in compliance with the policies of your business unit and when giving gifts is an expected and widely recognized cultural norm. In such circumstances a modest gift (other than cash or any cash equivalent) may be provided if, and only if, it is: (i) of less than $100 in value; (ii) legally permissible under local law; (iii) not prohibited under the policies applicable to the recipient; (iv) not provided on an inappropriately frequent basis; and (v) provided solely for the purpose of building generalized goodwill and not for the purpose or with the expectation of receiving 15 anything in return. Anyone wishing to provide a gift should obtain advance confirmation from the recipient that doing so would not violate the policies under which the recipient operates, or any applicable law, and ensure that doing so complies with all policies adopted by your business unit. Reasonable and infrequent meals and entertainment provided in connection with general business promotional activities or the performance of an existing contract are also permissible. However, nothing specific can ever be expected in return. When evaluating the reasonableness of the expense, the frequency with which meals and entertainment are provided for a particular person must be taken into account, as modest goodwill offerings, frequently provided, can become lavish and improper over time.
