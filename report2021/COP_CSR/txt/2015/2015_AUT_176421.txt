The January 2015 version of the Code is currently applicable. In addition to the mandatory “L rules” (legal reBusiness transactions with associated companies quirements), voestalpine AG voluntarily complies or parties are reported on in the quarterly reports with all of the “C rules” (comply or explain) and and in the Annual Report of voestalpine AG. the “R rules” (recommendation) of the Code. Research and development Research and development (R&D) is a core element of voestalpine’s sustainable business strategy. The Group’s R&D activities focus on solutions in the areas of energy efficiency, mobility, cost reduction, and raw materials efficiency. Innovations are necessary for a technology-driven company such as voestalpine, in order to develop new products and production processes that will enable it to differentiate itself from the competition and survive on the market long-term. Innovations ensure the survival of our company. 7 Research expenses in the voestalpine Group Research expenditure has risen continuously in recent years, with the decline in BY 2014/15 being the consequence of company divestments.

The newly developed AHSS HD – Advanced High Strength Steels with High Ductility – have significantly improved forming properties. They are consequently much stronger in the cold-forming process, so that components can be lighter and simultaneously improve safety. These steels are used in all automotive body parts relevant to vehicle safety. 9 Ecology Active environmental protection and conservation of finite resources are core elements of voestalpine corporate philosophy. Within the organization, voestalpine endeavors to create the necessary prerequisites for continuous improvements in the area of environmental protection, and has defined the following principles in this regard: Comprehensive responsibility for all products Optimization of production processes Implementation of environmental management systems Employee involvement Open and objective dialogue Environmental management and performance. The certified companies undergo a Group-wide knowledge transfer comprehensive environmental assessment within the scope of an annual audit by independent, exIndividual environmental policies based on ternal environmental experts.
