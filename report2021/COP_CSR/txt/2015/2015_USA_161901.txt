7/23/2015 GRI Index GE Sustainability GRI Index GE’s reporting on its 2014 sustainability program was informed by the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (“The G4 Guidelines”). We anticipate reporting relevant G4 metrics going forward. Part I: Reporting In compiling the content for GE’s Sustainability Report, GE applied the Reporting Principles for Defining Content—see our Reporting http://www.gesustainability.com/2014­performance/gri­index/ 1/26 7/23/2015 GRI Index Process—and the Reporting Principles for Defining Quality: Balance—provides both favorable and unfavorable results and covers a range of controversial issues relating to the application or misuse of GE products and services. Comparability—provides year-over-year metrics (less only when the information is not available) and includes a GRI Index. Timeliness—publishes reports at the same time every year, with updates to the website as new issues arise. Clarity—provides various formats for reporting to our stakeholders on GE activities, through the GE Sustainability website, which details our ongoing programs in these areas, as well as our long-term goals and annual performance metrics. Accuracy and Reliability—GE’s Finance Organization has reviewed the metrics and claims made in the 2014 report. The report has been reviewed and approved by GE senior management responsible for their subject matter area. Additionally, our Advisory Panel offers year-by-year commentary and guidance on GE’s reporting.
