I would moreover like to highlight the publication during 2013 of our first Code of Ethics at Velatia level, which embodies our business philosophy linked to our vision and business strategy, providing guidance on the values and ethical behaviour that should govern the way we work. Also we have reviewed all commitments taken on and reflected in the various Policies that have been updated and communicated. I would like to draw your attention among to them to the “Anti-Corruption Policy” that ensures compliance with anti-corruption and bribery laws as well as the “Social Action Policy” 1 for contributing to the development of each country where Velatia operates and/or maintains trade relations, driving innovation for a better quality of life of that country and creating value for the company. Also, in 2014 we worked to develop the master plan on corporate social responsibility from 2014 to 2016, in order to integrate social and environmental aspects at strategic and operational level in Velatia and to deepen the implementation of our ongoing commitment with the United Nations. These two years have been difficult as far as economic performance is concerned, but this has not meant that we have not held fast to our ethical convictions, our values and the essence of our management: focus on the customer, effort in innovation, commitment to multicultural teams and strategic discipline, the satisfaction of our people and strong commitment to the development of the countries in which we operate. With the course already set for 2015, it is time to move towards recovery, without losing our genetic makeup. We are Velatia.

On the other hand in terms of inert and urban assimilated waste, in Deridelpol we had a 59.22% decrease in the generation of waste wood in 2014 compared to 2013 and a decrease of 63.76% in the generation of waste paper and cardboard. In connection with the generation of hazardous waste, Deridelpol decreased by 86.03% in waste generation of ultrasonic bath liquid in 2014, compared to 2013. In Aislantes Sólidos, regarding hazardous waste, in 2014 we have had a decrease of 79.32% in the generation of sludge resin and a 23.77% decrease in the generation of material contaminated with hydrocarbons, and in turn a decrease of 40.95% in the generation of ultrasonic bath liquid, all in 2013. It is noteworthy that in 2014 we made a very important modification in the cleaning room in Aislantes Sólidos, where cleaning of the mixer and the pressure pots is carried out. We have managed to reduce the amount of waste resin sludge generated by 79.32% in 2014, compared to 2013. We have also achieved a very significant visual effect, from being a dirty, untidy place to being a clean area with a pleasant appearance and a lay out panel included, where we can see each of the steps in the cleaning process.

OUR COMMITMENT TO... 63 Cultural Area The Bilbao Choral Society was set up in the late nineteenth century to promote knowledge and dissemination of music in general and choral music in particular. This same purpose led the choral society in the 21st century to continue working with this lovely institution for the heritage of Bilbao and Bizkaia and for whoever enjoys music. In Velatia, this year 2012, we have shared this spirit by supporting the choir in its taste for group singing, combining voices and twinning feelings in a common effort to reach out to other people by transmitting beauty and emotions. OUR MAIN COLLABORATIONS In 2001, we signed a collaboration agreement with the university Engineering School of Bilbao to create a Company-Run Seminar Room in the faculty. With this collaboration, Velatia aims to: 1. Recruit prospective students after the training course, and develop projects in areas of interest to Velatia. 3 • Moreover, from 2001 to 2014, a total of 14 students who have completed 74 projects in the seminar room have joined the company. 2. Disseminate the image of Velatia in the School by explaining the company to the students of the Engineering School and increasing the prestige of Velatia within it as a benchmark company in the technology area. Regarding this second objective, during these two years we have carried out various communication activities directly related to the Seminar Room: • Participation in the presentation conferences for company-run seminar rooms of the School. • Participation in the newsletter of the School, reporting on progress and projects developed in the seminar room itself. The Ormazabal Class of the Polytechnic School of the University of Mondragon was opened in 2007 and specialises in power electronics, protection and automation, and communications for the medium voltage network, training final year engineers in disciplines of interest to the company through the use of projects. The work done by the students is led by the lecturers, and the tutors who are appointed by the company for each project, are the ones who oversee their work in the classroom. 64 OUR COMMITMENT TO...
