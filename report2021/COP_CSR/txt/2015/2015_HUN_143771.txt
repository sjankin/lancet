As a result, total Croatian oil and condensate production for the period, and inventory accumulated during 2012 were transferred to the Downstream (Sisak refinery). Negative impacts were partially offset by the stronger USD against HUF, and by a higher level of payments in Egypt in December 2014.

The main reasons behind this production drop were the divestures of Russian fields (ZMB and 49% of BaiTex LLC together totalling 6.3 mboepd), just partially compensated by the first contributions from the UK North Sea acquisition. Excluding these factors, production was close to the base level as a natural decline in the CEE region was partly offset by higher production in the MEA region, mainly from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

The termination of crude processing activities adversely impacted volumes sold in Italy in a year-on-year comparison. Downstream outlook Slightly easing fundamentals in the With a conservative approach, our expectation for the 2015 environment is similar to that of mid-term 2014. While the lower crude price environment is lending support through lower processing costs, this effect is limited as European refinery capacity overhang will persist, capping any sudden surge in margins. Global surplus of refinery capacity may even increase as new deep conversion refineries are starting up in the Middle East, India and Brazil. Due to sluggish global demand, margins may be under pressure in 2015. 67 Management Discussion and Analysis In the mid-term however, we assume there will be closure of marginal assets in Europe and a valid from 1 July 2014, as well as lower capacity bookings and lower turnover fee revenues in line revival of economic performance leading to healthier demand growth on a global level. Therefore, with decreasing domestic natural gas consumption, and further decreases in public utility charges the margin environment may improve overall in Europe in the mid-term. as of 1 November 2013. Following years of decline, motor fuel demand is expected to stabilise in the CEE region. On the back of economic growth, an increase in motor fuel demand may again be largely driven by diesel in Despite lower tariffs for household customers and due to decreased industrial demand, domestic 2015, meaning that the gap between motor gasoline and diesel sales will increase further regionally. natural gas consumption showed a further decrease compared to the previous year but the significantly higher volumes injected to storage compensated this negative effect.

MOL Group has developed a risk management function as an integral part of its corporate governance structure. A comprehensive and dynamic system that incorporates a broad range of risks is prepared by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) at group level. ERM integrates financial and operational risks along with a wide range of strategic risks, as well as compliance issues and potential reputational effects. The ERM process identifies the most significant and material risks to the performance of the company. Risks are assessed based on a unified methodology and collected into risk maps at different levels. Risk responses and controls are reviewed, while mitigation actions are established and reviewed for completion by top management on a regular basis. Enterprise Risk Management is a framework covering Business Units and Functional Units, which ensures incorporation of risks faced by the company into Risk Maps. Risk analysis activity supports stable and efficient operations by identifying key risks that threaten the achievement of the company’s objectives and require specific attention by the top management through the strengthening of controls, the execution of mitigation actions or a combination of the two. The Risk Map is a heat map that is graphically presents major risks on a matrix using probability and impact ratings, both being the result of detailed risk assessment processes. The Risk Maps integrate Strategic, Operational and Financial risks, which are identified and reassessed on a quarterly basis, providing regular updates to top management on the evolution of risks and the status of mitigation actions. To ensure the profitability and financial stability of the Group, Financial Risk Management is in place to handle short-term, market-related risks. Commodity price, FX and interest rate risks are measured by using a complex model based on Monte Carlo simulation, and are managed – if considered necessary with risk mitigation tools such as swaps, forwards and options. Business Continuity Management is the process of preparing for unexpected disruptions that have low probability but high impact. Emergency Response plans, Crisis Management procedures, Disaster Recovery and other risk control programmes are crucial in a business where operational risk exposure is significant, as a result of the chemical and physical processes underlying most of the Group’s operations. Transfer of excess operational risks is carried out by Insurance Management. Purchase of insurance represents an important risk mitigation tool used to cover the most relevant operational and liability exposures. The major insurance types are: Property Damage, Business Interruption, Liability and Control of Well Insurance. These are set around a yearly cycle (i.e. annual renewal of most insurance policies). Insurance is managed through a joint programme for the whole of MOL Group, in order to exploit considerable synergy effects. The existence of an integrated risk management function enables MOL Group to exploit the synergies between the above detailed pillars of risk management. The input sources of modelling financial risks are also applied in ERM. Similarly, the accumulated information on operational risks gained through managing insurance is also an important factor in the development of ERM. The results of ERM on operational risks (including business continuity management) can provide a clearer direction to insurance management by highlighting areas that must be covered by insurance, and where further analysis is required to make decisions on how to manage the associated risks. Besides providing information on the most imperative risks that MOL Group faces, Risk Management also supports top management and the Board of Directors in optimizing investment decision-making, taking into consideration the risk profile of each project. For this purpose, Group Risk Management is involved in the evaluation of major projects through the utilisation of its ERM capabilities by providing its opinion on capital allocation and financing headroom. 77 Management Discussion and Analysis MOL GROUP FY 2013 FY 2014 Appendix EBITDA EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS 494,226 410,221 UPSTREAM 10,507 15,403 APPENDIX I Gain on divestiture of Russian companies 10,507 12,679 IMPACT OF SPECIAL ITEMS ON OPERATING PROFIT AND EBITDA (in HUF mn) Impairment on INA Syrian assets (non-current and current) (1,997) Disputed gas price differential 6,436 MOL GROUP FY 2013 FY 2014 INA provision for redundancy (1,715) OPERATING PROFIT EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS 148,463 109,069 DOWNSTREAM (26,087) (15,283) UPSTREAM (32,858) (35,026) Gain on sale of surplus state reserves in Slovnaft Polska 3,420 Gain on divestiture of Russian companies 10,507 12,679 Tax penalty imposed on INA (5,005) (9,095) Impairment on INA Syrian assets (non-current and current) (43,365) (52,426) SN CAPEX reclassification (1,665) Disputed gas price differential 6,436 IES scrapping (3,324) INA provision for redundancy (1,715) IES provision for dismantling, restructuring (10,255) (4,145) DOWNSTREAM (176,645) (31,273) IES provision for redundancy (9,258) Impairment on INA's refinery assets (26,745) (15,990) Compensation for damages to CMEPS s.r.o.
