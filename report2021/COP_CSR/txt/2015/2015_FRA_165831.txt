Such events could have 18 2014 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT RISK FACTORS 4.3 Industrial and environmental risk 04 4.3.1. NUCLEAR RISK 4.3.1.1. RISK OF NUCLEAR ORIGIN The results recorded (see Section 17. Human resources) testify to the eﬀectiveness of these practices and the good level of radiation protection control in the group. Risks of nuclear origin are linked to the characteristics of radioactive substances. These risks thus concern all of the group’s industrial facilities in which these Criticality substances are found, whether regulated nuclear facility, regulated defense nuclear facility, environmentally regulated facility or mining operations. The risk of a criticality accident corresponds to the risk of an uncontrolled chain reaction with a brief and intense emission of neutrons, accompanied by radiation. Risk prevention is based on a systemic and systematic analysis of the risks speciﬁc This risk, should it materialize, would result in irradiation of workers or individuals to each facility or activity undertaken and on the deﬁnition of the means to prevent located near the event, causing lesions proportional in seriousness to the intensity events of concern and to detect and manage incidents and accidents and limit their of the radiation received. This risk is addressed in any facility likely to receive ﬁssile potential consequences, based on defense-in-depth principles. These principles materials. consist of systematically analyzing potential technical, human or organizational failures, and of deﬁning and implementing a series of independent lines of defense The prevention of this risk is based on limiting the factors leading to uncontrolled to protect against the consequences of those failures. chain reactions. This limitation is factored into the design (e.g. equipment geometry) or in operating requirements, mass limitations, etc. In areas of facilities most exposed These principles are implemented in the facility design phase, during the industrial to risk, prevention measures are strengthened with the use of shielding which production phase, and during cleanup and dismantling after the end of production strongly reduces the consequences of a potential criticality incident for personnel, operations. and with the installation of a criticality accident detection, alarm and measurement system. Dissemination of radioactive materials that can lead to contamination For transportation, nuclear safety and criticality are veriﬁed under both normal and accidental operating conditions. Transportation regulations set forth rules for storage Uncontained radioactive materials (solid, liquid or gaseous) may disperse and lead during transit, particularly in terms of the criticality risk. to human and environmental contamination if they are insuﬃciently contained. Controlling this risk consists above all of limiting the dispersion of those substances Thermal releases and radiolysis from the facilities under all operating conditions (normal or accidental), as well as after shutdown, in particular by interposing suitable containment barriers and Matter absorbs the energy produced by intense radiation, which can lead to ventilation systems. temperature increase. The energy is removed to control the temperature rise and prevent the dispersion of radioactive materials. Cooling is provided by redundant Radiation cooling systems with heat exchangers and ventilation systems. Whenever a person works in the presence of radioactive materials, there is a risk Radiolysis corresponds to the decomposition of a hydrogenated compound of exposure to radiation. (especially water) when exposed to radiation, leading to the release of hydrogen. In normal operations, the facilities are designed to limit hydrogen concentrations The estimated biological impacts of radiation on the human body are generally by ﬂushing the equipment with air. A backup system is added if a loss of normal expressed in millisieverts (mSv). The regulatory annual dose limits are as follows: ﬂushing capacity can cause concentrations to rise to the limit value in a few hours p in the European Union, 1 mSv per year for the general public above naturally or tens of hours. occurring radioactivity, and 100 mSv over ﬁve consecutive years for employees, not to exceed 50 mSv in any one year; 4.3.1.2.

The design of the shipping cask is the main component of this system. As with any nuclear activity, these operations are governed by stringent Earthquake international regulations. Earthquakes and their possible repercussions, such as a tsunami, can cause If the materials transported exceed a certain level of activity set by regulation, the damage that could disable nuclear safety systems. cask must, under normal and accidental operating conditions, provide: For facilities in which nuclear materials are handled, the risk of an earthquake is p the containment of the materials; factored into the design of equipment, systems and buildings.

Airplane crash The related requirements cover cask design, fabrication, operation and maintenance. This risk concerns the crash of an airplane, or part of an airplane, on a facility. Its probability of occurrence depends on the number of aircraft that could reach the site without being detected, and its potential severity depends on the type of aircraft and the surface of sensitive areas in each facility. Each site is located: p away from controlled airspace; p away from airspace used by military aircraft; and p far from any airport.

AREVA is dedicated to improving the formal conditions for subcontracting and Nuclear safety is an absolute priority for AREVA. The group formalized its monitoring subcontracted work. This includes applying internal guidelines for commitments in the ﬁelds of nuclear safety and radiation protection in a Nuclear compliance with nuclear safety, radiation protection and environmental protection Safety Charter (available on the group’s website under “Media Center”), which aims requirements as part of the procurement process. It also includes the deﬁnition of to ensure a very high level of nuclear safety throughout the operation of its facilities a social certiﬁcation for service providers based on the criteria of nuclear safety, and its services activities. The Charter is founded on the principles hereunder. occupational safety, training, professionalization and employee satisfaction. Organizational principles Reporting system The executive management of AREVA and each of its subsidiaries set up an AREVA endeavors to provide reliable and relevant information enabling an organization reﬂecting the legal provisions of the country in question based on the objective assessment of the status of nuclear safety in its facilities.

Natural uranium and conversion and enrichment prices AND CONVERSION have ﬂuctuated in the past, and depend on factors that are beyond AREVA’s control. These factors include demand for nuclear power; economic and political conditions Fluctuations in the prices of uranium, uranium conversion and uranium enrichment in countries that produce or consume uranium, including Canada, the United States, could have a signiﬁcant negative or positive impact on the ﬁnancial position of the Russia, other CIS republics, Australia, and some African countries; nuclear materials group’s mining, enrichment and conversion operations. and used fuel treatment; and sales of surplus civilian and defense inventories. Although the group operates mostly as a provider of processing services for If the prices for natural uranium, conversion and enrichment were to remain below uranium, of which the customers are generally owners, it remains exposed to price production costs over a prolonged period, this could have a negative impact on the risk for uranium in its mining operations and to price risk for uranium conversion group’s mining operations and uranium conversion and enrichment operations. 4.7.

Several combinations have been tested, our society’s challenges, which may be summed up as the need to continue but only a few of them have gone beyond the prototype stage to commercial to produce and consume energy without threatening the climate. If the share operation. of fossil fuels in the global energy mix is to be reduced from its current level of more than 80%, low-carbon energy sources that do not aﬀect the climate A heat source and a cooling source must be developed, including nuclear power, capable of producing massive Like all other thermal power plants, a nuclear power plant has a heat source quantities of electricity on demand, and renewable energies. (the nuclear steam supply system with its fuel core and heat exchangers) and Using ﬁssion energy in nuclear power plants a cooling source designed to condense steam after it has passed through the turbine. That is why power plants are usually built near the sea or a river A nuclear power plant is an electric generating station with one or more – the water is used to cool the steam. Some power plants are also equipped reactors.

A “nuclear steam supply system” is the combination of equipment During the ﬁssion process, neutrons are released at very high speed. As used to produce steam from ﬁssion energy. A “nuclear island” is the system they strike light atoms (hydrogen contained in water) and slow down, they encompassing the nuclear steam supply system and the fuel-related facilities, react much more with the uranium-235 atoms. Reactors called “thermal as well as the equipment required for the system’s operation and safety. A neutron” or “slow” reactors take advantage of this property, reducing the level “conventional island” consists of the alternating current turbogenerator of uranium-235 enrichment required to sustain the chain reaction. In water coupled to the nuclear island, along with the equipment required for its reactors, the water is used as a moderator, i.e. to slow the neutrons released operation. A nuclear power plant thus consists primarily of a nuclear island by nuclear ﬁssion, but it also serves as a coolant, i.e. the ﬂuid that circulates and a conventional island. The reactor is enclosed in a reinforced containment in the reactor core to extract heat. 2014 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT 35 06 BUSINESS OVERVIEW The world’s most prevalent reactor: the pressurized BOILING WATER REACTOR water reactor In light water reactors, the fuel is low-enriched uranium.

In this respect, the diﬀerence is that the water boils when it comes into contact with the fuel and technologies and services oﬀered by AREVA in nuclear power and renewable the primary and secondary cooling systems are not separate. This causes the energies complement each other. water to vaporize at the top of the vessel containing the core. The heat from the core is released to the water ﬂowing through it. The resulting steam drives the turbine, then cools when it comes into contact with the cold source and returns to liquid form in the condenser before it is recirculated to the reactor vessel. Thus, in a BWR, the water is in a closed cycle in which the steam produced in the reactor core expands directly into the turbine. 36 2014 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT BUSINESS OVERVIEW 6.1 Markets for nuclear power and renewable energies 06 6.1.

As a result, whereas 399 reactors had been built United States and in the early 1970s in Europe. In the 1970s, with fears of fossil fuel over the 1970 to 1990 period, installed capacity rose by only 18.1% over the 1990 shortages rising (oil shock), several countries decided to reduce their dependency to 2014 period. As the vast programs initiated in North America and Western Europe on imported energy by launching nuclear power programs. The 1970s and 1980s subsided, the growth of the reactor ﬂeet picked up in Eastern Europe and Asia. This saw a sharp rise in nuclear power programs, as shown below.

Production began in 2013. In 2012, AREVA Med entered into a strategic alliance with Roche, a pharmaceuticals laboratory, to create a new advanced platform for alpha radio-immunotherapy. The alliance is currently focusing on the treatment of the most aggressive cancers, for which the medical requirements are still far from being met. As part of their partnership, Roche and AREVA Med built a joint research laboratory called ARCoLab (AREVA Med Roche Common Laboratory) in the Limousin region of France, which began operating in 2013. In 2012, AREVA Med also began the ﬁrst Phase 1 clinical trial with lead-212, targeting intra-abdominal HER-2 expressing cancers (such as ovarian cancer or pancreatic cancer). The preliminary results of the trail were published in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine in October 2014.

STATUTORY AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS This is a free translation into English of the statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements issued in the French language and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. The statutory auditors’ report includes information speciﬁcally required by French law in such reports, whether modiﬁed or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and includes explanatory paragraphs discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain signiﬁcant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were made for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. This report also includes information relating to the speciﬁc veriﬁcation of information given in the management report. This report should be read in conjunction with, and is construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your annual General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31st, 2014 on: p the audit of the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements of AREVA; p the justiﬁcation of our assessments; p the speciﬁc veriﬁcation required by law. These consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been approved by the Board of directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. I. OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the ﬁnancial position of the Group as at December 31st, 2014 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the following matters set out in the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements: p Note 1.1.1 describes the circumstances that led the Group to revise its strategic outlook, and therefore to review the recoverable value of some current and non-current assets impaired for a total of € 2.6 billion and to record aﬀectional charges and provisions on some contracts; p Note 24 describes the reasons that led AREVA to apply paragraph 32 of IAS 11 as from the second half of 2013 and the methods of recognition applicable to the OL3 contract. In addition, this note speciﬁes the conditions of completion of this contract and the sensitivity of the income at completion to legal risks, as well as to the operational conditions for the end of construction and testing until the reactor is put into service; p Notes 1.2.5 and 9 describe the treatment and impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the discontinued operations (wind power, solar energy and energy storage activities); p Notes 1.18 and 13 describe the procedures for measuring the provisions for end-of-lifecycle operations, and their sensitivity to the assumptions used in terms of technical processes, costs, disbursement schedules and inﬂation and discount rates. p Note 1 relates to the new standards and particularly to the IFRS 11 standard regarding the “Joint Arrangements” whose impact on the 2013’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements is described in the note 37 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 170 2014 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 20.1 Consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 20 II. JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: As indicated in the note 1.1.2, AREVA’s Executive Management has been led to make estimates and assumptions that impact some ﬁgures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the related notes. Due to the fact that these assumptions are uncertain by nature, notably in the context described in the Note 1.1.1, the achievement could diﬀer from the current estimates. We deemed that among the accounts subject to signiﬁcant accounting estimations and likely to need a justiﬁcation of our assessment, include the following items: p Goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment have been tested for impairment according to the principles and assumptions described in Notes 1.10, 10, 11 and 12 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We examined the methods used to perform these tests, and assessed the consistency of the assumptions adopted with the Group forecast data, and the approach used to estimate the fair value of some mining assets. We also veriﬁed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements; p The deferred tax assets have been analyzed according to the principles described in Notes 1.23 and 8 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We examined the modalities of this analysis, and assessed the consistency of the assumptions used for the valuation of these deferred tax assets with the Group forecast. We also veriﬁed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. p AREVA recognizes the proﬁt or loss on long-term contracts according to the methods described in Notes 1.8 and 24 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We assessed the data and assumptions on which the estimated income at completion and changes therein are based. We examined the procedures for management’s approval of these estimates and reviewed the calculations made; p Provisions for end-of-lifecycle operations have been measured according to the methods described in Note 1.18 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We reviewed the implementation of these methods, the assumptions used and the cost estimates obtained. Oﬀ-setting these provisions, AREVA recognizes ﬁnancial assets to cover the end-of-lifecycle operations, which include a dedicated portfolio composed of directly held shares and units of equity and bond mutual funds. The portfolio management objectives and measurement principles are described in Notes 13, 1.13.1 and 1.13.3 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We assessed the appropriateness of the methods used and the measurement of the provisions for impairment of the ﬁnancial assets; p The accounting principles relating to employee beneﬁts are described in Notes 1.16 and 23 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We assessed the appropriateness of the methods used and reviewed the measurement of the hedging assets at market value; p We examined the existing procedures for the identiﬁcation, evaluation and presentation in the accounts of AREVA’s risks, litigation and contingent liabilities. We also veriﬁed that the main disputes identiﬁed during the implementation of these procedures are described appropriately in the ﬁnancial statements and particularly in the Notes 24 and 34 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements; p In the frame of our assessment of the going concern assumption, we examined the Group liquidity detailed in Note 31 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We have been informed of the cash ﬂow forecasts, the debt schedules, the current credit lines and the related covenants. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the ﬁrst part of this report. III. SPECIFIC VERIFICATION As required by law we have also veriﬁed in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information presented in the Group’s management report. With the exception of the matters described in the ﬁrst part of this report, we have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and includes explanatory paragraphs discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain signiﬁcant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were made for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. This report also includes information relating to the speciﬁc veriﬁcation of information given in the management report. This report should be read in conjunction with, and is construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2014, on: p The audit of the accompanying ﬁnancial statements of AREVA; p The justiﬁcation of our assessments; p The speciﬁc veriﬁcations and information required by law. These ﬁnancial statements have been approved by the Board of directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. I. OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the ﬁnancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2014 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matter set out in Note 1.1 to the ﬁnancial statements, regarding the circumstances in which the company was led to review some of its equity associates’ and loans to equity associates’ recoverable values. II. JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS Accounting estimates contributing to the production of the ﬁnancial statements have been made under the terms described in Note 1.1 to the ﬁnancial statements. Within this framework, and in accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: p Participating interests were valued in accordance with the accounting methods described in Note 2.2 to the ﬁnancial statements entitled “Accounting policies, rules and methods – Long-term investments”. As part of our audit, we reviewed the procedures for executing the valuation of those long-term investments and assessed the consistency of the underlying assumptions with the forecasted data of these entities concerned. We also veriﬁed the appropriateness of the abovementioned information provided in the notes of the ﬁnancial statements. p With respect to risks, litigations and contingent liabilities, we examined the existing procedures in your Company to identify, assess and record such risks, litigations and contingent liabilities in the accounts. We also ascertained that the main litigations identiﬁed through the procedures implemented by your Company are described appropriately in the ﬁnancial statements and speciﬁcally in Note 6.8. 2014 AREVA REFERENCE DOCUMENT 261 20 FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 20.3 2014 ﬁnancial statements p In the frame of our assessment on the going concern assumption, we examined the Group liquidity detailed in Note 6.4 to the ﬁnancial statements. We have been informed of the cash ﬂow forecasts, the debt schedules, the current credit lines as well as the related covenants. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the ﬁrst part of this report. III. SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS AND INFORMATION REQUIRED BY LAW We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the speciﬁc veriﬁcations required by French law. We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the ﬁnancial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of directors and in the documents addressed to shareholders with respect to the ﬁnancial position and the ﬁnancial statements. Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to remunerations and beneﬁts received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have veriﬁed its consistency with the ﬁnancial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these ﬁnancial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from companies controlling your company or controlled by it. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. In accordance with French law, we have veriﬁed that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.
