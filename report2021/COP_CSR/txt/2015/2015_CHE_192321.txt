In future Kaba will carry out regular supplier audits and regular supplier visits to monitor compliance.  By the end of the last fiscal year 351 suppliers signed up to the Code, which is around  SR 67 % of the total. Though it wasn’t possible to reach the target of all “A” suppliers by the 2014/2015, end of the 2014/2015 financial year, Kaba is confident of achieving this soon. page 9  In 2015 Kaba has announced and closed the merger with Dorma Holding GmbH + Co.

As a technology orientated  SR company we are particularly delighted by the – at 44 % – high percentage of women 2014/2015, working for Kaba. Of the 8 members of the Board of Directors, one (12.5%) is female. The age structure adheres to the classical bell curve: around 60 % of all employees are page 12 to 13 between 30 and 50 years old.  Furthermore Kaba does everything it can to ensure that its employees work in an environment free of all forms of discrimination, harassment, intimidation or coercion relating directly or indirectly to race, color, religion, disability, sex, sexual orientation, age or national origin. Harassment is considered a serious act of misconduct and may lead to disciplinary action up to and including immediate dismissal. The term “harassment“ includes sexual, racial, ethnic and other forms of harassment, including harassment based upon disability.  Kaba prohibits all forms of harassment of its employees by Executive Committee  LA 11 members, managers and other employees, including supervisors and other members of management.

Employees will not suffer adverse consequences as a result of reporting in good faith any act of discrimination, especially harassment, including sexual harassment page 3 of 4  In 2014/2015 no cases of discrimination have been registered, nor actions taken.  HR 4 Environmental Principles  Electricity and fuel usage play a crucial role in Kaba’s operations. Many of the Principle 7: components used in its end-products are manufactured in-house, in addition to onsite  EN 3 Businesses production of commodities such as nickel silver. Further processing may also be  EN 4 should support a required for other bought-in parts. This has significant impacts on the resulting energy demands of its manufacturing processes: Electricity and fuels account for over 90% of  EN 16 precautionary Kaba’s total energy requirements. Compared to 2013/2014, the total energy consumption increased by nearly 6% to 112,000 MWh in 2014/2015. This was mainly  SR approach to attributed to a significant increase in brass key sales at the Rocky Mount site in the U.S. 2014/2015, environmental In addition, Kaba reintroduced in-house nickel silver production at this site, which was challenges previously outsourced. While process efficiency improved, this increased production led page 12 to greater consumption of electricity and natural gas. However, at the same site, energy savings in the amount of approximately 1,200 MWh were achieved in 2014/2015. With regard to the 16 production sites covered by Kaba’s Sustainability Report 2014/2015 more than 1,400 MWh were saved in 2014/2015 in terms of electricity and heating fuel thanks to energy savings measures, which were defined for a majority of the production sites and which were partly already implemented in FY 2014/2015.  Electricity consumption at Kaba’s production sites remains the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, followed by heating and motor fuel consumption. Compared to 2013/2014, these emissions increased by almost 4% to around 46,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalents (tCO2e). As a result of business growth and changing production conditions in the U.S., there was no reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms. However, the energy-saving measures implemented since 2014/2015 led to a  EN 18 reduction of CO2 emissions by approximately 700 tCO2e—nearly 2% of total emissions.  The total annual savings potential of all energy savings measures is around 2,800 MWh  SR (1200 tCO2e). This corresponds to about 2.5% of the current total energy consumption or greenhouse gas emission. 2014/2015, page 14 to 15  There were no significant monetary fines as well as non-monetary sanctions for  EN 28 noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations in FY 2014/2015.  Energy reduction measures have been defined for a majority of the production sites. Principle 8:  EN 5, 18 Several of these initiatives were undertaken during the last financial year. In 2014/2015, undertake more than 1,400 MWh were saved in terms of electricity and heating fuel, and 700  SR initiatives to tCO2e of greenhouse gas emissions were avoided. The following activities had the 2014/2015, greatest impact on reducing electricity consumption as well as fuel requirements: promote greater pages 5 to 7, Reduction of hydraulic oil pumps in brass environmental processing 14 to 15 responsibility Closure of leaks in the compressed air system Switching to LED lighting Optimization of heating and ventilation systems Heat recovery (e.g., in compressors or ovens)  EN 8, 21  The water consumption slightly declined in the year under review. The majority of water consumed comes from municipal water supplies and is primarily used for cooling and  EN 22 sanitary purposes before being discharged, mainly via the respective municipal sewerage systems. About 24 % of the resultant waste was recycled in 2014/2015. Here too Kaba aims to reduce the environmental impact further by way of company-wide improvement measures. page 4 of 4 Principle 9:  Kaba proactively strives to mitigate impacts of products and services.

All GRI indicators mentioned refer to the Kaba Sustainability Report 2014/2015, GRI Index table. The Kaba Sustainability Report covers the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015, in line with the financial year 2014/2015. Merger of Dorma and Kaba In April 2015, the Kaba Group and Dorma Group, based in Ennepetal (Germany), have announced that they intend to merge their businesses. The responsible competition authorities have unconditionally approved the planned merger of Dorma and Kaba, and the merger was completed on 1 September 2015. As the period covered by the Kaba Group GRI Sustainability Report is 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015, the Dorma sustainability activities are not covered in this reporting. The same applies to this Communication on Progress which also covers the period of 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. Together, dorma+kaba will be one of the top 3 global companies in the market for security and access solutions, with pro-forma sales of over CHF 2 billion, and around 16,000 employees. The dorma+kaba Group will continue to be committed to a sustainable development of its business.
