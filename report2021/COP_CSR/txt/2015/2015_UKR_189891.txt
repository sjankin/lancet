I hereby present you the seventh non-financial report on sustainable development of Obolon Сorporation. This document is prepared based on the records of corporate structures (except for Sevastopil plant located at the occupied territory of the AR Crimea) during 2014. During this period the company continued the communication of the previous GRI Report version 4. The reporting year became a year of changes and challenges for each of us. Unstable macroenvironment, the fervor of the military conflict and loss of certain territories impacted both on the activities of the corporation and approaches to our responsibilities. As the largest Ukrainian manufacturer, Obolon did not stand aside the crucial events in the country. We continue to invest in the national economy, people, environment, culture and sports. From the beginning its work on the Ukrainian market, Obolon clearly set its social priorities. They remain unchanged to this day. The corporation cares about its staff, is thoughtful regarding the environment, supports local communities and develops culture and sports in Ukraine. However, events which occurred in the country over the last year have shifted the social accents in the work of the company. We have reconsidered communications with key stakeholders, having enhanced the dialogue with the state, law enforcement structures and volunteer organisations. In spite of the difficult situation in Ukraine and the unstable macroeconomic environment, sustained development is key to a common future. We continue building relations of trust and mutual understanding with all stakeholder groups. And these steps are reciprocated. For 35 years of operation, Obolon remains a responsible employer, reliable partner and transparent market player. Time has not broken us but only prepared us for further events and challenges. And I know that we will make it. Today Obolon presents the seventh Social Progress Report of the Corporation. The number seven is seen as a starting point for success and extraordinary luck. I hope that with joint efforts of business, the state and society Ukraine will become a strong and independent European country.
