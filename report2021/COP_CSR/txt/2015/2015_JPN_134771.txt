Expansion of an integrated forestry business that enhances the value of forest resources One of the pillars of the Oji Group’s Resource Recycling Business Model is promotion of the “Sustainable Forest Management”. In order to carry this out, it has become increasingly important to enhance the value of forest resources and effectively utilize them, rather than simply cultivate forests. The Oji Group actively promotes an integrated forestry business that maximizes the value of forest resources. In this purpose, it makes efforts to promote a diversified resource utilization through development of new markets for pulp, expansion of lumber processing business and entry into renewable energy business that exploits woody biomass resources, in addition to the conventional use of trees as raw materials for paper manufacturing.

The decline in net sales was caused by a gradual slowdown in demand for printing paper and communications paper, in spite of the implementation of price correction. The decline in operating income was a result of escalating prices of raw materials due to yen depreciation, though price correction and thorough cost reduction have been implemented. As for the outlook of fiscal 2014, we expect to achieve net sales of 319.2 billion yen (up 3.7 billion yen from fiscal 2013) and operating income of 4.8 N-1 Machine of Oji Paper Tomioka Mill billion yen (up 7.5 billion yen from fiscal 2013). Despite the continuing slowdown in demand, we anticipate a revenue growth as positive effects of the price correction undertaken in 2013 are expected to be reaped throughout the year. Similarly, we anticipate an income growth even with rising raw materials’ prices, owing to the positive effects expected to be generated from the commencement of operation of an integrated manufacturing of pulp and paper at Jiangsu Oji Paper Nantong Mill and from further cost reductions.

Till date, it has been making earnest efforts towards achieving its goals as described in the “Environment Action Program 2015”. Oji Group Environmental Charter Basic Policy The Oji Group Environmental Charter requires the Oji Group to help create a truly enriched and sustainable society by developing business activities that harmonize with environment from a global perspective. The Charter calls for the Oji Group to make autonomous efforts to achieve a further environmental improvement, and aggressively drive its “Sustainable Forest Management”, “Paper Recycling”, and global warming countermeasures forward.

Introduction/Operation of Environment Management Systems (EMS) In our drive to encourage each worksite to practice independent environment management, EMSs (ISO 14001, KES, Eco-Action 21, O-EMS*) have gradually been introduced. External audit at an overseas worksite (PANPAC, New Zealand) *O-EMS is a system that the Oji Group has developed based on requirements of ISO 14001 for easy implementation of environmental management at small-scale worksites.

(CENIBRA) Environment Management Manager Leandro Coelho Dalvi In 2014, CENIBRA underwent an environmental audit by the Environmental Management Department and a third-party organization that covers compliance status with environmentrelated laws/regulations and voluntary managements on air, effluents and wastes. It taught us about the importance of fulfilling our social responsibilities, keeping compliance with laws/ regulations and showing consideration for the environment. Putting the learning into practice, we will further familiarize our employees with the Oji Group’s policies on environmental management to promote eco-friendly as well as legally compliant business operations. Audit on an effluent treatment facility 58 Product Safety Charter The Oji Group delivers safe products, fully recognizing that its corporate social responsibility entails providing quality and services that enable customers to use its products with peace of mind. Going forward, we will continue to fulfill the trust of our customers by ensuring that all of our employees reliably implement the following commitments. 1 Complying with all safety-related laws and regulations, we will also implement appropriate management to follow voluntary standards. 2 We will continually improve our Group-wide quality control system, striving to ensure safety. 3 We will provide timely and appropriate information on product safety and proper usage. 4 We will proactively gather information on products involved in incidents and make reports to relevant authorities in compliance with laws.

WWF believe that acquisitions of FSC™, a highly reliable international forest certification, will definitely contribute to local communities and to conservation of the environment. A great amount of effort is required to meet the strict standards on consideration to environment, society and economy, and to acquire and maintain forest certifications. Recently, I had a chance to observe the Oji Group’s FSCT™-certified forest in Brazil*. The visit made me realize once again that a forest managed with such efforts brings beneficial impacts to conservation of biodiversity as a result of continuous activities such as regeneration of forests, protection of rare species and monitoring of wildlife.

The operation is conducted with *CENIBRA’s license code: FSC-C008495 consideration to remaining natural trees Paper Recycling Initiatives to Improve Waste Paper Quality (Promotion of paper collection and further expansion of waste paper usage) The presence of a large amount of prohibitives and foreign subThe Oji Group takes initiatives for Paper Recycling to achieve the stances in collected waste papers may cause various negative goal of a utilization rate of waste paper of 64% in fiscal 2015, impacts that include inefficiency in recycling, increase of energy which is a common goal in the pulp and paper industry. The result requirement, increase of sorting operation and lowering of paper in fiscal 2013 was 62.7%. In order to increase the utilization of product quality. To improve the utilization rate of waste paper, it is waste paper, we will continue to implement various measures important to prevent prohibitives from being mixed in.

Environment / Community Relations Hoping that nursery trees take roots firmly on the ground 75 Community Relations Social Contribution Activities at Oji Nepia Oji Nepia, which is involved in manufacturing and sales of tissue paper, toilet rolls and disposable diapers, has set “nepiaQuality” to pursue the following 3 qualities, living, environmental and social qualities . Considering social contribution activities as a part of the social quality , the company cooperates with customers and various other organizations to continue its social contribution activities that resolve social problems. “1,000 Toilets Program” There are nearly 1,400 children who are losing their lives every day due to unhygienic water and inadequate toilets in our current world. In 2008, Oji Nepia launched the“Nepia 1,000 Toilets Program” out of a desire to prevent loss of life caused by water and toilet problems. Under the Program, a portion of proceeds from the sale of specific nepia products during the campaign period is used to help fund UNICEF activities. In Timor-Leste, a recipient of the aid, the funds go towards providing sanitary toilet facilities to more than 1,000 households each year and fostering safe hygiene practices as a way of eradicating open defecation, which is a cause of diseases such as diarrhea and dehydration. Until today, more than 6,200 toilets have been completed and this has contributed to improvement of under-five mortality rate. The program has been growing as one developed together with customers,receiving approximately 70,000 cheerful messages from domestic customers. Comment from the project partner VOICE The project leads to a creation of a hopeful country Japan Committee for UNICEF Executive Director Mr. Ken Hayami Though there has been much development experienced in urban areas of Timor-Leste, a large number of people in rural areas still live in unhygienic conditions, without access to safe water and sanitary facilities. Inappropriate sanitary habits do not only cause diarrhea and parasite infection, but also seriously affect children’s future through chronic malnutrition and growth stunting. The “1,000 Toilets Program” has been contributing to a creation of a country full of hope by improving sanitary conditions. The cooperation between business enterprises and UNICEF to maximize both parties’ unique characteristics and strengths is an absolute essential to realize a “World Fit for Children”. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for Oji Nepia’s continual support to children. 76 “poo Classes” Since 2007, Oji Nepia and Japan Toilet Labo have been holding nepiaGenki!supports CliniClown “poo Classes” to teach elementary school children about the “Putting Smiles on the Faces of Hospitalized Children.” importance of healthy bowel movements.

A. and four group companies. For the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the above companies’ financial statements as of the end of their respective fiscal years were used. Adjustments were made for the purpose of consolidation as necessary for the material transactions that occurred between such fiscal year-end dates and the consolidated account closing date. 5. Matters Concerning Accounting Policies (1) Method of valuation of significant assets (i) Marketable securities Held-to-maturity debt securities: Stated at cost using the amortized cost method. Available-for-sale securities Securities with market quotations: Stated at market value based on the market price as of the end of the fiscal period (the valuation difference is accounted for as a separate component of net assets and the cost of sales is calculated by using the moving-average method). Securities without market quotations: Stated at cost using the moving-average method. (ii) Derivatives Stated at fair value (iii) Inventories Mainly stated at cost using the periodic average method (The balance sheet amount is calculated by writing down the value based on any decreased profitability) (2) Depreciation method of significant depreciable assets (i) Property, plant and equipment (excluding leased assets) Declining balance method (however, the straight-line method is applied to buildings acquired on or after April 1, 1998 (excluding improvements), machinery and equipment of the Oji Paper Co., Ltd. Tomioka Mill, and for certain consolidated subsidiaries) (ii) Leased assets Depreciation of leased assets is calculated by using the straight-line method over the period of the Financial Section lease contract term with no residual value. (3) Significant provisions (i) Allowance for doubtful accounts In order to prepare for potential credit losses on receivables outstanding at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, an estimated uncollectible amount is recorded at the amount calculated based 91 Financial Section on the historical rate of credit loss with respect to normal receivables and at the amount determined in consideration of collectability of individual receivables with respect to doubtful accounts and certain other receivables. (ii) Provision for surcharge Operating companies of the Oji Group in the paperboard business received advance notification of a surcharge payment order (draft) based on the provisions of Japan’s Antimonopoly Act, and the full amount in the surcharge payment order (draft) is recorded in order to prepare for the payment. (iii) Provision for directors’ retirement benefits In order to prepare for the provision of retirement benefits for directors, the amount required by the internal rules is recorded. (iv) Provision for environmental measures For the purpose of provisioning for the PCB waste treatment costs expected to arise going forward under the “Law on Special Measures concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Wastes,” the estimated required amount is recorded. In addition, for the purpose of provisioning for the maintenance cost after the completion of reclamation of waste-disposal facilities, the estimated required amount is recorded over the period until the reclamation is completed. (v) Provision for loss on litigation The Company’s consolidated subsidiary in Brazil is in the following litigation with the tax authorities in the country: tax-related lawsuits relating to IR (corporate tax), CS (social burden charge), ICMS (product distribution service tax), PIS/CONFIS (burden charges on social integration plan/social insurance loan) and others: lawsuit relating to INSS social insurance premiums and various taxes and dues: and two or more labor service-related lawsuits and civil lawsuits. To prepare for losses on such pending lawsuits, a provision for loss on litigation is recorded. (4) Accounting treatment for retirement benefits With regard to net defined benefit liability, in order to prepare for the provision of retirement benefits for employees, an amount determined to have accrued at the end of the fiscal year is recorded based on the estimated retirement benefit obligation and plan assets as of the end of the fiscal year. The straight-line attribution method is used for attributing the estimated amount of the retirement benefit obligation to periods up to the end of the fiscal year under review in the calculation of net defined benefit liability. Prior service cost is amortized as incurred using the straight-line method based on the average remaining service period (12 – 17 years) of the employees in service during the period in which it arises. Actuarial losses are amortized from the following fiscal year after recognition using the straight-line method based on the average remaining service period (12 – 17 years) of the employees in service during the period in which they arise. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service cost are recorded in net assets, adjusted for tax effects, as remeasurements of defined benefit plans and minority interests in accumulated other comprehensive income. Certain consolidated subsidiaries use a simplified method, which assumes the net defined benefit liability to be the benefits payable assuming the voluntary retirement of all employees at the fiscal year-end, in the calculation of net defined benefit liability and retirement benefit expenses. (5) Significant method for hedge accounting (i) Hedge accounting method The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries adopt the method for hedging instruments whereby any gains or losses are deferred over the period of the hedging contract and are offset against the deferred losses or gains on the related hedged items. However, when an interest rate swap contract meets certain conditions, the net amount to be paid or received under the contract is added to or deducted from the interest on the hedged items.

Financial Instruments (1) Matters concerning financial instruments (i) Management policy The Company and its main consolidated subsidiaries manage group finance under which mainly the Company finances and controls the cash necessary for Group operations primarily through loans from financial institutions, issuance of commercial paper and corporate bonds, and other activities. The Company invests temporary surplus cash in short-term and low-risk financial instruments only and does not make any investment for speculative purposes. The Company uses derivatives to hedge risks described below and does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. (ii) Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments Receivables, such as notes and accounts receivables-trade, are exposed to customer credit risk. Receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies, arising from exporting products, are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risks. However, the amounts of such receivables are always less than the amounts of payables that are denominated in the same foreign currencies. Investment securities are mainly stocks of companies with which the Group has business relationships and these are exposed to market price fluctuation risks. Payment terms of payables, such as notes and accounts payables-trade, are all less than one year. Some of the payables that arise from importing raw materials and others are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risks. Regarding the net payables (determined by deducting the amount of receivables denominated in same foreign currencies), the Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge such risks, considering the foreign exchange market situation. With respect to borrowings and debt, short-term loans payable are mainly for financing related to operating activities, while long-term loans payable are mainly for financing related to investment in property, plant and equipment. Borrowings and debt with floating interest rates are exposed to interest rate volatility risk. Long-term loans payable is partly hedged by using derivative transactions (interest rate swaps) by which interest rates are fixed. Derivative transactions entered into and managed by the Group are as follows: ・Foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risk related to assets/liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, 106 ・Interest rate swaps to hedge risk related to floating interest rates on borrowings and debt, and ・Commodity swaps to hedge price fluctuation risk related to energy purchases. Regarding hedging instruments and hedged items, hedging policy, the method for assessing hedging effectiveness and others related to hedge accounting, (see Note 5. (5) Significant method for hedge accounting) (iii) Risk management (a) Credit risk management (risk of non-performance by customers or counterparties) The Company and its main consolidated subsidiaries reduce credit risk through the following methods: ・The Company checks and manages due dates and balances of receivables on a customer by customer basis. ・Each sales department of the Company periodically monitors, and investigates, as necessary, the credit position of key customers. In utilizing derivative transactions, the Group limits the counterparties to highly rated financial institutions to reduce counterparty risk. (b) Market risk management (risks related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation, floating interest rates and others) The Company and some of its consolidated subsidiaries utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk regarding foreign currency monetary assets/liabilities that are expected to arise in the normal course of business activities. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to hedge the following risks: ・Fluctuation risk regarding variable interest rates for payments related to borrowings and debt ・Interest rate deviation risk between fixed interest rates for payments and future market interest rates Some of the consolidated subsidiaries utilize commodity swaps to hedge price fluctuation risk related to energy purchases. With respect to corporate stocks of available-for-sale securities, the Company checks periodically their fair values and financial conditions of such issuing entities (the companies with which the Company has business relationships) and reviews the benefits of continuing to hold such stocks, considering its relationships with such companies. In the Company, execution and management of derivative transactions are conducted based on the derivative transaction standards that provide the method and the organization for risk management and others. The consolidated subsidiaries also execute and manage derivative transactions based on their own similar standards. (c) Liquidity risk related to financing activities (risk of non-performance on a due date) The Company makes and updates financing plans in a timely manner and manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient liquidity on hand forecasted based on specific information, including the following information: ・Information reported from each department regarding credit and debit notes, and ・Information reported from the consolidated subsidiaries through which the Company determines group finance policies The Company is prepared to make emergency payments by entering into commitment lines of credit with related financial institutions. (iv) Supplementary explanation regarding fair value of financial instruments Financial Section Fair values of financial instruments are measured based on the quoted prices in markets. In cases where a quoted price is not available, other reasonably assessed estimated fair values are used. Such assessment is based on certain assumptions. Under different assumptions, the assessed value might differ. The contract amounts of derivative transactions and others, as shown in “(2) Fair value of financial instruments,” do not measure the Company’s exposure to market risk related to derivative transactions. 107 Financial Section (2) Fair value of financial instruments The following tables present the Company’s financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets, their fair value and the differences at March 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively.

The method for measuring fair values of financial instruments and matters relating to securities and derivative transactions ①Cash and bank deposits, ②Notes and accounts receivable-trade, and ③Short-term loans receivable The relevant book values are used because the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.  ④Long-term loans receivable The fair value of long-term loans receivable is calculated by applying a discount rate to the total of principal and interest. The discount interest rate is based on the assumed interest rate if similar new borrowings were entered into. ⑤Marketable securities and investment securities The fair value of equity securities equals quoted market price. The fair value of debt securities equals quoted market price or has been provided by financial institutions. ⑥Notes and accounts payable-trade, and ⑦Short-term loans payable The relevant book values are used because the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The current portion of long-term loans payable (the carrying amount of such portion on the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2014 and 2013 are ¥ 56,597 million ($549,921 thousand) and ¥ 149,430 million) is included in “⑨Long-term loans payable.”, respectively. Financial Section ⑧Bonds The fair value of corporate bonds is calculated based on the quoted market price (Reference: Statistical Prices for OTC Bond Transactions), or, in cases where quoted market prices are not available, by using the discounted cash flow, based on the total amount of the principal and interest of the remaining period and credit risk. The corporate bonds include the current portion (the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2014 and 2013 are ¥ 20,085 million ($195,151 thousand) and ¥ 20,160 million, respectively). 109 Financial Section ⑨Long-term loans payable The fair value of the long-term loans payable is calculated by applying a discount rate to the total of the principal and interest. The discount interest rate is based on the assumed interest rate if similar new debt were entered into. A portion of the floating rate long-term loans payable hedged by interest rate swaps (described in ⑩) is calculated by discounting the total amount of the principal and interest with the interest rate swaps, based on the reasonably estimated interest rate if similar new debt were entered into. The long-term loans payable includes the current portion (the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2014 and 2013 are ¥ 56,597 million ($549,921 thousand) and ¥ 149,430 million, respectively). ⑩Derivative transactions The estimated special treatment of interest rate swaps is included in the fair value of the underlying long-term loans payable, as the interest rate swaps are accounted for as part of the long-term loans payable.

The volatility is calculated based on historical data of the stock price for the past 10 years and 6 months (from January 16, 2003 to July 16, 2013) 2. As there is not enough data to make a reasonable estimate, expected life of the option is based on the assumption that the options are exercised at mid-term of during the exercise period. 3. This is based on the actual dividend for the year ended March 31, 2013. 4. Risk-free interest rate is yield on government bonds for the period that corresponds to the remaining life of the option. 125 Financial Section (4) Method for estimating the number of vested options Basically, as it is difficult to reasonably estimate the number of options that will expire in the future, the number of vested options is calculated based on historical data for the options that have not yet been vested, and the number of options that have actually been forfeited compared to the number vested. 20.

As a result, the effective statutory tax rate used to calculate deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities has been revised to 35.6% from the previous 38.0% for temporary differences that are expected to be realized or settled in the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2014. As a result of this change in the tax rate, the amount of deferred tax assets decreased by ¥766 million ($7,447 thousand)(the amount after deducting of deferred tax liabilities), income taxes – deferred increased by ¥767 million ($7,455 thousand), deferred losses on hedging derivatives increased by ¥0 million ($7 thousand) and minority interests increased by ¥0 million ($0 thousand) respectively, as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. Furthermore, the Local Corporate Tax Act (Act No. 11 of 2014) was promulgated on March 31, 2014, and, accordingly, the local corporate tax will be levied as a national government level tax offsetting a reduction in the rate of inhabitant tax from fiscal years commencing on or after October 1, 2014. The effect of this change in the tax rate on the consolidated financial statements is immaterial. 21.

Outline of business combination (1) Name and business lines of acquired company Name of acquired company Japan Brazil paper and Pulp Development Ltd. (JBP) Business lines of acquired company Marketing of pulp (2) Primary reason for business combination The Company is strengthening the pulp business as part of its efforts to drive forward businesses related to strategic resource management, which is one of its current business strategies. Celulose Nipo-Brasileira S.A. (CNB), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of JBP, is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of pulp available on the open market and boasts a production output of about 1.2 million tons/year in Brazil, a highly internationally competitive country in the pulp market. Accordingly, the Company expects not only to capture CNB’s high profitability though the purchase of shares in JBP, but also to include CNB in the Group’s management strategy to generate synergy with the existing pulp business in the international market.

(4) Outline of transaction, including its purpose Enhancing the Group’s competitiveness and profitability in the global paper, paperboard and related markets has become a pressing issue in an environment where domestic demand has matured and is declining and where Japanese and Asian markets continue to move rapidly in the direction of integration. Under such operating conditions, the Group is working to enhance its corporate value through pursuing a new business portfolio comprising the basic strategies defined as: “enhancing global competitiveness through aggressive cost reduction,” “establishing a material-converted products integrated business model,” “encouraging growth through incubating R&D oriented business,” “promoting resource and environmental business,” “expanding overseas business,” and “strengthening trading functions.” The Group decided that it would be appropriate to make a transition to a holding company structure so that it may push forward with further enhancement of management efficiency within the Group and the clarification of management responsibilities in each business unit to more actively pursue the aforementioned measures for business portfolio transformation to achieve sustainable growth. Financial Section 2. Outline of accounting procedures The transactions were accounted for as transactions under common control based on the “Accounting Standard for Business Combinations” (ASBJ Statement No. 21 issued on December 26, 2008) and the “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Business Combinations and Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures” (ASBJ Guidance No. 10 issued on December 26, 2008). 129 Financial Section 22. Segment Information  (1) Overview of reporting segments The reporting segments of the Company are the business units of the Group, of which financial information is available separately in order for the Board of Directors to conduct periodic review to determine allocation of management resources and evaluate business performance by unit. The Group is mainly engaged in production and sale of pulp and paper products and converted paper products. Each of the companies of the Group independently plans its comprehensive strategy for its products and services and implements its business activities. Therefore, each of the business segments comprises certain companies of the Group that are similar in terms of economic characteristics, production method or production process, types of market or customers to which products are sold and other characteristics. The Company consists of five reporting segments: “Household and industrial materials,” “Printing and communications media,” “Functional materials,” “Forest resources and environmental marketing” and “Other.” The principal business lines in each reporting segment are as follows: Household and industrial materials: Containerboard, corrugated container, boxboard and, packaging papers , folding cartons and paper bags, household products Printing and communications media: Newsprint, printing, publishing and communications paper Functional materials: Specialty paper, thermal paper, adhesive paper, film Forest resources and environmental marketing: Lumber, pulp, energy Other: Real estate, machinery, trading and other (2) Methods to calculate amounts of sales, income or loss, assets, liabilities and other items by reporting segment The accounting method applied for reporting segments is almost the same that described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.to 5. Segment profit is based on operating profit. Inter-segment sales and transfers are based on market price and other.

Significant Subsequent Events Acquisition of Carter Holt Harvey Limited’s Pulp, Paper and Packaging Businesses On April 25, 2014, the Company announced that the board of directors resolved to jointly acquire the pulp & paper business of Carter Holt Harvey Limited (“CHH”), Carter Holt Harvey Pulp & Paper Limited (“CHHPP”) and certain related companies (collectively “CHHPP Group”) with Innovation Network Corporation of Japan (“INCJ”) and executed a share purchase agreement for the transaction. CHHPP Group manufactures pulp, paper and packaging products in New Zealand and Australia. CHHPP Group is ultimately owned by Rank Group Limited. The transaction is subject to, among others, relevant regulatory approvals. 1. Transaction Background In recent years, the Company has been aggressively expanding its overseas businesses, particularly in Southeast Asia and other emerging markets where strong growth for the pulp & paper market is expected. The Company positions paperboards and packaging products as its core products and has either acquired or built a total of 21 plants/facilities (including on-going green-field projects) in Southeast Asia and India over the past few years. Further, the Company has been focusing on the forest resources business. It operates Pan Pac (plantation forests, lumber-processing and pulp business in New Zealand), CENIBRA (plantation forests and pulp business in Brazil) and a number of other plantation assets in Southeast Asia and Oceania, with an aim to further expand the business in Japan and globally in the near future. CHHPP Group’s three main businesses: (1) Pulp Business: Benefitting from its regional advantage with access to abundant softwood supplies Financial Section CHHPP manufactures bleached/unbleached softwood kraft pulp products, such as NBKP and NUKP. The acquisition of CHHPP will allow the Company to offer a broader range of products and solutions to customers adding to Pan Pac’s BCTMP and CENIBRA’s LBKP. (2) Paperboard Business: Using its softwood kraft pulp as the key raw material, CHHPP manufactures paperboard products that have a reputation as being more durable and stronger than recycled paperboard products provided by CHHPP’s competitors in Asia. As the market in Asia continues to expand, the 135 Financial Section Company will seek to market CHHPP’s outstanding products to various customers to meet their needs for durability, while using CHHPP’s paperboards as raw material for the Company’s own packaging products going forward. (3) Packaging Business: CHHPP Group manufactures packaging products in five facilities in New Zealand and Australia, in addition to its paper bag and paper cup businesses. As the Company expects that the trade volume among Asia Pacific Rim countries will continue to increase, it believes that the business will grow in parallel with robust demand in the region. Another important point is that the acquisition of CHHPP Group would also provide the Company with access to softwood resources, whereby expanding Oji Group’s wood product business in the region and allowing it to develop and market its advanced materials as well as new materials made from wood.
