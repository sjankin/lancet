These principles are at the core of our work. We believe responsible and sustainable business is a powerful development tool. From a personal perspective, I started the company with these principles as my main goals. My vision is to create a system of business, primarily in Africa and developing markets, that helps communities where we work. I believe by creating a business environment adhering to the Global Compact it will make sense both financially and developmentally for all stakeholders to participate fully. In 2014-2015 Dints, based on its first-hand experience, focussed also on the particular challenges of SMEs in developing countries. The company has been networking with UNIDO inter alia, and is finalising a system for integrating SMEs into large scale supply chains so local business can quantum leap frog forward and thus reduce poverty. A website for this purpose is being developed for launch in 2016. This communication reaffirms Dintsâ€™ support to the Global Compact and describes the activities in the past year aimed at continuing to embed the ten principles in our business. I look forward to the leaps that we expect to make in the coming year and reporting on our progress in 2016.
