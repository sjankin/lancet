This is accomplished through a consistent and legally defensible hiring and employment process that is in line with all federal and state hiring mandates. APT Metrics never has and never will be complicit in human rights abuses. In addition, we ensure that these human rights principles are embedded in the assessment and hiring practices that we implement for our global organizational clients. Implementation APT Metrics has a variety of mechanisms to ensure our adherence to the human rights principle. Training on sexual harassment is necessary for all employees as part of ongoing employment. An employee relations manager is in place to address grievances from employees. APT Metrics also promotes an open door policy regarding any issues employees may have about their workplace.

Labour Principles Assessment, Policy and Goals APT Metrics has policies ensuring fairness in employee compensation and benefits. We are committed to maintaining high level and ethical human resource processes. APT Metrics is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to enhancing diversity within the organization. Implementation Beyond our own policies, we work with our client organizations to ensure that they incorporate diversity as part of their strategic and tactical plans. For the past two years we have leveraged our Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) expert to educate and serve global organizations. For many organizations, the use of metrics to assess diversity and inclusion efforts means measuring the representation (or change in representation) of various groups in the workforce. APTMetrics works with organizations to identify the range of available measures and makes recommendations for when and how to integrate such measures into diversity and inclusion metrics—helping organizations move forward in the diversity and inclusion spectrum.

WBENC's goal is to foster diversity in the world of commerce. Its programs and policies are designed to expand opportunities and eliminate barriers in today's marketplace for women business owners.

The SIOP UN team continues to partner with the UN Global Compact in identifying ways in which SIOP can promote the Global Compact principles surrounding human rights, labor, environmental sustainability, and anti-corruption in organizations. We are also pursing ways in which graduate programs in I/O Psychology can also become official Global Compact participants, as well as incorporate the Global Compact 10 Principles into their curricula. Just recently, the SIOP UN team –spearheaded by Deb Rupp and Drew Mallory applied for and received acceptance of Purdue University’s Industrial/Organizational Psychology Program into the Global Compact: http://unglobalcompact.org/participant/51181.
