To maintain and develop this position, we are convinced it is a prerequisite to conduct our business in a responsible manner – “Doing Business the Right Way”. However, we must admit our principles are under intense pressure from competitors NOT doing business the right way. ScanCom’s approach to doing business the right way was recognized in 2014 when we were the recipient of the “CSR Abroad Prize”, an award established by Denmark’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and this provided great encouragement to Stig Maasbøl Group CEO continue our CSR strategy. ScanCom International A/S Sustainability for materials, products, and operations To create and offer sustainable products, ScanCom controls all materials and products in order to meet all relevant regulations in our markets. For the wood used in our products, ScanCom was a pioneer in using FSC certified hardwood, and today we use 100% FSC hardwood with an objective to increase the level of FSC teak year by year. At the same time we continuously optimize our operating activities to reduce consumption of energy and resources, increase recycling, and reduce emissions. Our main operation site in Vietnam is operated under ISO 14001 certificate. Social accountability It is important for ScanCom to assure respect for human and labor rights. Key features of this are: BSCI monitoring of all operations in Vietnam since 2008, SA 8000 certificates for the operations in Brazil (2012) and Indonesia (2001), and having our own Code of Conduct. OHSAS 18001 certification for health and safety management was obtained for the Vietnamese operation in 2014. Being signatory to the UN Global Compact, in addition to BSCI monitoring and certifications, sends a clear signal to all our stakeholders that we are committed to doing business the right way and also supports our activities in terms of meeting the CSR requirements of our global customers. Requirements for contract manufacturers and key suppliers Built into the BSCI CoC, SA 8000, and UN Global Compact are requirements for the improvement of CSR level in the supply chain. ScanCom actively practices this by performing CSR audits at key suppliers and contract manufacturers and requesting them to sign our Code of Conduct, and targets are set for continuous improvement in terms of that policy. UN Global Compact commitment I am very pleased that ScanCom, even under the difficult conditions of recent years, has been able to remain true to its basic CSR values and to make progress, or at least maintain the same high level, in all 10 of the UN Global Compact principles. For the following seasons ScanCom will continue to further develop commitment to the UN Global Compact – “Doing Business the Right Way” will remain part of our DNA. 5 ScanCom International A/S Legal Structure Finance figures The finance figures for ScanCom International A/S are given below. The financial results of the year reflect a drop in activity that was due to economic problems in key markets and also the bad weather in Europe in summer 2013. 6 ScanCom International A/S Performance indicators and objectives For season 13/14 ScanCom selected the performance indicators given below and set related objectives. This year’s Communication of Progress in performance focuses on the selected indicators and objectives, and also reports on other related areas.

Activities in Indonesia (SCIN) and Brazil (SCBR) are also reported. CSR Highlights season 2013/14 • OHSAS 18001 certification for ScanCom Vietnam in spring 2014. • Safeguards implemented on all manufacturing machines in SCVN. • Significant improvements of noise level in SCVN wood manufacturing. • New internal waste water treatment plant opened in SCVN. Human rights • ScanCom International is committed to influence our employees and business partners to respect the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. • For several years ScanCom has had its own, annually updated Code of Conduct for employees and business partners. It can be seen in full on our website: http://www.scancom.net BSCI monitoring of Contract Manufacturers ScanCom uses the BSCI monitoring system to ensure that its contract manufacturers, as a minimum, comply with basic human rights and local regulations pertaining to labor conditions. For season 13/14 ScanCom used a total of 25 contract manufacturers, all of which were registered on the BSCI platform.

In parallel, ScanCom follows up on all non-conformances found by 3rd parties or customers. This approach has maintained good results in the BSCI rating for our partners. Supplier audits ScanCom is continually developing higher CSR levels at our suppliers. By the end of the season all suppliers had signed ScanCom’s Code of Conduct. ScanCom continually evaluates which suppliers are critical in terms of CSR issues and audits these suppliers. About 25 % of ScanCom’s Vietnamese suppliers were CSR audited by ScanCom. Child labor During the past season ScanCom maintained regular internal audits of contract manufacturers together with customer audits and BSCI audits, and again for this season we can report that no cases of child labor were recorded. Forced labor Similar to the above, no cases of forced labor were recorded for the past season. Labor ScanCom is committed to the support and protection of labor rights including: abolition of child labor, elimination of forced labor, freedom of association, and eradication of any kind of discrimination.

ScanCom was affected by this for several years and actively addressed the problem by creating incentives for employees to stay. These have taken the form of an improvement in working conditions and the provision of a range of benefits: supporting the children of employees, providing a transportation allowance, and assistance with house rental. The employee turnover rate for SCVN was reduced from 86 % in season 12/13 to 75 % in season 13/14, and although this figure remains high, it meets the objective set for this parameter. The employee turnover rate for SCIN increased from 23% in season 12/13 to 24% in season 13/14. This relatively high number is a result of contract/seasonal workers resigning and not completing their contract. The labor turnover for SCBR for season 13/14 was influenced by the implementation of a new site and the situation is now normalized. Overtime The high labor turnover referred to above, in addition to the seasonal nature of the outdoor furniture industry has, in the past, resulted in the problem of overtime rates that were too high. However, through improvements in planning and a reduction in the labor turnover rate, this issue is now under control. The number of overtime hours per employee increased from 91 to 108 from season 12/13 to season 13/14, i.e. 19 %. The increase was mainly due to a shift in activity level, and all regulation related to overtime was respected. For SCIN the number of overtime hours per employee decreased from 39 for season 12/13 to 18.5 for season 13/14 and all regulation related to overtime was respected. SCBR follows Brazilian legislation dealing with overtime and is subject to both internal audits and a strict inspection of its implementation by an external inspector. 13 ScanCom International A/S Headcount Turnover by Category Age Site Employee Total Average Turnover category 18-25 26-35 36-45 46-55 56-60 leaving headcount % Male Official worker 488 438 97 17 0 1040 2019 52 Seasonal worker 756 449 62 2 1 1270 524 242 Staff 2 11 2 0 0 15 78 19 Management 0 37 11 4 0 52 227 23 Total-Male 1246 935 172 23 1 2377 2847 83 SCVN Female Official worker 123 116 40 4 1 284 736 39 Seasonal worker 115 72 19 2 0 208 113 185 Staff 6 12 4 0 0 22 99 22 Management 0 0 3 0 0 3 66 5 Total Female 244 200 66 6 1 517 1014 51 Grand Total 1490 1135 238 29 2 2894 3861 75 SCVN Male Official worker 0 3 1 1 0 5 54 9 Seasonal worker 34 14 0 0 0 48 153 31 Staff 0 3 1 0 0 4 22 18 Management 0 0 2 0 0 2 21 10 Total-Male 34 20 4 1 0 59 250 24 SCIN Female Official worker 0 0 0 1 0 1 12 8 Seasonal worker 5 5 0 0 0 10 33 30 Staff 0 6 0 0 0 6 15 40 Management 0 0 3 0 0 3 8 38 Total Female 5 11 3 1 0 20 68 29 Grand Total 39 31 7 2 0 79 318 25 SCIN 14 ScanCom International A/S Wages and benefits In Vietnam the legal minimum wage is frequently adjusted, but ScanCom has always compensated employees at a significantly higher level, applying principles for actual living costs rather than the minimum wage. In season 13/14 the lowest wage level for ScanCom workers was around 29 % higher than the legal minimum. Furthermore, ScanCom continued the policy of an extra 2.5 % health and social and unemployment insurance for workers compared to the legal requirement plus extra support for employees with children. SCIN pays contract workers at a rate that is a few percent above the minimum level and all permanent employees are paid at a somewhat higher level, depending on position and responsibility. SCBR pays wages based on an agreement with the Union and the wage pattern of the local area. SCBR has attractive benefit policies which are successful in the long-term retention of workers. Discrimination ScanCom continuously enforces its policy of not accepting any kind of employment discrimination of the workforce due to gender, age, or origin. 15 ScanCom International A/S Age distribution of employees.

A general introductory training course on safety was delivered to 3,172 new employees. Training activities were further developed for areas of special risk like pressure vessels, forklifts, and handling of chemicals. The Vietnamese regulation for required labor safety training was tightened and now requires external training which explains the large increase in training hours. SCIN also trains all new employees in health and safety and this is repeated twice a year for all employees. The total lack of accidents at SCBR is the result of high quality training and continuous improvements in terms of safety. 17 ScanCom International A/S Environment ISO 14001 certification of environment management system ScanCom Vietnam received ISO 14001 certificate in spring 2013 and the first surveillance audit was conducted in spring 2014 with a good outcome. The ISO 14001 management system is used as the basis for SCVN control of environmental impact, reporting and continuous improvements. For the manufacturing activities in Brazil and Indonesia the environmental impact is very low, and there are, for now, no plans to implement ISO 14001 at these sites. Materials used, recycling, and waste Data In relation to the ISO 14001 certification of SCVN the methods for registration of use of resources and disposal of waste were significantly improved and therefore the data for season 12/13 and onwards are to be considered accurate and at the appropriate level.

The increase of industrial waste is a consequence of temporary external sourcing of wood pellets for boilers for wood drying instead of using SCVN wood waste. This leaves more wood waste for external sale. The significant increase in the amount of aluminum waste is due to market prices for the waste. If the price offered for the waste by our aluminum supplier is low, the waste is instead sold in the local market and is not then used in future products. Significantly though, regardless of the buyer, the waste is recycled. The rest of the variations are linked to changes in activity levels. Even though environmental impact is low, SCBR established an improvement project and impact is expected to decrease in coming years. 18 ScanCom International A/S Water SCVN The industrial zone in SS 13/14 was still not able to supply sufficient water and SCVN wells were still used until this came to an end in May 2014. The positive development in water consumption comes from successful activities undertaken to identify and repair any leakage in the old pipework in the factories. For the activities in Song Than Industrial Park waste water volume is calculated as 80 % of water consumption and is not measured as it is on the small sites in other areas. Waste water volume therefore is reduced in line with the reduction of water consumption. SCVN is now cleaning waste water to the required level before discharging to the centralized waste water treatment plant of Song Than Industrial Park. The waste water is checked and reports are made quarterly. SCIN and SCBR There is practically no industrial waste water at those sites. Recycling ScanCom continuously tries to increase recycling of materials – mainly in SCVN. New methods for recycling in wood plastic composite furniture have resulted in increased recycling figures Development activities in recycling are ongoing and this should lead to a continued increase in the amount of internal waste being recycled. Waste For season 13/14 SCVN further improved on waste handling to meet ISO 14001 related objectives and legal requirements. In SCIN and SCBR as well, waste handling is under control and the data now presented are reliable and traceable. Waste type SCVN SCIN SCBR Disposal (MT) SS 12/13 SS 13/14 SS 12/13 SS 13/14 SS 12/13 SS 13/14 method Authorized Domestic waste 71.5 120 12.5 11 0.330 0.300 contractor Authorized Hazardous waste 290 476 0 0 0.066 0.060 contractor Sold to Recyclable waste 3,164 5,383 3.8 2.7 2.904 2.640 contractors It is evident due to volumes that for the ScanCom Group the challenges are connected to the operation in Vietnam. The increase of hazardous waste in SCVN is due to a one-off scrapping of expired materials and also a result of the improved classification of waste, now strictly adhered to, following regulation. 19 ScanCom International A/S CO2 emission Since 2012 ScanCom has continuously monitored CO2 generating consumptions with the aim of a stepwise reduction in CO2 emissions.

Impact of products on health and environment. Restricted substances. ScanCom continuously updates its own List of Restricted Substances (LRS) to always meet relevant legal and customers’ requirements. All new materials developed are tested for compliance. Random testing for existing materials is done at least once per year to ensure continued compliance. The administrative system prevents the purchase of non-compliant materials. FSC wood ScanCom was one of the pioneers in using FSC wood for outdoor furniture and is today the world’s biggest manufacturer of FSC hardwood garden furniture. Today ScanCom uses 100 % FSC hardwood in our operations in Vietnam – including our contract manufacturers. ScanCom Indonesia is now FSC certified and is working towards having all production made with FSC teak. Due to a global shortage of FSC teak of acceptable quality this process will take several years. However, only teak of verified legal origin is used. Taking into account the above, ScanCom can comply with any regulation on wood in all our markets and provide all relevant documentation for customers. 20 ScanCom International A/S Anti-corruption ScanCom maintains its own Code of Conduct with annual updates.
