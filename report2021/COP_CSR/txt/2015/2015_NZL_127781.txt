All incidents, regardless of their impact, are included in the calculations. The most frequent injuries are those caused by cuts. In the long term, the Tridonic Group is aiming to reduce the overall TRI rate below 9.5. Due to very different nature of business, Tridonic NZ is target TRI rate below 13.

The Policy includes the following components: • Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining The Company respects our employees’ right to join, form or not to join a labour union without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. Where employees are represented by a legally recognized union, we are committed to establishing a constructive dialogue with their freely chosen representatives. Tridonic NZ is committed to bargaining in good faith with such representatives. • Forced Labour Tridonic NZ prohibits the use of all forms of forced labour, including prison labour, indentured labour, bonded labour, military labour or slave labour. • Discrimination at work place Tridonic NZ values all employees and the contributions they make and has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity and intolerance of discrimination.

Energy savings of up to 80 percent can be achieved with lighting management systems and digital dimmable ballasts. Control of the luminaries is demand-led, governed by presence sensors and daylight levels. As part of TRIDONIC’s “ecolution” sustainability strategy, the “ecoism” simulation toll compares different lighting technologies based on life cycle costs, Page 20 of 67 10th February 2015 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY energy profiles and life cycle assessments. This way, the cumulative costs of various solutions can be mapped over several years, helping to define amortization periods and environmental impacts. Product quality is the top priority for us and is constantly monitored. As part of our Lean Six Sigma philosophy, we also operate a continuous improvement process and adopt a zero-defect approach. Our processes are constantly improved and systematically monitored, and the effectiveness of implemented process and quality improvement measures are followed-up through continuous reviews. In the event of any deviation, we instigate corrective measures and monitor their effectiveness. This ensures that resources are used in a sparing, costconscious manner throughout the entire life cycle of products, environmental pollution is prevented to the greatest possible extent and risks are minimized. This allows us to guarantee customers the very highest product quality at all times. The Tridonic Group is determined to make its contribution to climate protection not only by developing innovative products – as a manufacturing company it is also constantly mindful of the need to achieve the biggest possible reductions in emissions. The Tridonic Group’s environmentally relevant emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), dust and noise. Measures in the Tridonic Group to cut CO2 emissions are based primarily on optimising material and energy requirements in the manufacturing process and optimising transport logistics.

Anti-Corruption Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Our businesses are against all forms of Corruption: New Zealand does not have any one single agency tasked with fighting corruption. Unlike many other countries it has not seen the need to create an Independent Commission against Corruption. Rather it has a number of agencies that focus on the different elements in the fight against corruption. Some of these agencies have their focus on the more positive task of reinforcing values to ensure that New Zealand maintains a corruption free environment; others focus on the enforcement of the laws and the rules. Transparency International (www.transparency.org) is the global civil society organisation, leading the fight against corruption. Transparency International’s mission is to create change towards a world free of corruption. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) was first launched in 1995; it has been widely credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda. The CPI ranks almost 175 countries by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys. Currently, New Zealand is ranked 2nd with least corrupt and highly clean nation in public sector. New Zealand is just fractional behind on No. 1 spot with Denmark. New Zealand & Denmark were shared the No. 1 rank since 2007. Attached Appendix-E of “Corruption Perceptions Index-2014” Background: Tridonic NZ defines corruption as ‘the abuse of a position of trust in order to achieve improper financial or other advantage’. We are aware that corporate corruption can take many forms such as:  bribery, price-fixing agreements, facilitation payments  money laundering  inappropriate favours, hospitality or gifts The Zumtobel Group’s Corporate Values, Code of Conduct and Corporate Policies are binding for all the Group’s employees. These lay the foundation for taking the right decisions and acting in a fair, trustworthy and unprejudiced fashion towards both colleagues and business partners. Tridonic NZ is part of a the Zumtobel Group’s Code of Conduct which contains detailed regulations on corruption which all employees must observe as well as other sensitive issues such as:  Sponsorship  political and charitable donations Page 27 of 67 10th February 2015 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  and relations with the authorities Objective: We believe that “Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain”. It hurts everyone whose life, livelihood or happiness depends on the integrity of people in a position of authority. Tridonic NZ will not condone any form of corruption. Briefly, the giving or accepting of undue advantage and other forms of corruption, along with the damage caused by such misconduct worldwide, are a serious issue in today’s legal, economic and political environment. For this reason, in September 2004 the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, made a clear commitment to introducing anti-corruption regulations for all business dealings, transactions and processes in all Zumtobel Group companies worldwide of which Tridonic NZ is a member. As an active participant in the World Economic Forum’s “Partnering against Corruption Initiative” (PACI) the goal of the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, is to actively combat the various forms of corruption in international and national business dealings. Target: Do note, as an international company, we currently have an independent 3rd party audit carried out on a yearly basis. Fraud and corruption is an important component of this audit. Nevertheless, we will try and further improve by identifying key areas which might be susceptible to fraud and corruption in our business and rectify it. In the Zumtobel Group we will not tolerate any form of corruption; regardless of the value or nature of the advantage this involves (cash, benefits in kind, etc.). Inappropriate favours, gifts or complimentary benefits for customers and business partners also violate our Code of Conduct. In this respect we wish to point out that this also applies within the company to inappropriate gifts given by our employees to one another. Such gifts are not permitted and violate our Code of Conduct. The Zumtobel Group is a fair and trusting partner and this is an asset we aim to make good use of in our global growth strategy – especially in the new markets!

Report any violation of the Code! 8 Dignity and work environment 9 Communication and collaboration 10 Integrity and conflicts of interest 11 Property and confidentiality 12 Customers and competition 3 Page 33 of 67 A message from the CEO The Code of Conduct of the Zumtobel Group is the basis on which we do business. It governs the everyday activities of all employees across the Zumtobel Group as well as the activities of our business partners. The Code of Conduct itself is based on current legislation, on human rights and human dignity, and on our own internal regulations. The Zumtobel Group is a member of the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and we are committed to respecting the Conditions of Work and Employment laid down by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). To test your own compliance with our Code of Conduct, ask yourself the following questions, to which you should always be able to answer “yes”: • Is what I am doing legal? Is it transparent, justifiable and thus comprehensible? • Am I acting in the best interests of the Zumtobel Group? • Would I act the same way if a supervisor or a colleague were present? • Would I be perfectly happy for my actions to be made public? This brochure is designed to inform you about our ethical principles. Respecting those principles is both a duty and a personal commitment for us all. You will find further details on our Lightweb intranet. If you have any questions or are unsure how to behave in certain circumstances, please contact your manager or the relevant departments. 4 Page 34 of 67 Information and contacts The Code of Conduct is available in the various languages spoken by our employees and can be obtained from all HR departments and Works Council offices. New employees receive a copy of the Code when they join the company. Lightweb: Full details can be found on the Zumtobel Group’s intranet ( Lightweb ). http://lightweb. Your first point of contact in questions concerning our Code of Conduct zumtobelgroup.com is your manager, the HR department or the Works Council. You may also contact the Zumtobel Group’s Ethics Officer or colleagues at the Corporate Internal Audit or Corporate Tax & Legal departments. 5 Page 35 of 67 What happens in the event of violation of the Code? Violations of our Code of Conduct lead to disciplinary measures – from a verbal warning or written reprimand all the way to dismissal. Severe violations can constitute grounds for dismissal. We also reserve the right to sue for damages and initiate proceedings under civil law. In the case of our business partners, violation of the Code of Conduct may lead to termination of business relations or legal action. 6 Page 36 of 67 Report any violation of the Code! Please report any violation of the Code of Conduct to your manager, the HR department or the Works Council. Or contact the Zumtobel Group’s Ethics Officer or colleagues at the Corporate Internal Audit or Corporate Tax & Legal departments If you are ever unsure about the proper course of action or have any questions, these are the people you should ask! All contacts and reports will be treated confidentially and looked into carefully. Making a report will have no negative consequences for you, unless you deliberately make a false accusation. 7 Page 37 of 67 1. Dignity and work environment We reject all forms of discrimination. Every person is unique, precious and has their own individual capabilities. We do not tolerate any form of sexual discrimination in the workplace. The Zumtobel Group does not accept working conditions that fail to comply with international laws and regulations. We also expect this of our business partners. Child labour and forced labour are strictly prohibited. All employees are entitled to fair and proper compensation for their work. As an employer, the Zumtobel Group ensures that working conditions are safe and hygienic worldwide. We are familiar with and comply with the health and safety regulations of the Zumtobel Group. Any form of drug misuse is prohibited. Consumption of alcohol and smoking are prohibited at the workplace. Please also see the respective local plant regulations in this respect (e.g. smoking areas or exceptions for internal celebrations). We adopt a sensitive and sustainable approach to energy and resources. We are familiar with our environmental guidelines and observe them. We also expect this of our business partners. 8 Page 38 of 67 2. Communication and collaboration Our behaviour is marked by respect, esteem, dependability and trust. We always treat our colleagues, customers and partners politely and fairly. We communicate openly, honestly and transparently. We are helpful, support one another and work together constructively. We keep our promises and only make promises that we can keep. We address conflicts, problems and undesirable developments objectively and at the earliest possible moment and work together to find solutions. Our communications with the authorities are conducted with foresight and in a spirit of partnership. As a rule these are the responsibility of duly authorised employees or of management. We direct any enquiries from the press to the Corporate Communications department (news services and business media: questions about the company) or to the relevant PR managers of the brands (trade press: questions about products or projects). We are aware that even “private” communications on the internet are “public” and can reflect on the Zumtobel Group. We conduct our private and professional activities in the World Wide Web accordingly. 9 Page 39 of 67 3. Integrity and conflicts of interest We are familiar with the relevant laws and company policies and respect them. Anyone demonstrating corrupt behaviour is misusing their position in order to obtain inadmissible benefits for themselves or the company. Corruption includes but is not restricted to bribery, the granting or acceptance of advantages, price fixing, facilitation payments, embezzlement, misappropriation of funds, fraud, extortion or money laundering. We do not tolerate any form of corruption. We report any incidences of corruption that we encounter among colleagues, business partners, suppliers or the authorities. Moreover, when gifts, invitations or other business courtesies are offered, this must never give rise to the impression that we are trying to exert improper influence on business decisions. The same applies vice versa when we are the recipients of hospitality or gifts. As a matter of principle, we do not make donations to political parties. Similarly, during election campaigns, we do not allow representatives of political parties to speak at the company or at public events staged by our brands (e.g. at trade fairs). When no elections are pending, however, we are happy to provide an insight into the company. Donations to charities and sponsoring activities are only permitted within the framework of the appropriate policies. Personal interests must in no way collide with the interests of the Zumtobel Group. Examples of possible conflicts of interest include: • engaging in an activity outside the Zumtobel Group which could have a negative impact on our work; • business transactions involving friends, acquaintances or relations; • holdings (of over 3%) in companies with which we do business; • having management responsibility for a close relative. 10 Page 40 of 67 4. Property and confidentiality We always treat the property of the Zumtobel Group and the property of third parties with the utmost care. The intellectual property of the Zumtobel Group includes inventions, research findings, product and software developments, as well as all data stored in our IT systems. We take care to protect all of this. In line with the above, we do not reveal any information to third parties unless this has been expressly approved for release. This includes contracts, employee, customer and supplier data. In this way we ensure that confidential information is not passed on to unauthorised third parties. If we have good reason to pass on confidential information to third parties, we first ensure that they have signed a non-disclosure agreement. For our part, we also respect the intellectual property of others. Trust and confidentiality are mutual arrangements. All private use of business resources and office equipment is prohibited. Exceptions are governed by the relevant policies (e.g. private use of company cars). 11 Page 41 of 67 5. Customers and competition Unfair competition occurs when a company distorts competition or acts in an unethical way. We never deliberately communicate false or misleading information about our products or services. We are dependable partners. We meet our contractual obligations. Our purchasing decisions are based entirely on objective criteria such as the quality or price of a product or service. We never speak negatively or disparagingly about our competitors and their products or services. We do not take advantage of our customers or business partners. We do not engage in supply boycotts or enter into anti-competitive arrangements with competitors, suppliers or customers. In the project business sector we negotiate individual prices with our customers. These take into account our current price lists and terms & conditions, the complexity of the project and the competitive environment. There are clear regulations governing free-of-charge deliveries. We are familiar with the current company policies (e.g. “Free-of-Charge Policy”) and respect them. 12 Page 42 of 67 10th February 2015 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Appendix B Enterprise Policy TRIDONIC Page 43 of 67 Page 44 of 67 10th February 2015 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Appendix C Environment Health and Safety Policy Page 45 of 67 Page 46 of 67 10th February 2015 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Appendix D Ecolution – an initiative of TRIDONIC Page 47 of 67 Page 48 of 67 Sustainability at Tridonic Sustainability is more than just a word for us: it embodies our responsibility in all that we do. At Tridonic we adhere to a holistic sustainability concept. In keeping with our vision of “Through light, we care“, we take responsibility for our employees and our customers, for the environment and society – as a responsible employer, as a good neighbour and as a reliable business partner who offers high-quality products with the best possible properties. We are constantly looking to improve our sustainability credentials. We are helped in this respect by our sustainability strategy, a systematic sustainability programme with strategic objectives and concrete measures, and regular reporting on our activities and progress in all aspects of sustainability*. With close reference to our core business we are making a significant contribution to greater sustainability. Our products are helping our customers to manage their valuable energy resources efficiently, thereby helping the environment and creating financial benefits. *Sustainability report published by the Zumtobel Group: There are ordering and download options at tridonic.com/com/en/ecolution.asp Page 49 of 67 “The aim of our ecolution initiative is to show our customers that by using intelligent component solutions from Tridonic they can achieve greater convenience, improved economy and better quality of light, and all at reduced energy consumption. And to ensure that you benefit twice over – ecologically and economically.“ Alfred Felder, CEO Tridonic As part of our holistic sustainability concept, the Tridonic ecolution initiative stands for the added value in terms of sustainability and energy efficiency that we are offering our customers. Under the ecolution umbrella we have gathered together all the activities and measures that contribute to optimised and at the same time ecological lighting solutions for our customers. With this initiative we aim to make it absolutely clear to our customers exactly what Tridonic solutions can offer them in terms of sustainable added value. There are three aspects here: h Energy savings through technological innovation h Maximum quality and safety h Excellent customer service and advisory skills f Sustainability at Tridonic | Light & sustainability | Energy savings | Quality & safety | Customer service & advisory skills 2 3 Page 50 of 67 Light and sustainability Lighting and environmental protection are inextricably linked. Power for lighting makes up almost 19 % of global energy consumption and is also responsible for nearly 6 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. This corresponds to all the emissions from Germany and Japan combined. By combining modern light sources with innovative light management systems a large proportion of this can be reduced. 19% of global energy Fluorescent lamps still produce 70 % of artificial light 70% consumption is throughout the world 2 due to artificial lighting 1 99 Eco balance of a converter 3 % 6% of greenhouse gas emissions operation < 1 % production < 1 % transport < 1 % raw materials come from artificial lighting 2 < 1 % recycling 2020 would be the year in which three nuclear power plants could be shut down if Germany switched totally to LED lighting 4 75% of industry and office lighting in Europe is outdated or inefficient 2 Page 51 of 67 With appropriate ecological lighting design, efficient lighting technology and task-specific lighting control it is possible to reduce power consumption, operating costs and environmental impact considerably. h This is why at Tridonic we devote all our energy to your light.

Future School Programme, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) Customer requirements: Efficient light management in conjunction with significant energy savings. Light should only be switched on where and when it is needed. The Tridonic system solution: The luminaires were connected via the winDIM@net system and a DALI network with light sensors, motion sensors and timer switches. The light sensors enable natural daylight to be fully exploited, with dimming levels based on the amount of natural light available. With motion sensors and timer switches installed the lighting is only ever switched on when and where it is actually needed. More than 15,000 Tridonic products have been installed in 16 schools. Municipal Library and Culture Centre, Vallentuna near Stockholm, Sweden Customer requirements: Attractive optical lighting effects with an intelligent control system which also makes use of natural daylight. The lighting solution had to be easy to use and controllable from a central location. The Tridonic system solution: The entire lighting control functionality is handled via a DALI network. The intelligent light management system comprising more than 800 Tridonic products has led to a significant reduction in energy consumption and has made maintenance, monitoring and control much easier. The products included DALI TOUCHPANEL, DALI MSensor and TALEXXconverter. Morrisons supermarket chain, Bradford, UK Customer requirements: A reduction in energy costs and the same high quality of light. The Tridonic system solution: The old T8 fluorescent lamps and HF control gear have been replaced by state-of-the-art LED technology. With the aid of a total of more than 270,000 Tridonic products (including TALEXXmodule STARK LLE 24 and TALEXXconverter LCI 70 W 300 mA) Morrisons has been able to make energy savings of up to 70 %. This translates into annual savings of 195 tonnes of CO2 and 37,470 euros. Page 55 of 67 The results are crystal clear The example of rectangular recessed luminaires in the Office application shows that switching to LED lighting is a worthwhile move. If we compare different lighting solutions in a classic office with ros. And if a Tridonic lighting control system with daylight-dea floor space of around 63 m² and 15 luminaires, the differenpendent and presence-dependent control is added the total ce is very soon apparent. Replacing the existing T8 luminaires savings rise to an impressive 9150 euros. This changeover and magnetic ballasts with LED luminaires each equipped with would also reduce CO2 emissions from about 23 t to around four Tridonic QLE modules the savings in energy costs over 4.8 t. This corresponds to savings of almost 80 %. the entire lifetime of the system amount to around 6000 euCO2 emissions and energy costs over the lifetime of the system Switching from an existing lighting system comprising T8 luminaires and magnetic ballasts to an LED lighting solution with Tridonic QLE modules and Tridonic lighting control system can potentially offer savings of around 80 %. In concrete terms this represents a saving in energy costs of 9,150 euros. Assumptions: Room size (L x W x H): 12 x 5.3 x 3 m | No. of luminaires: 15 rectangular recessed luminaires | Electricity costs: 0.15 € per kWh with an annual increase of 5 % | Hours burned: 2700 h per year | Lifetime: 15 years | Emission rate: 0.43 kg CO2 per kWh | Lighting control: presence control (20 %) and daylight control (50 %) f Sustainability at Tridonic | Light & sustainability | Energy savings | Quality & safety | Customer service & advisory skills Page 568 9of 67 ecolution – maximum quality and safety From the initial idea to waste disposal at the customer‘s premises: Tridonic stands for quality, safety and transparency throughout the entire life cycle of a product.

Page 64 of 67 Corruption Perceptions Index 2014 Poorly equipped schools, counterfeit medicine and elections decided by money are just some of the consequences of public sector corruption. Bribes and backroom deals don’t just steal resources from the most vulnerable – they undermine justice and economic development, and destroy public trust in government and leaders. Based on expert opinion from around the world, the Corruption Perceptions Index measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption worldwide, and it paints an alarming picture. Not one single country gets a perfect score and more than two-thirds score below 50, on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). “Countries at the bottom need to adopt radical anti-corruption measures in favour of their people. Countries at the top of the index should make sure they don’t export corrupt practices to underdeveloped countries.” José Ugaz, Chair, Transparency International Corruption is a problem for all countries. A poor score is likely a sign of widespread bribery, lack of punishment for corruption and public institutions that don’t respond to citizens’ needs. Countries at the top of the index also need to act. Leading financial centres in the EU and US need to join with fast-growing economies to stop the corrupt from getting away with it. The G20 needs to prove its global leadership role and prevent money laundering and stop secret companies from masking corruption. Test your knowledge. Follow the discussion.
