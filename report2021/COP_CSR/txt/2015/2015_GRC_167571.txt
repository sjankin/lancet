In 2014, we managed to return to profitability, after five consecutive financial years of negative results, during which all ferry companies suffered heavy losses. By managing to restructure our operational model, we addressed successfully the complex challenges and intense competition which prevail in the passenger shipping industry. The factors which played a key part in this are the increased turnover and the reduction in operating costs and administrative expenses, without any lowering of the high standard of service which is synonymous with the Blue Star and Superfast vessels. In particular, in 2014 the Group's vessels carried 4.13 million passengers (2013: 3.76 million), 537.65 thousand private vehicles (2013: 503.42 thousand) and 263.96 thousand freight units (2013: 258.82 thousand). In line with our strategy for sustainable development, in 2014 our Group concluded a comprehensive agreement with the entirety of the Group’s lenders for the full and long-term reﬁnancing of its existing loans, and the agreement with funds managed by Fortress Investment Group. The long-term reﬁnancing of the Group's bank loans on conditions that enable us to look forward with optimism, constitutes a great success and an indisputable token of support by the investment and banking community to our Group's potential. Attica is the only Greek passenger shipping company which has managed to attract one of the largest investment funds internationally, a fact that constitutes a vote of trust to the Group's prospects. Furthermore, aiming to provide integrated services, in 2014 we enlarged our cooperation with ANEK S.A. with regards to the Joint Venture “Anek S.A. – Superfast Endeka (Hellas) Inc” for the joint service of vessels of the two companies in Adriatic Sea and in the domestic routes of Crete. The enhancement of this successful cooperation enabled us to provide, during difﬁcult times, highquality transport services for passengers and business travelers, with consistency and continuity, and is expected to create even greater synergies and new prospects for both Joint Venture partners. Finally, in November 2014 the sale of our RoPax vessel Blue Star Ithaki to the Government of Canada was concluded, resulting in Euro 4 million of net proﬁt for our Group. Through the years, our strategy has been steadily focused on maintaining practices that promote Fair Entrepreneurship in passenger shipping. In doing so, we have responded decisively, adopting a long-term perspective, to all our Customers' requirements, and to all needs in connection with the development of our Employees, our multifaceted contribution to Society and the protection of the Environment. A reference point for Attica Group are its people, who, driven by Greek seamanship and hospitality, are working with passion at sea and on land and are the Group's very soul and the strong voice of its vision. On our part, we encourage and constantly support their career development and growth, in a safe working environment that is based on mutual trust and respect, ensuring and helping them access opportunities for constant training, which promotes the Group's long-term sustainability. 4 Operating with increased responsibility towards the society and the local communities, Attica Group supports them in all their activities and initiatives, from culture and education to sports and health, contributing in this way to the improvement of the daily life of local residents in Greek islands. In this line, we continued for the 6th consecutive year, to great success, the Sun Protection preventive medicine programme; we organised ﬁrst aid training courses for the ﬁrst time in the islands of Tilos and Amorgos; we supported the Agoni Grammi Gonimi programme for the 8th consecutive year; and we responded to numerous requests from cultural societies, sports clubs, charities and public beneﬁt Foundations, the Church etc. Respect for the environment is an integral part of the Group's corporate culture. All our Superfast and Blue Star vessels operate in accordance with the International Safety Management (ISM) Code and apply all the provisions of European and Greek laws on the protection of the marine environment. Our sensitization to environmental issues is demonstrated in practice, as Attica Group is the ﬁrst Greek passenger shipping company that was certiﬁed for its Environmental Management System (ISO 14001) and it has also incorporated a series of environmental programs for climate rescue. In particular, seeking to develop energy-efﬁcient solutions, in 2014 we installed on a pilot basis, in collaboration with ECO MARINE POWER (EMP) and Japan-based KEI SYSTEM, a photovoltaic unit onboard our vessel, Blue Star Delos. The unit supplies electricity that is used to cover various needs onboard the vessel, thus reducing the use of the vessel's power generators, as well as fuel consumption and air emissions. We aim to expand this application and take advantage of the beneﬁts offered by solar technology, such as zero pollution, silent engine operation and minimal maintenance costs. Additionally, we are committed to be fully prepared to implement policies enabling control of air emissions on the basis of measurable results, as well as to manage more effectively all waste streams. With regards to our Corporate Governance, we paid particular attention to the promotion of Transparency in our sphere of inﬂuence and took an active part in the Global Compact initiative, signing onto the Call for Action , an appeal to governments to address corruption and bribery. In addition, we have set speciﬁc targets for 2015, such as the development of a Code of Business Ethics for our supply chain actors and the application of self-assessment tools in our business units in connection with Transparency and Human Rights issues. We should point out here that Attica Group is the only Greek passenger shipping company participating, from as early as 2008, in the UN Global Compact initiative. It is also the only passenger shipping company that actively participates in the Ministry of Development's consultation on the establishment of a National Action Plan for CSR . There is no doubt that, the Corporate Social Responsibility Report is an administration and management tool of crucial signiﬁcance. In this context, today we attempt to become more systematically involved in CSR policies and actions, so as to meet international standards and be ready for the statutory obligations to come. So in 2014 we applied for the ﬁrst time the process of Mapping the Environmental and Social issues most strongly affected by our business operation, in our internal as well as in our external environment. Furthermore we applied the materiality analysis process of the issues that concern our responsible and sustainable development, with the active engagement of our Stakeholders. In the same line, with our 6th consecutive annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report prepared for the ﬁrst time in accordance with the G4 Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative we wish to present, in an objective and transparent manner, our actions, results and commitments for the next ﬁnancial year. For all of us in Attica Group, our priority is to explore and develop opportunities, in the Greek as well as in the international market, which will enable us ﬁrst and foremost to ensure that the Group will be proﬁtable, in the interests of its shareholders, its employees and the Greek national economy. Proﬁtability depends on entrepreneurship, development, quality, the economy, mitigating risks, building a solid reputation, making the difference , standing out from the competition. Our voluntary initiatives and practices, which drive and complement our Group's responsible operation, will enable us to continue to lead developments in the decades to come. Spiros Ch. Paschalis Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 5 ATTICA GROUP CSR REPORT PROFILE The present publication is a ﬁrst attempt by ATTICA HOLDINGS S.A.

Joint Venture”. 10 Attica Group operates in strict compliance with the international, European and national legislation and is an active member of organisations and associations that shape the regulatory framework which governs its operation, with the aim of promoting the principles of safety and environmental protection. For the Group, adherence to the regulations in force is the minimum, and to this end, whenever feasible, the Group implements policies which are over and above its statutory obligations aiming at the provision of high-quality services, always taking into account the needs of all its Stakeholders. Applying this principle, the Group and its vessels are certiﬁed not only in accordance with the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, but also with the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 International Standards on Quality Assurance and Environmental Management which do not constitute statutory obligations. Attica Group, either through the Group's parent company ATTICA HOLDINGS S.A. or its subsidiaries (Blue Star Ferries and Superfast Ferries) participates on a voluntary basis in the following associations and organisations: (G4-16) The Association of Passenger Shipping Companies, since 1992 The Hellenic Chamber of Shipping (compulsory membership), since 1993 The High Level Ferry Group of the European Community Shipowners' Associations (ECSA), since 2003 The INTERFERRY Shipping Association, since 2003 The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE), since 2005 2. Economic Performance (G4-1) The Group's turnover for 2014 stood at Euro 266.66 million, an increase of 2.5% from Euro 260.16 million in 2013. A 64.5% of turnover was generated on Domestic routes (Greek coastal shipping) and 35.5% on Adriatic sea routes. Earnings before interest, taxes, investing and financial results, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew to Euro 42.35 million, from Euro 27.15 million in 2013. The Group reported Euro 4.27 million of after-tax profit for 2014, against Euro 10.13 million of after-tax loss in 2013. The factors which played a key part in helping bring the Group back to proﬁtability for the ﬁrst time since 2008 were the increase in turnover, the reduction in operating costs and especially fuel costs, as well as the reduction in distribution expenses and sales commissions. The reduction in operating costs was driven, for yet another year, by the Management's proactive scheduling of vessels’ sailings, which resulted in improved trafﬁc volumes per sailing, in combination with the maximisation of fuel savings, while maintaining the high quality of services always offered by the Blue Star and Superfast vessels.

Annual sailings increased by 4.9% compared to 2013. The substantial improvement of our economic performance for 2014 is the result of the Group’s collective effort, to achieve continuous growth, ensure the constant improvement of the services offered and secure stable relations of trust with customers and business partners, in the framework of our Corporate Social Responsibility. 11 ATTICA GROUP ECONOMIC VALUE TABLE (G4-EC1) Turnover 266,660,309.3€ Total (economic value created) 266,660,309.3€ Operating costs 193,608,937.5€ Employee salaries and beneﬁts 55,534,627.2 € Income tax and other taxes 200,126.7 € Capital providers 13,046,352.3 € Total (economic value distributed) 262,390,043.7 € Economic value distributed 98.4% Economic value retained 1.6% STATE SUBSIDIES (G4-EC4) Subsidies from the Manpower Employment Organisation 4,692€ (OAED) and the Ministry of Economy, Infrastructure, Maritime & Tourism (YNA) Investment, research and technology subsidies and 26,440€ other relevant types of subsidies PLEGMA S.A.

Our Approach (G4-1) The Group's Corporate Social Responsibility stems from its core principles as well as from its self-commitment to standards and multi-stakeholder initiatives in the domains of corporate social responsibility and sustainability (Global Compact, GRI). ATTICA Group Core Principles (G4-56) 1. Honest, fair and transparent transactions. 2. Quality and competence in the provision of services. 3.

Meritocratic approach to issues regarding personnel recruitment and the selection of business partners and suppliers. 5. Respect for the environment and increased awareness of environmental issues. 6. Full compliance with all Greek, European and international rules and regulations pertaining to our business activities. For Attica Group, 2014 was quite a productive year in terms of our progress with regard to Corporate Social Responsibility. More speciﬁcally, relevant activities comprised the following: 1. Mapping of the extent to which CSR is applied across the Group, by exploring at the level of policies, actions and results the CSR issues which concern the Group. The purpose of this mapping was to identify our strengths and weaknesses, so that we can proceed to determine the strategic directions for the development of CSR. Participation in the CSR mapping project included representatives from all Group Divisions, under the direction of the CSR Team. In parallel, the project provided opportunities for systematic dialogue and for expanding the understanding of the Group's policies, actions and performance with regard to social, environmental and economic issues. (G4-43) 2. Commitment by the Group to revise the CSR strategy applied so far, in the light of the results of the CSR Mapping project in 2015. 3. Implementation of actions and programmes in response to our Stakeholders' needs. 4. Implementation, for the ﬁrst time, of the Materiality Analysis process. 5. Publication of the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility Report following its approval by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO). (G4-48) 6. Participation in the consultation organised by the General Secretariat for Commerce on the National Action Plan for CSR. 7. Endorsement by the Group and signing onto the Call for Action initiative of the Global Compact against corruption and bribery. 13 Attica Group CSR Mapping PROCEDURES FOLLOWED BY THE GROUP OBJECTIVES METHODS 1.

Our Group's progress with regard to CSR and sustainable development is achieved with the contribution of the Group’s CSR Team, which enjoys operating flexibility within the Group and reports directly to the CEO. The key concern of the CSR Team is to develop, apply and evaluate the overall CSR strategy of our Group in terms of policies, targets, actions and results in connection with important environmental, social and ethical issues both within the Group and in relation to its external environment. The CSR Team is composed of executives from four (4) Divisions (Human Resources, Marine Operations, Legal & Corporate Affairs, and Domestic & International Lines Sales and Marketing) and is tasked with coordinating the promotion of CSR to the Group's Divisions and with encouraging the latter's participation in related programmes and actions that the Group undertakes. Furthermore, the completion of speciﬁc projects, such as the preparation of the Group's annual CSR Report, the CSR Mapping project and the engagement of the Group's Stakeholders, is made possible with the support that the CSR Team receives from all Group Divisions. (G4 – 36) It should be mentioned here that Attica Group is a voluntary and active member of a signiﬁcant number of institutional bodies and authorities, both in Greece and abroad, through which it seeks to promote the role of Corporate Social Responsibility in the economy and society.

Materiality analysis of sustainability issues (G4-1) In 2014, for the ﬁrst time based on the methodology of the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, the Group determined the social, environmental, economic and governance-related issues of priority, together with their impact and corresponding boundaries, taking also into consideration their combined signiﬁcance for the Group and for its Stakeholders. The process for identifying the materiality issues helped pinpoint the issues for which the Group's impact is considered to be of particular signiﬁcance in all business activity areas of its subsidiaries and for which the Group undertakes to monitor on an ongoing basis. The steps taken by the Group for the identiﬁcation of the materiality issues were the following: (G4-18) 1. The sustainability issues were identiﬁed through internal procedures meetings between top executives and the CSR Team. Account was also taken of the issues raised by Stakeholders through the Group's Stakeholder Engagement 2. A thorough examination was carried out of all (dialogue) networks, as these have been related aspects, at the level of corporate values presented in previous CSR Reports. and principles and of the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics, as well as at the level of national and international regulations affecting the Group's compliance requirements. In identifying these issues, particular attention 3. The issues identiﬁed as a result of the above, was also paid to the indicators laid down in the GRI which come under the areas of Environment, Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and to the Labour Practices, Market, Human Rights, Society, principles of the UN Global Compact. and Economic Performance-Governance, were further examined by the Group for determining their impact and assessing their signiﬁcance, using the criteria of the Materiality Principle. 4. In parallel, custom questionnaires were also developed, on the same issues, for each Stakeholder group, so that Stakeholders could rate the signiﬁcance of each issue in terms of its impact on 5. Finally, the process was completed with the merging their relation with the Group and its subsidiaries. of the results from the two procedures described The questionnaires were e-mailed to the majority above (for the Group and for its Stakeholders), of the Group's Stakeholders. In the particular case of through which the synthesis of the views expressed passengers, collection of the completed questionnaires and the ﬁnal classiﬁcation of the speciﬁc issues was made possible with the assistance of the were obtained.

Relations with Stakeholders Recognising that its decisions and activities may affect to a greater or lesser extend a number of its Stakeholder groups, the Group has identiﬁed the following categories of key Stakeholder groups: Employees, Passengers, Sales Network Port Agents, Suppliers, State & Regulatory Authorities, Local Communities, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Media, Shareholders. (G4-24) The approach that we adopted in order to identify the speciﬁc Stakeholder groups is related to the Group's internal and external environment, as well as to the extent that the Group affects them and is affected by them. (G4-25) The Group's relations with its Stakeholders are based on trust and credibility. This is also the result of the constant interaction, on a daily basis, with most of our Stakeholder groups, which allows us to strengthen the dialogue and to create conditions enabling the exchange of views. Our key Stakeholder engagement methods are listed in the table below, together with a summary of the key issues raised during 2014, primarily by Employees, the State and Regulatory Authorities, Local Communities Local Social Collectivities and NGOs. It should be mentioned here that, based on the results of the Group's CSR Mapping project, the need was identiﬁed for introducing a formal consultation process with the Group's Stakeholders, which will provide us with an opportunity to strengthen the Group's position, based on the precautionary principle in connection with social, environmental and governance issues. In addition, Stakeholder engagement (dialogue) activities for speciﬁc Stakeholder groups such as Employees, Local Communities Local Social Collectivities and NGOs, were carried out in 2014 for the purposes of the present Report.

Available from the Group's website, at www.attica-group.com 24 EMPLOYMENT, LABOUR PRACTICES & HUMAN RIGHTS 1. Human Resources (G4-10) Attica Group is centred on people, recognising that its sustainable development is inseparable from the potential of its personnel. With the aim of driving the constant development of the skills of our employees on land and onboard our vessels, and with respect for the internationally recognised principles regarding the protection of Human Rights, we seek to secure a fair and safe work environment for all our personnel. Our Group ensures that the employment practices and the work conditions are Above and Beyond Compliance with existing laws and regulations. In 2014, the Group employed a total of 1,192 people, of which 1,010 marine personnel and 182 land personnel. The total number of crew members employed at any given time is determined by the legislation and the deployment requirements of our ﬂeet's vessels as a function of the services to be operated. 15% Marine Personnel Attica Group Workforce by type of service 85% Land Services Attica Group Workforce by type of service and gender 1,200 1,192 1,044 1,000 1,010 960 800 600 400 200 182 148 84 98 0 50 GROUP EMPLOYEES MARINE PERSONNEL LAND PERSONNEL Total Men Woman 25 Supervised Marine personnel Land personnel Men Women employees of the Group 35 5 26 14 The Group is employing 908 people under contracts of indeﬁnite duration.

(G4-11) 2. Employment and beneﬁts Our human resources are a key driver of the Group's progress and growth. In this context, the divisions of Marine Personnel and Human Resources accordingly have adopted practices for the merit-based selection of the best candidates, in order to ensure that the Group's employees achieve a best ﬁt. The policy followed is derived from the implementation of international standards such as ISO 9001 and is fully aligned with the legislation on labour and the contractual terms applicable under the Collective Agreements in force. More speciﬁcally: The Marine Personnel Division is responsible for the selection and recruitment of ofﬁcers and crew as well as all aspects of seagoing personnel administration. In addition, the Division is also responsible for ensuring adherence to the minimum composition of vessel crews imposed by the law and for all related matters, also in accordance with the Greek and international legislation. The Human Resources Division (HRD) is responsible for the selection and recruitment of land personnel, and has originated and implemented practices designed to leverage people’s skills. In particular, to prevent discrimination and promote equality and diversity, the Group gives preference to internal candidates before looking externally to fill vacancies by notifying information to all employees. In the event that no suitable internal candidate exists, recruitment takes place externally from the labour market, ensuring in all cases that candidates will possess the required capabilities and effectiveness, in accordance with our Group's culture and business values. Candidates must meet the required qualiﬁcations speciﬁed in the relevant job description regarding the duties and responsibilities of the respective position or, in exceptional cases, as identiﬁed and described in the speciﬁc vacancy request. 26 Recruitment of new employees by gender, age group Land personnel and geographic region (G4-LA1) Recruitment of new employees Total 12 Men 6 Women 6 <30 y.o. 10 30-50 y.o. 2 Region of origin Attica 12 Employee departures by gender, age group and geographic Land personnel region (G4-LA1) Employee departures Total 7 Men 2 Women 5 <30 y.o. 4 30-50 y.o. 3 Region of origin Attica 7 Workforce diversiﬁcation by administrative level Land personnel only (182 persons) (G4-LA12) Top Management % Men 85.7 Women 14.3 30-50 y.o. 28.6 >50 y.o. 71.4 Management Executives % Men 95.0 Women 5.0 30-50 y.o. 50.0 >50 y.o. 50.0 Administrative Personnel % Men 39.4 Women 60.6 <30 y.o. 12.5 30-50 y.o. 76.3 >50 y.o. 11.3 During 2014, no complaints were recorded in the Group involving a violation of labour practices, a result that encourages us to continue on the same path during the next year, with equal dedication. (G4-LA16) 27 Above and beyond statutory requirements, the Group extends a number of additional beneﬁts to its employees in order to establish the best possible working conditions for its people and to improve the standard of living and their families. The speciﬁc beneﬁts are shown in the table below: Additional beneﬁts granted to Attica Group employees (G4-LA2) Marine personnel Land personnel Health and medical care • Coverage against disability/incapacitation • Refreshments and light meal • 143 Company phones • • 55 parking spaces • Support for participating in postgraduate programmes • Christmas cheques for the amount of €40 per child, for Group employees' children aged up to 12 • Organisation of annual Christmas festive event • Life insurance • Provision of free tickets and meals onboard our vessels, • • together with discounts of 50% for their ﬁrst-degree relatives 3. Occupational Health and Safety The Group has set as its primary goal to ensure that its employees work in an environment that will offer health and safety conditions of a high standard. To this end, the Group maintains written policies and procedures that meet the needs of both marine and land personnel. In parallel, it also makes available the resources needed for the implementation of related activities. Furthermore, constant efforts are made on an on-going basis to improve the standards and procedures through training and the adoption of new practices and technology. The Group considers the safety of our employees to be a non-negotiable minimum obligation, as our aim is not to merely meet but to surpass the requirements of the relevant legislation. For this reason, appropriate attention is paid to the human factor, through training sessions, drills, the provision of suitable equipment and materials and the maintenance of all main and auxiliary machinery in perfect working order. The relevant activities are evaluated at regular intervals, with a signiﬁcant contribution to the formulation and revision of the Group's Health & Safety policies being made by the Injury Rate (ΙR²). For 2014, this rate stood at 1.21, which is considered a satisfactory performance, as it refers to incidents involving very light injury. In addition, no fatalities or other incidents involving occupational diseases were reported in the Group during the year (G4-LA6). More speciﬁcally, 17 incidents of light injury occurred during 2014 for the Group's entire workforce, of which 16 incidents involved men employees and one (1) incident involved one woman employee. Attica Group Health & Safety Indicators (G4-LA6) Injury Rate (IR) 1.21 Men 1.29 Women 0.63 Lost Days Rate (LDR) Work days lost due to injuries 62.16 or occupational diseases Men 66 Women 32.19 Absenteeism Rate (AR) Employees' absence from work due to injuries, 0.46% occupational diseases or other causes rendering them unﬁt for work Men 0.36% Women 1.18% 2. The ΙR indicator refers to the frequency of incidents involving injury per 200,000 hours worked. 28 In tandem with safety and with equal consistency and responsibility, the Group is paying due attention to health issues and considers as its immediate priority to ensure adherence to the minimum acceptable health standards it has introduced, so that both employees and passengers can enjoy survives of a high quality. Additionally, voluntary standards and management systems, such as ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 22000 (Services)HACCP (Food Safety), MLC 2006 (Maritime Labour Convention), are also applied and certiﬁed where this is considered necessary, demonstrating the Group's commitment to continuous improvement. These are audited on the basis of speciﬁc written procedures, by the Group's internal competent units as well as by external organisations, with the ﬁnal users of the services concerned always having the last word. 4. Education, Training and Development Education and training are crucial tools for stimulating employee development and engagement, customer service, and the overall competitiveness of the company. Training needs are determined according to job descriptions, the level of knowledge and skills of personnel, and the Group's strategic goals and objectives. In particular: For our marine personnel, the responsibility for planning and delivering training programmes rests with the following Divisions, working closely together: (a) Fleet Operations, regarding the Quality and Environmental Management System (QEMS) and the Safe Management System (SMS); and (b) Hotel Operations and Customer Services, regarding catering and accommodation onboard our vessels. Related activities in this context include scheduled class training in speciﬁc subjects, drills, training videos, brieﬁngs by vessel Masters and the keeping of training records and certiﬁcates for vessel crew members. For land personnel, the Human Resources Division is responsible for the Group's training plan, on the basis of the training policies in place, i.e. the participation of employees in seminars and conferences as well as attendance of postgraduate programmes. The Training & Development Department of the HRD is responsible for identifying the training needs and selecting the appropriate corresponding training organisation, in cooperation with the respective Division. The Department's responsibilities also include the preparation of the annual training plan and budget, the ﬁnalisation of the training plan, the keeping of relevant training records, as well as the approval and reporting procedures involving the Company's Management. In 2014, the training programmes carried out totalled 883 training hours. The key training subjects covered technical issues, sales and management. Average annual training hours per employee, by gender and employment category (G4-LA9) Land services Average training hours by employee (Total) 3.3 Average training hours by employee (Men) 3.9 Average training hours by employee (Women) 2.8 Average training hours by employee (Executives) 3 Average training hours by employee (Administrative personnel) 3.4 Marine personnel Average training hours by employee (Total) 0.2 Average training hours by employee (Men) 0.2 Average training hours by employee (Executives) 1.3 Training programmes and seminars – Training programmes and seminars Marine personnel: (G4-LA10) Land services personnel: (G4-LA10) • Safe Work Practices • Shipping • Marine Environmental Awareness • Finance • Hazard Management of Vessel Operations • Labour/Insurance • Electronic Chart Display • Management topics (HR, CSR) and Information Systems (ECDIS) • Customer service Navigation Certiﬁcate • Safety / Security 29 In line with our strategy to maintain a leading role in the shipping industry, create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders and support the development of our employees, the Group is applying a Performance Appraisal System, developed in accordance with skills, competencies, and organizational objectives set by the Human Resources Division. The Performance Appraisal System allows the Group to assess the employees’ job performance and productivity in relation to certain pre-established skills, competencies and organizational goals and objectives on a yearly basis. PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL SYSTEM PA Competencies Stages • Transparency • Establishment of individual Performance Plan • Respect for the Individual • Performance Management/Mentoring • Freedom of expression • Annual Performance Review • Delegation of responsibilities • Meritocracy • Team spirit It should be mentioned here that the CSR Mapping project identiﬁed the need for systematically applying the Performance Appraisal System, together with the need for implementing an Employee Satisfaction Survey. The Group is committed to improve its practices in this respect. 5. Human Rights, Diversity and Equal Opportunities We are committed to the internationally recognised principles regarding the protection of Human Rights, as these are determined in the United Nations' Universal Declaration on Human Rights, of which the Group is a signatory. In Attica Group, we acknowledge and commit ourselves to the Principles of the UN Global Compact and have incorporated them in our Code of Business Ethics. In particular, we are committed to recruit only individuals whose age is above the minimum legal age for employment, as per Greek legislation. We are also committed to ensuring that no incident of forced labour occurs in all our facilities. During 2014, no reports or complaints were lodged involving a violation of Human Rights in our Group, whether concerning discrimination and inequality at the workplace or child and forced labour. We acknowledge, however, that during 2015 we will need to introduce in our business units self-control and self-assessment procedures in connection with Human Rights issues. We will also need to develop and promote to our supply chain actors a Code of Business Ethics for Suppliers and Contractors, in order to ensure that all our business partners acknowledge, adhere to and protect Human Rights and take steps to eliminate discrimination in their workplace. (G4-HR3, G4-HR5, G4-HR6, G4-HR12) 30 SOCIETY 1. Compliance (G4-SO8) The Group is fully committed to ensuring its strict compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements and with all national and international legislation governing the shipping industry. The high quality of our services is the result of the fulfilment of all necessary conditions and of our dedication to the proper operation of the Group and its subsidiaries. During 2014, no ﬁnes or non-monetary sanctions were imposed on the Group for non-compliance. 2. Ethics Integrity Actions to Safeguard Transparency Fully committed to our principles and values, in Attica Group we continue to win the trust of our business partners and customers and to successfully meet all demanding requirements in order to promote the best quality of our products and services. To this end, the principles of the Global Compact and the Group's Code of Business Ethics, which is derived from international practices, existing regulatory obligations and internal practices, serve as our reference and guide our employees towards the adoption of a shared professional conduct, while also strengthening our corporate identity vis-a-vis all our Stakeholders. The implementation, updating and highlighting of the corporate values and standards of conduct in the Group's Code comes under the responsibility of the Human Resources Division (HRD), working in close cooperation with the Group's Top Management. To this end, specific procedures have been adopted, especially for newly-recruited personnel, such as induction training and brieﬁngs, drawing on the Group's Manuals and covering the Personnel Work Regulation and the Code of Business Ethics. (G4-56) The Group recognises the importance of initiatives to combat and eliminate corruption in all business transactions and to safeguard transparency across the entire range of its corporate activities. In this context, in December 2014 we endorsed and signed onto the Call for Action initiative of the Global Compact. Furthermore, a standing commitment of the Group is the fulﬁlment of all obligations and responsibilities towards its shareholders and the supervisory authorities. To achieve this, there is an Auditing Committee, whose responsibilities include control of the Group's compliance with the laws, provisions, internal operation regulations and Management decisions, as well as the examination of corrective actions in cases of non-compliance. (G4-SO3) Paying appropriate attention to the issues of transparency and combating corruption, at the level of transactions with our business partners as well as at the Group level, we are already focusing on planning and developing additional initiatives. As already mentioned, we have set ourselves as a target for the next year the development and promotion to our supply chain actors of a Code of Business Ethics for Suppliers and Contractors, in line with the principles and values that govern our Group. During 2014, no incident of corruption was recorded in our Group (G4-SO5) and no complaints were made in connection with any negative impact of the Group's activity. In addition, the Group during 2014 was not the subject of any petitions to the Courts for anti-competitive behaviour. (G4-SO7,G4-SO11) Finally, the Group has made no financial contribution to political parties or related institutions. (G4-SO6) 31 3. Support of Local Communities In addition to caring for the environment, our Group's policy also extends to supporting local communities in connection with a broad range of local activities and initiatives that range from culture and education to sports and health, proving in a very tangible way that, in addition to serving transport and communication, the sea can also bring places, destinations, people, attitudes and ideas closer together. Our Group embraces local communities and contributes to the improvement of the daily life of local residents in Greek islands, with particular emphasis on remote islands. From the very start, the local communities in which our business activities are based have been at the core of the development of our comprehensive Corporate Social Responsibility programme, which keeps in touch with local needs and responds to them, creating conditions that help enhance the quality of life in the local communities. In this context, our Group responds regularly to numerous requests for donations or indirect sponsorships to associations located in the Aegean islands. In particular, tradition, culture and sports have for many years been a broad area of social contribution for the Group. Every year, we offer a large number of discount or free tickets to associations, entities, non-proﬁt organisations, unions, festivals etc., assisting them in their efforts to pursue their objectives. The responsibility for the implementation of our Group's social policy rests with the Domestic & International Lines Marketing & Sales Divisions and the corresponding Marketing & Sales Departments. In the context of its Corporate Social Responsibility, the Group has developed voluntary initiatives aimed at aiding the local communities with which it has developed close ties through the Greek coastal shipping services it operates. In addition, the Group is also collaborating with various Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Finally, the Group's social contribution can be appreciated through the programmes it is involved in, which have direct social and environmental impacts within its sphere of inﬂuence. Sun Protection preventive medicine programme From 2008 to this day, under the Sun Protection programme, an initiative of the Group in collaboration with the Melampous NGO, 2,760 residents in various Greek islands have beneﬁted from free tests of skin moles and have been supplied with information about the prevention of skin cancer. In addition, in order to provide the public with information about the appropriate self-examination methods, the Group has published relevant information leaﬂets, distributed at our central and port agencies and onboard our domestic line vessels throughout the year. During 2014, the programme visited the islands of Tinos and Symi, where a total of 349 persons were examined, as shown in the table below. It should be mentioned here that this initiative of the Group was presented with an award, for the second consecutive year, in the category Support of local communities of the 2014 Tourism Awards.

The purpose of the Life AMMOS initiative is to help establish an environmentally responsible attitude, which seeks to achieve multiple and long-term benefits for the local community. To this end and with respect for the protection of the environment, the Group undertakes initiatives towrads the prevention and minimization of smoking-related litter at the beaches, by participating in the Life AMMOS programme. During 2014, the Life AMMOS programme was implemented, in collaboration with the Mediterranean-SOS (MEDSOS) Network, in the following six island destinations of the Blue Star Ferries lines: Paros, Santorini, Lesvos, Chios, Rhodes and Crete. In total, we distributed 15,000 disposable beach ashtrays in various beaches on these islands. We also distributed 25,200 information leaﬂets to passengers onboard our vessels and briefed face-to-face 360 passengers. In parallel, we distributed 3,200 information leaﬂets through our port ofﬁces in Piraeus, Rhodes, Paros, Santorini, Chios and Lesvos. According to the results of country-wide sample surveys conducted in 13 of the 15 beaches over a period of one year, beach pollution appears to have been reduced by 73% overall, with reduction percentages ranging from 18.5% to 90.1% for the individual beaches. Irrespective of the Group's participation in the Life AMMOS Project, our Group has contributed to the dissemination of the message about the need to keep beaches clean since 2007. Since then and up to the end of 2014, the Group has printed and distributed a total of 1,298,500 beach ashtrays. Of these, 173,000 were printed and distributed during 2014. Agoni Grammi Gonimi programme For the eighth consecutive year, the Group continues to help the efforts to provide equal access to education and culture for all, through its participation in the Agoni Grammi Gonimi programme addressed to children and adults living on small Greek islands. For 2014, the programme's activities comprised piano, guitar, mosaic, martial arts, dance, theatrical play and pilates training workshops, a small planetarium, educational concerts given by the Athens State Orchestra and Opera nights. In all the islands visited, the programme and its activities were warmly received by schoolchildren and adults alike.

In particular, all Blue Star Ferries vessels sailing to the Cyclades, the Dodecanese and Crete, have available at their reception desks information material on sea birds, inviting passengers to observe them during their trip, identify them and record their details in a custom form or enter their observations by visiting the following website: www.ornithologiki.gr/seabirds. In this way, our passengers expand their knowledge and participate in an active and valuable way in the scientiﬁc work of the Hellenic Ornithological Society, which will be used to expand the Natura 2000 network in the marine environment. During 2014, the Society received 346 electronic entries of sea bird sightings (covering more than 1,000 sea birds of 5 species) & 52 entries of sightings made using the custom form distributed onboard the Group's vessels and from its port agencies. Finally, the Group offers discount and free tickets for the necessary travels of the programme's experts, who visit the islands in order to observe and record the birds in their natural habitats. Blood Ties Since 2009 the Group has established a blood donation program twice over the year, a valuable collective and voluntary contribution that promotes the spirit of solidarity, in response to requests by residents of remote Greek islands served by the Group's vessels and to personal health emergencies of our employees and their families. The Group's blood drive, organised in 2014 for the sixth consecutive year, collected 69 blood units donated by volunteers from its personnel. As every year, the blood drive was organised in the months of May and September in collaboration with the G. Gennimatas General Hospital and was held in the Group's head offices and onboard its vessels at berth in Piraeus on the date scheduled for the blood drive. First Aid Training Courses In collaboration with the Volunteer Crisis Rescue Team (EDOK), in 2014 the Group launched an initiative to provide local residents in Greek islands with information and training in the administration of ﬁrst aid in cases of injury and in responding to emergencies. The ﬁrst training courses were organised in Tilos and Amorgos and were attended by 120 people in total. The ultimate aim of this initiative is to create local rescue teams composed of permanent local residents and to provide them with further specialised training, so that they will be able to deal with emergencies using locally available means. 34 ATTICA GROUP COLLABORATIONS IN 2014 ENTITIES PROGRAMME MELAMPOUS NGO Sun Protection Volunteer Crisis Rescue Team (EDOK) First Aid G.

Safe Management of Vessels, Protection of Passenger Health and Safety, Certiﬁcations The Group places great emphasis on the protection of the health and safety of passengers during their sea travel. With a comprehensive framework of integrated procedures in place, derived from the management systems which the Group is applying (ISM, ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 22000HACCP, MLC), we create onboard our vessels the conditions required to minimise the potential risks that could affect the safety of passengers and the efﬁciency of our operation. Our primary purpose is to create conditions that meet high safety, quality, health and hygiene standards. The Hotel Operations & Customer Services Department and the Fleet Operations Department are responsible for managing, implementing and auditing the relevant policies. Constant efforts are being made to improve the standards and procedures onboard our vessels, through training and adoption of new practices and technology. For the Group, the health and safety of our passengers is a non-negotiable minimum obligation, as our aim is not to merely meet but to surpass the requirements of the relevant legislation. For this reason, the support of both the human factor through training sessions, drills, technical equipment as well as, keeping all main and auxiliary machinery in perfect working order is proper and effective. Concerning passengers indicatively we mention that a safety video is displayed for their information / familiarisation referring to the vessel's safety procedures, a demonstration regarding the use of life jackets is held and ﬁnally visible safety signs are posted. Additionally, in every vessel a Safety Committee is set up, with responsibility to monitor and asses issues concerning the safety and health of passengers, the protection of the environment etc. Regarding products and especially foodstuffs that are offered to our passengers, the Group's policy is that these should comply fully with the hygiene and safety requirements of the regulations in force. In this respect, the Group requires suppliers and catering contractors operating on its vessels to undertake the contractual obligation to implement and abide to the necessary quality and food safety management systems (ISO 9001 and ISO 22000-HACCP). Furthermore, Masters along with the other Heads of Departments carry out constant inspections of the areas where food is offered for consumption, stored, maintained and prepared, seeking to continuously improve the food hygiene and safety levels. As far as hotel services are concerned, the Group in full alignment with national and international regulations, ensures daily that high hygiene and safety standards are maintained, with continuous inspections, regular disinfection of public and catering areas, compliance with the clothing management procedures and the procedures concerning the precautions taken to protect passengers from food-related allergens. Aiming to maximise the satisfaction of our passengers, we are constantly searching for ways in which to provide optimal and innovative services. An example in this respect was the introduction by our Group in the Greek and Adriatic Sea market, for the ﬁrst time ever, of the PURE Cabin category of cabins, in line with leading standards worldwide. This type of cabin provides customers who are particularly sensitive to airborne particles with the ultimate comfort level in accommodation, thanks to its state-of-theart technology, which puriﬁes the air and the surfaces in the cabin. After a PURE Cabin has been used, it is cleaned and puriﬁed and a cleaning certiﬁcate is issued, showing the corresponding inspection date. (G4-PR1) The Group attaches particular signiﬁcance to certify by the relevant ofﬁcial bodies, all procedures it implements regarding all services offered and the products handled onboard the vessels. The renewal of these certiﬁcations, which takes place annually or at other 37 regular intervals, allows us to regularly conﬁrm the correctness of the procedures which guarantee our smooth internal operation and, at the same time, prompts us to keep introducing improvements in order to maintain the high quality of the services and products we offer to our customers. During 2014, no signiﬁcant ﬁnes, penalties or warnings were imposed to the Group in connection with incidents of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes applied and which concern the impacts of its products and services. (G4-PR2) The only ﬁnes imposed to the Group during 2014, in the amount of €2,534.72, concerned 21 cases of delayed departure, by the Port Authorities. It should be mentioned that these delays were caused by our response to requests from passengers and business professionals, while in many cases occurred as a result of the vessels' initiative to provide hospital care for passengers, assist other vessels in their vicinity or respond to other emergencies requiring not only tolerance on our part but also the offer of immediate assistance. (G4-PR9) 2. Responsible Communication & Marketing The relationship of trust between the Group's companies and our customers is the result of the objective information about our products and services, which we provide in a responsible manner, in order to fully cover the needs of those choosing to travel onboard our Blue Star Ferries and Superfast Ferries vessels. By following the principles of the Hellenic Code of Advertising-Communication Practice of the Communication Control Council, the responsible communication and marketing practices we apply in the Group ensure the validity of the communication material disseminated to the public through leaﬂets, radio, television and the Internet. The Domestic & International Lines Marketing & Sales Departments, in collaboration with the Group's Legal Department, ensure the control and proper communication of the promotional messages and advertisements for our products and services, seeking to avoid any potentially misleading advertising and/or stereotypes which may constitute an infringement of the personality of our customers, our business partners and/or the competition in general. One of our key priorities is to provide the public with timely and responsible information about changes to our itineraries and about offers, using all communication channels available (websites of the Group's subsidiaries, radio announcements, Press and information portals, briefing of port agents, briefing of customers by SMS, information newsletters etc.). In addition, starting with the Blue Star Ferries and Superfast Ferries websites, which are structured in such a way as to also be accessible by people with special needs (vision impairments), the Group aims to facilitate and make possible the provision of information also to this audience. During 2014 no incidents were recorded involving non-compliance by the Group with the regulations and voluntary codes on marketing communications, including advertising, product promotion and sponsorship.

Protection of passengers' personal data and property Operating according to the letter and the spirit of the law, we take care to secure the personal data of our customers. The personal data of passengers, business professionals, visitors to our websites and users of the Group's services in general are kept in a secure database. At the same time, their conﬁdentiality is preserved and they are not communicated to third parties unless this is required by the law and/or the competent Authorities. During 2014 no complaints were made to the Group for breaches of privacy in connection with the personal data of customers. (G4-PR8) Concerning the protection of passengers' property, passengers onboard our vessels can deliver to the Purser's Department for safekeeping money or valuables whose value does not exceed €500. In all other cases, the Group's companies bear no responsibility for any loss of money or valuables not delivered for safekeeping. In cases where luggage is lost or damaged, the Hotel Operations & Customer Services Department follows a procedure involving the search for the lost luggage or the investigation of the causes of the damage and, where there are grounds for compensation, the provisions of the law are applied. 2014: PIECES OF LUGGAGE LOST/FOUND OR DAMAGED Adriatic Sea lines 526 Domestic lines 4,109 2014: COMPENSATIONS PAID BY THE GROUP FOR LUGGAGE AND OTHER DAMAGES (€) 40,282 Cost of compensations for luggage 33,739 Cost of other compensations 6,544 It is pointed out that the corresponding amount for compensations in 2013 stood at €38,384.08 for a total number of 3.76 million passengers served, against 4.13 million passengers served during 2014. In the event that vehicles sustain a deterioration or other damage for which the Group is responsible during boarding/disembarkation or during the journey, the Damage Report procedure is followed. 2014: COMPENSATIONS PAID BY THE GROUP FOR VEHICLE DAMAGES (€) 33,674.18 Cost of compensations for vehicles 33,674.18 It is pointed out that the corresponding amount for compensations in 2013 stood at €42,132.75 and involved 36 incidents, with the total number of vehicles carried standing at 503.48 thousand, against 537.65 thousand vehicles carried during 2014. 39 4. Customer Service & Satisfaction With the key aim to ensure that the Group's subsidiaries are acknowledged by our customers as responsible companies that maintain high standards of service, we employ a number of communication tools and means which provide us with data for evaluating our performance. To this end, the Group's Customer Services and Loyalty Department is responsible for approving, revising and implementing the following specific procedures: 1. Management of the Customer Services Call Center and e-mails. 2. Option for the customers to communicate in writing with the Group companies, in connection with comments, complaints and other requests. 3. Option for arranging face-to-face meetings with customers. 4. Management of the Sea Smiles Loyalty Programme, which provides a range of privileges and offers to its members. 5. Implementation of the Mystery Passenger investigative procedure, aimed at ensuring effective operation of our companies, quality services and prompt response to our customers' new needs. This procedure is applied three times per year, onboard domestic and international lines vessels, with the aim of evaluating 17 passenger service sections. We mailed through the post a total of 660 formal letters by the Group in response to requests, complaints and comments, as follows: LETTERS IN RESPONSE TO COMMENTSTHANK-YOU LETTERS COMPLAINTS-REQUESTS Adriatic Sea lines 185 43 Domestic lines 348 84 Total 533 127 We also managed the memberships database of the SeaSmiles Loyalty programme, which since its launch and until the end of 2014 numbered 121,650 members. During 2014, we welcomed to the programme 49,757 new members. Finally, in the context of the Mystery Passenger procedure and based on the results for 2014, no revisions or improvements to procedures were considered necessary. Furthermore, during 2014 we successfully served: • 1,994 passengers with particular requirements (728 in the Adriatic Sea lines and 1,266 in the Domestic lines) • 512 passengers with reduced mobility (178 in the Adriatic Sea lines and 334 in the Domestic lines) • 398 passengers sensitive to allergens, • 117 passengers were given ﬁrst aid at sea, Of this total number of corresponding incidents, 101 incidents occurred in Domestic lines itineraries with our service Are you a Doctor? responding to 79 of them. Out of the 16 incidents which occurred in Adriatic Sea lines itineraries, our service Are you a Doctor? responded to 5. For the Group, the continuous investigation and enhancement of the satisfaction of the people who trust us for their sea travel is a standard business practice. In this context, we provide our customers with opportunities to evaluate us, so that we can improve the level of our services and beneﬁts and identify and respond to their new needs and expectations. (DMA, G4-PR5). During 2014, we received 1,189 completed evaluation forms regarding the services and beneﬁts offered onboard our vessels, made using the custom comment form available in all the Group's vessels. 40 In addition, four (4) satisfaction surveys were carried out at various intervals during 2014, in our Domestic and International lines. More speciﬁcally, the following were carried out: (G4-PR5) 1. Passenger satisfaction survey in all domestic and international lines, conducted by personal interviews onboard our vessels (January-March 2014) 2. Domestic lines passenger satisfaction survey focusing on company selection criteria, conducted by phone interviews (14-22 January 2014) 3. Satisfaction survey of associated travel agencies in Greece, conducted using questionnaires sent out by e-mail (20 March to 14 April 2014). 4. Satisfaction survey of professional drivers in the Adriatic Sea international lines / the ports of Igoumenitsa and Patras, conducted by personal interviews (20 March to 16 April 2014). The ﬁndings of the surveys carried out in the Domestic and International lines showed high customer satisfaction rates across the board and a convergence of views on issues such as the feeling of safety conveyed by the Attica Group vessels in connection with sea travel, followed by consistency, cleanliness of public areas and cabins and the friendly behaviour of crew members during customer service. (G4-PR5) Additionally, areas where needs for further improvement were identiﬁed include ticket price, prices in bars and restaurants, speed, frequency of itineraries serving our destinations primarily in the NE Aegean, and further improvements to the services provided in the shops (gift shops and & Boutiques) onboard our vessels. In what in particular regards the image of Blue Star Ferries, which operates services on the Greek coastal shipping routes, the company's key strengths emerged to be the trust and consistency it inspires to passengers and its modern and fast ﬂeet. As for Superfast Ferries, which operates primarily in international lines, the company totally dominates the market in the category company with the best vessels . (G4-PR5) Furthermore, our subsidiary Super Fast Ferries was given with a satisfaction rating of 8.7 out of a maximum 10 by professional drivers. (G4-PR5) Finally, the areas identiﬁed in our travel agent satisfaction survey in connection with improvements to our business partnership concern mostly ﬁnancial issues such as fee/commission, credit policy and pricing policy issues. (G4-PR5) 41 ENVIRONMENT 1. Compliance with Environmental Legislation Respect for the environment is an integral part of the Group's corporate culture. By acknowledging and assessing the impacts of our operation on the environment and on the local communities, the Group is committed in the framework of the relevant European and Greek legislation to its full compliance and takes additional measures and initiatives to minimise these impacts. To this end, the Group ensures that adequate resources (personnel, materials and funds) are made available. (DMA) Environmental issues of major signiﬁcance affected by our activities primarily the operation of our vessels concern air emissions, discharges to the sea, waste management, use of raw materials and resources, as well as environmental issues concerning the local communities. In this respect, the Group's subsidiaries Blue Star Ferries and Superfast Ferries assess on an annual basis their impact on the environment. This assessment is based on the Environmental Management Systems which we apply and which have been certiﬁed in accordance with the ISO 14001 International Standard on Environmental Management, as well as on other management systems such as the International Safety Management (ISM) Code. Tangible proof of the application of the above management practices are the following certiﬁcations, mentioned indicatively: The international and national certiﬁcations on the protection of the environment and the prevention of oil, sewage and air pollution, the international antifouling certiﬁcate and the ﬁve-year certiﬁcate for the oil bilge water separator. In addition, the Group now requires its suppliers to provide asbestos-free certiﬁcate. During 2014, no ﬁnes or other non-monetary sanctions were imposed on the Group for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. (G4-EN29) The Group's total expenditures and investments in connection with the protection of the environment during the same period stood at €1,365,685. In more detail: ATTICA GROUP ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2014 (G4-ΕΝ 31) Costs for the disposal of liquid and solid waste and environmental rehabilitation (€) Solid waste disposal 1,124,637 Liquid waste disposal 96,649 Expenditures for materials/equipment to be used in pollution remediation/management 38,000 Expenditures for internal/external inspections & certiﬁcates 32,500 Prevention and environmental management costs (€) Expenditures for certiﬁcations (ISO 14001, ISO 9001) 6,500 Anti-fouling paints 64,419 Expenditures for training in the protection of the environment 2,980 43 2. Management of Raw and Other Materials Our Group recognises the signiﬁcance of the conservation of natural resources and addresses this issue by recording and monitoring the consumption of the raw materials it uses and by taking corrective action, where this is considered necessary. Additionally, we have established and applied procedures to ensure the optimum efﬁciency in the operation of our vessels' engines, taking also into account the variations in speed during individual itineraries, so as to avoid unnecessary fuel consumption. The raw materials used by the Group for its activities are primarily fuels and electricity. More speciﬁcally, during 2014 we used 226,541.30 Mt of oil for the operation of our ﬂeet. The key materials used in our vessels consisted mainly of lubricants for machinery. The raw and other materials used, by type and supplier origin, are shown in the table below. RAW AND OTHER MATERIALS (G4-ΕΝ1) RAW AND OTHER MATERIALS, BY TYPE AND WEIGHT SUPPLIER ORIGIN Fuels Oil 176,761.30 Mt External supplier Lubricants 1,283,733 Lt External supplier Freon 3,957 kg External supplier 3. Prevention of Sea Pollution and Protection of Biodiversity The sea is an inseparable part of our business activity and growth. Consequently, its protection from all forms of pollution is one of our top priorities. Acknowledging that the operation of our vessels may directly or indirectly affect the natural environment, we take steps to ensure that our alignment with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) serves as the starting point for a number of additional prevention initiatives (DMA),which in 2014 resulted in the total absence of incidents involving spills from our vessels. (G4-ΕΝ24) These initiatives concern the following: (G4-EN12) • Relevant trainings for vessel crews in dealing with a potential pollution or hazard from fuel or lubricant spills during delivery. This particular issue is covered by the Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP), under the International Safety Management (ISM) Code. • Codiﬁcation and monitoring of chemicals used. The Fleet Operations Division has codified all chemicals used by the Bridge and Engine Departments and is monitoring their use. Vessels' garages, decks and external surfaces are cleaned using only environment-friendly cleansers. All chemicals used in our vessels have been selected based on their environment-friendly features. • Consumption of fuel with a sulphur content below 0.1% in ports, in accordance with the laws in force. During their stay at port, our vessels use marine gas oil (MGO) with a 0.1% sulphur content, in full compliance with the laws in force. • Operation of Sewage Treatment Plant System. The operation of the system is regularly monitored in accordance with the ISM procedures, while the policy of the Group does not permit the discharge of sewage inside ports. • Avoidance of dumping garbage at sea. No garbage is dumped at sea. Instead, all garbage produced onboard the vessels are delivered to approved reception facilities. This issue is monitored in accordance with the ISM Code, the Garbage Manual and relevant signage posted for passenger information. 44 • Use of TBT-free anti-fouling paints. The Group complies fully with the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships. The anti-fouling paints used on all our vessels do not contain the toxic substance tributyltin (TBT). • Ballast³ and Discharge of Bilge Water4 The Group adheres to all relevant regulations and monitors their application in accordance with the ISM Code procedures. 4. Management of Energy Consumption A key area that contributes to the efforts to contain Climate Change is the responsible management of electricity. In order to supply electricity to its vessels, the Group consumes oil, while for its land services it purchases and consumes electricity. In 2014, the Group's total consumption of energy stood at €12,922.23 GJ. ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN 2014 (GJ) (G4-ΕΝ3) Energy consumption from non-renewable sources (oil) 9,303.77 Energy consumption from renewable sources 0 Consumption of energy purchased (electricity) 3,618.47 In parallel, the Group's efforts for a more efﬁcient use of energy are focusing on actions such as the following: • Energy savings on lighting, air conditioning, heating. • Exploring the possibility to supply vessels with electricity from land during their stay at port, where this service is offered (cold ironing). • Installation and operation of photovoltaic panels on our Blue Star Delos vessel. • Utilisation of waste heat from cooling systems to heat water and air. • Relevant signage to remind passengers as well as employees to switch off lights. • The Group's newly-built Blue Star Delos & Blue Star Patmos vessels have been ﬁtted with economy lamps (LED). The gradual replacement of lamps by LED lamps in all our ﬂeet is already under way. • Purchase of ofﬁce equipment (computers, printers) with ENERGY STAR speciﬁcations and, where feasible, selection of products made from environment-friendly materials. SOLAR PANEL ON BLUE STAR DELOS With the key objective to develop energy-efﬁcient solutions, in 2014 we installed on a pilot base a photovoltaic unit on our Blue Star Delos vessel. Our aim is to expand this application and take advantage of the beneﬁts offered by solar technology zero pollution, quiet operation, minimal maintenance costs. 3. The term ballast is used to describe all types of weight placed on a vessel to provide stability. In our vessels, the term refers to seawater used to ﬁll special vessel compartments ( ballast tanks ). 45 4. Bilge water: This is a mixture of water, lubricants and fuel, drained into special oil collectors onboard the vessels. Bilge water is produced from the washing of engines as well as by accidental leaks. 5. Management of Water Consumption The Group aims to ensure the rational and responsible consumption of water in the facilities of its buildings on land as well as onboard its vessels. In this framework, we take speciﬁc initiatives to conserve water, such as: • Regular measurements of water consumption. • Maintenance of systems to avoid leaks. • Installation of photocell-operated water mixers in public WCs onboard the Blue Star Delos and Blue Star Patmos vessels. • Training of vessel crews in using water more efﬁciently. • Seawater intake for treatment and use onboard the vessel for cooling engines, cleaning decks etc. • Relevant signage to remind passengers as well as employees on the need to use water responsibly in sanitary areas and restaurants. In 2014, the Group consumed in total 114,304 m³ of water from the public water supply utility (Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company EYDAP), reduced by 6.17% compared to 2013. (G4-ΕΝ8) WATER CONSUMPTION m3 2014 2013 Vessels 111,437 120,014 Land facilities 2,867 1,816 Total 114,304 121,830 6. Management of Solid and Liquid Waste With the aim of minimising waste production, the Group places emphasis on briefing its vessel crews through the Garbage Management Manual , which describes all waste collection procedures. In addition, it has introduced procedures for the regular inspection, control, recycling and reuse of garbage. During 2014, we delivered 28,258 m³ of solid waste from our vessels to the ports' specialised and exclusive licensed contractors. We also delivered for disposal approximately 4,142 m³ of used liquid waste (lubricant oils and fuel waste oil). The Group's waste by type, quantity and disposal method is shown in the table below.
