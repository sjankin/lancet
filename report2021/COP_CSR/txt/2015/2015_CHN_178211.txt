Statement of the Chairman First of all, I would like to, on behalf of the Board of Directors and management team of COSCO Group, express my sincere appreciations to customers who have pay attention to and support the development of COSCO Group. I would also express my appreciations to our shipand shore-based employees who have worked hardly and diligently to promote business development of COSCO Group. In 2014, total operating revenue of COSCO Group reached RMB169.336 billion, up 2.75% year-on-year. Of which, the accumulative revenue of shipping industry reached RMB74.949 billion. The accumulative operating revenue of ship-building and ship-repairing industry had increased by 16.02% year-on-year to RMB22.931 billion. The accumulative operating revenue of logistics business had decreased by 6.08% year-on-year to RMB4.022 billion. The accumulative revenue of terminal and container leasing business had increased by 5.39% year-on-year to RMB7.248 billion, and the accumulative revenue of trade supplying business had decreased by 12.61% year-on-year to RMB82,171 billion. During the reporting period, the imbalance of supplies and demands of international shipping industry had no significant improvements. The freight rate of shipping market was stood at low level. The average figure of BDI was 1,105 points, down 8.3% compared with the previous year. The average figure of CCFI was 1,086 points, almost the same with 1,082 points in the previous year. In the meantime, operating cost of shipping industry increased continuously due to rigorous increase of port fees and other fees. Although international fuel price dropped greatly in the fourth quarter, the influence on annual performance was limited and the enterprise still faced great operation pressure. In face of fierce challenge, COSCO Group took active measures to increase the income and reduce the expenditure. The main shipping business had reduced the deficits greatly and the cash flow of operating activities was improved significantly. In the meantime, the sale of equity assets and subsidiaries for ship retirement also increased the revenue. In 2014, freight rate of international shipping market was still at low level due to weak economic recovery of the world, slowdown of growth of demands and surplus carrying capacity. In this year, COSCO Group continued to adjust the fleet structure, control the leased bulk shipping capacity. Leasing agreement of some bulk ships will not be renewed upon expiry, and some old ships were retired. This resulted in reduction of overall scale of bulk carriers. The size of oil tanker fleet and general cargo fleet 7 also reduced due to termination of leasing agreements of some carrying capacity. Scale of container fleet was increased due to delivery of new orders. In 2014, shipbuilding enterprises of COSCO Group overcame the double pressure of market and cost, tried to elevate the ship-building and ship-repairing skills, enhanced the technical R&D and cost control, strengthened self-inspection mechanism, implemented automation reform, coped with opinions of ship-owners high-efficiently, elevated the quality of ships constantly, and ensured on-time delivery of existing orders. As of early December, COSCO Shipyard had successfully completed the shipbuilding tasks for the whole year. The growth of world trade had slowed down due to global economic downturn. Although the growth of import and export volume of China had slowed down in 2014, the container throughout of COSCO Pacific at domestic and overseas terminals also increased. Piraeus Port invested by COSCO Pacific achieved outstanding results in market expansion, operation & management, cost reduction and benefit increase. The port saw sharp increase of container volume and made profits continuously. These favorable factors promoted the continuous growth of total container throughout of terminals invested by COSCO Pacific. Affected by world economic situations, the growth has been slowed down. Under the background that shipping market was in depression, COSCO Logistics tried to expand the business, and achieved growth in container canvassing volume, general and bulk cargo agent volume and railway transportation volume. While trying to increase the cargo canvassing volume, it promoted the classified management of customers and layered tracking and development mechanism, enhanced the construction of chemical, railway and other professional platforms, and made breakthrough in development of core customers. At the 2014 HP Global Supplying Chain Summit, COSCO Logistics awarded the Annual Innovative Logistics Supplier and Outstanding Strategic Partner in Chongqing. In 2014, COSCO Group deepened the comprehensive budget management, strengthened the cost control and achieved significant results in cost reduction work. With respect to fuel cost control, it saved 665,200 tons of fuels (about RMB400 million) through low-speed navigation, scientific dispatch and management, and ship technical reform. With respect to control of operating cost, it tried to enhance the control of voyage cost, engine cost, rents, port fee, transshipment fee and reparation fee. With respect to procurement, business outsourcing and supplier management, all shipping companies enhanced the concentrated procurement of spare parts and management of shipbuilding and ship-repairing business, and the procurement value of spare parts of ships had dropped by 10.8% year-on-year. The group has implemented the system of “repairing ships of COSCO Group at the ship-repairing companies of COSCO Group” strictly, generating good collaboration effects. In 2014, COSCO Group accelerated the adjustment and optimization of fleet structure, customer structure and market structure. With respect to adjustment of fleet structure, it accelerated the retirement of old ships, and ordered a batch of energy-conservative and high-efficient new ships, further elevating the energy efficiency and market competency of fleet and optimizing the overall structure of carrying capacity. With respect to adjustment of customer structure, it deepened the VIP customer strategies, and tried to increase the proportion of strategic customer, director customer and high-contribution customer. It strengthened the canvassing of basic cargo source to increase the proportion of basic cargo source and direct customers. With respect to adjustment of market structure, it actively explored the third country business, explored the new emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Central and East Europe, South America, Africa and Middle East. It also explored the markets in middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the central and west regions with the opportunity of “one belt and one road” strategies and the strategies of Yangtze River economic belt. 8 In 2014, COSCO Group made ceaseless efforts to innovate on the service mode and to promote long-term and sustainable development of the company. COSCON tried to improve customer experience and elevate customer loyalty by enhancing the customer service guarantee system. It made ceaseless efforts to promote the strategies of cross-border convergence of traditional industry and e-commerce industry. The Pan-Asia e-commerce platform received recognition of more and more customers, and made breakthrough in terms of number of users and transaction volume in the second half of the year. China COSCO Bulk innovated on marketing concept with customer as the center, deepened the reform of marketing system by setting up a marketing center and adopting the responsibility system of account manager for marketing, and established global marketing system. In 2014, China COSCO Bulk made significant progress in cooperation with large customers such as VALE, and gradually established long-term and stable cooperation mode. In 2014, COSCO Group followed the requirements of UN Global Compact, and made active efforts to build up an environment-friendly, ocean-protective and resource-conservative enterprise. In 2014, COSCO Group saved 521,900 tons of fuel through energy conservation technical reform, low-speed navigation and optimization of shipping lines, and reducing the carbon dioxide emission, sulfur dioxide emission and nitrogen dioxide emission by 1.6231 million tons, 266 million tons and 454 million tons respectively. Moreover, COSCO Group brought into full play the humanistic spirits, and participated and assisted in many rescue activities. In 2015, domestic and overseas economic situations will still be complicated. The uncertainties of world economy will increase and China will face economic downturn pressure. WTO predicted that global trade volume will grow by 4% in 2015, lower than the average growth rate of 5.3% in the past 20 years. Affected by this, global shipping market is entering a new normal with low-speed growth of demands and the surplus carrying capacity can’t be changed in short period of time. It is predicted that the low-level fluctuation of shipping market will last for a certain period of time. In face of new normal of global economy and shipping market, COSCO Group will pay more attention to the collaboration of all companies in the business cluster, and tried to take a lead in terms of profitability, anti-cycling ability, globalization and scaled growth. With the emerging of new technologies, new economy and new business status, as well as higher and higher requirements on transportation mode, transportation safety, service experience and environmental protection, shipping market will be more complicated in the future. Cooperation, innovation and rational operation will become the common understandings of shipping industry. Supported by all shareholders, COSCO Group will seize the opportunities of “one belt and one road, collaborative development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, strategies for development of Yangtze River Economic Belt and the national policies to promote development of shipping industry” under the background of economic reform and innovation of China, made reform, innovative and struggling, and made ceaseless efforts to promote sustainable development of COSCO Group, provide high-quality services for customers and return to the shareholders continuously.

III. Analysis on Primary Influences and Measures of Sustainability COSCO Group insists on using the scientific development outlook in all kinds of work, systematically analyzes the primary influences, risks, opportunities and measures of sustainability with SWOT analytical method of lean six-sigma theory, correctly identifies the external opportunities and threats as well as internal advantages and disadvantages, and formulates related strategies correspondingly, so as to fulfill its sustainable development. 12 SWOT analysis on sustainability strategies Strength (S) 1. The first place in China and the second place in the world for its fleet scale, leading position in the world for scale of container fleet, dry and bulk fleet, professional general cargo fleet, multiple-purpose and special fleet, and one of the super-oil tanker fleets in the world. 2. Worldwide service network and globally-renowned brand. 3. Stable customer basis and wide strategic partnership relationships. 4. Continuously promote business collaboration and bring into full play the comprehensive advantages of COSCO Group. 5. Revise and improve the 2020 Strategies and make arrangement for entire ocean shipping industrial chain. 6. Elevate the internal management level of the enterprise continuously. Weaknesses (W) 1. Shipping and related industries are fluctuating and imbalanced in face of complex market situation of fluctuation in recovery in post-crisis era. 2. Insufficient research on shipping-supplementary industries, and incomplete transformation from periodic development to sustainable development. Opportunities (O) 13 1. Global economic development enters post-crisis era and the overall situation develops favorably in fluctuation. In middle and long-term, global economy is expected to keep stable and sustained growth. 2. The implementation of “one belt and one road”, collaborative development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei and the Yangtze River economic belt create new space for development of multiple-modal transportation. The construction of free-trade area offers new markets for bringing into full play the advantages of entire industrial chain. The acceleration of “out-going” strategies of central SOEs creates new opportunities for construction of world’s first-tier companies. The efforts to support development of internet, e-commerce, logistics and real estate industries created new sectors for innovation of business mode. The target to rejuvenate high-end equipment manufacturing industry creates new opportunities for elevation of ocean engineering and ship industries. The policies to promote development of shipping industry offers new environment for sustainable and healthy development. 3. The sharp decrease of international oil price has reduced the shipping cost. Threats (T) 1. The weak recovery of world economy hasn’t been improved significantly, financial market faces increased fluctuation, and prices of bulk commodities such as oil dropped continuously. These factors in addition to the non-financial factors such as geographic politics create difficulties for more stable recovery of world economy. 2. Domestic economic development is in the switch period of growth speed, painstaking period of structural adjust, and the digestion period of previous stimulating policies, and the increased pressure of economic decline is the main risk. 3. International shipping market is still in an unstable rebound period where supplies exceed demands. Strong periodical feature results in severe challenges. Energy conservation and emission reduction pressure of shipping industry increases. Terminal industry faces unoptimistic supply and demand situations, and enters meager-profit era. 4. Elevation of transportation ability of new Asia-Euro continental bridge also threats to ocean shipping industry.

General Information of Shipping Industry Shipping industry as the pillar industry of national economy has special features that are significantly different with other industries. Therefore, judgment and comment on sustainability and profitability of shipping industry have its unique characteristics. Shipping industry is a kind of derivative demand, and is generated with the economic development of various countries to serve for international trade. Development of shipping industry is closely related to changes of global economy and trade, and is affected by periodic factors such as global economy and international financial system. Therefore, shipping industry is one of the industries with most obvious periodic fluctuation. The fluctuation of freight becomes a normal status. Economic cycle is the fluctuation based on global or national economy. One economic cycle includes four stages, namely recovery, expansion, downturn and recession. Recovery is the prelude for next round of periodic expansion, therefore, the economic cycle can be simply divided into expansion and recession stages. Periodic change of economy is the basic reason for periodic change of peak and valley of dry and bulk shipping market. According to related calculations, international shipping volume will increase by 1.6% if the world economy increases by one percentage point. Economic recession will bring direct, rapid and profound influence on shipping industry. As world shipping volume which determines shipping demands is closely related to world economy, and supply of carrying capacity, although rigorous, is changing with the freight rate, world economic development determines the periodicity of shipping industry. It can be said that development of world economy determines the long cycle of shipping industry, the contrast of supply and demand relationships leads to fluctuation of freight rate of shipping industry and therefore the short cycle of shipping industry. Periodical fluctuation will bring various operating and financial risks to shipping companies. Each financial crisis will cause depression of shipping industry. This results in the special operating mode of “making up the deficits during low season with the profits at peak season”. Therefore, the appraisal on profit-making situations of shipping industry shall not be based on losses or profits in recent two to three years, but the accumulative profits or average profits in a certain period of time. Each economic crisis will bring bankruptcy and liquidation of many shipping companies. Shipping companies who exist in the economic crisis can enjoy growth in the next cycle. Therefore, appraisal on sustainability of shipping companies shall be based on existence ability of enterprises in low valley and fast profit-making ability of enterprises in recovery period. II. General Information of COSCO Group At the beginning of the establishment on April 27, 1961, COSCO Group was only a small shipping company with four ships and a total carrying capacity 22,600 DWTs.

The group repairs and refits over 500 large ships annually, and has an annual ship-building ability of 8.4 million tons, which make it the largest ship-repairing enterprise and most-advanced ship-building enterprise in China. COSCO Group owns matured ocean engineering construction technologies, and has become the first option of internationally renowned ocean oil service providers for its professional service and modernized management. The project of “key design and manufacturing technologies of highly-stable cylinder deep-sea drilling platform” developed by COSCO Shipyard has won the first-class National Scientific and Technological Progress Award. It is the highest award received by COSCO Group in scientific and technological sector since its establishment and the first time for a domestic ocean engineering equipment manufacturing enterprise to win such honor. COSCO BOS Ballast Water Disposal System was listed as key national scientific research achievement. The project, which has reached or is close to internationally advanced level, has independent intellectual property right and received 12 national invention patents. In the same year, the project was listed as “key new national product” by four ministries and commissions including the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. COSCO Group has formed a global structure with Beijing as the center and nine regional companies in Hong Kong, America, Europe, Singapore, Japan, Australia, Korea, West Asia and Africa as the radiation points.

Total asset value of the group has exceeded RMB340 billion, and the proportion of overseas assets and revenue has exceeded more than 50% of the total. Currently, the group is forming a complete global business chain comprising of shipping, logistics, terminal, shipbuilding and ship-repairing businesses. 16 COSCO Group is one of the earliest Chinese enterprises that enter international capital market. In 1993, COSCO Investment was listed in Singapore in form of back-door listing. Currently, it holds controlling shares or shares in eight listed companies including China COSCO, COSCO Pacific, COSCO International, COSCO Investment, COSCO Shipping, CIMC, China Merchants Bank and China Merchants Securities. As a transnational company in China, COSCO Group started to shoulder its extensive corporate citizen responsibilities long before. In 2001, it established a comprehensive management system, which includes international environment management system, and occupational safety and health management system, becoming the first Chinese enterprise that passes certification of three management systems. In 2004, COSCO Group joined the UN Global Compact initiative to voluntarily practice the 10 principles of Global Compact and fulfill sustainability. The sustainability report of COSCO Group has been appraised as notable COP by UN Global Compact for four consecutive years, making COSCO Group become the only Asian enterprise whose sustainability report was included in the list of notable COPs for four years in a row. COSCO Group is also a member of the Global Compact LEAD Steering Committee. COSCO Group has combined the performance of corporate social responsibilities with corporate development strategies, and actively cultivated “green competitiveness”. Its main indicators for internationalization operation are close to UN’s standards for Global 100 transnational companies. It is gradually enhancing its position as a system integrator in international shipping, logistics and terminal operation and ship-building and ship-repairing sectors. COSCO is marching towards a leading enterprise in global shipping industry under the principle of “global development, harmony and mutual benefits” and the century vision of “building up a century-old COSCO”. III. General Information of Supply Chain and Industrial Structure of COSCO Group Shipping logistics business operated by COSCO Group is in the middle of the entire industrial chain, and is the part with lowest profits in entire value chain. In upstream, it depends on basic supplying and manufacturing industries, and in downstream, it subordinates to trade and financial services. Profits of the industry are squeezed by the two ends. In order to avoid the risk of strong periodicity of shipping logistics business, world’s first-tier shipping and logistics companies all developed upstream and downstream to form core competitiveness through advantage supplementation. Through investment or development of non-periodic industries or industries with reverse period with shipping logistics industry as the supplementary industries of shipping logistics business, they can “offset” the periodicity risk of shipping logistics business.

Influences of Climate Changes The global environment issues caused by climate changes have gradually raised concerns of all circles of the world. For COSCO Group, climate changes bring following safety risks and financial influences: 1. Risks Caused by Climate Changes Climate changes affected the typhoon occurrence period, moving path and intensity changes. These, in addition with increase of weathers with poor visibility, threaten shipping safety of COSCO Group's ships in various sea areas. Increase of typhoons and bad weathers with poor visibility need more labors and materials from the bank to guide safe shipping of vessels. In the meantime, as anti-typhoons and bad visibility affect the arrangements in and out the port, increase shipping time of vessels and non-productive berthing time at port. In order to cope with influence of climate changes, international community and port states formulated new conventions, rules and regulations, bringing new financial risks to COSCO Group. 2. Financial Influences of Climate Changes In order to prevent and fight against the possible damages caused by typhoons, COSCO Group input more human resources and materials into the organization establishment, shore-based shifts, command and coordination. Typhoons also led to the increase in the sailing time and distance as well as the delay in the schedules. In 2014, a total of 83 tropical cyclones (including TD) were generated worldwide, down 18 compared with 2013, affecting 336 ships (times) of CSOCO Group. Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of tropical 105 87 86 92 101 83 cyclones (TD) Number of ships affected 342 433 459 918 653 336 (number of ships) Restricted by poor visibility, many ports have taken entry and departure prohibition measures protect ship security during berthing at the port. This resulted in increase of non-productive berthing time of COSCO Group’s fleet at Hong Kong. In order to alleviate global environmental pressure, reduce emissions and energy consumption, and in advocacy of Chinese government’s appeal for energy conservation and emission reduction, COSCO Group has invested material and financial resources to enhance R&D of emission reduction technologies and improvement of 87 related equipment and facilities, so as to save energy consumption and reduce emissions. It also invested capitals to establish management systems of operational quality, environment and occupational health & safety, and opened safety and environment web and occupational health & safety web. Moreover, it has established effective training mechanism to carry out science popularization and operational skill trainings, so as to enhance the environment consciousness and management ability of employees and increase additional costs. COSCO Group has tried to reduce emissions by applying electronic control device cylinder petrol supply system, installing homogeneous fuel equipment on vessel engines, installing waterway guide cover, airscrew clipper, Shipaneng oil-saving devices on vessels. In order to cope with climate changes, the international community had revised the international conventions, resulting in increase of management costs and equipment expenses of COSCO Group. In 2014, COSCO Group adopted 284,900 tons of low-Sulfur fuel in a bid to satisfy the requirements of MARPOL Appendix VI and reduce emission of ships. This resulted in increase of costs by RMB90.88 million. In the past six years since 2009, cost of the group had increased by RMB326.17 million due to the use of low-sulfur fuel. Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 1.5%m/m fuel consumption volume (ton) 79,474 110,475 106，278 187,900 312,900 284,900 Cost increased for using 1.5%m/m 2,848 1,818 2,944 5,927 9,992 9,088 fuel (RMB10,000) COSCO Group has responded to preventative measures taken by port countries and coastal countries to deal with climate changes, resulting in increase of its operating costs of shipping companies under the group. For instance, COSCO Group has actively responded to the Green Ship Flag advocated by California in US, requiring ships to reduce the speed in advance before sailing into or departing from the ports. COSCO Group's ships sail into and depart from ports at a speed lower than 12 nautical miles per hour and use the light oil-based fuels with less sulfur content instead of heavy oil in a bid to alleviate air pollution. As the price of the light oil is 1.8 times of heavy oil, COSCO Group has to pay more when buying light oil-based fuels for ships. 3. Emission reduction and benefit increase, and opening of shipping lane to the North Pole COSCO Shipping launched “Seal Project” to open the shipping lane to the North Pole and develop a more economical shipping line from China to West and North Europe. The shipping line is shortened by 46% compared with regular shipping line, and can realize the emission reduction and benefit increase effectively, thus receiving high praises from shipping circle. 3. Fixed Welfare Plans COSCO Group has attached great importance to fixed welfare plans for employees and paid endowment insurances for every employee according to policies of the State and local employees. COSCO Group calculated the budget for endowment insurances by 20% of total salaries of employees and paid the endowment insurances monthly to the social insurance institutes of the country. By the end of 2014, total number of retired employees of the group reached 34,727. (Please see the table below) 88 Number of newly retired employees Number of retired employees as of the Year in the year year end 2009 1,977 28,074 2010 2,046 29,855 2011 1,752 31,392 2012 1,062 32,454 2013 1,011 33,465 2014 1,422 34,727 COSCO Group has set up a special institute, dispatched special personnel and allocated special expenditure to provide services for retired employees, ensuring that all retired employees can enjoy pensions when they are old and can have medical treatment when they are ill.

According to the plans, the new alliance will partner on six Asia/Europe shipping lines and four Asia/Mediterranean Sea shipping lines since mid April. Formation of the new alliance not only improves the service ability and service quality of CKYHE, but also elevates its competitiveness and influence in global liner industry to a new height. (3) Global thinking and localized operation. In this international operation, COSCO has always insisted on “global thinking and localized operation”. Firstly, it tried to meet internationally advanced level, carried out benchmarking activities with first-tier enterprises in the world, made improvements continuously, conducted self-innovation and enhanced its competitiveness continuously. Secondly, it respected local culture and habits, strictly abided by local laws and regulations and operated in accordance with the laws. Thirdly, it selected talents from local place.

(4) Cooperate with construction of “one belt and one road”. Container and railway transportation network of Piraeus Terminal, Greek has primarily formed, becoming the new highlight of terminal business. 90 Chinese Government appeals for construction of “one belt and one road”, which aims to realize inter-connection of Asia, Europe and Africa continents and surrounding oceans, establish and enhance the interconnecting partnership of different countries along the coast, and realize diversified, democratic, balanced and sustainable development of coastal countries. COSCO Group cooperated with Chinese Government in construction of “one belt and one road”, invested into container and railway transportation network of Piraeus, Greek and offered high quality and all-directional services for the customers. Container liner routes of COSCO Group Construction of global sea-rail intermodal service network is an important part of door-to-door comprehensive logistics solution offered by COSCO Group for its customers, and also an important measure for traditional shipping enterprise to realize service mode innovation. The Sino-Europe sea-road express line starts from Piraeus Port, Greece in the south and reaches Budapest, Hungary in the North after passing Skopje in Macedonia and Belgrade in Serbia. The new shipping line has become the most price-worthy intermodal shipping network from China to Europe. Compared with traditional shipping mode, the sea-rail intermodal service mode shortens the delivery time of cargos from China to Europe by 7 to 11 days. 91 Piraeus Port of COSCO Group in Greece opens Sino-Europe sea-road express line Piraeus Port is the intersection point of land and sea routes of “one belt and one road”, and also an important hub for Sino-Europe sea-road express line. It is the largest port in Greece and is one of the basic ports nearest to Suez and Gibraltar axle. Transshipment at the port enables connection of Northwest Europe, Mediterranean Sea-Far East trunk lines to branch lines in Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, West Africa, North Africa and Adriatico in the fastest and most economical manner. Piraeus Port is also the bridgehead to South Europe and Balkan, where cargos can enter and exit the new emerging markets in the east of Mediterranean Sea conveniently. In 2008, COSCO Pacific obtained 35 years of concession of #2 and #3 container terminals of Piraeus Port through market competition. The terminal project extends its shipping industrial chain and enhances its global competiveness. On June 2, 2010, COSCO Group took over Piraeus Port.
