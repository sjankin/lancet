In the previous Fourth Medium-term Business Plan (FY2013–FY2015), our financial strength improved thanks to the rapid progress made by Devices business, whose core product is touch panels. The Devices business, however, requires an optimized portfolio of target markets as it relies largely on the consumer electronics industry prone to sharp fluctuations in demand. The Industrial Materials business and the Information and Communication business were unable to achieve a full recovery of performance, and need to improve profitability through an accelerated reorganization of business structure. Fifth Medium-term Business Plan Recognizing these challenges, in April 2015, the Nissha Group started operation of the Fifth Medium-term Business Plan based on a fundamental strategy for reorganizing our business portfolio. “We will acquire and merge new core technologies into printing technologies and completely reorganize our business portfolio in global growth markets”—in line with this new medium-term vision, we will seek to create new values and innovative product lineups through an expansion of our existing base of proprietary printing technologies combined with newly added core technologies, and branch out into markets with global potential to realize continuous, stable growth. Using return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC) as management indicators for measuring the results of our efforts, we will promote reorganization of our business portfolio from the perspectives of business profitability and capital efficiency. Nissha’s CSR Nissha’s business activities must both achieve financial growth for the company and create value for society. We believe this defines the “Co-existence” articulated in our corporate mission, and the corporate social responsibility (CSR) we are required to fulfill. Essential to realizing this is communication and collaboration between Nissha and our stakeholders. Our new brand statement, “Empowering Your Vision,” expresses the relationship of co-existence between Nissha and our stakeholders. Both we and our customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and society have visions, and we mutually affect each other toward realizing it. We maximize our capabilities driven by our technology, passion, and leadership, and with the energy infused in us by our stakeholders, together create value for the future. Aiming to be a Company that Creates Value for Global Society In April 2012, we joined the United Nations Global Compact and declared our commitment in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. In April 2015, we established a CSR Committee and defined the target areas of our activities as basic CSR and strategic CSR. CEO Message 2 CSR Report 2015 Today, corporate management that merely adheres to the laws and customs of its own country is insufficient and unrecognized by global society. In basic CSR, we conform to standards based on the global template provided by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC). By building and operating management systems in the areas of labor, safety and health, the environment, and ethics, we aim to strengthen our foundation as a corporation and be a company trusted by global society. In strategic CSR, we promote initiatives to enhance our corporate value from a mediumto longterm perspective. Diversity is essential for Nissha to realize continuous growth. To promote diversity, we strive to enable all our employees—our most important management resources—to perform to their full potential regardless of gender, nationality, age, or disability. With a focus particularly on expanding women’s participation in business, in June 2014, we welcomed Nissha’s first female board member. Our new Life Innovation business, launched in April 2015, aims to contribute to safe, secure, and healthy lifestyles worldwide. By offering products and services that resolve society’s challenges, we seek to be a company needed by society. In Closing Fiscal year 2016 will see the target date for realizing the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and discussions are underway to design a post-2015 development agenda to succeed it, notably a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For Nissha, where we aim to be a truly global company, it is more important than ever that we turn our eye to global society and address its challenges. To this end, we strive to listen to our stakeholders at all times and reflect your voices in our business activities. We hope you will give CSR Report 2015 a read and offer us your candid thoughts and advice. We look forward to your further guidance and encouragement in the future.

United Nations Global Compact We joined the United Nations Global Compact in April 2012 and declared our commitment to 10 principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. Nissha's CSR 4 CSR Report 2015 Approach to CSR Nissha's CSR With the start of our Fifth Medium-term Business Plan in fiscal year 2016, we have set forth a new approach to, target areas of, and a promotional structure for Nissha’s CSR. 1. Nissha’s CSR seeks to realize our corporate mission of “pursuing a mutually trustful Coexistence with society through our business activities utilizing a unique technology development, based on Printing as a core.” We established a new brand statement, “Empowering Your Vision,” expressing the ideal relationship of co-existence between Nissha and our stakeholders. 2. We redefined the target areas of our CSR activities as strategic CSR and basic CSR. In strategic CSR, we work to enhance our corporate value from a mediumto long-term perspective by determining key material challenges and promoting initiatives to resolve them. In basic CSR, we strive to reduce CSR risks by promoting compliance with the global template, the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct, as well as with customer demand. 3. We organized a new CSR Committee, chaired by the president, with eight subcommittees dedicated to areas such as labor and human rights, the environment, and safety and health. Each subcommittee presents a strategic CSR topic and a basic CSR topic, discusses it with the CSR Committee and the subcommittees, and works to achieve its objectives. Each subcommittee further operates a management system and reports the progress of activities as needed to its secretariat. Initiatives related to strategic CSR topics, in particular, are included in Monthly Business Review (MBR) reports. The CSR Committee convenes once a year and conducts a management review in the presence of the president serving as chair. We identify the stakeholders that support Nissha operations as our customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and society. Toward realizing our corporate mission, we incorporate the voice of our stakeholders into business activities that contribute to a sustainable society. Both we and our stakeholders have a clear vision, and we mutually affect each other toward realizing it. Our aim is to work together and create value for the future. * Nissha’s corporate mission and brand statement can be viewed here. Corporate Philosophy and Nissha Brand http://www.nissha.com/english/company/philosophy.html CSR Management The CSR Committee and each of its subcommittees, as a rule, build and operate a management system. Quality, Environmental, and other subcommittees that already have ISO certification are working to make continuous improvements and enhance performance. The Corporate Ethics and Compliance, and Labor and Human Rights subcommittees, however, had not operated a management system in the past. Following a CSR audit conducted by our customers in fiscal year 2015, Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc. (NPT) started operating a management system. In the three years from fiscal year 2016 covered by the Fifth Medium-term Business plan, we will build and operate management systems based on the template provided by the EICC throughout the Nissha Group including overseas bases and at major suppliers.

We are working to build Subcommittee, and managers and group and improve a structure for enhancing leaders to conduct training in their respective transparency and ensuring fairness in our divisions, we are making company-wide business activities, and promoting the efforts to ensure thorough compliance. reinforcement of internal controls. Distribution of Added Value to Stakeholders This section sums up our distributions of added value to stakeholders in fiscal year 2015. Organizational Governance 14 CSR Report 2015 Corporate Governance Strengthening Corporate Governance toward Continuous Enhancement of Our Corporate Value “We are committed to pursuing a mutually trustful Co-existence with society through our business activities utilizing a unique technology development, based on Printing as a core”—as stated in our corporate mission, we at Nissha believe that continuous enhancement of our corporate value comes from fulfilling our social responsibilities as a corporation and building a trustful relationship with our stakeholders. In line with this recognition, we position the strengthening of corporate governance as a key management priority and work to build and improve a structure for enhancing transparency and ensuring fairness in our business activities. We seek to achieve a structure that enables swift decision making amid changes in the business environment, and to reinforce internal controls in areas including management oversight functions, thorough compliance, and risk management. Strengthening Corporate Governance Appointment of Outside Directors for Increased Transparency Nissha is a company with an audit and supervisory board comprising company auditors. Our governance structure is built upon a Board of Directors, an Audit & Supervisory Board, and corporate officers. Our Board of Directors consists of seven members—a small group that facilitates a brisk, substantial exchange of views. The board holds regular meetings once a month and extraordinary meetings when necessary to receive reporting on the execution of business activities and make decisions regarding important matters. The president chairs the meetings. In addition to board meetings, for deliberations involving the direction of important matters we organize management meetings with members centering on the president and inside directors. Directors serve a term of office of one year, which allows for flexibility in responding to changes in the business environment and for increased transparency of management responsibilities each fiscal year. Our seven-member Board of Directors includes three outside directors (ratio of outside directors: 42.9%), selected from figures with experience in business administration at other companies and researchers of corporate governance and business strategy. All of our outside directors participate actively in board meetings from an independent standpoint, offering objective, specialist advice and opinions regarding Nissha’s management activities overall, and contributing to enhanced transparency and reinforced management oversight by the Board of Directors. The three outside directors are elected as independent directors based on the judgment that they do not correspond with any item in the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Guidelines Concerning Listed Company Compliance Corporate Governance 15 CSR Report 2015 III. 5. (3)-2, and therefore are fully independent and risk no conflict of interest with general shareholders. Of the outside directors newly elected at the general meeting of shareholders in June 2014, one is Nissha’s first female board member (ratio of female directors: 14.3%). We hope to turn diversity in the boardroom into an opportunity to promote diversity in the workplace and improve our vitality. Adoption of the Corporate Officer System We adopt a corporate officer system to segregate the Board of Directors’ strategy-formulating and management oversight functions from the corporate officers’ day-to-day business execution function. Corporate officers serve a term of office of one year. Six of our 18 corporate officers are hired from outside Nissha (ratio of mid-career hires: 33.3%) for a structure that promotes diversity and allows for flexibility in responding to changes in the business environment. The corporate officers’ business execution function is monitored through Monthly Business Review (MBR) meetings, organized to confirm the progress of plans, toward building a system for swiftly responding to changes in the business environment and ensuring that each business division is operating appropriately and efficiently. Enhanced Auditing System Our Audit & Supervisory Board consists of two inside corporate auditors (full-time) and two outside corporate auditors (part-time). The outside corporate auditors, selected from certified public accountants and lawyers, conduct audits drawing on advanced expertise toward maintaining and improving our governance structure. The two outside corporate auditors are elected as independent directors based on the judgment that they do not correspond with any item in the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Guidelines Concerning Listed Company Compliance III. 5. (3)-2, and therefore are fully independent and risk no conflict of interest with general shareholders. The corporate auditors attend Board of Directors’ meetings and other important meetings, examine requests for managerial decision and other important documents, visit Nissha’s major offices and group companies for audit, and exchange views with the president, directors, and heads of business divisions on a regular basis in accordance with auditing policies and plans drawn up in line with standards determined by the Audit & Supervisory Board. In addition to collaborating closely through regular meetings with accounting auditors, the internal audit division, and the corporate division, the company auditors organize regular group-wide Audit & Supervisory Board meetings to enhance and strengthen audits of the Nissha Group overall. To ensure objectivity and effectiveness of audits, we have an Audit & Supervisory Board Members’ Office staffed by employees dedicated to assisting the work of the corporate auditors. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC is responsible for performing accounting audits appropriately and in adherence with the Companies Act and with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. Corporate Governance 16 CSR Report 2015 Nissha's Management and Business Execution System Remuneration for Directors and Corporate Auditors Remuneration for directors and corporate auditors is set within the upper limit of total remuneration approved at the general meeting of shareholders (an annual maximum total of 430 million yen for directors and 50 million yen for corporate auditors). Remuneration for directors consists of a basic compensation and bonus, the sums of which are determined in accordance with a policy established by the Board of Directors. Basic compensation is set according to the scope of the role and position of each director, and finally determined by president and CEO based on an evaluation of the contribution and performance of the director. Bonuses are determined by president and CEO and correspond to the degree of success in achieving performance targets based on business results (consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income to sales ratio, performance of the business the director is responsible for, etc.). A fixed sum is determined for outside directors, taking into account factors such as the business experience of each outside director. Remuneration for corporate auditors is determined by negotiation with corporate auditors.

We have in place a Disclosure Control Committee to ensure that information about all Nissha Group companies is disclosed promptly and in a timely manner in accordance with related laws and ordinances, and moreover that disclosure occurs swiftly, accurately, fairly, and on a continuous basis. The committee secretariat is responsible for compiling internal information, and the committee for deliberating on and determining whether that information requires timely disclosure. When disclosure is deemed necessary, the information is disclosed swiftly with approval from the Board of Directors. As an organization under the direct control of the president, the internal audit division is responsible for analyzing and assessing the status of preparation and operation of the internal control system, and for offering suggestions for improvement toward maintaining and enhancing order. Risk Management With a risk management policy in place to clarify our approach, we promote risk management to counter risks that may have a significant impact on our business activities, and to be fully prepared in the event an emergency does occur. In fiscal year 2015, we established a Risk Management Subcommittee, headed by the Executive Vice President in charge of administration, within the Management System Committee. Having defined risks that require addressing as “any thing or situation that hinders Nissha’s implementation of the corporate mission,” the subcommittee works to ferret out all conceivable risks associated with business processes—including those related to disasters, accidents, and compliance—and devise countermeasures for them. The Risk Management Subcommittee meets twice a year to narrow down the selection of particularly significant risks to eight items, and strives to counter those risks and make continuous improvements. Our cross-organizational committee, subcommittee, and superintending divisions play a pertinent role in reducing and coping with evident risks related to compliance, insider trading, product quality, the environment, information security, safety and health, and trade management. In the area of crisis management, we have in place a set of Emergency Response Regulations stipulating that we set up a group-wide response task force headed by the president and CEO in the event of a serious interruption of business due to emergency over a certain level, such as a large earthquake or new global influenza epidemic. Furthermore, in fiscal year 2015, we promoted activities to enhance employee awareness about the general rules for action and response in an earthquake, such as stockpiling supplies at major bases in Japan, distributing “survival cards” listing information about what to expect and do should an earthquake strike to all officers and employees of the Nissha Group in Japan, and conducting emergency drills. For the purpose of ensuring business continuity and maximum service to our customers, securing the safety of our employees and their families, and contributing to the restoration of communities and of society at large, we conduct desktop simulation exercises aimed at identifying risks and reviewing our business continuity plan (BCP) and related codes. In fiscal year 2016, we established a CSR Committee chaired by the president that promotes risk management to counter or avoid risks that may have a significant impact on our business activities, and to be fully prepared in the event an emergency does occur. Initiatives of Internal Audit Internal Audit, to maintain impartiality and objectivity in its functions, serves as an independent corporate staff organization in drawing up annual auditing plans, investigating whether business activities are carried out appropriately and efficiently, and offering advice and recommendations to internal organizations. Furthermore, it conducts follow-up audits to confirm how each finding that has surfaced through the audits is improving. The office makes reports and offers suggestions based on the results of its audits to the president and CEO at monthly meetings, and presents particularly important matters at Board of Directors’ meetings. Moreover, it holds meetings with fulltime corporate auditors every three months to establish mutual cooperation with the Audit & Corporate Governance 20 CSR Report 2015 Supervisory Board. Audits in fiscal year 2015 focused on governance, compliance, and work processes at overseas bases and at consolidated subsidiaries in Japan. Internal Audit, as a third party, also performed an independent assessment of financial reporting-related internal controls in response to the internal control reporting system prescribed by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. ESG Study Session by Outside Lecturer for Executives On March 16, 2014, we organized a study session on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) led by an outside instructor for executives and strategy divisions. We invited as instructor Mr. Masaru Arai,* chair of the non-profit organization Japan Sustainable Investment Forum (JSIF), to provide a lecture titled “Disclosure required by institutional investors and management of the future,” followed by a question and answer session. Participants from Nissha included the president and CEO, the chief financial officer (CFO), and managers of strategy divisions including Corporate Strategy Planning. Against a backdrop of the rapid expansion of ESG investing of late and the introduction of Japan’s Stewardship Code and Corporate Governance Code, a lively discussion took place regarding disclosure expected of companies and ideas toward the enhancement of corporate value from a long-term perspective. * Mr. Masaru Arai Chairman, JSIF (Japan Sustainable Investment Forum) CEO, Corporate Value Research Institute Member, Advisory Committee, Criteria Sub-committee (only member from Asia), FTSE ESG Advisory Committee Member, CDP Japan Advisory Group Member, the Independent Committee, Eco-stage Institute Japan Elected Director, PRI Association Board (UN Principles for Responsible Investment) in June 2015 Corporate Governance 21 CSR Report 2015 Corporate Ethics and Compliance Guideline of the Corporate Ethics and Compliance In addition to establishing a basic guideline based on the Nissha Group’s Corporate Mission, Shared Values, and Guideline of the Corporate Ethics and Compliance, we set forth 13 important points for the purpose of appropriately executing the guideline. All executives and employees work to promote and thoroughly implement corporate ethics and compliance. Guideline of the Corporate Ethics and Compliance 1. We comply with laws, social rules and internal regulations along with high ethics, and act with common senses and responsibilities. 2. We pursue the Co-existence with the Stakeholders such as Customer, Shareholder, Supplier, Society, and Employee. 3. We will immediately report and consult with supervisors or Hotline in case we find the violation or the doubtful act against Corporate Ethics and Code of Conduct . 13 important points Relationship with Customer and Supplier 1. Free and Fair Competition 2. Prohibition of Corrupt Practices 3. Quality and Safety of Products 4. Protection of Intellectual Property 5. Appropriate Handling of Information and Resources 6. Compliance with Import/Export Regulations Relationship with Shareholder 7. Handling of Corporate Information 8. Compliance with Regulations against the Insider Trading Relationship with Society 9. Environmental Protection 10. Regional/Social Contribution 11. No Relations with Antisocial Forces Relationship with Employee 12. Respect of Human Rights 13. Safe, Healthy and Comfortable Workplace Promotion Structure and Initiatives All Nissha bases in Japan and abroad appoint managers and group leaders in charge of promoting corporate ethics and compliance. These managers and group leaders not only conduct training in their respective divisions but also implement corporate ethics and compliance through organizational management, serve as the contact for Corporate Legal Affairs in responding to Corporate Ethics and Compliance 22 CSR Report 2015 specific cases, and even take on the role of consultant in their workplace. We designate every October as corporate ethics and compliance month, during which we offer group-wide training. In fiscal year 2015, the managers and group leaders led training sessions on two major themes—respect for human rights and appropriate handling of information—based on training material. In conjunction with the training sessions, we carry out a test on the 13 important points as well as a questionnaire on the Nissha Group’s awareness of compliance. For the prevention of insider trading, we cover regulations against insider trading in our regular training programs in addition to educating employees through quarterly publications on the Nissha intranet. To promote free and fair transactions, we work to enhance employee awareness of our manual on the promotion of appropriate transactions as well as our code on exchanging information with competitors. Corporate Ethics and Compliance Structure Corporate Ethics and Compliance 23 CSR Report 2015 Distribution of Added Value to Stakeholders Our fiscal year 2015 distribution of added value to stakeholders is given in the table below. Distribution to shareholders increased due to a resumption of dividends. That to employees also increased due to additions of consolidated subsidiaries. Increases in the amount of taxes paid and in internal reserves had an impact on distribution to government agencies and the company. Distribution of Added Value to Stakeholders Distribution of Added Value to Stakeholders 24 CSR Report 2015 Human Rights Basic Policy on Labor and Human Rights We define Nissha’s principles on labor and human rights in a basic policy toward realizing our corporate mission of pursuing a “mutually trustful co-existence with society.” The policy is translated from Japanese into the English, Chinese, Korean, and Malay languages for group-wide distribution. Basic Policy on Labor and Human Rights In order to realize a widespread mutually trustful co-existence with society, Nissha will observe the international norms, laws and ordinances related to human rights and labor standards and will make efforts to continually improve human rights and labor standards. 1. Child labor: We will prohibit child labor and also implement relief measures. 2. Forced labor: We will eliminate all forms of forced labor. 3. Health and safety: We will secure the health and safety of our employees and provide a hygienic workplace environment. 4. Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining: We will guarantee the right to organize and the right to collective bargaining. 5. Discrimination: We will not discriminate based on a person’s age, disability, ethnic group, gender, marital status, nationality, political support, race, religion, sexual orientation, pregnancy or membership in a union. We will also not be party to this. 6. Punishment: We will not perform physical punishment or mental or physical coercion and we will not engage in verbal abuse. 7. Working hours: We will observe the laws, ordinances and labor agreements related to working hours, rest breaks and holidays. 8. Remuneration: We will observe the laws and ordinances related to the payment of appropriate wages. June 16, 2014 Junya Suzuki President and CEO Chairman of the Board Nissha Printing Co., Ltd. In April 2012, we joined the United Nations Global Compact, thereby declaring that we support and will make continuous efforts to practice the initiative’s 10 principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. We include the 10 principles in our Corporate Ethics and Code of Conduct Manual, citing “respect for human rights” as a key item. The manual is produced in the Japanese, English, and Chinese languages and distributed through regular study sessions targeting all employees. After each training session, we collect signatures from our employees confirming that they understand and will base their conduct on the contents of the manual. Human Rights 25 CSR Report 2015 Hotline To minimize risks and promote ethical conduct and compliance, as well as to enable the company to immediately verify facts, we have in place a system for internal reporting in the event of fraud, illegal activity, or unethical conduct by either an organization or an individual employee. The hotline, a dedicated telephone line, enables reporting from within the company and from outside (through a lawyer’s office). Our Internal Reporting Code protects informers from any unfavorable treatment by either the company or other employees on account of their reporting. We also accept anonymous reports. In fiscal year 2015, the hotline was used five times. The reports concerned mainly labor management. We are working to enhance employee awareness of this hotline through the Corporate Ethics and Code of Conduct Manual, as well as through the Nissha intranet and training, in order to further reinforce corporate ethics and compliance. With the aim of preventing and resolving rifts in workplace relationships, including sexual and power harassment, on April 1, 2015, we established a help desk specializing in harassment, providing our employees with a clearer destination for discussing their concerns. Hotline Organizational Chart Relationship with Labor Union Nissha Printing Co., Ltd. has a solid relationship with the Nissha Labor Union,*1 joined by employees excluding managerial staff. It holds regular negotiations and discussions with the labor union, holding Management Council meetings every month to negotiate and discuss employees’ labor conditions and to share information about the Nissha Group’s business operations. Although no minimum period is set for notifying the union of significant changes in labor conditions, the company exchanges dialogue with the labor union on a daily basis with the aim of reaching an agreement satisfactory to both. The labor contract confirms, “the Company and the Union shall respect one another’s position and maintain a peaceful relationship between labor and management as well as strive for the maintenance and improvement of labor conditions and the growth of the Company,” and stipulates, Human Rights 26 CSR Report 2015 “the Company shall respect the Union’s right to organize, right to collective bargaining, and right to act as a group,” thereby guaranteeing basic labor rights for union members. The Nitec Industries Labor Union,*2 organized at affiliated company Nitec Industries, Inc. (NII) holds negotiations and discussions about employees’ labor conditions. And the Workplace Improvement Committee, established by both labor and management at Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc., (NPT) works to promote improvements in the workplace environment and in welfare benefits. In fiscal year 2015, the Nissha Group had no report either of a strike or lockout or of a situation that infringed on our employees’ freedom of association. We will continue to respect the mutual positions of both company and union, and build a sound relationship between labor and management. *1 As of the end of March 2015, the Nissha Labor Union has a membership of 913. *2 As of the end of March 2015, the Nitec Industries Labor Union has a membership of 476. Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining Our Basic Policy on Labor and Human Rights contains the provision, “4. Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining: We will guarantee the right to organize and the right to collective bargaining.” We adhere to international norms and laws on human rights and labor standards, and strive for continuous improvement. In fiscal year 2015, we embarked to build management systems in the areas of labor and human rights toward preparing a structure for complying with the global template provided by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC). A risk assessment concerning labor and human rights identified the possibility that Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc. (NPT), which has no labor union, risks not selecting workplace representatives through democratic election. In response, NPT established a Workplace Improvement Committee as a forum for regular dialogue between workplace representatives selected through democratic election and management on improving the workplace environment and welfare benefits. We have also started to conduct CSR audits of suppliers, evaluating similar cases as noncompliant and calling for rectification. The Fifth Medium-term Business Plan launched in fiscal year 2016 promotes the establishment of a structure in compliance with the EICC template at all Nissha Group bases, including those overseas, and at major suppliers. We are striving to reduce CSR risks also in the areas of freedom of association and collective bargaining through the operation of management systems in line with our basic policy. Fair Evaluation and Treatment We at the Nissha Group view evaluation systems as a mechanism for ensuring consistency between the company’s strategy and individuals’ goals, and for determining treatment accordingly. To this end, we conduct a personnel evaluation of all full-time Nissha Group employees twice a year. The evaluations cover the level of achievement of employees’ goals (accountability) and responsibility, the results of which are reflected in bonuses, pay raises, and promotions. By organizing interviews at the time the goals are set and the results are evaluated, we strive for evaluation and treatment that are fair and convincing.

We also work to prevent lifestyle diseases and support the mental health of our employees. Labor Practices 28 CSR Report 2015 Human Resources Development Human Resources Development Policy We implement a planned development of human resources needed for the company to grow and actively support our employees in the voluntary development of their skills with the aim of achieving growth for both the company and our employees. We at Nissha believe that our employees are our most important management resources. We are aiming to achieve growth for both the company and our employees by actively supporting the growth of each individual employee and developing human resources who are equipped with the skills and experience required to work at Nissha. Approach to Human Resources Development We at Nissha approach human resources development from the three areas of planned human resource development, skill development, and career development. For each area, we aim to promote comprehensive education incorporating the perspectives of training system, on-the-job training (OJT), mediumto long-term career path development, and human resource systems to support these programs. Human Resources Development Model Planned human resource development Implement planned development to foster and secure the human resources needed to achieve the management vision. (e.g., growth strategy, business continuity, creation of corporate culture) Skill development Individual employees voluntarily develop their skills and increase their market value. Human Resources Development 29 CSR Report 2015 →The company supports this and thereby enhances the quality of its human resources. Career development Support mediumto long-term career development and promote growth toward employees’ ideals. (Provide opportunities to recognize the importance of and pursue career development.) Training System Model Education programs Area Training Nissha Academy (selective training for nextgeneration management candidates), rank-specific Planned human resource development training, manager training, overseas appointee training, etc. Theme-specific training (leadership, problemsolving skills), foreign language training, Skill development accounting education, in-house TOEIC testing, correspondence course, etc. Education for young employees (first, second, and Career development third years of joining Nissha), career development training, etc. Enhancement of Selective Human Resource Development In fiscal year 2014, we established Nissha Academy, an in-house institute for fortifying advanced, specialized development of human resources. While we continue to expand on our rank-specific, theme-specific, and career design training programs, Nissha Academy employs a selective system to provide advanced, specialized education. Nissha Academy has opened a Business School, which provides knowledge and skills in the proposal and execution of management strategies including accounting, finance, marketing, and human resources; and a Management of Technology (MOT) School, which aims to foster leaders capable of linking technology with management to create new businesses. Graduates of each school are given opportunities to practice what they have learned through involvement in projects and the drafting of medium-term business plans, for a consistent human resource development Human Resources Development 30 CSR Report 2015 program that integrates all three areas of planned human resource development, skill development, and career development. Nissha Academy plans to establish a variety of courses in future, such as for learning the scientific processes of “monozukuri” (manufacturing). Company-wide Basic Education While providing advanced, specialized selective education at Nissha Academy, we are also focusing on basic education in business skills for all employees. From fiscal year 2013 onward, in particular, we conduct company-wide training in accounting and cost on a continuous basis. The aim of the program is to have employees gain an understanding of the numerical figures associated with our business activities, and perform their job always with an awareness of how their work reflects in these figures. Starting in fiscal year 2015, we also offer basic education in quality control and improvement not only to relevant employees, as in the past, but also to young and mid-career employees throughout the company. Training Programs in Fiscal Year 2015 In fiscal year 2015, corporate divisions organized a total of 24 training programs undertaken by 1,057 employees (822 men and 235 women). By area, skill development, centering on programs that call for voluntary participation, and career development, targeting primarily young employees, had a significant percentage of female participants. Planned human resource development, consisting of Nissha academy, manager training, and rank-specific training, had a high percentage of male participants. We expect the number of female participants to grow further, however, due to an anticipated increase in high-ranking females as a result of efforts to promote expanding women’s participation in business, as well as through career development training programs in the planning for women employees. Training program participants (full-times employees by gender) * Numbers for skill development exclude participants in in-house TOEIC testing and correspondence courses Human Resources Development 31 CSR Report 2015 Training hours per participant (full-time employees by gender, unit: hour) * Numbers for each area are calculated by dividing total training hours by gender by the number of full-time male and female employees * Hours for skill development exclude participants in in-house TOEIC testing and correspondence courses Human Resources Development 32 CSR Report 2015 Respect for Diversity The Nissha Group has a set of Shared Values that serve as a code of behavior for Nissha People seeking to realize our corporate mission. One of those values, Diverse Capabilities, declares, “We respect diversity that enhances our organizational capabilities and drives growth.” To grow as a global company, we respect diverse work styles by diverse human resources, and aim to create workplaces in which all employees can perform to their full potential. Composition of Nissha People The diversity of the Nissha Group shows in our employee composition in terms of gender, age, and employment status. More than one-fourth of our employees work at Nissha Group companies outside Japan. Locally hired employees are appointed to upper management positions at overseas bases. The CEOs of three companies in North America are served by local hires (as of the end of March, 2015). Composition of Nissha People *Directors include outside directors. Composition by age (Nissha Printing Co., Ltd., as of the end of March, 2015) Respect for Diversity 33 CSR Report 2015 Number of Nissha Group Employees *Figures exclude temporary employees. Composition by region (Nissha Group, as of the end of March, 2015) Gender ratio by region Respect for Diversity 34 CSR Report 2015 Composition by employment status (Nissha Group, as of the end of March, 2015) Gender ratio by employment status Percentage of People with Disabilities Employed at Major Group Companies The Nissha Group periodically interviews employees with disabilities and promotes their long-term employment. We work to create jobs by preparing workplace environments for and spreading understanding about the employment of people with disabilities. In fiscal year 2015, Nissha Printing Co., Ltd., with the largest number of employees, employed more people with disabilities than the statutory rate of 2.0%. Respect for Diversity 35 CSR Report 2015 *The statutory employment rate of people with disabilities for private companies in Japan changed from 1.8% to 2.0% on April 1, 2013. Expansion of Women’s Participation in Business In July 2014, we launched a project team led by Human Resources for expanding women’s participation in business. As a first step, we sought to understand how women employees felt about working in the Nissha Group. We interviewed 134 women—about 30% of all women employees—at our headquarters and bases in Japan. Many were of the view that they “got along well with their co-workers thanks to a comfortable Interview women employees workplace” and that Nissha provided a “broad range of systems for child-rearing support that are easy to use.” As much as 80% of our women employees felt “the Nissha Group is a good place to work” or that they “wish to continue working at Nissha.” In response to questions concerning the will to take on managerial roles, however, many women were under the impression that “management seems like too large a responsibility” and they would “rather be a player than a manager.” Only 13% of our women employees “want to be a manager,” bringing to light the need to foster recognition and understanding of the role and work of management, and the challenge of a lack of role models. The interviews also drew out requests unique to women for improving the workplace environment. Some views have led to actual changes at production facilities. We feel that expanding women’s participation in different types of workplace requires a mechanism for translating the voices of women into practice in real life. To expand women’s participation in business, it is important to realize work-life balance for both women and men. Acting on this belief, in October 2014 we created a Work-Life Balance Support Guidebook and distributed it to all employees of the Nissha Group in Japan. In April 2015 we Respect for Diversity 36 CSR Report 2015 added to our intranet a NISSHINE (Nissha + shine) section for communicating information on work-life balance support and expansion of women’s participation in business. Along with an introduction to systems for supporting child-rearing and family care, the section publishes the voices of employees who have used each system, with the hope that this will acquaint other employees with and encourage them to take advantage of the systems. The Labor and Human Rights Subcommittee, launched within the CSR Committee in April 2015, NISSHINE on intranet has set key performance indicators (KPI) for the key topic of expansion of women’s participation in business. We hope to continue in our efforts toward realizing the Diverse Capabilities cited in our Shared Values. Respect for Diversity 37 CSR Report 2015 Support for Diverse Work Styles The Nissha Group has many initiatives to support diverse work styles and achieve work-life balance for employees. Introduction of Flexible Work Hours We have in place flexible work hours as a mechanism in which employees can voluntarily determine their own start and finish times of the working day. The aims of the system include responding flexibly to the time difference between Japan and overseas, to deadlines, and to the busy and slow hours of the working day, and enabling employees to maintain harmony between work and life. Initially introduced in sales departments, the system was expanded gradually to other divisions and today benefits employees also in development and administration. Promotion of the Use of Paid Leave To promote the use of paid leave, we encourage employees to take two days each under our summer and winter vacation planning systems, and offer a further two days in which employees may request to take paid leave on their birthday, that of a family member, or their wedding anniversary. As a result of ongoing efforts, the average paid leave taken in fiscal year 2015 exceeded 10 days. We plan to continue aiming for improvements in the percentage of paid leave used. Average days and percentage of annual paid leave used Reduction of Overtime Work We are promoting a reduction of overtime work with the aim of encouraging employees to improve their work process and the way they manage their time, and thereby achieve work-life balance. Each month, departments that had a large amount of overtime work are questioned as to the causes, future outlook, and physical condition of employees. The findings are reported to management and the labor union, and furthermore reflected in personnel assignment decisions. In fiscal year 2015, the amount of overtime work decreased by 5.9% compared to the previous year, for a continuous year-on-year reduction of overtime work. In an aim to comply with the global template provided by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc. (NPT) operates a unique alert system to meet the requirement “Total hours worked should never exceed local or national standards, or 60 Support for Diverse Work Styles 38 CSR Report 2015 hours per week, whichever is stricter.” The system takes a count of work hours in midweek, alerts the superior of any employee at risk of exceeding the standards, and prompts rigorous management of work hours during the remainder of the week. Child-rearing and Family Care Support We are working to expand our support systems and enable employees to have flexible work styles in the various stages of life. Major support systems offered by Nissha are given below. By drafting an action plan and executing a range of measures based on the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-generation Children, some of our efforts in child-rearing support exceed statutory guidelines. Major child-rearing support systems Support system Nissha Group in Japan Statutory coverage During pregnancy (up to Shorter hours during pregnancy maternity leave before childbirth) − Up to 3 hours per day As a rule, up to 1 year old (1 Child-rearing leave Up to 2 years old year 6 months old when certain conditions are met) 4 days at the time of spouse’s Days off for spouse’s childbirth childbirth − (Special paid leave) Up to completion of elementary Up to 3 years old Shorter hours for child-rearing* school By effort: Start of elementary Up to 3 hours per day school 1 child: 5 days 1 child: 5 days Days off for child nursing 2 or more children: 10 days 2 or more children: 10 days Paid Either paid or unpaid Amount: 150,000 yen (for each occasion below) Period • Birth Child-rearing support fund − • Start of elementary school • Start of junior high school • Start of senior high school • Start of technical college Major family care support systems Support system Nissha Group in Japan Statutory coverage Family care leave Total 240 working days Total 93 days Total 480 working days Shorter hours for family care* Total 93 days 3 hours per day 1 family member: 5 days 1 family member: 5 days 2 or more family members: 10 2 or more family members: 10 Days off for family care days days Paid Either paid or unpaid *We allow employees to shorten their work time by three hours. For example, employees who normally work eight-hour days may shorten their work time by three hours to five-hour days. We also have in place a system in which employees may save up to 30 days of expired leave to be used in the event of illness, either of the employee or of a family member, and for child-rearing, family care, school events, and days on which a child’s kindergarten or school is closed. Support for Diverse Work Styles 39 CSR Report 2015 Distribution of Work-Life Balance Support Guidebook To support our employees in achieving work-life balance, we created a Work-Life Balance Support Guidebook containing information on both in-house and outside systems for child-rearing and family care, and distributed it to all employees in October 2014. The contents are also published on the Nissha intranet since April 2015. Kurumin Certification In 2013, we received “Kurumin” certification for the second consecutive term, following 2009. * Use of the Kurumin Mark is permitted for companies certified as being nextgeneration supportive by the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare. Certification is granted to companies that draw up and implement a medium-term action plan, and submit it to their prefectural labor bureau. Kurumin Logo Status of Major Long-term Leave and Time Taken Off from Work (Nissha Group in Japan) The number of employees who used child-rearing leave, worked shorter hours for child-rearing, and took days off for child nursing are given in the graphs below. All numbers are on the rise, and male employees are using the systems on an ongoing basis.

We are making efforts to raise employee awareness of our efforts to support diverse work styles in an aging society by distributing the WorkLife Balance Support Guidebook containing information on both in-house and outside systems for family care, and publishing the contents on the Nissha intranet. Support for Diverse Work Styles 41 CSR Report 2015 Support for Reinstatement after Long-term Leave For employees reinstated at work after long-term leave due to illness or injury, we have Reinstatement Support Bylaws that stipulate the consideration to be taken by workplaces according to the condition of the employee’s health in an aim to prevent recurrence of the illness or injury and achieve a smooth return to work. To offer support also in terms of work style, we arrange periodic consultations with an industrial physician to confirm the considerations necessary in the workplace, and have a system in which reinstated employees may shorten their work time by up to two hours per day for a period of six months. Work at Home System In fiscal year 2015, we introduced a work-at-home system with the aims of promoting harmony between employees’ work and life, and improving their work efficiency. The system enables employees living with a child before completion of elementary school and employees providing family care to work at home either on two days a week or for a number of hours a day. In fiscal year 2015, a total of four employees used the system (one during pregnancy, two for child-rearing, and one for family care). Outpatient Sick Leave System In fiscal year 2016, we will introduce an outpatient sick leave system with the aim of supporting employees who require long-term outpatient treatment to continue working. The system will enable employees with specified disorders to take 10 days off per year for treatment. Internal Job Posting System The Nissha Group introduced an internal job posting system in fiscal year 2012 with the aim of providing employees with the opportunity to choose their own career path as well as appoint employees to positions that reflect their aptitude and thereby enhance our organizational strength. The company posts specific job openings internally, employees who meet the criteria apply for the job of their own will, and those who pass the screening are transferred to the relevant post. Employees who have transferred through the system are playing an active role in their new division. Awarding system The Nissha Group has in place various awarding systems that aim to reward praiseworthy endeavors and create a setting in which the employees responsible for the endeavors influence and motivate the company and organizations as a whole. In fiscal year 2013, we reviewed the contents of our awarding systems. From fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2015, as many as 416 employees received the most prestigious President’s Award, 124 employees the Top-Line Award recognizing contributors to sales expansion, and 338 employees the Nissha People Award celebrating workplace stars who epitomize our Shared Values and Code of Conduct. The awards are presented globally across the Nissha Group, with recipients including employees at overseas bases. Every two years, we also organize Technology Presentation Meetings with an eye to discovering and recognizing excellent technologies with great potential, and ultimately inspiring our engineers. Support for Diverse Work Styles 42 CSR Report 2015 Safety and Health Occupational Safety and Health Policy / Safety and Health Objectives The Nissha Group has in place a Occupational Safety and Health Policy declaring that we position the safety and health of all involved in our business activities as a top management priority. We promote thorough awareness of this policy through postings on the Nissha intranet and at each base, and draw on it as a guide for various activities. The results of our efforts are reviewed, reflected in safety and health objectives set each year, and used as a base for further initiatives. Occupational Safety and Health Policy Nissha recognizes that ensuring the safety and health of all people engaged in our business activities is a top management priority for the continuity and development of our operations, and to this end, commits to the following practices. 1. We promote the participation of all in creating comfortable workplace environments and developing sound physical and mental health. 2. We pursue Co-existence with society in compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and with the requirements agreed upon by Nissha of local communities, public institutions, and our customers. 3. We strive for continuous improvement in occupational safety and health standards through the operation of management system. This policy will be distributed widely to all people in the Nissha Group as well as released to the general public. Safety and Health Subcommittee / Safety and Health Management System Toward further enhancing our safety and health management level, we drew up a Safety and Health Management Manual in January 2015. Each base is conducting activities, applying the plando-check-act (PDCA) cycle. The former Safety and Health Section of the Management System Committee, responsible for the safety and health activities of the Nissha Group, was reorganized in fiscal year 2016 as the Safety and Health Subcommittee of the CSR Committee. The new organization reviews whether our management system is functioning effectively, oversees the Safety and Health Committees operated by each base, and works to standardize and upgrade initiatives throughout the Nissha Group. The Safety and Health Committees of each base consist of base representatives including a safety manager and health manager, and employee representatives selected from the labor union and from each workplace. The members meet to exchange views and propose measures for improvement toward realizing a safe and comfortable workplace. Safety and Health 43 CSR Report 2015 Safety and Health Management Structure Reduction of Workplace Risks—Risk Assessment We continue in our efforts to conduct point-based evaluations of the dangers and harms that production equipment and chemical substances used in the workplace may have on workers, and to take measures starting with the highest risks. Based on the results of risk assessment, we work Safety and Health 44 CSR Report 2015 to identify the remaining risks and reflect them in our management efforts. We have also organized a set of standards and launched an initiative to assess the risks of chemical exposure ahead of mandatory requirements being introduced in 2016. Safety Patrols Members of the Safety and Health Committees of each base take the lead in conducting safety patrols of workplaces. In addition to regular monthly patrols, heads of the Subcommittees carry out special safety patrols during national safety week in July toward enhancing workplace awareness about safety. Starting in fiscal year 2016, we provide safety patrol training for workplace promoters of safety and health. Employees who have acquired a certain level of knowledge are registered as certificate holders and participate in the patrols, identifying problems with fresh pairs of eyes and striving to create safe and comfortable workplaces. Occurrence of Work-related Accidents In fiscal year 2015, both the frequency and the severity of work-related accidents increased due to a rise over the previous year in injuries or casualties resulting in four or more days of leave. Starting with this CSR Report 2015, we present a breakdown by region (Japan and Asia) and by gender for the number of work-related accidents only. Occurrence of Work-related Accidents (Nissha Group in Japan) *1. Frequency of work-related accidents: Refers to the number of injuries and casualties resulting from workrelated accidents (four or more days of leave) per one million working hours *2. Severity of work-related accidents: Refers to the severity of work-related accidents in terms of the number of working days lost per one thousand working hours. Number of Work-related Accidents (Nissha Group in Japan and Asia, by region and by gender) *Work-related accidents at production bases in North America are measured by different standards, and therefore statistical data are incomplete at the time of this publishing. We plan to include the data in CSR Report 2016 and beyond. Safety and Health Education and Training We provide education and training required in workplaces based on our Safety and Health Safety and Health 45 CSR Report 2015 Education and Management Regulations. In fiscal year 2015, to respond to the concentration of workrelated accidents in employees with limited on-site experience, we conducted training for supervisors in the basics of worker guidance as well as practical training in procedures for assessing the dangers and risks of chemical substances. Safety and health training Prevention of Lifestyle Diseases We are carrying on with our efforts in exercise, diet, and smoking cessation as countermeasures for metabolic syndrome with the aim of preventing lifestyle diseases. In fiscal year 2015, we promoted exercise, and provided opportunities to learn about the benefits of exercise and specific exercise routines. In addition to health courses by industrial physicians and health lectures by outside instructors, we organized an original event for gauging health. Employees measured their grip strength, abdominal Event for gauging health muscle strength, flexibility, sense of balance, reflex, body fat, and girth, and received individual consultations using a fitness support leaflet. Learning the age of their physical strength through the measurement results proved to be a good opportunity to develop awareness about exercising on a regular basis. For promoting smoking cessation, we continue to organize Smokerlyzer events to measure the level of carbon monoxide in smokers’ breath. As a high-risk approach, we further undertook measures to maintain health by recommending visits to a medical institution to employees who required either detailed examination or re-examination as a result of their health checkup, and provided specific health guidance with support from a designated medical institution to employees who required it as a result of their health checkup. Mental Health Support We launched efforts to provide mental health education in fiscal year 2010, and as part of our mental health checkup offering, introduced surveys on coping with work-related stress in fiscal year 2013. The survey results have been useful in self-care by helping employees identify and cope with their own stress. In future, we plan to use the survey results also in our organizational approach to improving workplace environments and promoting comfortable workplaces. As a first step in this initiative, in fiscal Line care education year 2015, we provided line care education about supporting the process of improving workplace environments for mental health. • Line care education in improving workplace environments As for support on a personal level, we have an outside web counseling service through which a specialized counselor offers mental health advice online. In fiscal year 2015, the service was used nine times. For employees who work long hours, our healthcare staff and industrial physicians offer consultation to understand their health condition and work with their supervisor and the human resources division to provide required follow-up guidance. For employees who require special attention in terms of mental health, we follow our Long-term Safety and Health 46 CSR Report 2015 Leave Regulations and offer time to recover from their condition as well as consideration in the workplace upon reinstatement, in an aim to prevent recurrence and achieve a smooth return to work.

Status of Waste Generation at Bases This section uses graphs to introduce the status of waste generated at Nissha’s major production bases in Japan in March 2015. The Environment 48 CSR Report 2015 Environmental Policy and Management Structures Environmental Policy and Management Structures In April 2015, we established a new Environmental Subcommittee of the CSR Committee, which promotes environmental risk management in the Nissha Group through initiatives both in strategic CSR, aimed at enhancing our corporate value from a mediumto long-term perspective, and in basic CSR, seeking to build and maintain a structure for conforming to global standards such as that provided by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) toward strengthening our corporate foundation. Activities in basic CSR include building an environmental management system (EMS) based on ISO14001 at all bases of the Nissha Group in Japan. The Environmental Subcommittee comprises management covering general supervision, the director of Corporate General Affairs in Corporate Administration in charge of EMS management, and Environmental Subcommittee members selected from each department and factory. The Corporate Environmental and Safety Management of Corporate General Affairs functions as a secretariat and operates the Environmental Subcommittee. It conducts internal environmental audits and management reviews toward the continuous improvement of our EMS, and receives ISO14001 certification inspections to assess and improve EMS effectiveness. Our Environmental Policy aims for both business development and the realization of a sustainable society. We are working to familiarize the policy widely throughout the company via the Nissha intranet as well as promoting the policy among all employees by posting it at each base of the Nissha Group. Toward achieving our environmental objectives, which serve as group-wide mediumterm objectives, each factory and organization sets its own environmental targets, and creates and implements an action plan. These environmental targets are linked to quality targets and the more important key performance indicators (KPI) so that they relate directly to everyday tasks. Overseas offices of the Nissha Group obtain ISO14001 certification individually. With support from the Corporate Environmental and Safety Management of Corporate General Affairs, they also undertake initiatives to build and maintain a structure in conformance with global standards such as the template provided by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC). Environmental Policy Nissha and its subsidiaries, as members of the global society, aim for business development and the realization of a sustainable society through environmentally conscious corporate activities. 1. Prevention of Pollution We comply with legal requirements and agreements with society, and strive to prevent environmental pollution in all aspects of our corporate activities such as product development, design, materials, production, sales, and facilities. 2. Product Safety We fulfill promises with our customers and deliver safe and environmentally conscious products. 3. Prevention of Global Warming We make a contribution to prevention of the global warming by efficient using of resources and Environmental Policy and Management Structures 49 CSR Report 2015 energy. 4. Continuous Improvement We strive for continuous improvement by establishing an environmental management system and reviewing it in response to changes in the business environment. 5. Co-Existence with Society We promote open dialogue with our customers, shareholders, suppliers, employees, and society through our efforts to preserve the global environment. Establishment April 1, 2012 Continuous Improvements in the Environmental Management System (EMS) We build an EMS not only at our major production bases but also at small production bases and sales bases. Each site focuses on its key management items and operates an effective EMS. With an eye toward improvement, in fiscal year 2015, we organized our sites into the four categories below. 1. ISO14001 certification sites 2. ISO14001 non-certified operation control and inspection sites 3. Compliance inspection sites 4. Chemical substance control and inspection sites ISO14001 certification sites, which are also our major production bases, carried on implementing a unique environmental risk assessment process based on environmental hazards, taking into account the risks of a suspension in factory operations. This risk assessment process involves two pillars of activity: managing negative risks, and managing positive risks including the improvement of environmental performance in sync with business targets and quality targets. ISO14001 non-certified operation control and inspection sites are small production bases that are included in the scope of EMS application, although they have not obtained certification. As operation control and inspection sites, we checked whether their maintenance and control processes are operated appropriately in compliance with laws and regulations. Compliance inspection sites are sales bases that do not cover production functions. They operated an EMS to check whether waste management is conducted in compliance with laws and regulations. In fiscal year 2015, Nissha Business Service Co., Ltd. obtained ISO14001 certification. In fiscal year 2016, we are set to promote ISO14001 certification for the product development divisions of the Industrial Materials and Devices business units. Amid the move to strengthen adherence to global standards including the requirements of customers and the EICC template, in fiscal year 2016, we plan to organize sites in the scope of EMS application into the three categories below, and promote efforts in EMS that also live up to global standards based on the ISO14001 management system. 1. Customer and EICC requirement compliance sites 2. ISO14001 certification sites 3. Compliance inspection sites Many overseas offices of the Nissha Group build and operate an EMS individually. Environmental Policy and Management Structures 50 CSR Report 2015 Nissha Environmental Management Structure Energy Management and Environmental Communication Structures Environmental Policy and Management Structures 51 CSR Report 2015 Environmental Objectives and Status of Achievement The Nissha Group environmental objectives set in May 2012 serve as medium-term objectives covering the three-year period from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2015 for the Nissha Group in Japan. In fiscal year 2015, the final year of this period, each factory and relevant division aimed to achieve its individual environmental targets toward achieving the objectives of the Nissha Group in Japan as a whole. ISO14001 certification sites undertook environmental risk mangement and measures to reduce environmental risks, and all sites attained one risk level lower. As a result, we maintained zero environmental accidents and achieved our environmental objective. In energy saving measures, Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc. (NPT) Himeji Factory achieved its reduction target for CO2 emissions but did not achieve its target CO2 emissions rate, which indicates efficiency against production volume. In recognition of energy saving efforts implemented since its inception, NPT Kaga Factory received an Excellent Energy Management Promoter Japan Electric Association Hokuriku Branch Director’s Award. Nitec Printing Co., Ltd. (NPC) Yachiyo Factory upgraded its air-conditioning system from a gas absorber to an electric chiller. Each factory worked toward improvement, and some, as mentioned above, won external recognition. However, the Nissha Group in Japan recorded a CO2 emissions rate of 1.32 in fiscal year 2015 (compared to fiscal year 2012 results as 1.00), and we did not achieve our target. In waste reduction measures, we recorded a waste generation rate of 0.79 in fiscal year 2015 (compared to fiscal year 2012 results as 1.00) and achieved our target, primarily due to a significant reduction in the volume of waste generated at NPT Kaga Factory. In addition to items designated in the environmental objectives, each factory sets its own targets and works to achieve them. Having reviewed its wastewater treatment process, NPT Kaga Factory aimed to reduce the usage rate of chemical agents and achieved its target. Nitec Industries, Inc. (NII) sought to reduce the usage rate of organic solvents, but did not achieve its target due to a decline in production volume and conversion to small lot production. It did, however, produce results in resource reuse and cost reduction through efforts to sell organic solvents for recycling. We have officially begun to conduct CSR audits of our suppliers based on the template provided by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), and plan to approach major suppliers during the three-year period of the Fifth Medium-term Business Plan starting in fiscal year 2016. We also continue to conduct environmental workshops in which employees visit local elementary schools and nurseries neighboring production bases. Participants number more than 4,000 children at a total of 78 schools since we started the initiative in 2007. Nissha Environmental Objectives Scope: Nissha ISO14001 certification sites in Japan (hereinafter “certification sites”) 1. Prevention of pollution Zero environmental accidents (accidents that affect areas outside the factory) Reduce the possibility of environmental risks (by one risk level) by the end of fiscal year 2015 Certification sites implement measures to reduce environmental risks* classified as H2 or more on the hazard assessment list (make efforts to attain one risk level lower) * The degree of severity may not change after measures are implemented in some cases Environmental Objectives and Status of Achievement 52 CSR Report 2015 * H2 or more refers to hazards on the hazard assessment list that affect areas outside the factory * H2 is equivalent to “maintain” in the conventional classification, and should be addressed in accordance with the designated procedure * The risk of environmental hazards by degree of severity and possibility, assessed in nine levels in a matrix (Risk levels from highest to lowest: VH, H1, H2, H3, H4, L1, L2, L3, VL) 2. Prevention of global warming Reduce CO2 emissions rate (basic unit) by 3% or more by fiscal year 2015 (Base: Average of fiscal year 2012 results) Certification sites reduce annual CO2 emissions rate by 1% or more compared to the previous year by basic unit, derived from factors such as production volume, through improvements in work processes (efficiency) and quality * Each organization may set KPI or quality targets as environmental targets * Companies classified as “specific business operator” in the Act on the Rational Use of Energy use the basic unit reported under the act * A default emission factor (0.555 kg-CO2 / kwh) is used to monitor fluctuations resulting from initiatives 3.

Reduction of hazardous chemical substances Certification sites reduce usage rate of hazardous chemical substances Work to reduce {(usage or purchase volume) / (production volume, treatment volume, or number of units)} (Certification sites set individual targets) Results and Assessment in Fiscal Year 2015 and Fiscal Year 2014–2015 1. Prevention of pollution Target: Certification sites implement measures to reduce environmental risks classified as H2 or more on the hazard assessment list (make efforts to attain one risk level lower) Environmental Objectives and Status of Achievement 53 CSR Report 2015 Results in Fiscal Year 2015 Certification sites Nitec Industries, Inc. (NII) Koka Factory and Tsu Factory, Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc. (NPT) Himeji Factory and Kaga Factory, Nitec Printing Co., Ltd. (NPC) Yachiyo Factory, and Nissha Business Service Co., Ltd. (NBS) created a hazard assessment list and took measures to reduce risks. These sites primarily organized training in substance leakage. NPT Kaga Factory worked to prevent pipe leakage in its wastewater treatment process. Assessment: Satisfactory Results in Fiscal Year 2014–2015 All certification sites took measures to reduce risks and attained one risk level lower. As a result, we maintained zero environmental accidents and achieved our environmental objective. From fiscal year 2016 onward, we plan to conduct environmental hazard assessment taking into account risk assessment of steady-state chemical substances. Assessment: Satisfactory 2. Prevention of global warming Target: Certification sites reduce annual CO2 emissions rate by 1% or more compared to the previous year by basic unit, derived from factors such as production volume, through improvements in work processes (efficiency) and quality Results in Fiscal Year 2015 The Nissha Group in Japan recorded a CO2 emissions rate of 1.14 in fiscal year 2015 (compared to fiscal year 2014 results as 1.00), and we did not achieve our target. Although some factories produced results in measures linked with quality-related activities, such as improvement of yield rate, NPT Himeji factory, which accounts for 30% of CO2 emissions in the Nissha Group in Japan, did not achieve its target by basic unit. Assessment: Unsatisfactory Results in Fiscal Year 2014-2015 The Nissha Group in Japan recorded a CO2 emissions rate of 1.32 in fiscal year 2015 (compared to fiscal year 2012 results as 1.00), and we did not achieve our target. However, in recognition of energy saving efforts implemented since its inception, NPT Kaga Factory received an Excellent Energy Management Promoter Japan Electric Association Hokuriku Branch Director’s Award. Assessment: Poor Issues: The environmental objectives of the Nissha Group in Japan serve as medium-term objectives covering a three-year period. Although each factory promotes various energy saving measures to achieve its targets, we have had difficulty maintaining a steady basic unit due to a succession of mass production launches and factory reorganizations. Appropriate management of the basic unit will be required from fiscal year 2016 onward with the addition of new bases to the group through M&A. 3-1. Control waste generation Target: Certification sites reduce annual waste generation rate by 1% or more compared to the previous year by basic unit, derived from factors such as production volume, through improvements in work processes (efficiency) and quality Environmental Objectives and Status of Achievement 54 CSR Report 2015 Results in Fiscal Year 2015 We recorded a waste generation rate of 0.65 in fiscal year 2015 (compared to fiscal year 2014 results as 1.00), primarily due to a significant reduction in the volume of waste generated at NPT Kaga Factory. NII did not achieve its target by basic unit due to unstable production volumes stemming from a conversion to small lot production and factory reorganization. NPT Kaga Factory worked to reduce the amount of sludge generated by improving its wastewater treatment process. Assessment: Satisfactory Results in Fiscal Year 2014-2015 The Nissha Group in Japan recorded a waste generation rate of 0.79 in three years (compared to fiscal year 2012 results as 1.00), and we achieved our target, primarily due to a significant reduction in the volume of waste generated at NPT Kaga Factory. Assessment: Satisfactory Issues: The environmental objectives of the Nissha Group in Japan serve as medium-term objectives covering a three-year period. Although each factory promotes various waste reduction measures to achieve its targets, we have had difficulty maintaining a steady basic unit due to a succession of mass production launches and factory reorganizations. Appropriate management of the basic unit will be required from fiscal year 2016 onward with the addition of new bases to the group through M&A. 3-2. Promote the selling of waste for recycling Target: Certification sites set individual target rates and work to sell waste for recycling * Maintain zero emissions Results in Fiscal Year 2014-2015 Through efforts to sell organic solvents for recycling, NII Koka Factory dramatically improved its target rate from 8.51% in fiscal year 2014 to 36.8% in fiscal year 2015. Through an initiative to separate and sell waste, NBS is a contributor to efforts made by the Nissha Group in Japan for selling waste for recycling. Assessment: Satisfactory 4. Reduction of hazardous chemical substances Target: Certification sites reduce usage rate of hazardous chemical substances Results in Fiscal Year 2014-2015 NPT Kaga Factory improved its wastewater treatment process and worked to reduce the usage rate of chemical agents. NPT Himeji factory aimed to reduce the rate of chemical agents used in the production process and achieved its target. Assessment: Satisfactory Environmental Objectives and Status of Achievement 55 CSR Report 2015 Environmental Impact as a Result of Business Operations In order to grasp the impact of our business operations on the environment, we conduct surveys of resource and energy usage (input) and gas, water, and waste emissions (output). The results for the Nissha Group in fiscal year 2015 are given in the table below. Input and Output at Nissha Group Production Bases Input for the Nissha Group in Japan decreased slightly, by about 4%, compared to fiscal year 2014. By business, Devices saw an increase of around 6% primarily due to an increase in materials used in product manufacturing accompanying full-scale production using a new process at Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc. (NPT) Kaga Factory. Industrial Materials saw the effects of a reorganized product portfolio. At Nitec Industries, Inc. (NII) Koka Factory, the usage of film increased by approximately 70%, solvents by 20%, and ink by 40%. At NII Tsu Factory, the usage of film decreased significantly due to a shift to new film production. Information and Communication saw a decrease in the usage of paper by roughly 6% due to a decline in production volume. We welcomed FIS Inc. (FIS) into the Nissha Group in fiscal year 2015, and plan to disclose information about its various activities under Life Innovation starting in fiscal year 2016. In terms of output for the Nissha Group as a whole, CO2 emissions remained nearly level and waste emissions decreased by about 5% compared to fiscal year 2014. At 2,594,000 m3, water emissions increased by roughly 4% from the previous year. At overseas bases, input increased by around 21% compared to the previous year due to a rise in production volume. Input increased particularly at Guangzhou Nissha High Precision Plastics Co., Ltd. by a significant 60%, at Nissha (Kunshan) Precision IMD Mold Co., Ltd. by 20%, at Eimo Technologies, Inc. by 13%, and at Southern Nissha Sdn. Bhd. by 4%. Molded resin accounts for more than 90% of materials used at overseas production bases. Environmental Impact as a Result of Business Operations 56 CSR Report 2015 Environmental Impact as a Result of Business Operations 57 CSR Report 2015 Prevention of Further Global Warming Status of CO2 Emissions at Nissha In fiscal year 2015, CO2 emissions from Nissha bases in Japan totaled 106,087 t-CO2, for a reduction of about 1% compared to 107,101 t-CO2 in the previous year. CO2 emissions from overseas production bases amounted to 8,748 t-CO2 for an increase of 2% compared to 8,601 tCO2 in the previous year. The reduction at bases in Japan resulted primarily from the significant decrease in emissions from Nitec Industries, Inc. (NII) Tsu Factory stemming from a reorganization of product portfolio. CO2 emissions from NII Tsu Factory amounted to 6,566 t-CO2 in fiscal year 2015, for a roughly 37% decrease compared to 10,431 t-CO2 in the previous year. On the other hand, emissions from NII Koka Factory were 19,768 t-CO2, for a 10% increase compared to 17,979 t-CO2 in the previous year. Due to the full-scale start of mass production, those from Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc. (NPT) Kaga Factory were 31,438 t-CO2, also for a 10% increase compared to 28,693 t-CO2 in the previous year. CO2 emissions from overseas production bases increased at Southern Nissha Sdn. Bhd., Guangzhou Nissha High Precision Plastics Co., Ltd., and Nissha (Kunshan) Precision IMD Mold Co., Ltd., but decreased by around 4% compared to the previous year at Eimo Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Nissha USA. At 4,645 t-CO2, emissions from Eimo Technologies account for more than half of the volume of all overseas production bases combined. The Nissha Group emits virtually no energy-related greenhouse gases other than CO2, and their effects are minimal. Trends in CO2 Emissions Volumes and Basic Unit Prevention of Further Global Warming 58 CSR Report 2015 Trends in Energy Consumption and Basic Unit Trends in Electricity Consumption Trends in Gas Consumption Prevention of Further Global Warming 59 CSR Report 2015 Trends in Gasoline, Diesel, and Heavy Oil Consumption Basic Unit Management by Production Volume and Its Issues The enactment of the revised Act on the Rational Use of Energy demands the comprehension and management of energy use per company. To comply with the legal requirements in line with this shift, in fiscal year 2014 we started managing emissions under a basic unit based on factors such as production volume per company. With 1.00 indicating the benchmark fiscal year 2014 results of Nissha Printing Co., Ltd. and each affiliated company that constitutes a production base, we set fiscal year 2015 targets at 0.99 or less. The results are given in the table below. Nissha in Japan did not achieve the company-wide target by basic unit, as the results of NPT Himeji Factory dropped significantly below its basic unit. We have had difficulty managing basic units appropriately due to cases of imbalance between production and emissions volumes, stemming from new product releases, new mass production launches, and factory reorganizations accompanying a shift in product portfolio during the threeyear period covered by our environmental objectives serving as group-wide medium-term objectives. More appropriate management of the basic units of CO2 and waste emissions will be required from fiscal year 2016 onward with the addition of new bases to the group through M&A. * CSR Report 2014, issued in June 2014, contained the following errors. CO2 emissions volumes for fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014 were incorrectly given due to a miscalculation of emissions accompanying gas consumption at NPT Himeji Factory. The correct figures are given in this report. Prevention of Further Global Warming 60 CSR Report 2015 Waste Management Waste Management and Zero Emissions In fiscal year 2015, the Nissha Group generated a total 16,929 tons of waste for a 5% reduction compared to fiscal year 2014. The primary reason is the decrease in production volume at Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc. (NPT). The volume of simple incineration and landfill waste similarly decreased, amounting to 2,020 tons for a 12% reduction. Our recycling and resource reuse rate was 88.1%, for an improvement of 1 percentage point compared to the previous year. We fell short of achieving our zero emissions target (a recycling and resource reuse rate of 99.5% or more), however, as sludge generated at NPT Kaga Factory cannot be recycled. NPT Kaga Factory is working to reduce the volume of sludge generated through improvements in its wastewater treatment process. Its recycling and resource reuse rate improved from 64.5% in the second half of fiscal year 2014 to 71.5% in the second half of fiscal year 2015. Further reductions in the amount of sludge generated from NPT Kaga Factory are expected to contribute to a significant improvement in the recycling and resource reuse rate of the Nissha Group in Japan in fiscal year 2016. Status of Recycling and Converting Waste into Valuable Resources We continued to make efforts to convert waste into valuable resources. In fiscal year 2015, we sold 38.2% of all waste generated for an increase of 6 percentage points compared to the previous year. Similarly, the material recycling rate was 56.3% for an increase of 2 percentage points compared to fiscal year 2014. Nitec Industries, Inc. (NII) is making active efforts to sell waste solvents for recycling, as it offers the benefits of a lighter burden on the environment as well as cost reductions. Trends in Recycling and Resouse Reuse (Nissha Group in Japan) Waste Management 61 CSR Report 2015 Status of Initiatives at Overseas Production Bases Asian production bases Guangzhou Nissha High Precision Plastics Co., Ltd., Nissha (Kunshan) Precision IMD Mold Co., Ltd., and Southern Nissha Sdn. Bhd. generated a total 256 tons of waste in fiscal year 2015 for a 32% increase compared to fiscal year 2014. In a breakdown by company, the year-on-year increase was 41% at Southern Nissha, 14% at Guangzhou Nissha, and 89% at Nissha Kunshan due to increases in production volume and other factors. On the other hand, recycling and resource reuse rates remained level, with all Asian production bases achieving their target again this year. Southern Nissha achieved a rate of 99.0% against a target of 90.0% or more, Nissha Kunshan achieved a rate of 89.1% against a target of 86.3% or more, and Guangzhou Nissha achieved a rate of 72.0% against a target of 71.0% or more. All waste generated in Asian production bases (Guangzhou Nissha, Nissha Kunshan, Southern Nissha) FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 All waste generated (tons) 99 194 256 Recycling and resource reuse rates in Asian production bases (FY2015) Targets Results Evaluation Guangzhou Nissha 71.0% or more 72.0% Satisfactory Nissha Kunshan 86.3% or more 89.1% Satisfactory Southern Nissha 90.0% or more 99.0% Satisfactory Risk Management Related to Waste and Waste Converted in Valuable Resources We recognize largely three types of waste-related risk: Accidents and disasters caused by waste and waste converted into valuable resources (including at treatment contractors) Environmental pollution and violation of laws caused by inappropriate waste treatment Leakage of confidential information from waste and waste converted into valuable resources Based on laws and customer demand, we have created a set of Nissha Waste Management Regulations that enables all bases to manage waste safely under the same set of standards. In line with these regulations, each base has drawn up its own Waste Management Manual and makes efforts toward thorough waste separation and management. Whether small amounts of substances or a spray can, the properties of waste are checked meticulously and monitored so as to prevent spillage during transportation and accidents at treatment facilities. The regulations also stipulate the criteria for selecting waste treatment contractors and for regularly inspecting treatment facilities that use a checklist original to Nissha. In addition, we have in place standards for managing waste and waste converted into valuable resources that contain confidential information, and promote management in association with our information security management system (ISMS). Waste Management 62 CSR Report 2015 Monitoring and Prevention of Pollution Measures to Help Prevent Pollution We undertake monitoring and measuring activities to prevent pollution. Based on strict voluntary standards, we conduct periodic testing the level of atmospheric pollutants, wastewater quality, noise, and foul odor. Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc.

Initiatives Related to Conflict Minerals We established Underlying Philosophy Concerning Corporate Responsibility for Minerals Procurement in March 2014, where we declared to make sincere response engaging in minerals procurement. Fair Operating Practices 69 CSR Report 2015 Initiatives Related to Information Security The spread of the Internet and the broad use of smartphones and other devices have ushered in a convenient era in which anyone can connect with the online community easily at all times. On the other hand, the risks are increasing of everyone becoming either a victim or perpetrator of information leakage. We at the Nissha Group recognize the paramount importance of not leaking outside the company or beyond related parties information about our employees, personal information, and information entrusted to us by our customers and suppliers, particularly highly confidential information assets such as information on new products and state-of-the-art technologies. All our employees adhere to our Information Security Policy, which we drew up in and implement since 2005 with the aim of building a highly reliable and safe information security management system (ISMS). Information Security Policy Nissha and its subsidiaries committed to establish, maintain, and improve highly reliable and secure an information security management system to protect our own business information and the information assets, which we acquire from customers, suppliers and employees, etc., through our business activities performed, from any kinds of threat. And we take internal and external information security requirements into consideration and reduce all risks below the acceptable levels. 1. We continually improve an Information security management system by establishing, implementing, and reviewing the information security objectives, so that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information can be maintained and improved. 2. We comply with legal and regulatory requirements for information security and with contractual security obligation. 3. We establish and improve the criteria for reasonably evaluating risks concerning information security as well as the risk assessment methods, to mitigate risks and to maintain the information security levels which contributes to the corporate developments. 4. We make Information Security Policy known to all employees working in the premises of Nissha and its subsidiaries to raise their awareness of the issues related to information security. Information Security Management Structure We have in place an Information Security Subcommittee of the CSR Committee to serve as a center for the promotion of information security. The subcommittee is run by an ISMS management representative (the Chief Information Officer, or CIO) and comprises information security managers and promoters selected from each department. An ISMS secretariat set up within the IT Department functions as the subcommittee secretariat. The subcommittee plays an important role in the promotion of our ISMS by addressing issues that have become evident as well as reporting and sharing the results and challenges of initiatives related to information security. Initiatives Related to Information Security 70 CSR Report 2015 Management Structure Initiatives in Information Security Management In September 2005, we obtained ISO27001 certification, a global standard for ISMS. Since then, we have built and continuously maintained and improved an ISMS unique to the Nissha Group. Through the operation of our ISMS, we have performed risk assessment and analyses related to information assets, determined and strived for information security targets, complied with related laws and regulations, conducted internal audits, and appropriately followed processes such as management reviews, thereby reducing the risks of information security incidents and accidents. In fiscal year 2015, the Nissha Group focused particularly on the following initiatives. 1. Complete revision of information security-related regulations We carried on with our initiative from the previous year in expanding company-wide our revised information security-related regulations addressing changes in the IT environment. In addition to organizing our information security structure and dealing with smart devices, social networking services, and bring-your-own-device (BYOD), we reinforced the content of our information security education materials. 2. Strengthening of information security education We implemented training and education to deepen the understanding of all employees, including through group sessions at affiliated companies new to the Nissha Group. 3. Expansion of ISO27001 examination and certification Nitec Precision and Technologies, Inc. (NPT) Himeji Factory obtained ISO 27001 certification with an eye to more advanced, continuous operation of its unique ISMS. 4. Survey toward expanding ISMS to overseas bases We conducted a survey of overseas bases toward ISMS operation, such as through questionnaires and on-site interviews. Initiatives Related to Information Security 71 CSR Report 2015 5. Response to new ISO 27001 (2013 version) We made preparations for certification in the following year by updating related documents and conducting internal audits. In fiscal year 2016, we plan to obtain certification in the new version of ISO27001 and start operation of ISMS at overseas bases. The Nissha Group will actively continue in our efforts to keep up with the rapid changes in the IT environment, and reduce risks and strengthen management of information security. Initiatives Related to Information Security 72 CSR Report 2015 Trade Management Enhancement of Trade Management Structure Our Initiatives related to trade management date back to April 2010 with the launch of the Trade Management Improvement Project Team. With the purpose of building an appropriate internal structure for import and export control, the following year, in 2011, we established the Trade Administration and Control Committee and started full-scale trade management. At its first general meeting organized in May 2012, the committee confirmed that activities would aim to strengthen security trade control incompliance with the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act, and to obtain authorized exporter status under the Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) program, which would recognize that we implement appropriate trade management based on the Customs Act. We obtained this AEO approval in June 2014. We earn an increasing proportion of our sales overseas, with the percentage reaching 75.7% in fiscal year 2015. For a company like us, efforts in trade management are essential for business continuation. Net sales and percentage of overseas sales Trade Management Structure The Trade Administration and Control Committee works to strengthen trade management under the chairperson served by a director appointed by the president. Thorough management in daily operations is assigned to committee members and division managers at business divisions, corporate divisions, and affiliated companies in Japan. In fiscal year 2016, the committee secretariat plans visit our overseas bases for employee education toward expanding trade management efforts to overseas affiliated companies. Trade Management 73 CSR Report 2015 Trade Administration and Control Committee AEO Approval Status Following approval as an AEO Exporter in June 2014, we obtained approval as an AEO Importer on June 15, 2015. Presentation of the certification was held on June 26, 2015 at the Osaka Customs Headquarters. Southern Nissha Sdn. Bhd., in Malaysia, obtained approval as both an AEO Exporter and an AEO Importer in October 2014. Certificate of AEO Importer Fiscal Year 2015 Initiatives and Future Challenges In fiscal year 2015, we carried on with our initiatives from the previous year in fortifying security export control and furthering export management not only of cargo but also of services (technological information). Meanwhile, we also worked toward obtaining approval as an AEO Importer. Members of the Trade Administration and Control Committee from each business unit organized secretariat meetings every month, and as part of its efforts to fortify company-wide trade management initiatives, implemented rank-specific training for select groups of participants: sessions for all employees to acquire basic knowledge, sessions for managers and trade-related workers aiming to acquire more specialized knowledge in trade-related duties, and sessions for executives. It also invited an instructor from Osaka Customs to conduct a special session on imports, kicking off efforts to obtain approval as an AEO Importer. Through these efforts, awareness has improved about prohibited articles and restricted articles based on import control, and the number of submissions for export and import application continued to increase significantly. We are also carrying on with our efforts toward thorough compliance with rules for completing and submitting customs documents required with actual exports and imports. The strict control of export and import cargo is not only a demand from society but also, for a company like Nissha that operates a global business, an important initiative toward enhanced service to our customers. While we draw on the reciprocal advantages of approval as both an AEO Exporter and an AEO Importer, we believe it is crucial to step up our efforts continuously on a Trade Management 74 CSR Report 2015 company-wide level toward appropriate cargo control and improved employee awareness of security. We will continue to promote efforts to ensure safety, improve work quality, and fortify our initiatives in compliance so that we may provide safe, secure, and speedy international logistics services to meet our customers’ demands. Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) Program Reinforced security measures are a major requirement in international logistics in recent years. Amid the increase in international logistics, ensuring both trade security and smooth logistics is a great challenge. The AEO program seeks to address this challenge by fostering partnerships between customs and private businesses. AEO operators, approved for their security management and compliance structures, are given benefits such as simplified customs procedures in accordance with international standards. Trade Management 75 CSR Report 2015 Initiatives Related to Intellectual Property Approach to Intellectual Property The protection of intellectual property is our basic policy as well as a key item of our Guideline of the Corporate Ethics and Compliance. We make active efforts to respect the intellectual property of third parties and to obtain rights for and use that of our own. Intellectual Property Management acts as the central body for protecting intellectual property. With the aim of expanding the performance of business units and ensuring a competitive advantage for new businesses, it works to establish intellectual property strategies for the entire Nissha Group and meet internal needs to secure intellectual property rights. Basic policy for protection of intellectual property (from the Guideline of the Corporate Ethics and Compliance) 1. We will acknowledge the importance of our technologies and brands as intellectual property and will undertake their appropriate management. 2. We will report any invention arising through our business operations in accordance with our Company regulations. 3. We will strive to avoid the breach of third-party intellectual property rights. Promotion of Patent Application We aim to file for patent application and obtain rights for new technologies developed in our development divisions. To respond to the increasing globalization of our business activities, this requires us to file for application not only in Japan but also abroad. The promotion of technology development and the obtaining of patent rights help to differentiate Nissha products, made with our own distinctive technologies, from other companies’ products. This in turn puts a check on the inappropriate use of other companies’ technologies, helping also to reduce intellectual propertyrelated risks in connection with Nissha products for our customers. Monitoring of Other Companies’ Patents We periodically research and continuously monitor other companies’ patents so that Nissha products do not infringe others’ patent rights. For monitoring, we input subjects as research criteria in a patent database and obtain results on a regular basis using a selective dissemination of information (SDI) system. Intellectual Property Training Programs We organize internal training programs so that employees may deepen their understanding of and properly protect intellectual property. In fiscal year 2015, we invited an outside specialist to conduct sessions divided into four levels—introductory, basic, advanced, and practical research—in which participants learned in detail about intellectual property law, how to research other companies’ patents, and promoting technology development and filing for patent application. We also hold sessions in which a member of Intellectual Property Management serves as instructor.

We work with our suppliers that constitute this supply chain to promote CSR procurement based on our Basic Purchasing Policy toward realizing co-existence, sharing awareness of social responsibility, and enhancing mutual corporate value. Procurement and purchasing as a truly global company →Fair evaluation / CSR procurement Partnership with Our Suppliers 78 CSR Report 2015 Expansion of Our Supply Chain We collaborate with various suppliers in conducting our business activities. Supply Chain of the Industrial Materials and Divices Businesses Supply Chain of the Information and Communication Business Start of CSR Supplier Audits We started CSR supplier audits covering four areas—labor and human rights, safety and health, environmental protection, and ethics—drawing on the global template provided by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and on our customers’ own code of conduct based on this EICC template. In fiscal year 2015, we carried out audits at a total of five major materials suppliers of the Devices business and companies that dispatch workers to our factories. Although we have conducted audits related to quality and the environment in the past, the inclusion of the EICC template has led to a reduction in CSR risks and further enhanced the content of the audits. Auditors are selected from Nissha employees who have undertaken and passed EICC auditor training. The audit process consists of an inspection of the supplier’s employment regulations and time cards, tours of the site premises including the clean room, and interviews of employees. In the event the audit uncovers any instances of noncompliance, the supplier is required to establish corrective action (CA) and preventive action (PA) on the findings. Roughly three months later, the auditors check that CA and PA have been taken and the noncompliance has been remedied, bringing the CSR audit to completion. From fiscal year 2016 onward, we will expand the CSR audits to particularly important suppliers of all business units. Partnership with Our Suppliers 79 CSR Report 2015 In moving forward with this initiative, we revised our Basic Purchasing Policy and, based on this revision, further implemented an extensive review of our CSR Procurement Guidelines as well as the Supplier ESG Check Sheet, a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ). Our plan is to hold CSR procurement briefing sessions and distribute the ESG Check Sheet for our suppliers to complete prior to auditing. Before the end of fiscal year 2018, we hope to remedy all instances of noncompliance uncovered by the audits and build a structure in conformance with the EICC template. Fields of the supplier self-check sheet 1. Certification 2. Labor and human rights 3. Health and safety 4. Environmental management 5. Information security management 6. Corporate ethics and compliance 7. Management system Development of Procurement Personnel We make continuous efforts to educate procurement personnel and promote transactions with our suppliers based on fairness, impartiality, and integrity in line with our Basic Purchasing Policy. In fiscal year 2015, we conducted training in relevant laws such as the Act against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, as well as a procurement test created in-house, which attracted 117 participants from a total of seven offices and production bases in Japan. The test included questions on relevant laws, on our basic approach to procurement, and on communication skills. In preparation for the test, we also invited an outside lecturer to provide training in topics selected from the questions. The test results are analyzed and used to plan the contents of the next training session toward enhancing our employees’ skills. Training by an outside lecturer Procurement test In-house Exhibitions In an ongoing effort to strengthen partnerships, we host in-house exhibitions in which we invite our suppliers to introduce their products and new technologies to the employees of various Nissha departments. In fiscal year 2015, we sought cooperation from two suppliers associated with the Devices business and the Information and Communication business. In-house exhibitions Partnership with Our Suppliers 80 CSR Report 2015 Basic Purchasing Policy For the achievement of the Corporate Mission, We are committed to pursuing a mutually trustful Co-Existence with society through our business activities utilizing a unique technology development, based on PRINTING as a core. , we at Nissha are always committed to creating enterprise value by establishing the partnership for co-existence and co-prosperity with suppliers and carrying out mutually fair procurement. We at Nissha evaluate suppliers impartially, fairly and comprehensively, based on the following points. 1. Stable business foundation and reliable business attitude 2. Excellent technology development and supply abilities 3. Flexibility to adapt to changes in the business environment 4. Safety of products and services, stable quality and lead time and competitive prices 5. Supply chain management aimed for business continuation We at Nissha promote CSR procurement by working with suppliers on the following points. 1. Labor 2. Health and Safety 3. Environment 4. Ethics 5. Information security Establishment April 2, 2009 Amendment June 30, 2015 Nissha Printing Co., Ltd. Partnership with Our Suppliers 81 CSR Report 2015 Initiatives Related to Conflict Minerals Since the adoption in August 2012 of the final provision of the Dodd-Frank Act*1 (Section 1052) requiring companies to report whether conflict minerals are contained in their products, we at Nissha have responded to many inquiries from our customers. The major conflict minerals used in Nissha products include tin used in some decoration films and in ITO film*2 for touch panels, and gold used in FPC*3 plating. We procure all of the materials that make up our products, identify those that contain conflict minerals, and then ask our suppliers of the relevant materials not to source minerals produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. In fiscal year 2015, we completed our investigation of smelters and countries of origin concerning all of the conflict minerals we use. Further, in response to customer demand, we have embarked on an initiative to switch suppliers of all conflict minerals to Conflict-Free Smelters, or designated smelters that do not source minerals produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. In future, we will continue our efforts to engage in minerals procurement with integrity in line with our Underlying Philosophy Concerning Corporate Responsibility for Minerals Procurement drawn up in March 2014. Initiatives Related to Conflict Minerals 82 CSR Report 2015 Underlying Philosophy Concerning Corporate Responsibility for Minerals Procurement The Nissha group is deeply concerned that a portion of the conflict minerals extracted by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighboring countries are being used as a source of funding for militia that through acts of looting, violence and forced labor are infringing on fundamental human rights. In April 2012, Nissha became a signatory to the “Global Compact” as advocated by the United Nations. We at Nissha have fully embraced the Ten Principles stated in the Global Compact as a cornerstone of our Corporate Mission. Based upon our recognition of the importance of these principles and aiming for co-existence with our stakeholders, we are committed to non-use of these conflict minerals, as raw materials in our products as they result in an infringement of basic human rights. Accordingly where our company becomes aware of the use of any conflict minerals, we will immediately implement all measures required regarding that use. 1. Nissha is presently implementing ongoing control systems for conflict minerals which we maintain continuously. 2. Nissha will promptly provide to its customers conflict minerals information including its smelters, etc. 3. Nissha in respect of this issue will publish the relevant information in its CSR reports. We will continue to make sincere efforts for the responsible procurement of related minerals in order to fulfill our corporate social responsibilities.

Initiatives Related to Conflict Minerals 83 CSR Report 2015 Consumer Issues Responsibility to Our Customers / Quality-related Initiatives We at Nissha strive daily to improve quality, based on our Quality Policy, so that we may provide products and services that satisfy and meet the needs of our customers. Quality Policy Nissha and its subsidiaries are committed to contributing widely to society through customer’s trust and satisfaction of quality, cost, delivery, services and speed. 1. We aim for quality that stands up to the customer’s expectations. 2. We pursue Zero Defects in our products. 3. We provide products which satisfy customer requirements and conform to relevant legislation and regulations. 4. We establish and maintain a quality management system, and continually improve its effectiveness. April 1, 2011 Junya Suzuki President and CEO Chairman of the Board Quality Management System (QMS) We operate a quality management system that meets the requirements of international standard ISO 9001:2008. Led by the president and a Chief Quality Officer (CQO) in charge of the system, we promote improvements in quality under our comprehensive quality assurance initiative Nissha Total Quality Management (NTQM). We also implement for various forms of improvement based on instructions from top management in periodic management reviews. Consumer Issues 84 CSR Report 2015 Quality Assurance Structure Nissha Total Quality Management (NTQM) Our NTQM initiative seeks to build and improve a mechanism for keeping promises with our customers as well as complying with laws and regulations. NTQM clarifies the procedures followed at each business unit, such as design reviews (DR), reliability tests, and supplier management. We believe that improving the accuracy of these procedures will enable us to provide products and services with even higher levels of quality and safety. In fiscal year 2016, we will embark to create a mechanism for supporting new businesses. Five Musts for the Systematization of Work In fiscal year 2012, we set forth Five Musts for the Systemization of Work, a concept we are working to communicate company-wide through training and our internal newsletter. Five Musts for the Systematization of Work 1. Standardize work. Standardization clarifies the required input, as well as the work you have to perform. 2. First of all, check the input. Begin your work by checking for any fault in input. 3. Incorporate the customer viewpoint into the output. Not only customers for the Company, but your immediate customers, internal and external. In your work, you must aim at an output that meets QCDS from all your customers. 4. Reinforce the system using human factors. Human factors should be used to cover those areas of work which cannot be covered by the system alone. Your communication and teamwork will reinforce the system. Consumer Issues 85 CSR Report 2015 5. Make continuous efforts to improve the system. The system must be established and implemented continuously. Continuous implementation results in further improvement of the system, as well as that of the quality of our work and the Company. Small-group Activities The accumulation of bits of wisdom and creativity from all employees is the source of great improvements in work processes. The small-group activities we restarted in July 2011 are an important mechanism for mustering our knowledge and strengths. And the Company-wide Presentation Meeting of Small-group Activities we have held every six months since October 2011 unveils various results of improvement. The presentation meetings are designed to reward not only the results but also the thought process and creativity that produced the results, as well as the skills for explaining these in an easy-to-understand manner. Through the small-group activities, a positive attitude has taken root in our employees’ minds: 1) always incorporate creativity in work processes, 2) base judgments on data (facts), and 3) utilize the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle to make improvements on a continuous basis. Improvement Proposal System Besides taking time to analyze workplace problems and search for optimal solutions, it is also important to say “just do it” and act on inspired ideas. In fiscal year 2012, we reintroduced the improvement proposal system as a company-wide mechanism. The number of proposals is increasing year after year, and the concept of giving shape to ideas and reporting them is taking root. At present, various departments submit many proposals, which are helping to streamline management and make it more efficient as well as to invigorate workplaces. Education and Training Activities We at Nissha believe that the quality of people plus the quality of work equals the quality of the company. We plan and provide various educational programs in efforts to develop our employees— our most important management resources. 1) General quality training (for first-, second-, and third-year employees, new managerial staff, managers, and overseas transferees) 2) Management system training (ISO 9001:2008, ISO/TS 16949:2009, and core tools) 3) Quality control training (QC Exam levels 3 and 4) Training 4) Quality methodology training (statistical methods, experimental design, TS core tools, etc.) 5) Improvement tool training (industrial engineering, human error prevention, “5 Whys” cause-and-effect analysis, etc.) 6) Other training (corporate ethics and compliance, finance and export management, CPL*) 1) Support for small-group activities Practical 2) Support for project launches education 3) Support for key project themes Information sharing / Company-wide Presentation Meeting of Small-group Activities reciprocal learning * CPL: Combination of contractual liability (CL) with product liability (PL) Consumer Issues 86 CSR Report 2015 Customer Satisfaction Improvement Subcommittee We established a Customer Satisfaction Improvement Subcommittee under the CSR Committee. With the Chief Quality Officer (CQO) Planning Office, which oversees all matters related to quality, functioning as a secretariat, the subcommittee conducts investigations and analyses to improve customer satisfaction, provides education to raise employee awareness, and promotes improvements in systems. From Department-based Optimization to Company-wide Optimization The next process is the customer—this is a Japanese maxim related to quality improvement. It means that all workers in every process must have in mind the customer, who might be workers in the production process following theirs. We at Nissha promote the recognition of ties between one’s own department and others’, and even ties between work processes across the whole company, in terms of “input” and “output.” Hence we stress the importance of links between internal processes and the orderly division of roles. By having all employees stand in the customers’ shoes, we aim to break free of department-based optimization and strive for company-wide optimization. We believe that basic concepts like this and the sorting out of functions will build Nissha’s foundation as a manufacturing company. Quality and Safety of Products We at Nissha provide our customers with explicit information on product usage and safety in documents such as delivery specifications. In the event a serious accident occurs as a result of flaws in our products and services, which may violate laws or regulations, we establish a CPL committee and strive for a quick resolution. We are also prepared to report the incident to government agencies in accordance with laws and to notify our customers as soon as possible. We communicate to our employees the importance of ensuring the quality and safety of products through corporate ethics and compliance training. Up to fiscal year 2015, the number of instances in which we organized a CPL committee or violated laws was zero, resulting in a fine of 0 yen. We will strive to maintain our zero violation record in the future. Initiatives Related to Chemical Substances in Products We at Nissha have in place two sets of criteria for managing chemical substances: the Nissha Control Criteria for Chemical Substances, covering Nissha products and packaging materials, and the Nissha Control Criteria for Chemical Substances in Purchased Products, covering procured items such as primary and secondary raw materials. Both reflect the laws and regulations of relevant countries and regions, including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation, as well as the substance-related criteria of our customers. Whenever our customers’ criteria change, we identify the differences from our criteria and work to conform to our customers’ request. Apart from this, we review our criteria once a year, making revisions as necessary, and organize briefing sessions for related divisions and our suppliers. When selecting new materials in the design and development stages, we conduct design reviews related to materials and assess compliance with our criteria. Our factories are building a mechanism for accepting materials that meet our criteria, ensuring traceability, identifying and separating noncompliant substances, and responding to issues swiftly such as through reporting in efforts to prevent misuse and contamination. Corporate Environmental and Safety Management of Corporate General Affairs functions as a secretariat and works with the product development, quality assurance, and procurement divisions of each business unit to promote management of chemical substances in products. It also carries out internal environmental audits on a regular basis to inspect the management status. This internal structure implements strict control of chemical substances from the design stage to the final product, and responds to changes in the needs of society and the demands of our customers. Consumer Issues 87 CSR Report 2015 Community Involvement and Development Promoting Communication with Local Communities As a member of the global society, Nissha aims not only to fulfill its responsibilities as a corporation but also to win the trust of local communities and be a company that is needed by society. We promote active communication so as to deepen mutual understanding with local communities. Basic Social Contribution Policy We at Nissha set forth our approach to social contribution in the Basic Social Contribution Policy. We devote our management resources to four fields we recognize as important: environmental protection, next generation support, promotion and support of arts and culture, and human support activities. Basic Social Contribution Policy Nissha and Nissha People contribute to society under the spirit of global citizenship by using their management resources effectively toward the achievement of the Corporate Mission. Main fields of contribution: environmental protection , next generation support , promotion and support of arts and culture , and human support activities . Initiatives for Next Generation Support and Humanitarian Support Environmental Workshops at Local Elementary Schools and Nursery Schools Our employees mainly at production sites in Japan visit local elementary schools and nursery schools and conduct environmental workshops. This initiative, which started in fiscal year 2008, has reached some 4,000 children in a total of 78 schools as of the end of March 2015. In fiscal year 2015, workshops were held at two elementary schools in Kyoto, two elementary schools in Kaga, Ishikawa Prefecture, and four nursery schools in Koka, Shiga Prefecture. At the elementary schools, children learned about preventing global warming, how to separate waste, and Community Involvement and Development 88 CSR Report 2015 other environmental initiatives that are close to their daily lives. In addition, we introduced the “Secrets of Printing” and the “Secrets of Touch Panels” as part of a uniquely Nissha program, aiming to encourage an interest in creating items (monozukuri) as well as fostering their concepts of occupations. Workshops Held in Collaboration with an NPO With the aim of developing in children an interest in the environment and unleashing their creativity and imagination, we are holding “Machikusa Mikke!” workshops in collaboration with the NPO Kids Meet Artists (Director: Haruka Idegami). In this program, the children observe the weeds (Machikusa) that generally go unnoticed in daily life, guided by the artist Shinpei Shigemoto, who coined the term Machikusa, give them original names of their choice, and make presentations about them. Following this, they create their own original Machikusa cards, or make Machikusa maps which record where they were discovered. In fiscal year 2015, the workshop was held at two shrines in the Rakuhoku area of Kyoto where children from the Jidokan (local children’s hall) of each location participated, in addition to an elementary school near the Kyoto Headquarters. Since its start in 2010, this workshop has been run a total of 13 times, with around 600 children participating. Support for Kyoto City Inquiry Learning Center for Career Education We are sponsors of the Children's Monodzukuri Project in Kyoto run by the Kyoto City Board of Education. In addition to exhibiting in a corporate booth at the Kyoto City Inquiry Learning Center for Career Education, Kyoto Monodzukuri-no-Dendo (Monodzukuri Hall of Fame), we provide teaching materials and programs for the workshops held at the Monozukuri Workshop. In this program, the children themselves used staplers and tape to create simple touch panels, which were lit up using LED lights. In fiscal year 2015, 22 elementary schools and about 1,300 children participated in our program. We hope that this will provide an opportunity for them to gain an interest in creating things through familiar items in their daily lives. Human Support Activities in Partnership with TABLE FOR TWO Since April 2013, the corporate cafeteria at Nissha’s Kyoto Headquarters implements a program in partnership with TABLE FOR TWO International (Director: Masahisa Kogure), where with each purchase of a meal, 20 yen is donated to provide one school lunch for children in developing countries. The cafeteria designates every Friday as TABLE FOR TWO (TFT) day and serves a healthy TFT menu. While enjoying lunch as usual, employees have the opportunity to deliver a meal to children in Africa. The program has taken root thanks in part to its simplicity. In October 2014, the cafeteria also staged an in-house campaign in conjunction with World Food Day, where employees filled a blank map of Africa with stickers, and the company donated 20 yen for every sticker to TFT. Over seven TFT Fridays, the campaign collected a total of 2,002 stickers worth 2,002 meals. In June 2015, we presented the contents of this initiative at an activity report meeting organized by TABLE FOR TWO International. In October 2014, we further hosted a Stand Up Take Action event, offering employees the opportunity to participate in a global campaign to end poverty and achieve one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Representative members of Nissha divisions running the TFT Community Involvement and Development 89 CSR Report 2015 program gathered with the suppliers of our daily meals.
