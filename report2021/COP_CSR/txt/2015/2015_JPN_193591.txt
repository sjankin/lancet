Amid stable economic growth in North America and Asia, our machined component and LED backlight businesses logged strong growth, while our electronic devices and components business achieved improved profitability. As a result, compared with the previous year, our sales surged 34.8% in FY2014 to 500,676 million yen, while our operating income rose 86.7% to 60,101 million yen and our net income increased 91.0% to 39,887 million yen. Our sales, operating income, and net income were all record highs for the Group. We achieved these results by continuing and furthering our commitment to “manufacturing with sincerity,” the basic belief sustaining the Minebea Group. To solidify the management foundation on which this success is based, and aim for even greater growth in the Yoshihisa Kainuma future, it is critical for the Minebea Group to implement Representative Director President and Chief Executive Officer CSR in accordance with our basic management policy, the Minebea Co., Ltd. Five Principles. I feel that it’s especially important for a company doing business in global markets to bolster its New “Five Arrows” Point to the Next CSR management. In FY2014, we expanded to overseas Stage of Development sites an ISO 26000*-based CSR analysis program which we had conducted in Japan in FY2013.

Minebea Group CSR Report 2015 4 H o t T o p i c s “Smart Lighting” Paves Way for Brighter Future In April 2014, Minebea established the joint venture MIK Smart Lighting Network Co., Ltd. (“MIK”) with Iwasaki Electric Co., Ltd. and Koizumi Lighting Technology Corp. The companies are combining their respective technologies to contribute to the development of nextgeneration lighting systems designed for “Smart Buildings” and “Smart Cities.” For Next-generation “Smart Lighting” Systems advanced lighting control and power management. For example, the systems can adjust street lighting Minebea has been a leader in the development of based on the volume of pedestrian and vehicular circuit design and manufacturing technology used in traffic, or automatically adjust a building’s external optical components for lighting, personal computers lighting based on the lighting usage inside the and televisions, as well as light guide plate design building. LED lighting reduces power consumption and manufacturing technology for mobile phone and by about 60-70% compared with traditional lights. By smartphone backlights. Now, we are combining these incorporating network controls to efficiently manage technologies with highly energy-efficient LED lighting the lighting systems, the power consumption can be and IT to create innovative, highly efficient lighting reduced by about another 15%.

Voice Wireless Lighting Networks to Make Streets More Comfortable Our vision for “Smart Lighting” is to link all street lighting in a given area into network which is not only energy efficient, but which serves as a building block for the creation of “Smart Cities.” Wireless systems for street lighting can serve a larger purpose than just lighting; they can be the cornerstones for various kinds of networking paradigms. For example, the network can be used to provide Wi-Fi connection spots or to install wireless security cameras and protect the security of communities.

COD (chemical oxygen demand): The amount of oxygen consumed to oxidize organic substances (pollution) in water. COD measurement takes less time than BOD measurement, but is less reliable. COD is generally used as a metric in wastewater management for sea, lake, and marsh waters. 3. BOD (biological oxygen demand): The amount of oxygen required for Social Report bacteria to consume and decompose organic matter (pollution) in water. Higher values indicate greater degrees of pollution. Measurement takes several days. BOD is generally used to observe effluent water in rivers. 4. SS (suspended solids): The volume of substances suspended in water. The higher the number, the greater the degree of water pollution. 5. n-hexane extracts: Substances extracted from oils and detergents that are difficult to volatilize in water using a substance called n-hexane as solvent. In this report they signify mineral oils.
