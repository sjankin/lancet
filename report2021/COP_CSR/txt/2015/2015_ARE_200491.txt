International Armored Group | The Ten Principles 4 Human Rights Principles Assessment, Policy and Goals As part of International Armored Group (herein “IAG”) continued efforts to respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Humans Rights laws of each respective country IAG operates in, extensive efforts have been made to ensure all aspects of IAG’s policies and goals are in compliance with these standards. IAG is an Equal Opportunity Employer and has adopted the following policy: IAG stands committed to its philosophy that all employees are entitled to equal employment opportunities. This policy applies to all personnel actions, including compensation, benefits, discipline, transfers, promotions, lay-offs, leaves of absence, terminations, and participation in IAG-administered activities. IAG also affirmatively recruits and hires individuals based upon demonstrated abilities, achievements and experience, without regard to race, color, religion, age, national origin or ancestry, sex, pregnancy, citizenship status, marital status, physical or mental disability, medical conditions, sexual orientation, or any other consideration made unlawful by UAE laws. It is the responsibility of all employees to ensure IAG’s policy of equal employment opportunity is implemented in all phases of human resources administration. Violation of this policy by any employee will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. To comply with applicable laws ensuring equal employment opportunities to qualified individuals with a disability, IAG will make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or an employee, unless undue hardship to IAG would result. Any applicant or employee who requires an accommodation to perform the essential functions of the job should contact their supervisor or Human Resources representative and request such an accommodation. The individual with the disability should specify what accommodation he or she needs to perform the job. IAG will then conduct an investigation to identify the barriers that make it difficult for the applicant or employee to have an equal opportunity to perform his or her job. IAG will identify possible accommodation, if any, which will help eliminate the limitation. If the accommodation is reasonable and would not impose an undue hardship, IAG will make the accommodation. It is also against IAG policy for any employee, male or female, to harass another employee, based on an individual’s race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry, citizenship status, marital status, pregnancy, age, medical condition, handicap or disability. IAG policy defines “‘sexual harassment’ to mean any conduct, comment, gesture or contact of a sexual nature (a) that is likely to cause offence or humiliation to any employee; or (b) that might, on reasonable grounds, be perceived by that employee as placing a condition of a sexual nature on employment or on any opportunity for training or promotion” International Armored Group | The Ten Principles 5 Outcome Since the last COP report, our company has not received any human rights complaints nor have been documented for any violations. No fines related to human rights issues have been levied against the company by any governmental organization since the formation of the company. The goal of 2016 will be to maintain our flawless track record. Labor Principles Assessment, Policy and Goals Leading policy for IAG is to guarantee equal opportunity without abusing human rights for all its employees. Therefore, IAG is constantly implementing policies beyond minimum legal requirements regarding: supporting the freedom of association, elimination of forced labour and child labour, elimination of all forms of discrimination. IAG abides by ILO’s eight fundamental conventions in support of UN Global Compact’s four labor principles, including:  Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)  Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98)  Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29)  Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105)  Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138)  Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)  Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100)  Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958 (No. 111) Our practice and sustainability polices are designed to guarantee that all employees reflect in their daily work the high ethical standards set by the company. IAG is upholding the freedom of association by means of providing the right to form and join workers’ organizations of their choice. Workers are allowed to freely choose representatives and no management interference is obstructing their privilege in collective bargaining. Moreover, IAG is working on implementation of rigid sets of rules preventing from any form of harassment levied on unions’ representatives at the work place. Providing access to all workplaces in the company and allowing attendance to certain management meetings in order to initiate genuine dialog with workers’ representatives through consultations are just few of the strategies which reflect company’s desire to abide to the labour principles regarding the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. IAG strictly does not engage in any practices related to forced labor. We require all recruitment to be consistent with the human rights policy, equal opportunity requirements, relevant employee protection legislation and appropriate pre-employment screening in order to prevent from involving the company into activities harming vulnerable workers. One of the means for prevention is initiating regularly consultations with employees and International Armored Group | The Ten Principles 6 workers’ representatives as well as other groups concerned. Further, IAG plans to include in our sets of sustainability development policies a transparent procedure for appointed employee to educate and inform the workers in order to prevent their becoming involved in forced or compulsory labour practices as well as to prevent vulnerable workers from possible abusive and fraudulent practices during recruitment and placement process. IAG guiding philosophy is intended to abide to effectively abolish child labour. We require from all our employees to conform with the relevant protection legislation and to strictly observe labour requirements such as: minimum age for working in the particular country, minimum weekly hours of work that can be undertaken legally by children below this age, minimum age for hazardous work, other legal requirements if any regarding child labour. Regular audits are being held of HR documentation in order to maintain proper screening of the age of the workers. Recruitment and promotion are based entirely on professional qualities, without any form of discrimination. IAG undertakes to respect and defend the dignity and privacy of each of its employees. Across every part of our business, we strive to create an inclusive culture in which difference is recognized and valued. We employ people on the basis of job requirements and do not discriminate on grounds of age, ethnic or social origin, gender, sexual orientation, politics, religion or disability. It is of great importance to us that our employees are properly trained, and that they work in safe, healthy and environmentally responsible ways.
