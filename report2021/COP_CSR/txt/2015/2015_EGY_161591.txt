Sustainability Report 2014 SEKEM Sustainability Report 2014 Dear Readers, When I look back to the past months it seems to me like a small miracle became reality, which fills me with gratitude. After SEKEM had to face a lot of challenges during the past four years we are happy that we can say now: yes, we did it! We, the whole SEKEM community were able to manage all these difficulties and brought SEKEM back on track, which would have never been realized without our ambitious employees and our reliable partners. An amazing network of friends and backers gave SEKEM a strong foundation enabeling our committed workers to close the year 2014 with very good and satisfying results. We are not only thankful for managing the past years somehow, but are also proud to confirm that we could hold our most important concern of promoting sustainability in all dimensions. And we are convinced that now, after the situation in Egypt is starting to improve on all levels, we will be able to even expand our vision of holistic and sustainable development by focussing processes and human development. Thus, the Sustainability Report 2014 is not only a statement of SEKEMs engagement in the past year, but also a symbol of confidence, gratitude and joy. Thank you all, SEKEM workers and partners, for your great loyalty and encouragement that made this miracle become true.
