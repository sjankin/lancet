Continual Supplies improvements by our engineers resulted Our People & Partners in the creation of innovative techniques Reporting to reuse materials from our customers’ used cartridges. Prior to implementation of our newest process, the developer roller in a used laser cartridge was rarely part of our remanufactured cartridge. This roller possesses a difficult-to-clean film of toner on the rubber surface that inhibited its reuse. Testing revealed the roller had an extensive life if the film of toner was removed. Lexmark engineers created a novel washing system to remove the toner film using ceramic agitators with scrubbing agents to clean the roller without damaging it or altering its properties. Reuse of developer rollers results in substantial environmental and cost savings for Lexmark. Using a reconditioned developer roller instead of a new one saves 80 percent of the cost, protects natural resources and prevents pollution caused by harvesting Lexmark 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility Report Our Solutions 68 Innovations in Partnerships: hundreds of hours that now could be spent annual savings of $2 million.
