Our value creation activities use inputs or contributions from provide inputs for our four capitals monetised capital (which includes financial capital, our value creation property, plant and equipment), Relationship, Human and Intellectual activities Capital. The efficient and productive management of our capitals and processes is what we pride ourselves upon, for therein lies the key to the efficient and continuous delivery of rising value. In our model there are three activities that lie at the heart of our value-creating enterprise. Securing, nurturing and preserving the capitals we own while simultaneously managing the economic, social and environmental impacts of our processes. The second demands precision and efficiency in the management of the supply chain activity, in order to maximise the value created. The final element in Monetised our value chain is the responsible corporate citizenship that we have Capital always prioritised from 1939 to this day, not just because we know that our stakeholders’ belief in us depends upon it but because it is the standard of governance we live by. In the end the cycle is a perfect one, in which our capitals or value stores provide inputs for the value creation activities, leading to Relationship outputs, impacts and outcomes affecting our capitals. Capital Vision Mission Strategy And that is how we add value through every activity we undertake, however great or small. In short, it is how we seek to leverage our core strengths, our expertise and our resources to produce a win-win result for both DIMO and every stakeholder who trusts us to deliver Human on every promise we make.

We will continue to integrate new processes that will contribute to reducing our carbon footprint over the coming years. Managing Atmospheric Emissions Monitoring of atmospheric emission levels is done every quarter. Emission levels during the year were well within the limits set down by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA). The Group’s activities do not result in the emission of NO2 or SO2. DIMO’s exhaust gas and dust extractors capture emissions emanating from engine testing and the cleaning of air filters and brake assemblies. These fumes are extracted into a machine, and released into the environment within legally permissible limits. Our paint booths incorporate filtration systems that prevent the release of toxic fumes and particles into the atmosphere. The Group’s activities do not result in ozone depleting emissions. CFCfree gases used in vehicle and plant air conditioning has built in systems to capture and recycle gas when the units are serviced.

Most of our electricity comes from the national grid and small amounts of electricity are generated through in-house generators. The consumption of energy remained at the previous year’s level, even though the activity increased due to increase in Group turnover. The increase in the electricity consumption was due largely to the operation of the new Dimo 800. | 63 Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC Annual Report 2014/15 Impact Management Environmental Impact The energy consumed by third parties due to our activities was 15,475 Gj compared to 13,002 Gj in the previous year.

DIMO has obtained accreditation from the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority to conduct in-house energy audits. The energy audits carried out at DIMO has highlighted the following aspects:  The use of capacitor banks for power factor correction  The replacement of incandescent lighting with CFL and LED technology (almost all areas of the Group have now been converted to CFL or LED)  The programming of all computers to revert to standby mode within five minutes  Setting air conditioning units at a constant minimum of 24oC or over  Inculcating a ‘conservation culture’ among staff: ‘switch off’ lights, computers, and taps when not in use.  New buildings should make maximum use of natural light in their designs and adopt energy efficient building codes. Water Usage and Management Our main source of water comes from the national water supply. Ground water sources are used at some of our locations: the Siyambalape workshop, the Weliweriya Logistic Centre and the workshop in Colombo. State-of-the-art water recycling plants are operative at all workshops. The treated re-cycled water is then used within the Group for permissible activities.

Ground water consumption decreased by 37% (15% in 2013 – 14) due in large CASE STUDY measure to the enhanced recycling capacity at the Siyambalape water treatment plant. Of the ground water consumed, 31% (24% in 2013 14) was recycled and reused. This amounted to 9% (11% in 2013 14) of the total water consumption. The total volume of water reused at Siyambalape and Weliveriya was 7,910 m³. Of this, 3,272m³ was used for vehicle washing purposes whilst the balance was used for other purposes. During the year under review, a state-of-the-art water treatment plant, costing Rs.5.3 million, was installed at DIMO 800. This treatment plant has a capacity of 14,000m3 per day.
