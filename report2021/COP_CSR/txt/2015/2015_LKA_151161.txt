Investments in joint ventures (adoption of SLFRS 11) Under LKAS 31 Investment in Joint Ventures (prior to the adoption of SLFRS 11), the Group’s interest was classified as a jointly controlled entity and the Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, revenue, income and expenses were proportionately consolidated in the financial statements. These jointly controlled entities were namely NDO Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. (60%), Information Systems Associates (49%) and Sentinel Realty (Pvt) Ltd. (40.16%). Upon adoption of SLFRS 11, the Group has consolidated its interests in these entities using the equity method as required and accordingly the comparatives have been restated.

For financial assets both at fair value through profit and loss and available-for-sale financial assets the carrying amount and fair value are equal. The fair value of loans and receivables is not significantly different from the value based on amortised cost methodology. Fair value of held to maturity investments amounts to LKR 12,581 mn (2014 LKR 15,413 mn) for the Group. The Group has designated financial assets amounting to LKR 430 mn (2014 LKR 334 mn) upon initial recognition, as fair value through profit or loss. The management assessed that, cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: Fair value of quoted equities, debentures and bonds is based on price quotations in an active market at the reporting date. The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under finance leases, as well as other noncurrent financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. Fair value of the unquoted ordinary shares has been estimated using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The valuation requires management to make certain assumptions about the model inputs, including forecast cash flows, the discount rate, credit risk and volatility. The probabilities of the various estimates within the range can be reasonably assessed and are used in management’s estimate of fair value for these unquoted equity investments. 21.2 Financial assets and liabilities by categories Financial assets and liabilities in the tables below are split into categories in accordance with LKAS 39.

The Group also holds other financial instruments and may enter into derivative transactions. The Group’s principal financial liabilities, comprise of loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, and financial guarantee contracts. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 23.1 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all clients who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, such as cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial investments, investments, and certain derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty. The Group manages its operations to avoid any excessive concentration of counterparty risk and the Group takes all reasonable steps to ensure the counterparties fulfil their obligations.

While these mitigate insurance risk, the recoverable from reinsurers and receivables arising from ceded reinsurance exposes UA to credit risk. Reinsurance is placed in line with policy guidelines approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis in line with the guidelines issued by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka and concentration of risk is managed by reference to counterparties’ limits that are set each year and are subject to regular reviews. On a regular basis management assesses the creditworthiness of reinsurers to update the reinsurance strategy and ascertain the suitable allowance for impairment of reinsurance assets. 23.1.9 Premium receivable UA has a credit risk exposure to receivables where the policyholder or the intermediary cannot settle their dues to UA. In life insurance, credit risk is minimal, since premium is collected before the policy is issued. The following steps have also been taken to further minimise credit risk; • Customers are regularly reminded on the premium warranty clause. • Outstanding credit is followed up on a daily basis. • Policies not settled within a reasonable period are monitored and cancelled. • Outstanding receivables are checked and confirmed prior to settling claims. • Until premium is settled a temporary certificate for 60 days issued for motor policies. 23.1.10 Amounts due from related parties The Group's amounts due from related parties mainly consists of associates and other venture partners' balances from joint ventures. The Company balance consists of the balances from affiliate companies. 23.1.11 Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents In order to mitigate the concentration, settlement and operational risks related to cash and cash equivalents, the Group consciously manages the exposure to a single counterparty taking into consideration, where relevant, the rating or financial standing of the counterparty, where the position is reviewed as and when required, the duration of the exposure in managing such exposures and the nature of the transaction and agreement governing the exposure. 23.2 Liquidity Risk The Group’s policy is to hold cash and undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its short and medium term capital and funding obligations, including organic growth and acquisition activities, and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities. The Group holds cash and undrawn committed facilities to enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk. The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a daily cash management process. This process considers the maturity of both the Group’s financial investments and financial assets (e.g. accounts receivable, other financial assets) and projected cash flows from operations. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of multiple sources of funding including debentures, bank loans, loan notes, overdrafts and finance leases over a broad spread of maturities.

Market risk comprise of the following types of risk: * Interest rate risk * Currency risk * Equity price risk * Commodity price risk The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at 31 March in 2015 and 2014 The analyses excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of other post-retirement obligations, provisions, and the non-financial assets and liabilities. The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis, • The statement of financial position sensitivity relates to derivatives and available-for-sale debt instruments, • The sensitivity of the relevant income statement item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held as at 31 March 2015 and 2014. John Keells Holdings PLC Annual Report 2014/15 233 23.3.1 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. Most lenders grant loans under floating interest rates. To manage this, based on the market condition and outlook of the interest rate, the Group takes mitigating action such as interest rate swaps, caps, etc. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s and Company's profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings).

The Group has exposure to foreign currency risk where it has cash flows in overseas operations and foreign currency transactions which are affected by foreign exchange movements. Group treasury analyses the market condition of foreign exchange and provides market updates to the Group Executive Committee (GEC), with the use of external consultants' advice. Based on the suggestions made by Group treasury the GEC takes decisions on whether to hold, sell, or make forward bookings of foreign currency as per decision rights given by Board of Directors. 23.3.2.1 Effects of currency transaction on forward contracts The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the USD/LKR exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of the Group’s forward exchange contracts. Currently these financial instruments are categorised under trade and other receivables. Increase/ (decrease) Effect on profit before tax For the year ended 31st March in basis points USD LKR '000s Group Company 2015 +2% (23,677) -2% 23,677 2014 +3% (13,960) -3% 13,960 The assumed spread of the exchange rate is based on the current observable market environment. Group Highlights l Governance l Sustainability Integration & Risk Management l Management Discussion and Analysis l Financial Statements l Supplementary Information NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 234 23.3.2.2 Effects of currency translation For purposes of JKH's consolidated financial statements, the income and expenses and the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside Sri Lanka are converted into Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR). Therefore, period-to-period changes in average exchange rates may cause currency translation effects that have a significant impact on, for example, revenue, segment results (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes –EBIT) and assets and liabilities of the Group. Unlike exchange rate transaction risk, exchange rate translation risk does not necessarily affect future cash flows. The Group’s equity position reflects changes in book values caused by exchange rates.

Reports on the equity portfolio are submitted to the Group’s senior management on a regular basis. The Board of Directors reviews and approves all equity investment decisions.
