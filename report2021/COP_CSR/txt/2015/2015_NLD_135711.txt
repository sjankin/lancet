Global Compact 2014 The United Nations Global Compact is an initiative for businesses committed to aligning their operations and strategies with 10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption. Ahold’s own principles align with those of the Global Compact, and we have been striving for high standards against these principles for some time. We signed the Global Compact in 2010, and continue to report on our own operations and strategies in relation to these principles annually.
