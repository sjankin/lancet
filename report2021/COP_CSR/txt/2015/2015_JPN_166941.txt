A period that tested our ability to execute the Medium FY 2012– FY2013 Term Management Plan Drawing on lessons learned in the past that we created plans without full execution of the measures we had decided to take, and without ample analysis, all JAL Group staff worked to demonstrate that the JAL Group has changed and has become a company that keeps its promises to its stakeholders. Under the harsh business environment that prevailed during this two-year period, caused by factors such as the grounding of Boeing 787 aircraft and a rapid decline in the yen, we nevertheless strived to introduce new products, enhance our services and improve productivity. As a result, we were able to attain our target of raising our operating profit margin to above 10%. While revenues increased, however, earnings decreased year-on-year, and we realized that we needed to develop the ability to respond to severe business environments. A period for establishing our business foundation for FY 2014 new growth At the beginning of fiscal 2014, we expected extremely severe business conditions, which included intensifying competition at Tokyo metropolitan airports as a result of the dramatic increase of international flight slots at Haneda Airport, negative effects to traffic demand caused by the consumption tax increase, and rising fuel costs due to the weaker yen. Accordingly, we began by positioning that year as a period for establishing our business foundation in line with our projections for higher revenues and lower profit. As it turned out, the higher consumption tax rate had only a limited negative impact on demand for air transport, while robust demand for inbound flights and a decline in the fuel markets served to alleviate the severity of the business environment. We also made a concerted effort to reduce costs and improve our products and services. As a result, we achieved higher revenues and profits compared to the previous year. We believe that we have established the business foundation for growth in the form of higher earnings on higher revenues. A period for achieving new growth and management FY 2015– FY2016 targets in the Medium Term Management Plan Although we expect a severe business environment ahead, we are not only pursuing business expansion; we are also working to differentiate ourselves in order to survive the competition based on the keywords “Autonomy,” “Challenge” and “Speed.” We will strive to enhance the JAL Brand and improve our products and services in order to become the first choice of more customers, and to strengthen our cost competitiveness to accomplish growth in terms of revenue and profit improvement, thus ensuring that we attain the targets set out in our Medium Term Management Plan. Furthermore, in light of the projected expansion in the capacity of metropolitan airports and rise in demand for inbound flights ahead of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020, we will also proceed with building a corporate foundation capable of responding to various social changes.

During the follow-up meeting held in March 2015, Mr. Hatamura gave a lecture on the importance of creating a culture of taking personal initiative in thinking and actions to add another safety layer. He offered advice on citing the effectiveness of “output-based thinking,” of developing a pattern of thinking in which we draw out knowledge by thinking for ourselves, verbalizing thoughts and taking action, rather than seeking only to increase knowledge through education and training. We have begun applying output-based learning to some of the training sessions for cabin attendants, who take part in role-playing exercises that enable them to think and act on their own under unexpected circumstances. The JAL Group will continue to reflect the feedback and advice offered by the Safety Advisory Group to the management and safety operations of the Group.

JAL REPORT 2015 33 Human Resources Management Each of Us Making JAL What It Is Human resources embodying a diverse array of experiences, values and viewpoints have come together to keep JAL brimming with vitality. 01 Leading a Satisfying Life in Japan with Many Helping Hands Hou Yonghui Human Resources Management, Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. I was transferred from the Shanghai Branch to the Personnel Department at the head office in April 2014 on a long-term assignment. My job includes formulating projects for global human resource development and providing support at the receiving end for joint global training in Japan and abroad, and for staff who are overseas nationals dispatched to Japan. At the head office, I was made aware of the utmost importance JAL places on global human resource development and the significant effort it makes to implement various initiatives. Over the past year, I benefitted from the generous support of my supervisor and colleagues. I have changed the way I approach problem solving and have gained a number of business skills. I am also a mother on an unaccompanied assignment, and back home my child is in the first grade of elementary school. I was able to get this far by keeping sight of my goal of balancing work and family to develop my career, and with a lot of help from family and friends. During my assignment in Japan, I will do my best to lead a fulfilling life happily. Putting Myself in the Customer’s Position and 02 Applying Experience from Outside the Industry Keitaro Kitadani Haneda First Cabin Attendant Department, Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. I joined JAL in 2013 as a new hire with experience and spent my first year in passenger service at the international lounge of Haneda Airport. In my second year with the company, I started working as a cabin attendant on international and domestic flights. When I joined JAL, I had no experience in customer service, so I became constantly mindful of putting myself in the customer’s position, whether I was at the airport or on a flight. I spent each day fumbling about, trying to understand what our customers wanted and what I could do to make them happy. Also, I have been analyzing customer survey results to contribute to enhancing airport services, applying my strengths and related experience from a previous job. In my current position, I am working to improve on-time performance, aside from my job as a cabin attendant. Going forward, I hope to demonstrate my abilities and contribute to the growth of the JAL Group by using the experience I am gaining through serving our customers. 34 JAL REPORT 2015 Highlights President’s Message The Medium Term Management Plan to Date CSR Financial Section Balancing My Job with Child Rearing while Harnessing the Empathy of Women at Work Emiko Takano Ticket Group, JAL Plaza Office, JAL Navia Co., Ltd. As head of the Ticket Group in the JAL Plaza Office, I am responsible for overseeing the entire counter and managing the operations of about 30 employees. I joined JAL in 1996 and became a manager in 2014. After my daughter was born, I took a one-year childcare leave before balancing parenting and my job by working shorter hours until she was three. When she was small, I sometimes felt guilty going to work and, frankly, I still struggle to strike a balance between my job and parenting. I have come this far only because of my love for JAL and belief that my workplace allows me to reflect on myself. Above all, I am motivated by my daughter, who tells me: “Mom, don’t ever quit! I like you working at JAL.” Now, as a manager, I often come home late, so I make up for it by cooking meals with loving care. More employees in my workplace are having children. I think they will be able to take even greater steps forward, with unique sensitivities and an awareness of women. I hope to continue working in my own way, with a deep appreciation for my family and colleagues. 03 04 Supporting the IT System of the Entire JAL Group with Expertise and Leadership Yoshiyuki Uchida Airline Systems Department, JAL Information Technology Co., Ltd. Since I was hired, I have been refining my skills specialized in the area of IT systems at JAL Information Technology. After being assigned to my current position in Group Management in April 2014, I took on more responsibility for providing and safely operating the IT infrastructure that all JAL Group services depend on. When building and operating a system, I always keep in mind how our customers are using JAL. My greatest mission for IT infrastructure is to ensure that nothing goes wrong and operations are consistently maintained. To fulfill this mission, I strive to secure the robustness of the system from the design and construction stages, take great care to prevent system maintenance work and upgrades from affecting operations, and hone my IT techniques so I can promptly solve any problem. As I go about each day, I feel the gravity of the fact that all JAL customers depend on the IT infrastructure we provide as well as the responsibility of being one of those who are holding up the very foundation of the business. I make maximum use of the power of IT, which will continue to be a driving force in becoming the most loved, and number one airline of choice in the world.

Aid for Areas Affected by Torrential Rains in August 2014 Hiroshima City was hit by localized downpours that caused large-scale landslides, while parts of Western Japan, including Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures, suffered damage from torrential rains in August 2014. To support these areas, we collected donations through a JAL Charity Miles campaign as well as from employees. The donations along with a matching donation from the JAL Group were delivered through the Central Community Chest of Japan to people who were affected. Column Cooperation for Transporting Ambulances in Support of the Battle against Ebola in Guinea The Society for Promotion of Japanese Diplomacy donated six ambulances to the Republic of Guinea in West Africa to support the country’s ongoing battle against the Ebola contagion. JAL cooperated by arranging air transport, making maximum use of the networks and know-how possessed by JAL CARGO. JAL currently does not have freighters, and we were unable to carry the ambulances on our own flights due to their size and to weight limitations. Nevertheless, we sought to live up to expectations and play our part in supporting Africa by requesting and entrusting the flight operations to a partner airline company, which made speedy transport possible. In February 2015, the ambulances were received at Narita Airport and loaded onto a regular cargo flight operated by the partner airline, drawing upon the accumulated knowhow of the JAL Group. Upon arrival at the transit point in Belgium, the cargo staff we had dispatched liaised with the partner airline to assist in the cargo’s smooth transfer to the connecting flight. The ambulances arrived safely at Conakry in Guinea and were delivered to the consignee.

While JAL is a company with corporate governance. a board of corporate auditors, we have opted to set up four committees that include the Nominating Committee and Compensation Committee, which are characteristic of a Company with Committees, and we pride ourselves in having this hybrid system. Taka In the Nominating Committee, for example, do you discuss the appointments of corporate officers? Iwata In appointing corporate officers, we offer advice from a third-party perspective, pointing out, for example, that promoting younger candidates may be better than simply adhering to a seniority rule, or that more female candidates should be sought, or encouraging the appointment of promising JAL leaders to the position of president at subsidiaries so they can gain experience. We serve, in a sense, as escorts guiding the appointment process up to the president’s final decision. Meanwhile, we participate right from the beginning in the appointment of external officers, from identifying the desired qualifications to selecting the final candidates. Taka JAL is to be commended for maintaining a mechanism that serves as a brake by referring to overall trends or pointing out that the appointment of an officer who is approaching retirement to a post at a subsidiary is inappropriate. The external directors are functioning well. Iwata The compensation of officers 50 JAL REPORT 2015 Highlights President’s Message The Medium Term Management Plan to Date CSR Financial Section is handled in a similar way.
