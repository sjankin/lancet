I look forward to another productive year of A major challenge facing the Company is the continuously rising worker cooperation and teamwork. costs. Already worker costs account for nearly 70% of KVPL’s total operating costs and have an accelerated annual increase of 11% 8%. In comparison, annual price increases for tea over last five years, is in the range of 6% 7%, while rubber prices have declined by 14% year on year over the last two years. These numbers clearly indicate that the current W G R Rajadurai rate of wage increase is not commercially sustainable, particularly as we Managing Director have no control over tea and rubber prices and worker productivity in Sri Lanka is lower than our competitor countries. However, once again, 08 May 2015 we are bracing for another wage increase in the new financial year that will inflate up our production costs even further. Migration of workers from the plantations has been a cause for concern. KVPL has introduced many community development programmes and worker welfare programmes to stem this trend. However, I believe we need to seriously reconsider the traditional plantation model, to develop a more sustainable business model. Future Prospects I am confident our investments in tea and rubber replanting and our growth strategy of diversification and new product development will ensure KVPL’s financial sustainability into the future. In the new financial year, we project a yield increase of 3% for tea and 10% for rubber. As our parent company Dipped Products PLC absorbs nearly half of our output of rubber, we have a stable market for this commodity. However, the low prices for rubber will have an impact on our revenues. 25 It has a story “As far as tapping quality is concerned, Kelani Valley is leading, in controlling the bark consumption rate, which minimises the tapping panel dryness, while improving quality.

However, as Sri Lanka supplies high quality orthodox tea, which attracts higher demand in international markets, the export price of Sri Lankan tea averaged at USD 4.97 per kg, recording an increase of 3.1% from the previous year. This price was above the average international tea price of USD 2.72 per kg that prevailed in 2014. National Rubber Industry National Rubber Production National rubber production declined by 24.4% to 98,573 metric tonnes (MTs) in 2014, from 130,420 MTs in 2013. This decline was largely due to lower prices for rubber and continued dry weather during the first half of the year and the heavy rains in the third quarter, which disrupted tapping. Rubber smallholders affected by the decline in rubber prices slowed tapping operations, resulting in the reduction of smallholders share in total rubber production. Overall, the production of sheet rubber, which accounts for nearly 50% of the total production, declined significantly by 22.7%, to 48,539 MTs, while the production of latex crepe, accounting for 12.0 % of total rubber production, reduced by 23.0 %, to 11,832 MTs in 2014. Due to the production shortfall and lower prices in international markets, domestic rubber product manufacturers turned towards imported rubber. As a result rubber imports increased to 29,220 MTs in 2014, from 11,150 MTs in 2013. 39 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2014/15 G4 Reporting Management Discussion & Analysis Operational Review Operational Review Reporting Period G4 28 GSA : High grown average Vs.

The assets (including plantation assets) taken over by way of estate leases are set out in Note 12 to the Financial Statements. Further investments in Immature Plantations taken over by way of leases are shown in this note. When such plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from immature to mature. The requirement of recognition of bearer biological assets at its fair value less cost to sell under LKAS 41 was superseded by the ruling issued on 02 March 2012, by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Company has elected to measure the bearer biological assets at cost using LKAS 16 – Property Plant & Equipment. Specific borrowings have not been obtained to finance the planting expenditure. Hence, borrowing costs were not capitalised during the 15 months under Immature Plantations (2013 NIL). The addition of Rs.477 m (2013 Rs. 395 m) shown above includes the following costs among other other costs incurred during the 15 months in respect of Uprooting and Planting of Tea and Rubber.

The cost of immature trees is treated as approximate fair value particularly on the ground of little biological transformation has taken place and impact of the biological transformation on price is not material. When such Plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from immature to mature. The fair value of managed trees was ascertained since the LKAS 41 is only applicable for managed agricultural activity in terms of the ruling issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. The valuation was carried by Messer’s Sunil Fernando Associates, chartered valuers, using Discounted Cash Flow methods. In ascertaining the fair value of timber a physical verification was carried covering all the estates. 181 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2014/15 G4 Reporting Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Contd. 14.2.1 Information about Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Non Financial Asset Valuation Unobservable Range of unobservable Relationship of technique inputs inputs (probability unobservable Inputs to weighted average) fair value Consumable managed biological assets DCF Discounting rate 17.5% The higher the discount rate, the lesser the fair value Optimum rotation 25-35 Years Lower the rotation (Maturity) period, the higher the fair value Volume at rotation 25-85 cu. ft. The higher the volume, the higher the fair value Price per cu.ft. Rs.450/to Rs.1,800/The higher the price per cu. ft., the higher the fair value Other key assumptions used in valuation 1. The harvesting is approved by the PMMD and Forest Department based on the forestry development plan 2. The price adopted are net of expenditure 3. Though the replanting is a condition precedent for harvesting, yet the cost are not taken in to consideration. The valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on net present values, take into account the long term exploitation of the timber plantations. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation at fair value of the biological assets due to the volatility of the variables, their carrying value may differ from their realisable value. The Board of Directors retains their view that commodity markets are inherently volatile and that long term price projections are highly unpredictable. Hence, the sensitivity analysis regarding selling price and discount rate variations as included in this note allows every investor to reasonably challenge the financial impact of the assumptions used in the LKAS 41 against his own assumptions. 14.2.2 Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity variation sales price Values as appearing in the Statement of Financial Position are very sensitive to price changes with regard to the average sales prices applied.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group has loans and other receivables, trade and other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its operations. The Group also holds available-for-sale investments and enters into derivative transactions (Mainly Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts). Accordingly the Group has exposure to namely Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, Currency Risk and Market Risks from its use of financial instruments. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. 37.1 Financial Risk Management Framework The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s financial risk management framework which includes developing and monitoring the Group’s financial risk management policies. The Group financial risk management policies are established to identify, quantify and analyse the financial risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor financial risks and adherence to limits. Financial risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The KVPL Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s financial risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the financial risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 37.2 Credit Risk Credit Risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arise principally from the Group’s receivable from customers and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. 37.2.1 Trade and Other Receivables The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group’s credit policy is monitored at the Board level. The new customers are analysed individually for credit worthiness before Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Group review includes external ratings, when available and in some cases, bank references, purchases limit etc. which also subject to under review on quarterly basis. The past experience of the Management is considered when revisions are made to terms and conditions. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date is Rs. 737 m (2013 – Rs. 692 m). KVPL has a minimal credit risk of its trade receivables as the repayment is guaranteed within seven days by the tea and rubber auction systems. 205 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2014/15 G4 Reporting Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Contd. 37.2.2 Investments Credit risks from invested balance with the financial institutions are managed by the Board of Directors. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to them. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty’s failure. The Group held short term investments of Rs. 40 m as at 31 March 2015 (2013 – Rs. 200 m) which represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets. 37.2.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents The Group held cash at bank and in hand of Rs. 54 m as at 31 March 2015 (2013 – Rs. 52 m) which represents its maximum credit exposure on these assets.

Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group does not concentrate on a single financial institution, thereby minimising the exposure to liquidity risk through diversification of funding sources. The Group aims to fund investment activities of the individual and Group level by funding the long-term investment with long term financial sources and short term investment with short term financing. Where necessary the Group consults the Treasury Department and Strategic Business Development Unit in Parent Company for scrutinising the funding decisions. 206 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2014/15 G4 Reporting Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements The Table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.
