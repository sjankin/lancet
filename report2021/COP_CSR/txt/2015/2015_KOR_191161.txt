The U.S. was the only country that relished high growth rate whereas Total Assets (billion KRW) the other parts of the world suffered from sluggish economic growth. Unemployment rates increased in the EURO ZONE, there was minus growth in Japan, and economic growth in China was slowing, 4,991.0 4,183.5 to cite a few examples. The Korean economy was not an exception. Korea’s economic growth 3,371.4 continued to decline due to these unfavorable external conditions and reduction of investment by corporations. As for the electricity market, the electric power reserve rate has risen in 2014 due to the increase in new generator supply and slowed demand growth driven by the government’s policy to tightly 2012 2013 2014 manage the power demand. Despite the deteriorated electricity market conditions, POSCO ENERGY achieved sales of 2,598.6 billion KRW and operating profit of 118.7 billion KRW based on consolidated financial statements through stable power supply, the enhanced profitability of Off-gas Combined Cycle Power Plants, and various internal improvement activities.

Investment Risk Management 2012 2013 2014 To consolidate the grounds for future growth, POSCO ENERGY is investing in domestic & overseas power business, and new & renewable energy business, comprising photovoltaic power, wind power and fuel cells, etc). Due to the inherent nature of the energy business that requires a tremendous Profit and loss amount of investment over a long period of time, the company establishes and implements an Sales (billion KRW) investment deliberation process so as to thoroughly diagnose and analyze any associated risks in advance and evaluate investment feasibility. Firstly, the department in charge of investment 2,809.5 2,901.3 2,598.6 proposal shares information on the proposal with relevant departments through a business presentation session to modify and complement the business plan by incorporating various ideas during the session. Secondly, in-house experts in technology, laws and regulations, accounting, finance, etc. participate in each deliberation stage to identify and assess any potential risk elements before reaching a conclusion on whether or not to invest. Even if a proposal is authorized by the 2012 2013 2014 deliberations, the department must establish a counter-measurement plan against identified risks and report the results while the investment management departments have to regularly monitor all the proceedings to minimize investment risks. Also, to identify the impact of the investment over the entire POSCO group’s financial soundness and strategic consistency, we conduct sufficient Operating Profit (rate) discussions and consultations with the mother company, POSCO.

The association will also protect the rights and interest of the industry. KNREA is joined by domestic and overseas new and renewable energy related manufacturers, constructors and generation enterprises, and other relevant organizations, which made it imperative for us to play a bridging role between the governments and our members with open and vibrant communications. Among our members, POSCO ENERGY is a company that owns world-class technological competencies in the field of fuel cells and enters a variety of new and renewable energy fields including wind power, photovoltaic generation, bio/waste-to-energy, etc. In consideration of all this, I think that it is somewhat urgent for POSCO ENERGY to build a portfolio for new energy business and secure domestic and overseas markets. To do so, POSCO ENERGY would need to create a public image that allows people to easily regard the company as a provider of eco-friendly energy, employing some initiatives such as “the construction of an Korea New & Renewable eco-friendly energy town” in close cooperation with KNREA and partner companies. If it turns out successfully, I expect that it would result in a Energy Association (KNREA) Manager new national growth engine as well as a consolidated social consensus for the necessity of new and renewable energy. If so, KNERA will be happy Young-jae Min to support and take part in the activities led by POSCO ENERGY.

POSCO ENERGY is also committed to making fair evaluations and assessments in selecting its partner companies and suppliers, as well as establishing fair trade relations by concluding 700 million transparent agreements with partners. KRW Introduction to Core Issue POSCO ENERGY reconfirms the fields of interest for stakeholders and determines the direction to lead its strategic efforts and future tasks to pursue. Among the core issues selected out of a materiality evaluation process, we identified “Reinforce Shared Growth Activities” under the core aspect of “Fair Competition and Cooperation” in terms of establishing reliable trade relations throughout the supply network. Core Issue. 11 Aspect Reinforce Shared Fair Competition Growth Activities and Cooperation Key Achievements and Goals In an effort to protect partner companies from unfair behaviors and practices, POSCO ENERGY has set up a fair trade guideline and introduced a standard subcontractor agreement. The company makes sure that the evaluation/assessment process is conducted a fair and just manner when it selects and assesses partner companies/suppliers. The company also sets up and implements a monitoring system to manage the actual needs of partner companies to ensure that they will receive supports they need it. The company is broadening the range of support, extending these benefits to secondary partner companies.

Since we first signed the joint development agreement with POSCO ENERGY in 2012, we have maintained a sustained and wide-reaching cooperative relationship. For instance, early this year, we concluded another agreement to provide two reaction steam turbine units to the company, which is worth around 2.5 billion KRW. Since we were able to receive extensive support and assistance from the company, we could accomplish successful technical and business performances. What struck me the most about POSCO ENERGY was the company’s investment in possibility, the management’s commitment to shared growth, and the horizontal and vibrant communication. I expect that POSCO ENERGY will be engaged in expanding shared growth with SMEs, just as in the cooperative relationship between POSCO ENERGY and HK TURBINE, HK TURBINE based on open communication and partnership, and I hope the company will be a top-notch company that continues to demonstrate CEO Jeong-hoon Kim leadership based on co-prosperity.

In particular, the company has set up and complied with the four guidelines of fair trade while introducing the standard subcontractor agreement to protect suppliers from unfair business practices. Transparent agreement | The company is committed to ensure transparency in its agreement procedure by implementing the e-Procurement system. It also enacts efforts to ensure that every agreement is sealed in a transparent and fair manner by holding the Subcontracting Evaluation Committee at least once a month.

However, it would be safer to say that there is much room for improvement in terms of the targets and nature of support, as they do not match what local communities actually need. In recognition of this, POSCO ENERGY searches for ways to offer substantial support through close cooperation with local communities and organizations, pursuing social contribution activities focused on local communities. Introduction to Core Issue POSCO ENERGY reconfirms the fields of interest for stakeholders and determines the direction to lead its strategic efforts and future tasks to pursue. Among the core issues selected out of a materiality evaluation process, we identified Operate Social Contribution Program with Local Community Development under the core aspect of Local community Investment and Engagement in terms of the revitalization of local economy and the enlargement of development potential. Core Issue. 12 Operate Social Contribution Aspect Program with Local Community Investment Local Community and Engagement Development Key Achievements and Goals To realize the value of ‘‘Energy for a Better World”, POSCO ENERGY is engaged in social contribution practices through employees’ autonomous participation in sharing and voluntary work and company-led social contribution activities. The company runs the aged house remodeling work for energy efficiency improvement, solar power generator installations, electric safety inspection service as talent donation activities, etc. as the representative social contribution activities for the company’s “Energy Dream Project.” Starting from the western part of Incheon city in 2012, the “Energy Dream Project” will be extended to Pohang and Gwangyang. This will not just realize energy welfare, but also help those in need to lead safer and happier daily lives.

The center has been developing new items for self-support programs for self-supporting work groups and self-support enterprises and sealed a partnership with POSCO ENERGY. As part of the key activities of the partnership, a self-support enterprise carries out energy-efficiency improvement projects, which have resulted in favorable performance: creating new jobs, heightening the income level of the lower income class, and saving energy costs for the energy deprived. The project has been positively recognized from the initial stage, and I wish to continue these performances. I hope to be engaged in many more similar projects through the partnership with POSCO Central Self-Sufficiency ENERGY and consequently attract more attention and participation from society.

The company has also published a 1% sharing letter since 2014 that discloses how the funds have been executed to allow contributors, POSCO ENERGY employees, to easily access the details. As the company also donates a matching grant to the 1% Sharing Fund, and the program has been positioned as the social contribution funds jointly participated by labor and management. This voluntary sharing program by employees was highly recognized and consequently rewarded with the Certification of 1% Sharing Letter Commendation for Love of Neighbors by the mayor of Incheon in 2014.

The KPC verified that POSCO ENERGY clearly defined the communication channels and expectations of each group and garnered the opinions of its stakeholders through active interaction and dialogue. Materiality: Selection and Reporting of Key Issues Based on the issues of the last report, POSCO ENERGY has settled on 25 sustainable management issues by investigating the domestic and foreign energy industry issues, media analyses, and international standards in sustainable management such as the GRI G4 Guidelines, GRI electric industry supplementary indicators, ISO26000, UNGC, etc. Furthermore, six key issues have been deduced through the level of concern of outside stakeholders and the importance of business through the materiality evaluation, which have been reflected in a balanced manner in each of the Report’s pages. Responsiveness: Organizational Response to Issues The KPC verified that the Report properly demonstrates POSCO ENERGY’s awareness of the key issues that would impact stakeholder judgment of its performance and that it undertook measures to resolve such issues. Through the Report, POSCO ENERGY is faithfully disclosing the actions and performance of their responses to key issues in sustainable management. Recommendations KPC rates highly the range of endeavors and achievements made by POSCO ENERGY to advance its sustainability and presents the following recommendations to enhance POSCO ENERGY’s future reports and its level of sustainability management. • In order to examine and manage the performance of sustainable management activities, a proposal needs to be made based on a sustainable management strategy system and the key performance indicators (KPI) must be given form. Furthermore, continuously managing the selected sustainable management proposal and the KIP will allow POSCO ENERGY’s sustainable management activities and performance to be reported to stakeholders in a more transparent and objective manner. • As for the stakeholders’ participation method, their opinions are being collected through surveys and employee interviews. There needs to be a strengthening of the activities for collecting the stakeholders’ opinions in a more comprehensive manner as well as for verifying the expectations of POSCO ENERGY’s annual sustainable management activities. We recommend collecting the stakeholder participation principle and plans and using various channels so that opinions can be continuously collected.
