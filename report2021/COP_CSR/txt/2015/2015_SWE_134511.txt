The proposal is consistent with the established cash flow forecast under which the parent company and the group are expected to manage unexpected events and temporary variations in cash flows to a reasonable extent.

Financing risk management TeliaSonera’s aggregate borrowings usually have a longer maturity than duration of interest (principal is fixed longer than interest rates). This allows the group to obtain the desired interest rate risk without having to assume a high refinancing risk. The group’s policy is that the average maturity of borrowings should normally exceed 4 years. In order to reduce refinancing risk, the group aims to spread loan maturity dates over a longer period.
