Investors’ decisions showing a resumption of growth” increasingly depend on how sustainably a company develops and manages its properties. Employees care about how transparent a company is and the opportunities it offers for them to advance in an appealing, enriching atmosphere. Store operators play a vital role in improving our sustainability performance. Government agencies and local communities have welcomed our centres and they expect the company to be transparent, sensitive to their concerns, and committed to creating jobs and economic growth opportunities. NEINVER has launched initiatives reflecting its awareness of how much its stakeholders care about these issues and how sustainability benefits the company’s operations. The following pages describe these actions in detail. Let me summarise NEINVER’s main achievements of the past year. The first, unquestionably, was the magnificent earnings (€24.1 million in profits), showing a resumption of growth after three years of a complex situation in the property market. Equally noteworthy was the signing of three strategic alliances with internationally respected partners: TIAA-CREF (co-managed with its subsidiary TIAA Henderson Real Estate), KKR and Colony Capital. This not only opens the door to further growth through development of new centres and upgrades to existing centres, but also clearly vouches for the solidity and confidence the company inspires in the market. In new development, in 2014 NEINVER started construction on a new centre in Spain, in the Catalan town of Viladecans. The project will involve an €80 million investment, and its 26,500 sq. m will house more than 130 stores, representing top-name fashion brands, and restaurants. Besides helping to promote tourism and energising commerce in the area, its construction and operation will create job opportunities for the local community. Besides developing new properties, one of the strategic priorities for NEINVER’s future growth will involve leveraging new technologies and expanding digital channels, to adapt to shoppers’ needs. In 2014 the company made progress in developing an omni-channel strategy to improve satisfaction among visitors to the centres, through better knowledge of their behaviour and needs. These accomplishments would not have been possible without the dedication of the 266 professionals who make up the company. I thank all of them sincerely and invite them to bring the same enthusiasm to the challenges the company has defined for the coming years. Madrid, July 2015 José María Losantos y del Campo Chairman 4_ 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT _ 5 Message from the Chief Financial Officer (G4-1) “At NEINVER we are convinced that responsible conduct generates value” With this Sustainability report, NEINVER is taking the next step in its commitment to transparency. In preparing this publication, the company followed the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 standard, which meant revising the content to ensure a focus on issues relevant to the company’s stakeholders. Content was selected based on a materiality study in which NEINVER not only identified the types of topics to include but also structured the information in a way that clearly conveys how we create value through our operations and how much of this value is passed along to the various groups of stakeholders. At NEINVER we are convinced that responsible conduct generates value. Good economic and operational performance is essential to improving sustainability performance, but responsible conduct also makes the company more attractive to investors, marks us as a high-quality partner, strengthens the link between our employees and the company, and makes our centres run more efficiently, which benefits our store operators and bolsters our integration with the local community. The company has reached important milestones in these areas, some of them in 2014. Specifically, To increase our integration with the community, NEINVER has also signed an agreement with the with regard to the environment, NEINVER was the first company in the sector to implement an ISO Viladecans town government and launched a Communication Plan to strengthen transparency during 50001–certified energy-efficiency system in all its centres.

The company’s responsible behaviour, however, goes beyond earning these distinctions. This way of These are some examples of NEINVER’s efforts to improve its sustainability performance. Along with these, working pervades all our activities and has translated into other achievements in terms of managing our and from a strategic perspective, the company is now creating a roadmap of new CSR priorities for the people, promoting ethical conduct and improving relations with the community. coming years to help maintain our leadership in that area.

Milestones for the year include the satisfaction survey and the training of management, including senior management, to better implement the professional performance evaluation programme.

The planned two-phase project will involve an investment of more than €80 million, and will feature more than 130 store locations, devoted to top-name fashion brands and to restaurants, in 26,500 sq. m of GLA. It will also draw tourists and energise business in the Barcelona metropolitan area. It has a catchment area of 7 million inhabitants, and in the first year, it is expected to welcome 2.7 million visits. NEINVER is making a great effort to develop and operate this centre with maximum integration into the community and the local surroundings. To do this, the company has signed a Collaboration Agreement with the Viladecans town government, with both parties committing to work together to develop and implement projects and actions that could help the area’s economic and social development. NEINVER also has developed a communication action plan to ensure transparency throughout the construction period. Activities being carried out under the agreement, and their expected benefit to the community: • Job creation: besides the 1,300 jobs expected to be created directly or indirectly during the operation of the centre, a commissioned study by economic experts estimates that the construction will generate about 2,500 jobs through direct and indirect job creation and a knock-on employment effect. • Infrastructure: developing the centre has involved developing the surrounding area and building the viaduct that connects it to the C-32 motorway. This bridge opened to traffic in August 2014, producing notable improvements to traffic in the area. • Promoting tourism: NEINVER will work to strengthen and promote tourism through initiatives and services such as establishing Tourist Information Points and a VAT refund counter in the centre, bolstering the flow of visitors via transport between the outlet centre and Barcelona’s city centre, and cooperation with the Barcelona and Catalonia Offices of Tourism. • Training and know-how transfer initiatives: to prepare interested members of the local community for the future jobs in the centre, NEINVER holds training sessions in cooperation with the local employment office, on topics such as business skills, languages, writing a CV, and job interviews. Company employees participate in these sessions, which are being well received among local residents. Also, in keeping with NEINVER’s sustainable construction policy, Viladecans will be developed in compliance with BREEAM and ISO 14001 standards, with the goal of earning those certifications. The whole complex was conceived in accordance with energy-efficiency and energy-saving criteria, and NEINVER ensures responsible management throughout the construction process. 102_ 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT.

The centre’s approach to water and waste management, based on continual improvement, has brought about constant reductions in both parameters year after year. Vila do Conde has the broadest, most detailed, most comprehensive waste treatment and tracking system of any NEINVER centre and surpasses many others in the sector. Besides separating waste into more than ten categories to maximise recycling, Vila do Conde is especially proactive about training store operators to ensure proper management, and in its awareness campaigns and communication and its reminders sent to all operators. In 2014, it gave a specific course on this topic to all tenants. The waste separation area is very complete and easy to use, and is always kept clean and tidy. This is possible thanks to outstanding management and the commitment of all the centre’s employees and operators. In the future, NEINVER aims to extend these best practices to all its centres. Environmental training Meeting environmental management targets Besides the awareness sessions mentioned above, requires having aware, qualified professionals with upon the centres’ receiving ISO 50001 certification strong knowledge of this field.
