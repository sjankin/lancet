Our 2014 “See Change” report showcases research findings from a GlobeScan/SustainAbility Survey of industry experts on corporate transparency. Sustainability experts often point to stakeholder engagement and enhanced reputation as some of the benefits of corporate transparency. This survey reveals that corporate transparency brings even more value to companies. Seventy-nine percent of survey respondents indicated that corporate transparency positively impacts a company’s sustainability performance. While there are barriers to transparency driving change within companies, there are a number of transparency practices that can help better guide decision making and work towards sustainable change. Download a copy of the report here THE HOPE INDEX Just as the Consumer Confidence Index is a reliable predictor of our economic future, the GlobeScan Foundation believes that hope can predict our potential as a global society to overcome the social, economic, and environmental challenges we face. In 2014, we launched the first Hope Index, reflecting the degree to which 12,000 citizens across 12 countries express optimism on current trends and hope for humanity’s future. A majority of citizens (59%) believe “the social, environmental and economic challenges the world faces today are more difficult than the ones we have faced in human history.” Only one in four (25%) believe our challenges are less difficult. In spite of this, a similar majority (63%) believe that “humanity will find a way to overcome our current challenges,” although almost a third of citizens (31%) think it is “very or somewhat unlikely” that we will be successful.
