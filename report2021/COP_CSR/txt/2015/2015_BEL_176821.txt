Communication on Progress “2014” Artoos Oudestraat 19 1910 KAMPENHOUT BELGIUM www.artoos.be COP Communication on Progress (COP) 2014 Introduction Artoos is a vertically integrated one-stop shop communication partner for (direct) marketing & communication departments offering the whole process of developing, producing and distributing marketing communication projects: design – production – fulfillment. Both for offline (printing) and online communication. In the spring of 2014, Artoos acquired the Brussels based printing company Hayez. In carrying out our customers’ projects completely independent with our 150 employees based in Kampenhout and 10 sales people in Brussels, our own high tech infrastructure and focusing on end-to-end automation we offer a quite unique business model. To highlight some important facts and figures of Artoos|Hayez we present our recent infographic: Page 1/10 COP Page 2/10 COP Principle 1: An organization should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: An organization should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Principle 4: An organization should support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5: An organization should support the effective abolition of child labour Our commitment or Policy As we are a CSR company we take several actions and have several policies concerning “people, our human capital”. For exemple: in a very natural way we respect diversity among our workers (we have a balanced age pyramid, a balance exists between women/man, we do not discriminate on the grounds of ethnic or social origin, gender (including pregnancy or maternity), age, sexual orientation, politics, religion/belief, … ) human rights are a natural right of all the people working at Artoos there is no question of compulsory labour or child labour We take these principles also into account in our business affairs. That is why we decided e.g. to promote paper with a FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)–label for printing. Not only environmental aspects are important within FSC, social aspects are equally important. In 2014 65% of all the paper used for printing was with an FSC-label. Principle 3: An organization should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Our commitment or Policy Our employees are free to establish and join organizations of their own choice, given these do not violate the law or pursue unethical goals. Trade unions are represented in our organization. Membership is generally accepted, as is non-membership. Consultations between trade unions and the management of the organization are organized on a regular basis. Works council as well as Health and Safety Committee happen in all openness and with mutual respect. Principle 6: An organization should support the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Our commitment or Policy As stated by Belgian law, Artoos does not discriminate on the grounds of ethnic or social origin, gender (including pregnancy or maternity), age, sexual orientation, politics, religion/belief, trade union membership or non-membership. Page 4/10 COP Principle 7: An organization is asked to support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 9: An organization should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Our commitment or Policy CO2 emissions are amongst the most important factors causing global warming, and the decline of our environment and its biodiversity. This is exactly why we go through great lengths in order to reduce CO2 emissions. The next step after reduction is to ask Climate Partner, a specialized German engineering firm, to measure and calculate the remaining greenhouse gasses produced by our machinery and printing work, and convert them into its CO2 equivalent. Once calculated, we neutralize our production site and our own printing work. This is the case since 2010. We stimulate our clients to do the same, and neutralize the leftover CO2 emissions of their printed matter. 1. Design & set up During the design processes, we advise our clients how to make it as “green” as possible. We look at the design, recommend FSC or recycled paper, determine which printing press is the most energy efficient etc. 2. Calculation Artoos calculates the CO2 emissions of the printed matter. For this we use a computational model that has been built by Climate Partner in accordance with the “Greenhouse Gas Protocol” from the WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development). Wherever we write CO2 we mean greenhouse gasses expressed as their CO2 equivalent in accordance with recommendations from the IPCC. Climate Partner calculated for us: The direct CO2 emissions from our production site in Kampenhout (transport, cooling installations, printing presses, air-conditioning, etc.). Once measured and calculated, we neutralized this The CO2 emissions from our energy resources (which is nil, because we purchase from a completely green, climate neutral source) All other indirect CO2 emissions relating to the printing work that we as a printer have no control of, e.g. the CO2 emissions for the paper manufacturer and the supplier We add the specific parameters relating to our client’s printed matter to this model, such as: The print run; Dimensions; Paper selected; The weight of the inks and dyes as used; Which printing press is used; How long this printing press is used; How many printing plates are used; The transport involved to deliver the printed matter to the client. The module uses the above information to calculate the exact amount of CO2 emissions produced by the printed matter. Since the start of the calculation of our CO2 emissions we were able to reduce these emission by approximately 50% because of several actions that have been taken. Page 5/10 COP 3. Neutralization Knowing the amount of CO2 emissions produced by the print job, our clients are stimulated to neutralize these emissions through voluntary purchasing of tradeable certificates from top carbon offset projects that are in accordance with the highest international standards, and also provide assistance in offsetting carbon emissions. Clients can choose from a portfolio of projects that are strictly selected by Climate Partner. Since 2014 we support the Kasigau Corridor forest protection program of Wildlife Works in Kenya. This is a project with standards VSC, CCBS. It represents an ideal mix of reducing CO2-emissions and sustainable development. After decreasing our CO2 emissions and offsetting the inevitable rest emissions our production plant and if the client wants print jobs are climate neutral by contributing to this sustainable project. To contribute to a carbon offset project is also an example of practicing the 10 Global Compact principles. Principle 8: An organization should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Our commitment or Policy In the past the printing business had a negative image when it comes to environmental issues. That is why we – at Artoos have committed ourselves to protect the environment in any way we can. In the printing industry, the limitations of environmental protection are mostly determined by technology. Nearly all technological progress also means environmental progress. Artoos is aware of this and has the most modern and energy-efficient infrastructure from prepress to finishing. Not only is it possible to produce high quality products with these machines but they are also very energy efficient, use less raw material, make less noise, are more ergonomic to work with, ... But we do much more than offering an environmentally friendly infrastructure. We also created an environmental management system in accordance with the ISO 14001:2004 standard. In 2012 we renewed our ISO 14001 certificate. In the beginning of 2015 another renewal is scheduled. Then the certificate is valid for a new period of 3 years. Our environmental policy is published on our website (www.artoos.be) Since we started our environmental management system, the phrase “measuring is knowing” is the basis of our environmental policy/way of thinking. We noticed that the more precise measurements are performed, the quicker we can take action to prevent or improve the things that need our (urgent) attention. Within our management system we have set ourselves goals. These are evaluated yearly. Based on this evaluation and new situations in our company we set new goals or adjust our existing goals for the year to come. We work on 5 domains. One goal depends on the result of most of our other goals: this is our climate neutral theme. Other goals include reducing waste streams (especially paper and ink waste), reducing and/or controlling solvent usage, reducing and/or controlling usage of water, reducing our energy consumption. To make the necessary calculations, statistics, … we need to obtain all the data. To be able to do so we ask our employees for example to weigh the baskets with paper waste, to monitor the usage of printing alcohol, to save on electricity in the office, …. We tell them about our progress on several occasions: at team meetings, at our annual meeting, in a monthly company newsletter, in our company brochures, … We also inform our clients, suppliers, … of our goals and work efforts in theme magazines, on our website, in external meetings, on seminars, … Page 6/10 COP In accordance with financial reports all our results are compared on a 3 year basis. To be able to make the right conclusions we also calculate ratio’s. In that way we also take into account the production and economic factors of that period. Looking at all the gathered information we can conclude that we are still making a positive progress. Paper waste Paper waste 2012 2013 2014 Purchased paper (ton) 3.746,70 3.945,82 4.585,4 Paper waste (ton) 1.258,64 1.199,85 1.479,56 Ratio waste/new paper 0,34 0,30 0,322 The percentage of waste in relation to the amount of bought paper has increased slightly. The mean reason is the type of print jobs. Since our coalition with Hayez a larger sum of print jobs are smaller in number per print job. This results in a more frequent adjusting of the presses and thus more waste. The matter stays our number 1 priority but because there is an admissible explanation the increase is acceptable. Ink waste Ink waste 2012 2013 2014 Waste 11,951 12,257 18,763 Purchased paper (production in m²) 28.077.593 31.545.515 35.124.72 5 Ratio waste/production 4,256* 3,886* 5,342* *number to divide by 10.000.000 The ratio waste/production (= paper) has gone up with 25% compared to 2012 and with 37,5% compared to 2013. In comparison with the previous year we printed more. Thus more product has been used. Another consequence of printing smaller print jobs per print job is that the presses need to be cleaned more. That fact also leads to a greater amount of waste. Because the increase is an consequence of changes in our production, the augmentation of the ratio ‘ink waste’ is acceptable. Solvents 2012 2013 2014 ton VOC emission 3,846 4,652 4,379 m² purchased paper (= production) 28.077.593 31.545.515 35.124.725 Ratio VOC-emission/production 1,369* 1,475* 1,247* * number to divide by 10.000.000 VOC = volatile organic compounds After an increase last year our VOC emissions have decrease again. The emissions have gone done with 5,9% in comparison with 2013. If we look at 2012 we see an augmentation of 13,9%. Page 7/10 COP The decrease is caused by a diminished use of alcohol in the offset printing process while we have printed more than the years before. Energy We have 2 sources of energy: electricity and natural gas. Electricity 2012 2013 2014 electricity consumption(kWh) 1.930.412 1.981.150 2.234.020 m² purchased paper 28.077.593 31.545.515 35.124.725 Number of employees 140 132 144 Surface building in use 7.355 m² 10.043 m² 10.043 m² Ratio electricity consumption/paper (x) 0,069 0,063 0,064 Ratio electricity consumption/employee (Y) 13.788,657 15.008,712 15.514,028 Ratio electricity consumption/surface (z) 262,463 197,267 222,445 Total ratioelectricity: x*y*z 249.711,85 185.941,81 219.493,81 In 2014 our solar panels produced 2,99% of our total electricity capacity. This % is depend of the climate conditions. Because they were not as good as the conditions in 2013 the % is somewhat smaller. We produced more print jobs. So it is only natural that we used more electricity. But the ratio electricity/paper*people*surface decreased with 18% in comparison with 2013 but 12% lower in comparison with 2012. This means that measures that have been taken in the past (eg. relighting) have a result. Natural gas 2012 2013 2014 Gas consumption (kWh) 311.285 396.966 321.836 Number of employees 140 132 144 Surface building heated by natural gas 5.063 m² 6.675 m² 6.675 m² Ratio gas/employees (x) 2.223,464 3.007,318 2.234,972 Ratio gas/surface (y) 61,482 59,471 48,219 Total ratiogas: x*y 136.703,013 178.846,902 107.759,47 9 Because of a kind winter we needed less heating and thus less gas. Page 8/10 COP Water 2012 2013 2014 Water consumption 1.369 1.931 1.674 m² purchased paper 28.077.593 31.545.515 35.124.725 m² purchased plates 61.819 66.639 85.915 Number of employees 140 132 144 Water/paper (x) 4,876** 6,121** 4,766** Water/plates (y) 0,022 0,029 0,019 Water/employees (z) 9,78 14,629 11,625 Total ratio (=x*y*z) 1,06** 2,59** 1,079** ** number to divide by 100.000 After an increase last year, we used a smaller amount of water in 2014. In comparison with 2012 we notice an increase of 22,3%. The decrease in comparison with 2013 is 13,3%. This means that measures that have been taken in the past, still have an effect on the total use of water. Ecological footprint The previous results and all positive changes that are metioned above result to the following: 2012 2013 2014 CO2 emissions (kg) 298.492 318.836 328.326 m² purchased papier 28.077.593 31.545.515 35.124.725 Number of employees 140 132 144 Surface building in use 7.355 10.043 10.043 Ratio CO2/paper (x) 0,011 0,010 0,009 Ratio CO2/employees (Y) 2.132,09 2.415,42 2.280,04 Ratio CO2/surface (z) 40,58 31,75 32,69 Total ratio CO2: x*y*z 951,72 775,05 696,75 All our figures show, without any doubt that Artoos pays a lot of attention to decreasing its ecological footprint and works in a sustainable way. Page 9/10 COP Principle 10: An organization should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Our commitment or Policy Corruption, extortion and bribery are prohibited by Belgian law. We are subject to Belgian law and act as such. We are transparent in our financial dealings and have external auditors to oversee our accounts. On a yearly basis, our intentions for the future are explained and documented to all employees. ISO 26000 Since 2011 we are implementing the principles of ISO 26000. A GAP analyses was made. After deciding which of the missing points were of any materiality for us, we started several actions. Commuting e.g. is a topic that we have put (and are still putting) in the spot lights. We have tried to motivate people to use sustainable transport to come to work. Especially the use of electric bikes is an important topic. As a result of this the number of sustainable commuters has gone up with 22,2% compared to 2013 and with 29,4% compared to 2012. Page 10/10
