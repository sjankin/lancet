We adopt green sale model. We reduce We insist on promoting bulk packaging for resource occupation and improve marketing cement products and bare packaging for efficiency through establishing modern glass products. We seek to simplify packaging logistic park and rational plan on supply, of products including gypsum board, glass marketing and logistics. We provide online fiber, etc. and maximize the use of recyclable transaction service for worldwide building packing materials to reduce packaging waste products and reduce the carbon released by Energy Saving & Environmental Protection while ensuring the quality of products and business travel of clients and sales personnel transportation safety. through establishing online marketing platform. DEVELOPING BULK CEMENT Bulk cement means cement is directly delivered from plants to transfer stations or users after produced at factories through specific facilities or containers, without any pouch pack. Using bulk cement can improve the reliability and safety of constructional engineering. When leaving the factories, bulk cement has relatively high stability and quality. During transportation and storage, they cannot be easily deteriorated by moisture, thus avoiding strength decrease caused by moisture. Developing bulk cement can improve the working condition of workers and achieve civilized production Employee Care of cement enterprises. If cement leaves factories in traditional paper bag packing, workers will have to face very bad working conditions given that physical labor and semi-mechanization operation account for the main works in packing workshops. Such a working condition will seriously affect their physical and psychological health. If cement leaves factories in the form of bulk, complete mechanization and automation can be achieved, which not only reduces much hand labor, but also improves the production environment of the factories. It will advance manufacturers of cement to develop from labor-intensive type into knowledge-intensive type and from operators of an industry that creates a great deal of pollution to garden-style civilized manufacturers. Developing bulk cement, which can reduce environmental pollution, is conducive to people’s health. When cement in bags are loaded, uploaded and Corporate Citizen transported, loss is usually caused by the breakage of paper bags, which also pollutes surrounding environment; the on-site concrete mixing causes noise pollution to surrounding area. The above-mentioned problems can be well solved through bulk cement and the matching station of ready-mixed concrete. Developing bulk cement can reduce timber resources and environmental load, protecting ecological balance. To produce the paper material adopted for packing cement in bags requires timber resource, causing damage to forest; the composite materials adopted cannot be easily degraded and recycled, causing relatively heavy environmental load. It is estimated that 60 tons of packaging paper can be saved per 10,000 tons of bulk cement; and to produce 60 tons of packaging paper requires 330 m3 of timber, 72,000 kilowatt-hours of power, 78 tons of coal, and 22 tons of caustic soda; in addition, the cement loss caused by transporting per 10,000 tons of bulk cement can decline by 4% compared with cement packed in bags.

He led a team to build green pre-fab housing in the desert, overseas, and rural areas. The experience records the lively outline of common workers. The story of Su Zhixiong is not only a story of a person; it is one of thousands of green leaves of the towering tree–CNBM and the song representing the youth of Chinese workers in the new era, through which we can find youth, family, country, dream, and the Post-1980’s responsibilities for the country, their careers, and their families. Workers in the new era keep the country in their hearts and mark their youth with responsibility. When Su Zhixiong went to build Lotus Project in the desert, his wife just got pregnant; when he went to build pre-fab housing in Zambia, his daughter was barely one-month old. However, he was very proud of building Chinese green pre-fab housing overseas. He adhered to the national commitment, by paying attention to details and strictly controlling the quality of the project to carefully defend China’s national dignity in housing quality. Workers in the new era are professional workers with specific knowledge; they utilize knowledge to pursue their dreams. Su Zhixiong, major in civil works, has strict control over selecting materials and construction of projects. He always solves problems related to construction in innovative ways. According to the report of Xinhua News Agency, we find such a detail – “in China, keel frameworks of pre-fab housing are installed and jointed by specific equipment, but Zambia doesn’t Employee Care have such equipment. How should they do to ensure the progress of the project? To overcome the difficulty, Su Zhixong made numerous drawings and improved samples for many times; finally, by utilizing basic mechanical principle and handmade methods, he made a simple replacement of the complex and precise equipment, which consists of screw stem, steel tube, and clamping components. Such a simple device not only guarantees the quality of installation, but also reduces the period for jointing by 1/3.” Who can insist that young workers like Su Zhixiong lack the tenacity of the older generations? They are even better. Young workers in the new era adhere to their dreams, and incorporate their own dreams into “green dream” and “Chinese dream”. Su Zhixiong said: “BNBM Homes Co., Ltd. is my battlefield, green and environmental protection is my dream.
