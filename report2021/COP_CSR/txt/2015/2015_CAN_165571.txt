These gases are produced during the GHG Protocol and ISO14064.

Energy indirect emissions are associated To understand and manage our environmental footprint, we have with power that HBC has purchased and consumed, such as electricity, been tracking our greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, steam, and chilled water. In 2014, we have also included energy indirect and fuel efficiency since 2000.

HBC has been a proud participant of Earth Hour since 2008, when all of our GTA locations participated. In 2009, and each year following, all of HBC’s Canadian locations participated in Earth Hour.

We face localized and systemic challenges that make us re-evaluate the way we interact with various business partners – suppliers, factories and buyers – to ensure everyone understands the role they play in this symbiotic relationship of global trade.

In China, the rapid growth of wages is changing the face of the manufacturing industry by moving factories away from the coastal regions. HBC’s sourcing strategies were naturally impacted by these geo-political issues that affect the cost of producing merchandise. It is our responsibility to ensure that we remain steadfast in our commitment to source responsibly while we meet our corporate and financial objectives. To address these challenges, we established one Supplier Code of Conduct for all company banners and developed one standard Social Compliance Policy for all merchandising areas in 2014. HBC’s Social Compliance Policy requires all vendors to conduct business in an ethical and socially responsible manner, as stated in our Code and in compliance with local laws. Both the Policy and Code are communicated as terms within our business agreements, and vendors must ensure their suppliers and subcontractors are in compliance with these terms. Additionally, the HBC Social Compliance Program is applicable to vendors and factories that produce private label merchandise for HBC, as well as overseas import vendors producing national branded merchandise where HBC is the importer of record.

Peer educator training occurred in our partner factory from April to June 2014, which covered topics such as reproductive health and nutrition. Peer educators, who initially had little knowledge prior to training, demonstrated great interest in learning about reproductive health, as evidenced by the quality of discussion and questions asked. In October 2014, peer trainers led a series of three training sessions at the factory for more than 250 female workers. Training sessions included trivia games, pamphlet distribution, and active Q&A discussions. In addition, in November, an outreach initiative coinciding with World AIDS Day took place. Doctors and experts from the local Center for Disease Control (CDC) and local Women’s Union came into the factory to discuss HIV prevention with more than 110 female workers. In addition to lectures, games were played to ensure that the women understood the information, and condoms and educational pamphlets were also distributed to the workers.

COMPLIANCE Through our yearly System Review we continue to improve our programs and practices to comply with regulatory requirements. CONTRIBUTE TO POSITIVE CASH FLOW One of the many benefits that come with good safety performance is reduced costs related to workplace injuries. We strive to achieve lower workers’ compensation insurance premiums that come with fewer injuries. Furthermore, in Canada, we continue to pursue incentive programs including Alberta WCB’s Partners in Injury Reduction, and Ontario WSIB’s Safety Group program. In the U.S., we continue to see a decline in the frequency of our Workers’ Compensation and lost time claims. Our key focus remains on accident prevention and awareness. We have also instituted the consolidated processing of claims by a single Third Party Administrator (TPA) for both Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue, a process completed on November 1st, 2014. Through this consolidation we now have strategic opportunities to best maximize our return on investment, while offering consistent resources to our associates.
