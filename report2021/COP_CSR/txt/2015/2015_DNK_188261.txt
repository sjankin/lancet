November 1st 2015 CEO STATEMENT As Managing Director of Iver C. Weilbach & Co. A/S, I would like to express the company’s continued support and commitment to the UN Global Compact. As a small company our ability to influence global society is limited, but by joining with other companies in this initiative we feel that a significant impact can be achieved. By renewing our commitment to the UN Global Compact we pledge to incorporate the ten principles within the areas of Human Rights, Labour, the Environment and Anticorruption, into our business practices. In addition, we will collaborate with our customers, suppliers, business partners, subcontractors and other stakeholders to promote the UN Global Compact, and address potential issues in our sphere of influence.
