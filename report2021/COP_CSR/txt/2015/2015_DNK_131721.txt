It also provides our employees with tools and procedures to guide them in their daily work. NORDEN has, as part of an industry collaboration, been instrumental in developing anti-corruption training for senior management, captains and operators for the Maritime AntiCorruption Network (MACN) and its members. The training was made available for all the members in September and has been launched by NORDEN within our organisation for the senior management, captains and operators. During the year, we were rewarded with a position on the A Michael Tønnes Jørgensen List in the CDP's Climate Performance Leadership Index. This CFO and Chairman of the CSR Executive body is the highest category that a company can achieve, and it shows that NORDEN has gone from beyond transparency to excellent performance . 3 CSR REPORT 2014 / NORDEN IN BRIEF 978 emplOyees Offices wOrldwide 673 seafarers on owned vessels, denmark, singapore, china, india, UsA, Brazil and 305 onshore employees Australia and port captains in large ports ensure a close contact with customers denmark UsA china india One Of the wOrld's lArgest singapore OperAtOrs Brazil within supramax and panamax. in addition, activities within handysize, Australia post-panamax and capesize • Established and listed in 1871 • Flexible business model of owned and chartered vessels • Global activities within • Owns 50% of Norient Product Pool, NPP, • dry cargo – transport of commodities such as coal, grain, one of the world's largest operators of product tankers iron ore, etc. • Share listed on nAsdAq OmX copenhagen A/s • product tankers – transport of refined oil products • 16,226 registered shareholders missiOn VisiOn Our business is global tramp shipping.

To reach our target of reducing CO2 emissions from owned vessels by 25% compared to 2007-levels by 2020, exclusive of vessels on contract to third parties, NORDEN focuses on three different areas. These are technical improvements, speed optimisation and maintaining a young, modern and fuel efficient fleet. Technical improvements NORDEN’s Climate Action Plan from 2007 includes 10 fuel saving initiatives, which are assessed yearly for their effectiveness. Each initiative’s effect is calculated based on assumptions about engine size, engine type, voyage conditions as well as guidelines from the IMO and Intertanko. In 2014, the target was to reduce CO2 emissions from owned vessels by 4.3% via the initiatives in the Climate Action Plan, which we reached with a total reduction of 10.7%. The pie chart illustrates how large a share of the CO2 reduction each initiative contributed with in proportion to the overall reduction of CO2 emissions of 10.7%. The reduction of 10.7% is included in the total data on reduction of CO2 emissions from owned vessels (EEOI) described below in the subsection “Total reduction of CO2 emissions”. Climate Action Plan 1. Propeller Cleaning: Adoption of propeller cleaning on an average 6 months basis. 1.4% 2. Advanced Hull Coating: Reduces marine growth on the under9.0% water hull. 1.5% 3. Shaft Torque Monitoring System: Ensures an on‐line real‐time 4.0% 30.9% monitoring of the propulsion power delivered to the propeller. 4.

Slide Fuel Valves For Main Engines: Improves the combustion 7.5% of main engine and ensures a cleaner engine. 6. Electrical Steam Generator: Instead of using the large capacity oil fired boiler to top up steam at low engine loads and/or in cold weather, a small electrical heating system can be installed and 9.0% efficiently generate the required top up steam. 7. CASPER Vessel Performance Monitoring: Ensures an overview of the development of the fuel efficiency for each individual vessel 13.5% 24.6% in the fleet. 8.

Variable Sea Water Cooling Pump Capacity: Can adjust the cooling capacity to the actual cooling demand, electrical power drawn from the main switch board can be reduced and thereby auxiliary engine fuel oil consumption will be reduced. 5 CSR REPORT 2014 / CO2 efficiency Speed optimisation In a market where bunker prices are decreasing, it is even more important to make use of right steaming. NORDEN is committed to right steaming, which is to sail at the optimal speed according to the framework set out, i.e. time versus cost. Another means to optimise speed is to make use of virtual arrival, which is a partnership between NORDEN, the customer and a weather routing company with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions and thereby also bunker costs. In practice, it means that if a vessel is scheduled to arrive on a specific day, but the circumstances entail that this is not optimal, for instance due to congestion in the terminal, then an agreement is made with the customer and a new scheduled time and speed is planned. NORDEN engages with the weather routing company to ensure that the speed chosen is in line with the weather forecast. In the end, the gain obtained on the saved bunker is divided between the customer and NORDEN. NORDEN’s automated system gives a notice if there is a possibility for a virtual arrival voyage. In addition, NORDEN has a Fuel Efficiency Team comprised of qualified engineers, who in cooperation with other departments, monitor each vessel’s bunker consumption and identify potential possibilities of improvement. In order to quickly facilitate the right decisions and actions to improve fuel efficiency, data quality and consistency in fuel monitoring are both very important. But fuel consumption measurements are typically subject to several sources of error, to external influences, and they can change substantially over time. To ensure data quality and consistency across the organisation, the project One Set of Numbers was therefore initiated in 2013. The project was completed during 2014 and has resulted in all fuel data now being available on a daily basis, in a standard format and with consistent adjustments. The benefit is clear: higher data reliability provides greater alignment in relation to fuel saving actions and better sharing of best practices. Modern fleet An essential part of our strategy to maintain a young, modern and fuel efficient fleet is to invest in fuel efficient vessels. This is supplemented by continuously evaluating how existing vessels can be optimised. We consider eco vessels as vessels that live up to the phase 2 requirements of the IMO’s Environmental Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), which are to be implemented in the shipping industry by 2020. Phase 2 sets the requirements for vessels built in 2020 and onwards and is the stricter version of the current EEDI requirements. NORDEN strives to adhere to these criteria in all future newbuilding contracts. In 2014, NORDEN received 2 eco tanker vessels and 4 long term chartered eco dry cargo vessels with purchase option. We ordered 6 eco dry cargo vessels to be delivered in 2016-2018. We also ordered 1 long term chartered eco tanker vessel with purchase option and 1 long term chartered eco dry cargo vessel with purchase option. In total within the next 3 years, we will receive 4 eco tanker vessels, 12 eco dry cargo vessels, 1 long term chartered eco tanker vessel with purchase option and 4 long term chartered eco dry cargo vessels with purchase option. Total reduction of CO2 emissions The International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) is used to enable us to see how far we have come in reaching the 25% reduction in CO2 emissions from the 2007 level by 2020. The EEOI is used to calculate the mass of CO2 emitted per metric ton of cargo transported per nautical mile sailed. It is a useful indicator as it enables us to compare our yearly CO2 reduction regardless of changes in fleet size. We are once again disclosing our Cargo EEOI performance in addition to the Total EEOI performance. The results are visually illustrated in the table “Total reduction of CO2 emissions”. Cargo EEOI is the indicator that we can directly impact, through the quality and operation of the vessel, and therefore, the most representative of our efforts to decrease CO2 emissions. Ballast and Port EEOI are linked to market conditions, including cargo availability, waiting time or port stays, which are generally beyond our control. 6 CSR REPORT 2014 / CO2 efficiency Total EEOI = Cargo EEOI + Ballast EEOI + Port EEOI ∑ ton CO2 total ∑ ton CO2 laden ∑ ton CO2 ballast ∑ ton CO2 port ∑ distance * cargo ∑ distance * cargo ∑ distance * cargo ∑ distance * cargo The Total EEOI, as defined by the IMO, may be regarded as made up of three contributions, which are the cargo, ballast and port parts of the journey.

Both elements are mainly market driven and outside NORDEN’s control. The Cargo EEOI, describing the vessel efficiency, has had a fine development. Especially the owned vessels have improved their efficiency due to more active approach towards water hull cleanings, propeller polish, advanced dockings, use of better anti-foulings and the delivery of new ECO vessels. A complete outline of our CO2 emissions and overall environmental performance can be found in the section Facts, Figures and Assurance. Future targets Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator EEOI 2020 target: 25% reduction in relative CO2 emissions from owned vessels exclusive of vessels on contract to third parties by 2020 from the 2007 level (Total EEOI) where 15% should be a result of technical improvements and 10% a result of speed reductions Climate Action Plan 2015 target: 4.7% reduction in CO2 emissions from owned vessels Covered by PwC's 2014 report on non-financial data 7 CSR REPORT 2014 / VESSEL SAFETY VESSEL SAFETY Performance 2014 Target Actual Maximum of 3.79 remarks per vetting inspection of owned tanker vessels technically managed by NORDEN in 2014 0 3.79 3.87 5 Maximum of 1.3 deficiencies per PSC per owned vessels Target Actual technically managed by NORDEN in 2014 0 1.3 1.9 2 Pass all Port State Controls (PSC) without detentions in 2014 0% 99% Zero incidents of piracy on owned vessels in 2014 0% 100% NORDEN's Technical Department went through a reorganisation to future proof the department as well as improve its effectiveness,quality and performance. Consultants were hired to identify areas of improvements. The main change was the establishment of 4 vessel groups based on the different vessel types which NORDEN owns. The vessel groups have the full responsibility of the technical operations of a vessel, which makes the dialogue with the vessels less resource demanding as the vessels receive a single point of contact. Moreover, it creates transparency towards our customers as they can more easily see how we manage our vessels. The benefits which this reorganisation has had and will continue to have will help us to remain a preferred business partner for our current customers as well as attract new customers. Vetting NORDEN's tanker vessels are chartered by oil majors and are Vetting and Port State Controls (PSC) therefore continuously vetted. Vettings are risk assessments conducted by oil companies, which focus on the safe and environmental operation of the chartered vessels. 8 We have increased focus on safe operation of the vessels by 6 withdrawing the vetting function from the other job functions and placed in the daily vessel operation. This was done in con4 nection with the above mentioned reorganisation of the Techni2 cal Department. 0 Moreover, an additional employee was hired at the end of the 2011 2012 2013 2014 year to strengthen the vetting function. Our vetting target is to have a total of vetting remarks below er risk assessment tool concerning vessel safety introduced by the peer group benchmark average, as indicated by the Tanker the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF).

NORDEN takes all possible measures to avoid these types of incidents during the operation of vessels. Several times per year, crew members receive training in contingency exercises. For instance, one of our vessels participated in an oil spill exercise in Hawaii with local authorities and the US Coast Guard. In the event of an incident, mitigation material, such as pollution prevention equipment, can be found on board, and the crew is trained in using it.

All different aspects of Human Resource are emphasised, such as for instance competency building, retention, measuring performance, work environment, recruitment and talent management. This enhanced focus will have a positive effect on our crew and help us in our aim to be a preferred employer. We believe that salary is not a retention parameter on its own. It is important to look at the entire employment package. Therefore, besides the competitive salary package, NORDEN also offers other benefits such leadership training, talent management and health insurance. Moreover, NORDEN offers benefits on board to ensure a healthy and attractive working environment, such as access to exercise equipment and healthy nutrition, focus on timely relief and a short line of command. In addition, NORDEN provides good internet connection, as we believe that it is important for our seafarers to be able to be in regular contact with their families and friends, during their periods far away from home. In 2014, NORDEN achieved a retention rate of 95% thus meeting our target of 90%. Having different cultures confined to a vessel for a certain period of time can sometimes pose some challenges. NORDEN therefore focuses on cultural awareness and will in the next couple of years enhance this focus by integrating cultural awareness and understanding in leadership training, as well as officer seminars, which are held 2 times per year. In 2014, no discrimination incidents were reported. Moreover, to strengthen the crew's cooperation it is important to also have a good crew composition, which in turn leads to a better working environment on board. NORDEN has therefore started to make use of personal profiles, as we believe this tool will enable us to identify which traits are essential in ensuring good crew cooperation. NORDEN will focus on using this tool more actively over the next couple of years. All in all, NORDEN believes that the above-mentioned initiatives and the change from crewing to Marine HR will result in a string of positive effects, such as better leadership on board, better crew composition, more transparency concerning future career opportunities, and better dialogue between the vessel and Marine HR. 11 CSR REPORT 2014 / Employee conditions Rest hours at sea NORDEN aims to ensure compliance with regulations and conventions concerning working hours, rest hours, rest facilities and leave to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for our employees at sea. NORDEN's Technical Department has upgraded the software for records of rest hours enabling online monitoring of the records kept. The increased focus together with the online monitoring makes it possible for the shore staff to assist the Master in complying with the complex rest hour regulations. In addition, safety leadership training has been conducted during 2014 to increase exchange of information between employees on shore and employees at sea. In 2014, NORDEN's target was less than 0.38 rest hour non-conformity per full-time equivalent, meaning 0.38 breaches per 1 crew member on board a vessel during 1 month. We unfortunately did not reach our target as we had 0.86 rest hour non-conformity per full-time equivalent. Consequently, we are continuing to focus on training and safety campaigns. It is a mind-set change and therefore the importance of rest hour adherence is a key subject on all quarterly officer seminars. The target for 2015 is 0.5 rest hour non-conformity per full-time equivalent. Lost-Time Injury (LTI) at sea The assessment of the number of injuries in the past year helps us evaluate whether our incident prevention efforts are successful or should be strengthened. The LTI frequency rate is measured in work related incidents per 1 million working hours which cause absence from work for more than 1 working day. The rate is calculated as an average over the past 12 months. The target in 2014 was a maximum of 0.8 incidents per 1 million working hours which was not met with an actual LTI of 1.13 incidents per 1 million working hours. The injuries are minor and varied in nature and therefore there are no identified trends which would enable targeted safety initiatives. Hence, NORDEN will continue to focus on the improvement of the safety in general by having incidents on the agenda at officer seminars. The target for 2015 is a maximum 0.8 incidents per 1 million working hours. Incidents We are pleased to report that there have not been any fatalities or other grave incidents in 2014. NORDEN will continue to maintain a high focus on safety. Near-miss reporting at sea NORDEN encourages the submission of near-miss reports as they reflect employees' focus on safety. Therefore the goal is to receive as many reports as possible with a minimum target of 1 near-miss report per vessel per week. We had an average of 1.7 near-miss reports per vessel per week, thus meeting our target. This indicator is used as a safety awareness indicator as it refers to situations, which could have led to an accident had they further developed. Thereby we can identify if there are any trends and if so develop initiatives targeted these.

The 3 inflatable rubber boats were carrying a total of 301 persons of which one had tragically lost his life before NORD FARER arrived. They disembarked at the port of Catania on Sicily as instructed by the Italian authorities. In addition, NORD GUARDIAN rescued 269 persons in June 2014 while heading for Zawiya, Libya. The vessel was diverted to port Pozallo, Sicily, where they disembarked. All refugees on both vessels were helped on board by the crew and provided with food and shelter. Employees on shore NORDEN strives to provide a working environment, which is diverse, inclusive, respectful and tolerant. For instance, we have 21 different nationalities working at NORDEN, and we have a wide range of different age groups, ranging from 18 to 68 years. We believe in equal opportunities and fair treatment for everyone and prohibit any form of discrimination and harassment. No discrimination incidents were reported in 2014. NORDEN reached a retention rate of 87% thus unfortunately not meeting our goal of a minimum of 90%, partly due to the reorganisation of the technical department. As shipping is historically primarily a male profession, we still face challenges regarding gender distribution, specifically in management positions. NORDEN developed a gender policy in 2013 in connection with the Danish legislation on gender equality in companies' Board of Directors and management. NORDEN's Board of Directors is constituted of 16% female board members, exclusive of employee representatives. The goal is as a minimum tomaintain the 16% and strive to reach 33% before 2017. At the general meeting, current board members were re-elected, which resulted in the female share of board members remaining the same at 16%. When proposing new board members for election, the Board of Directors commits to consistently consider female candidates. With regard to the gender distribution in management, we focus on the root causes of the uneven gender balance to make sure that we as a company do not lose our female talents due to unnecessary perceived or actual structural impediments. The mapping of root causes of gender diversity is still ongoing. To obtain a more balanced gender distribution in management, it is essential to focus on attracting female candidates to the positions from which future managers are typically promoted, to create a pool of qualified female candidates for future management positions. In 2014, NORDEN hired 14 finance and shipping trainees where we reached a gender distribution of 57% female and 43% male trainees. Commitment to Human and Labour Rights NORDEN is still in the process of mapping our actual and potential impacts on all 48 human and labour rights as expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and required by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We are conducting two human and labour rights impact assessments, one for our headquarters and overseas offices and one for our vessels. We have not come as far with the two impact assessments as we would have liked, and therefore, we will prioritise the assessments in 2015 and aim to have the two impact assessment finished by the end of 2015. 13 CSR REPORT 2014 / Employee conditions Community engagement In 2014 following NORDEN's recommendations, D/S Orients Fond supported a variety of different projects such as: a 3-year scholarship for students for the Singapore Management University, a sponsorship for the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore as well as support to the Sailors' Society in the form of a minibus to the port chaplain in Porto Santo, Brazil, and 5 years of operating expenses related to the bus. Besides the above mentioned projects, the Foundation also made donations to the Training Ship Denmark for a modern communication system and to the Aarhus School of Marine and Technical Engineering to purchase an engine room simulator. NORDEN’s in-house employee collection after the super Hurricane Yolanda hit the Philippines was used to purchase books and video materials to be used by maritime students on the marine engineering programme at the Eastern Visayas State University. Lastly, NORDEN sponsored a spinning bike for the event “Spinning4Cancer” where all the proceeds in full went to the Danish Cancer Society. NORDEN’s employees had to ensure that the bike kept going non-stop for 24 hours. Supporting Save the Children in Somalia D/S Norden has through D/S Orients Fond continued to support Save the Children Denmark's project in Somalia, which aims to contribute to the creation of a sustainable and coherent education system by providing training adapted to the different age groups in Somaliland and Puntland. In Somaliland in 2014, 5 class rooms were added to existing schools and one science lab was constructed. Moreover, 2,664 children started attending school and 12,311 students from primary and secondary school have benefited from textbooks.

Having gone through two thirds of the strategy period, we can safely say that we are still on track. We have reached the majority of our targets and for those which we have not reached; we have identified the reasons behind this and will use this knowledge to better reach the 2015 targets. The main focus of 2014 has been on anti-corruption and the development of an Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme and training. More detailed information on this can be found in our anti-corruption section. Our current strategy on the right course ends in 2015. Therefore in the second quarter of 2015, we will develop a new CSR strategy. It is important for our strategy to reflect the risks and business opportunities which we, as a shipping company, face as well as the expectations of our stakeholders. Therefore, the strategy process will as last time include a materiality assessment where issues will be prioritised and selected based on two parameters: their importance to our stakeholders and their business impact. Our stakeholders are customers and brokers, suppliers, external organisations, investors and analysts, media, authorities and regulators, local communities, NGO's and employees at sea and on shore. CDP NORDEN reports to the CDP regarding our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and the impact of climate change on our business. Regulations which attempt to offset the impact of climate change as well as changes in weather patterns are the main consequences of climate change for the industry and NORDEN. Our Executive Management embeds climate change implications in their business considerations and in the conduct of long-term market and risk analyses. NORDEN has been awarded with a position on the A List in the CDPs Climate Performance Leadership Index 2014. This is the highest category which a company can achieve, and it shows that NORDEN has gone from beyond transparency to excellent performance . The position has been achieved due to our actions to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the business risks of climate change. Out of nearly 2,000 listed companies, who have reported to CDP, NORDEN is one of the 187 reporting companies that have been awarded an A grade for its climate performance, earning a position on this global ranking of corporate efforts to mitigate climate change. Besides the ranking on the A list in the performance index, NORDEN has achieved a leading position for the fifth consecutive year in the CDP's Nordic 260 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI), which highlights the companies listed on the Nordic stock exchanges that have displayed a strong approach to climate reporting. The criteria for entering the Nordic CDLI rose in 2014. A company must now score 95 points out of 100 to be included in the CDLI, whereas in 2013, it was only 91 points. NORDEN is still the only shipping company represented in the Nordic CDLI. Whistleblowing There have been no incidents reported in 2014 to NORDEN's whistleblowing system SafeLine. The system was implemented in 2011 and is a means to create transparency within the organisation, providing the Board of Directors and all employees safe access to report any violations of law and regulations, NORDEN's Employee Code of Conduct and other serious irregularities. 15 CSR REPORT 2014 / TRANSPARENCY Future targets Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP report) 2015 target: CDP report part of the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) Covered by PwC's 2014 report on non-financial data 16 CSR REPORT 2014 / ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT Performance 2014 Reduction of weighted average sulphur content in total bunkers purchased to 2.30% in 2014 0% 100% Reduce waste from owned vessels technically managed by NORDEN from the 2013 level 0% 100% Reduce onshore energy consumption per employee from 2013 0% 100% Sulphur oxide (SOx) In January 2015, NORDEN, like the rest of the shipping industry, will be faced with a challenge concerning the availability of low sulphur oil. All Emission Control Areas (ECAs) will introduce a sulphur control limit of 0.1%. The challenge lies in the fact that it is doubtful whether there will be enough ultra low sulphur fuel oil available in 2015 for all vessels sailing in the ECAs. Consequently, NORDEN will have to use gas oil instead of fuel oil, and this may result in an increase of more than 50% in bunker costs when sailing in the ECAs. As SO2 emissions are harmful to people and the environment, NORDEN aims to reduce our emissions of SOx mainly through the purchase of bunker with reduced sulphur content. Bunker is the fuel oil used by vessels. NORDEN's target in 2014 was a weighted average sulphur content of 2.30% for total bunkers purchased for our operated vessels, which was reached by achieving a total of 2.13%. The target for 2015 is 2%. Nitrogen oxide (NOx) NORDEN also focuses on reducing emissions of Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) which is harmful to people and the environment as it causes smog and acid rain. Based on a vessel's construction date, the IMO has defined different tiers which have different criteria for NOx limits. One of NORDEN's strategies is to have a young and modern fleet, and this has a positive effect on our reduction of NOx emissions. 57 of NORDEN's vessels in our core fleet, comprising of a total of 102 vessels, are Tier I compliant as they are built after 1 January 2000, which means that they emit 13% less NOx emissions per ton of fuel consumed than vessels that are not Tier I compliant. In addition, 45 of NORDEN's vessels in our core fleet are Tier II compliant as they are built after 1 January 2011, which means that they emit 15% less NOx emissions per ton of fuel consumed than vessels that are Tier I compliant and 36% less than vessels that are not Tier I compliant. Waste NORDEN closely monitored the development of disposed waste during 2014 to enable faster response if unusual peaks in the amount of waste disposed were spotted. All of our waste is disposed of in accordance with the rules set forth by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The MARPOL regulations from 2013 have resulted in changes that impact both the categories of waste and the estimation of waste volumes. Consequently, NORDEN decided to familiarise ourselves with the changes before establishing specific numerical targets. Therefore, in 2014, it was NORDEN's overall aim to decrease waste from the 2013-level, and in 2015 the target will be to decrease waste by 5% from owned vessels operated by NORDEN from the 2014-level. In 2014, we had a decrease in waste of 3.6 % compared to the 2013-level. 17 CSR REPORT 2014 / ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT Ballast water treatment system Planning, selection and implementation of ballast water treatment systems depend mainly on the decisions made by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) as well as the legislation established by the US Coast Guard (USCG). The IMO's ballast water management convention of 2004 has not yet been ratified and the US Coast Guard has yet to grant type approval to any of the existing ballast water treatment systems. The US Coast Guard has therefore decided to allow shipping companies to apply for an extension until US Coast Guard type approved systems are available. NORDEN is waiting for a system to be approved by the US Coast Guard (or IMO ratification) before taking a new stance regarding installation on our vessels. On shore energy consumption NORDEN focuses on decreasing our onshore energy consumption throughgradual changes. Our aim is to reduce energy consumption per employee compared to last year. One of the means to do so is to favour the most energy efficient solution when repairing or changing equipment in NORDEN's offices. Our energy consumption has decreased from 5.2 MWh per employee in 2013 to 4.7 MWh per employee in 2014. In 2015, NORDEN plans to update the ventilation system in our headquarters in Hellerup, which we believe will have a positive effect on our energy consumption. Future targets SOx 2015 target: Reduction of weighted average sulphur content in total bunkers purchased to 2% Waste 2015 target: Reduce waste from owned vessels technically managed by NORDEN by 5% C02 on shore 2015 target: Reduce energy consumption per employee from 2014 Covered by PwC's 2014 report on non-financial data 18 CSR REPORT 2014 / ANTI-CORRUPTION ANTI-CORRUPTION Performance 2014 Establish an Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme 0%100% NORDEN has developed an Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme which was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2014. The programme was also sent to the external third party PricewaterhouseCoopers who provided feedback on the programme and made the following statement PwC has found the Programme to be built on the Adequate Procedures guidance set out for the UK Bribery Act, the Resource Guide to the FCPA and the 7 principles of the MACN. PwC also states that NORDEN has documented a solid Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme, including some best practices and some opportunities for improvement. PwC made a few recommendations for improvements to the Programme which NORDEN will be addressing. The programme assembles the different steps and initiatives which we as a company and our employees, regardless of their position, should follow. The programme ensures that all employees have the relevant tools, procedures, guidelines and knowledge to support NORDEN's Anti-Corruption Policy and relevant procedures. It is in line with the seven anti-corruption principles formulated by and agreed upon in the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), which are themselves in line with the principles and guidance in the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The programme is structured in 7 steps: Top-level commitment, Risk assessment, Procedures, Training and communication, Monitoring and internal controls, Due diligence and Reporting, discipline and incentives. The programme deals with the main forms of corruption, which include bribery, facilitation payments, extortion, fraud and embezzlement. But third party responsibility, gift and entertainment, commissions, conflict of interest, sponsorships as well as political and charitable contributions are also covered by the programme. To ensure that we have adequate and relevant procedures andtraining, it is essential that we have an understanding of the challenges our employees face in their daily work. Therefore the programme includes a risk assessment, both at a country level and at a job function level. Interviews were conducted throughout the organisation and resulted in the identification of which corruption risks, if any, a given job function was prone to. The employees' job functions were divided into high, medium and low risks. Tailor-made training is currently being developed for the various employee groups that will address the specific identified challenges these groups face. The training will be in the form of approximately 12 tailor-made e-learning courses and will be implemented throughout the organisation in Q1 2015. In addition, high risk groups will, besides an e-learning course, participate in an annual workshop where dilemmas and concrete scenarios can be discussed. The target is that all employees have undergone anti-corruption training before the end of 2015. Besides from the above-mentioned training, 3 training packages have already been developed within the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN) and launched in September 2014. NORDEN collaborated with GAN Integrity Solution, an anti-corruption expert, to develop these 3 training packages to be distributed to all MACN members: a senior management workshop, operator e-learning and captain e-learning. NORDEN has already implemented the 3 above training packages in 2014. NORDEN' Senior and Group Management all went through a 3 hour anti-corruption workshop hosted by GAN Integrity Solutions, where key corruption risks, anti-corruption legislation and scenarios were explained. The workshop was followed by a test which was passed by all participants. Moreover, NORDEN implemented the operator e-learning in October. End 2014, all NORDEN operators at headquarters and overseas offices had gone through and passed the e-learning course. The captain training was also implemented on board NORDEN's owned vessels both those in internal as well as those in external technical management. We have decided to expand the target group, so senior officers, junior officers and cadets are also undergoing the captain e-learning course. Due to crew rotation, the training process is a bit longer than for commercial operators, so NORDEN has not trained crew members yet, but aims to do so in 2015. To ensure compliance with the programme, a Compliance Task Force reporting directly to NORDEN's CFO has been established. The role of the Task Force is to ensure that the policies and procedures are followed and that risk assessment,due diligence and monitoring are conducted regularly. The Task Force is also responsible for analysing data and pinpointing trends and patterns. 19 CSR REPORT 2014 / ANTI-CORRUPTION NORDEN is still an active member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN) where we are part of the steering committee and active in several working groups. We will continue to prioritise the active participation in the network as webelieve that corruption is an international issue which companies cannot solveon their one; instead industry cooperation and governmental support is needed. The agent screening for port agents and due diligence tool that is being developed in MACN by GAN Integrity Solutions will be available to all members in the second half of 2015. The tool will help companies operating in the maritime industry who rely on a global network of agents and have difficulties vetting them all. CORRUPTION Bribery Facilitation payments Acceptance, offering solicitation or promise of benefits, Small payments in cash or in kind made for a service to in kind or monetary, in order to gain business advantages which we have a legal right or other entitlement to which we would not otherwise be entitled NORDEN's policy NORDEN's policy Zero tolerance Endeavours to reduce Distinction between bribery and facilitation payments.

The system is run by the International Marine Purchasing Association (IMPA) and has been developed by IMPA, NORDEN and the Danish ship owner J.Lauritzen. It goes beyond the requirements set by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and includes provisions on anti-corruption and the environment. The intention and aim is that IMPA ACT will become a maritime industry standard, as a common approach will ensure consistency and prevent too many different codes of conduct at our suppliers. Moreover, it will reduce costs and resource consumption in the short and long term both for the company but also for the supplier. Some of the chosen suppliers in 2013 have successfully gone through IMPA ACT, while others are still going through the process. We have partnered up with the latter and agreed upon milestones for their future work. We engaged in dialogue with 5 new suppliers in the second half of 2014. These suppliers were, similar to the suppliers NORDEN cooperated with in 2013, chosen based on spend, dependency and frequency. We see benefits of conducting the in-house process in parallel with our suppliers undertaking their process. For instance, it enables us to better relate to their challenges and share bestpractice and experience. In 2015, NORDEN will once again engage with 5 new suppliers. In 2014, Purchasing in the Technical Department started including a new clause in all new or renegotiated supplier contracts, requesting that they abide by our Supplier Code of Conduct. We are gathering experience from this process and aim to start implementing this clause in other supplier contracts for the rest of NORDEN in the next couple of years. Third party vessels Due to the reorganisation of the Technical Department in 2014, we have not come as far as expected with the inspections of third party vessels. Consequently, we will focus on conducting the handful of third party vessel observations in 2015. The purpose of the observations is to collect information and experience that will enable us to establish and pinpoint what measures to take in the future to ensure that third party vessels actually uphold classifications and flag state requirements. 21 CSR REPORT 2014 / RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT Future targets Responsible procurement: first-tier suppliers 2015 target: Distribute Supplier Code of Conduct to and engage in dialogue with another 5 first-tier suppliers Third party vessels: ensure that third party vessels 2015 target: NORDEN will do a handful of observations of actually uphold classification and flag state requirements third party vessels in order to establish what measures to take in the future Covered by PwC's 2014 report on non-financial data 22 CSR REPORT 2014 / FACTS, FIGURES AND ASSURANCE FACTS, FIGURES AND ASSURANCE Reporting To ensure transparency and consistency in NORDEN's CSR reporting, we have collected data and developed our report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) G3.1 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and Logistics and Transportation Sector Supplement. Only indicators that are relevant to our business and stakeholders have been chosen. We have thus created a CSR reporting model which is tailored for NORDEN and our business and is based on recognised standards such as GRI and UN Global Compact. This report also serves as NORDEN's Communication on Progress (COP) Report 2014 to the UN Global Compact. Our report application level is C+ as the content of this report has been assured by PricewaterhouseCoopers. For more detail, see the independent auditor's report.

(c) T  ransport work is defined as the mass transported times the distance and enables the reader to put the other values into perspective. (d) C  O2 emissions from vessels are calculated from the fuel quantity consumed on a voyage times the duration of the voyage (calculated pro rata) times the CO2 emissions factor for each bunker type (for residual fuel oil the CO2 emissions factor is 3.1144, and for marine diesel oil and marine gas oil the CO2 emissions factor is 3.206 (source: ”Second IMO GHG Study 2009”). (e) S  cope 1 emissions include emissions from owned vessels operated by NORDEN and also emissions from owned company cars. Scope 2 emissions include emissions from land-based activities at NORDEN’s offices worldwide, except from the Annapolis office since electricity is integrated in rental costs. Scope 3 emissions include emissions from chartered vessels, business travel by air transport and leased company cars. (f) S  Ox emissions are weighted as SO2 emissions since this is presumably what the emissions will become in time. SO2 emissions are calculated from the fuel quantity consumed during the year times the average sulphur content in the bunker fuel (in 2014: 2.13%) times 2 since sulphur is about twice as heavy as oxygen. The formula is provided by MAN Diesel & Turbo SE. (g) N Ox emissions are weighted as NO2 emissions since this is presumably what the emissions will become in time. NO2 emissions are calculated from the energy that the main engine produces times the Tier I NOx limit which is 17 gr/kWh, as NORDEN’s owned and operated vessels are Tier I compliant. The energy produced is calculated using the fuel oil consumed in kg divided by the SFOC which in this case is estimated to be 0.173 kg/kWh (source “Project Guide for MAN S50MC-C7 two-stroke engine, 6th Edition, January 2009”). The figure for NOx is conservative estimate, as approximately half our owned vessels are Tier II compliant as described in the section Environmental Management. 25 CSR REPORT 2014 / FACTS, FIGURES AND ASSURANCE Table 2: Active core fleet NORDEN’s active core fleet, 31 December 2014 Avg. years of DIS flag (Denmark) SRS flag (Singapore) Other flags operation Owned vessels, Dry Cargo fleet 5 21 0 5.6 Owned vessels, Tanker fleet 10 9 1 5.0 Chartered vessels with purchase option, 0 5 44 4.0 Dry Cargo fleet Chartered vessels with purchase option, 0 1 6 5.3 Tanker fleet Total active core fleet 15 36 51 4.7 Table 3: LA1 Total workforce by employment type, employment contract and region broken down by gender (Women= W, Men= M) Employees at sea 2014 W M Employees at sea 2014 W M Full-time 3 670 Indefinite or permanent contract 3 115 Part-time 0 0 Fixed term or temporary contract 0 555 Employees on shore 2014 Copenhagen Singapore Shanghai Mumbai Rio de Janeiro Annapolis W M W M W M W M W M W M Full-time 55 142 14 34 7 6 1 6 2 3 2 17 Part-time 12 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Employees on shore 2014 Copenhagen Singapore Shanghai Mumbai Rio de Janeiro Annapolis W M W M W M W M W M W M Indefinite or permanent contract 60 132 12 33 4 6 1 6 2 3 3 15 Fixed term or temporary contract (e.g. trainees and maternity leave 7 13 2 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 replacements) 26 CSR REPORT 2014 / FACTS, FIGURES AND ASSURANCE Table 4: LA2 Total number and rate of new employees hired and employee turnover by age group, gender and region Employees at sea hired Employees at sea who Employees on shore Employees on shore who Age in 2014 left NORDEN in 2014 hired in 2014 left NORDEN in 2014 <30 95 42 28 16 30-50 46 82 28 16 >50 10 28 4 5 Employees at sea hired Employees at sea who Employees on shore Employees on shore who Gender in 2014 left NORDEN in 2014 hired in 2014 left NORDEN in 2014 Women 0 1 17 12 Men 151 151 43 25 Employees on shore Employees on shore who Location hired in 2014 left NORDEN in 2014 Copenhagen 45 27 Singapore 5 7 Shanghai 4 3 Mumbai 2 0 Rio de Janeiro 0 0 Annapolis 4 0 27 CSR REPORT 2014 / FACTS, FIGURES AND ASSURANCE Table 5: Employment level 2014 Copenhagen Singapore Shanghai Mumbai Rio de Janeiro Annapolis W M W M W M W M W M W M Leaders 7 38 1 4 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 Employees excl. leaders 60 107 13 30 7 6 1 5 2 2 3 15 Leaders in % of total workforce 3 18 2 8 0 0 0 14 0 20 0 10 Gender distribution in % of leaders 16 84 20 80 0 0 0 100 0 100 0 100 Note: A leader is defined as someone with leadership responsibilities, meaning leading a team of at least 1 other person, regardless of title.

VESSEL SAFETY NORDEN’s Port State Control target is to have lower deficiencies per owned vessel technically managed by NORDEN per Vetting PSC than the peer group benchmark average (as measured by Vetting inspections are performed by inspectors from oil compaTanker Safety Forum Benchmark and Boston Consulting Group nies in accordance with the Ship Inspection Report Programme Benchmark). (SIRE). Observations identified during the inspection are reported to vessel and office by the inspector (results are also recorded The average number of deficiencies per PSC from the Boston in the SIRE database by OCIMF). The data is applicable for Consulting Group’s peer group was the following for 2013 owned vessels which are in technical management by NORDEN.

All the that same period, to INTERTANKO Retention Formula from employees at sea are full-time. March 2009, which accounts for the type of termination. The new formula is as follows: An indefinite or permanent contract is a contract with an employee for full-time for an undefined period.
