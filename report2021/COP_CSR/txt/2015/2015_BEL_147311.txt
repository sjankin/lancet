Diversified around the world, order bookings reached more than eur 600 million in 2014, In 2014, we confirmed the success of the strategic developments more than 60 % of which came from emerging countries, i.e. we initiated several years ago. Dry Cooling now accounts for non-nafta and non-Western European countries. Our turnover more than 50 % of the Cooling Systems Business Unit’s of eur 606 million represented an 18 % increase on 2013. While workload. Wet Cooling also made a major contribution to ebitda in 2014 was higher than in 2013, it was still negatively the results, with a significant increase in ebitda thanks to rapid impacted by the reorganization and refocusing of the Hamon and profitable projects.

The order backlog at the end of December 2014 stood at Admittedly, new orders were down in relation to the previous almost eur 800 million, compared to eur 748 million at the year as 2013 was an exceptional year due, as mentioned earlier, end of December 2013.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANIZATION 2012 2013 2014 The need for training and ongoing skills has been highlighted Europe USA + Canada Asia-Pacific by our stakeholders (see Parameters of the csr report in the Africa & Middle East Latin America annexures). It is an important factor for our development. The challenges of Hamon’s business activities and changes in the social context (our customers’ business environment, As mentioned for the figures per bu, the figures for 2012 technological performance and environmental protection, and 2013 are not comparable to those for 2014, as three competition in our markets, etc.) mean that we must strengthen 21 1 General presentation of the Group and increase our expertise. Hamon’s staff are pivotal to our Hamon continuously seeks to improve its performance in order success. It is important to continuously increase their level of to align with its values. Even though “zero risk” is impossible, versatility and competence in each business unit. This is Hamon’s every incident or accident is one too many as it has an impact custom and it is this that gives us our added value. Training on the physical and emotional well-being of our workers. our staff is a solution to these challenges. That is why this area has received particular Group-wide attention in the past few years via, for example, an annual In addition to formal training, our employees receive daily questionnaire that every subsidiary with at least 15 employees “on-the-job” training. In the Hamon ‘multi-department’ culture must fill out (see the list of subsidiaries in the annexure Paramof work and project management, employees use their own eters of the csr report). In 2014, Hamon introduced a Group specific skills and knowledge, and also learn through other health and safety policy. Hamon also recommends that its team members.

The following graphs show the accident frequency and severity rates, along with the number of occupational diseases and Hours of training per employee per year the rate of absenteeism. 16 Note that, for these statistics, there may be differences in the calculation methods and criteria used by the different 15 countries and subsidiaries (each country has its own social and labor regulations). 14 These figures only concern staff reported as people employed 13 by the Group in 2014 (in other words, consultants and tem12 porary workers are not included). Note that the scope of consolidation in 2012 was slightly different from that in 2013 11 (a German subsidiary and a Korean factory were added in 2013); the consolidation scope in 2013 was the same as in 2014. 10 2012 2013 2014 Out of the 26 subsidiaries included in this analysis for 2014, two were not fully consolidated (Hamon Shriram Cottrell in India and Hamon D’Hondt Middle East in Saudi Arabia). We nevertheless thought it relevant to include them in the In 2014, Hamon’s staff underwent approximately 25 000 hours analysis. The other 24 subsidiaries employed 1 637 people of training, which represents an average of approximately (average headcount for 2014), in other words, 97 % of the 13 hours per year per person. There was a slight decrease in Group’s workforce. See annexure Parameters of the csr report relation to previous years. This training concerned, particularly, for more details on this subject. health and safety, the use of new it tools, the use of specific equipment, English, etc. Hamon has not implemented a global action plan at Group level in the area of health and safety; however, a number of subsidiaries do have a local action plan 3.3. HEALTH & SAFETY Hamon delivers solutions for industrial environments and Frequency rate of occupational accidents by region operates eleven factories or workshops. The risks inherent (Number of accidents / million working hours) in our business activities, although well known, are many. It is essential that this matter receives constant attention. In total, there were 41 occupational accidents in 2014, compared The health and safety of our employees in their workplaces to 25 in 2013. remains a priority, whether in factories, in our offices or on site.

However, the rate greatly declined in other regions. At Group level, the severity rate increased to 0.35 days lost per thousand hours worked. In total, 1 339 days were lost due to occupational accidents, compared with 527 in 2013. In 2014, the number of days lost to occupational diseases amounted to 319 days (factory in the north of France), compared with 397 in 2013.
