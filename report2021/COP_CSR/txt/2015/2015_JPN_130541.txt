Be the Best, Be the One Annual Report 2014 What We Aim to Be in 2019, Our Centennial Year Be the Best, Be the One Building a foundation for stable, sustainable growth over the next 50 years, 100 years, and beyond The Sumitomo Corporation Group to date has continued to grow, adapting flexibly to various changes in business environments along the way. Those business environments enveloping the Group, however, are forecast to change both dramatically and erratically as the years go by. To achieve stable, sustainable growth under these environments, a medium-to-long-term vision will be required. The Sumitomo Corporation Group has set a vision of “What We Aim to Be in 2019, Our Centennial Year” (Be the Best, Be the One) to take the initiative of building a foundation for stable, sustainable growth for the next 50 years, 100 years, and beyond. “Be the Best, Be the One 2014” (BBBO2014) medium-term management plan we are currently implementing is the first important step in making our vision of “What We Aim to Be” a reality. 238.9 215.1 211.0 200.2 160.2 155.2 Stable and Continuous 85.1 66.6 AA Plan AG Plan GG Plan FOCUS’ 10 (FY)2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Medium-term management plan Be the Best, Be the One 2014 Heading for an even higher level of profit growth by thorough enhancement of our earning power. n Basic Policy An even higher level of profit growth Aims of “Be the Best, Be the One 2014” Thorough enhancement of our earning power P8, P22 250.7 Stimulate the metabolism of our business Pursue and combine our strengths portfolio from a medium-to-long-term perspective and capabilities Consolidated 232.5 Net Income 223.1 billion yen Management base that supports earning power P18 Strengthen management Strengthen foundations Develop and deploy Maintain financial human resources abilities for business of overseas regional soundness required to investment organizations achieve our vision This medium-term management plan for fiscal 2013 and 2014 (April 2013 through March 2015) covers the first two years of our journey to achieve our vision of what we aim to be.

Kuniharu Nakamura, President and CEO Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2014 Management Strategy and Achievements 1 7 01 Aiming for Stable and Continuous Growth We will think outside the box to create completely new business models and achieve stable and continuous growth. Looking at prospects for global conditions over the longer term, the world’s population is projected to increase, driven by emerging countries in Asia and Africa. This is likely to spur rapid growth in demand for resources such as energy, food and water. In Asia, economic development will boost the wages of low-income workers, lifting many into the middle class and driving sustained expansion in emerging markets. As a result, emerging countries will account for a larger share of the global economy, leading to major changes in the global economic environment. Business models of integrated trading companies have changed drastically over the last 20 years, but in order to continue delivering stable and continuous growth under those conditions, trading companies will need to think outside the box to create completely new business models that anticipate long-term developments in global conditions and the operating environment. Sumitomo Corporation will celebrate its centennial anniversary in fiscal 2019. With this major milestone on the horizon, we have set out the Sumitomo Corporation Group’s medium-to-long-term vision in “What We Aim to Be in 2019.” By realizing this vision, we aim to lay a solid foundation for stable, continuous growth over the next 50 years, 100 years, and beyond following this centennial. What We Aim to Be in 2019, Our Centennial Year n We aim to be a corporate group that is recognized by society as meeting and exceeding the high expectations directed toward us, creating value that nobody else can match in ways befitting our distinctive identity. n We aim to build a solid earnings base and aim for an even higher level of profit growth while maintaining financial soundness.

Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2014 8 1 Management Strategy and Achievements 02 Overview of BBBO2014 and Its Initiatives We will build a foundation to achieve the even higher level of profit growth envisioned in “What We Aim to Be.” Under our current medium-term management plan, Be the Best, Be the One 2014 (BBBO2014), we have positioned fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 as a two-year period to build an operating base that will support even stronger profit growth in order to realize our vision of “What We Aim to Be.” Specifically, we are working to thoroughly enhance the Group’s earning power by “stimulating the metabolism of our business portfolio from a medium-tolong-term perspective” and by “pursuing and combining our strengths and capabilities.” To stimulate the metabolism of our business portfolio from a medium-to-long-term perspective, Sumitomo Corporation will concentrate corporate resources on • Making the existing earnings pillars even more robust, • Undertaking efforts to foster and develop new pillars of earnings for the future, and • Achieving greater value of existing investment projects in order to strengthen our earning power. At the same time, in order to secure the necessary corporate resources for the Group, we will carry out reductions and divestitures of businesses that show little potential for profit or growth, and sell or reduce assets on an ongoing basis through strategic partnerships. Stimulate the metabolism of our business portfolio “Pursuing and combining our strengths and from a medium-to-long-term perspective capabilities” has two key elements. We are actively pursuing the Group’s existing strengths Enhance existing Develop future Improve profitability of earnings pillars earnings pillars existing investments and capabilities, while also combining them inside and outside the Group in order to make Preferentially allocate Specify fields and regions Achieve greater value for the corporate resources to our that have high potential for investments made in recent the most of our integrated strengths. strong fields growth and provide support years at the company-wide level Specific initiatives include positioning Primary Fields Strategic Industrial/ unconventional energy-related business fields Regional Focus as a strategic industrial focus for development by the entire Group, with cross-company workShift corporate and human resources ing groups formulating strategies and business models and implementing new projects.

Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2014 Management Strategy and Achievements 1 9 03 Interim Evaluation of Fiscal 2013 after a Year of BBBO2014 We have steadily enhanced our earning power as envisioned in “What We Aim to Be.” P14 In fiscal 2013, the first year of BBBO2014, we reported consolidated net income of (Please refer to page 14 for details on ¥223.1 billion, lower than our initial forecast of ¥240.0 billion. Non-resource businesses Progress in BBBO2014) such as metal products and transportation & construction systems were firm, but resource businesses were hit by falling prices and we booked an impairment loss on our Australian coal mining project toward March 31, 2014, which were the main factors behind the shortfall in net income. Also, some investments, including major resource development investments, are taking longer to become profitable than we initially projected. Enhancing the value of these investments will be a key issue going forward. Basic profit, which strips out impairment losses and other extraordinary items to show the Group’s underlying earning power, rose to ¥245.0 billion, exceeding our initial forecast on the back of growth in non-resource businesses. This illustrates the steady progress we have made in enhancing our earning power, which is part of our vision of “What We Aim to Be.” Non-resource businesses reported basic profit of ¥208.4 billion, supported by solid growth among our earnings pillars. This reflected a shift in corporate resources to those earnings pillars and the results of initiatives that we are implementing with strategic partners. In fiscal 2013, investments and loans totaled ¥290.0 billion, compared with our twoyear target of ¥750.0 billion. We focused our resources on the primary fields and on the area of strategic industrial and regional focus. We also divested and reduced ¥250.0 billion in assets compared with our two-year target of ¥770.0 billion, making steady progress with our policy of “stimulating the metabolism of our business portfolio.” Trend in Basic Profit (Billions of Yen) Non-resource Business Resource Businesses 300 251.5 245.0 250.0 216.5 36.7 30.0 72.2 39.8 200 220.0 208.4 100 179.3 176.7 0 2011 2012 2013 2014 (FY) Forecast ƒ(x) BBBO2014 * Basic Profit = (Gross Profit + Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding provision for doubtful receivables) + Interest expense, net of interest income + Dividends) x (1 – Tax rate) + Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2014 10 1 Management Strategy and Achievements 04 Initiatives in Fiscal 2014, the Second Year of BBBO2014 for the ­Realization of “What We Aim to Be” We will step up efforts to “stimulate the metabolism of our business portfolio.” Sumitomo Corporation will target ¥250.0 billion in consolidated net income for fiscal 2014, the second year of BBBO2014. In resource businesses, we expect operating conditions to remain challenging amid low prices. However, in non-resource businesses, we forecast profit growth in operations that have become earnings pillars, and business investments in recent years are likely to start contributing to profits. In fiscal 2014, we will step up efforts to “stimulate the metabolism of our business portfolio from a medium-to-long-term perspective.” By achieving our targets, we will work toward creating solid foundations to realize our vision for “What We Aim to Be.” In November 2013, as part of efforts to make existing earnings pillars even more robust, the tubular products business acquired the Edgen Group, a global distributor of metal and tubular products for the energy industry. In fiscal 2014, we plan to strengthen earning power further by generating synergies between our tubular products value chain—one of the P22 Group’s strengths—and the Edgen Group. In the automotive business, we plan to ramp up (Please refer to the feature entitled Thorough Enhancement of Our Earning production at our finished vehicle manufacturing joint venture with Mazda in Mexico and Power on page 22 for details) expand our automotive components business to grow the earnings base. Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2014 Management Strategy and Achievements 1 11 Also, in order to develop future earnings pillars, we signed a comprehensive alliance agreement in the unconventional energy field in 2013 with Gas Technology Institute, one of the leading energy research organizations in the U.S. By bringing together Gas Technology Institute’s long track record in shale-related technological expertise and the technology of Japanese companies, we aim to help Japanese corporate interests move into the shalerelated industry while also using our global network and know-how to pursue multiple business opportunities. We have already received inquiries from Japanese companies, suggesting a positive outlook for new business development. In the retail field in Asia, we plan to apply our successful domestic approach to overseas markets in order to tap the voracious consumer demand of the growing middle classes in emerging countries. One example of our approach is Indonesia, where we have been operating car and motorcycle retail financing businesses since 1994. This long track record has helped us build up a vast amount of customer data that is unrivaled in the market. With the arrival of the big data era, customer data has become an extremely important resource for developing retail businesses. In addition, to expanding the retail financing operations further, we are looking to develop a wide range of retail businesses based on this customer data. Achieving greater value of existing investment projects is an issue we have been tackling since last year, but we need to step up our efforts in this area. In January 2014, we started up commercial production at the Ambatovy nickel project in Madagascar. Operating rates at the project have recently risen to 60–70% (on the basis of nickel production volume). In fiscal 2014 we will focus all our efforts on completing the project by March 2015. 05 Shareholder Returns We aim to increase dividends per share through medium to long-term profit growth. Our basic policy is to improve shareholder returns by balancing increases in corporate value with improvements to dividend payments. The Sumitomo Group has access to numerous investment opportunities worldwide. In order to realize our vision for “What We Aim to Be,” we will steadily implement our plan for new investment and loans in BBBO2014 to drive profit growth over the longer term with the aim of increasing dividends per share. Based on our targets in BBBO2014, we are targeting a consolidated dividend payout ratio of 25%, taking into account relevant factors such as the economic environment and our investment plans. We therefore expect to pay dividends per share of ¥50 in fiscal 2014 if consolidated net income reaches the planned level of ¥250.0 billion. Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2014 12 1 Management Strategy and Achievements 06 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) For the Sumitomo Corporation Group, CSR is nothing other than putting our Corporate Mission Statement into practice. P54 One of the credos of Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy, passed down for 400 years, says: (Please refer to page 54 for details on “Benefit for self and others, private and public interests are one and the same.” This means Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy/ Sumitomo Corporation Group’s that Sumitomo’s business activities must benefit not only Sumitomo’s own business, but Corporate Mission Statement) also society and the nation. The idea behind this credo represents the essence of corporate social responsibility (CSR), and has been carried on in Sumitomo Corporation Group’s Corporate Mission Statement, which includes “We aim to constantly stay a step ahead in dealing with change, create new value, and contribute broadly to society,” and “To achieve prosperity and realize dreams through sound business activities.” For the Sumitomo ­Corporation Group, CSR is nothing other than putting our Corporate Mission Statement into practice. That is, our CSR activities are planned and implemented as business strategies after considering what we should do and how we should do it as a corporation to help solve social issues through our business activities. P70 The Sumitomo Corporation Group, with its presence in a large range of industries in (Please refer to page 70 for details on countries and regions around the world, is working to obtain an accurate understanding of Towards a Better, Sustainable Society social issues and identify new needs through dialogue with stakeholders. Using this infor(CSR)) mation, we can offer proposals to resolve those issues by bringing together our unique strengths and capabilities. In other words, we have the power to create value nobody else can match by playing a useful role in society. By leveraging that power to the full extent, we can help lift the living standards of people in the countries and regions where we do business and contribute to economic, industrial and social development, while also boosting earnings and expanding our business activities based on relationships of mutual trust. This is the positive business cycle I want to create. In March 2009, the Sumitomo Corporation Group signed the UN Global Compact and declared its support for the 10 principles on human rights, labor standards, environment, and anti-corruption. Each employee of the Group will continue to respect these 10 principles, which share the same values as our Corporate Mission Statement, and adhere to our spirit and a strong sense of ethics, to be recognized by society as meeting and exceeding the high expectations directed toward us. 07 Development of Human Resources for the Sumitomo Corporation Group to Grow Human resources are an important corporate resource that we must develop to underpin our growth. P66 Human resources are one of the most important corporate resources for integrated trading (Please refer to page 66 for details on Human Resource Management) companies. We recognize that we have to nurture our workforce to support the Group’s sustained growth. We see a growing number of business opportunities in emerging countries in Asia and Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2014 Management Strategy and Achievements 1 13 Africa. To develop our business in those countries, we need talented human resources who can communicate with local people from their perspective, regardless of race, gender, age or nationality, in order to identify needs specific to those countries and regions. This information will help our Company build new business models tailored to each market. At the same time, it is vital that we cultivate human resources that understand ­Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy and are fully committed to supporting the development of local communities and raising living standards through our business activities. Those are the type of human resources we will focus on nurturing. 08 A Company Able to Grow over the Next 50 and 100 years Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy is a key strength we must pass down, stick to and practice to ensure stable and continuous growth. Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy provides a good reference point for the management approach we need to follow if we want to deliver stable and continuous growth over the next 50 or 100 years. The Sumitomo group has been in existence for 400 years. Throughout that time, members of the group have inherited the principles of Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy, firmly committed to them and put them into practice in their business activities. This has helped ­Sumitomo remain relevant to society for so long. I believe those principles are one of the Sumitomo Corporation Group’s key strengths. Every one of our employees puts Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy and Sumitomo Corporation Group’s Corporate Mission Statement into practice, working with enthusiasm, hunger and persistence to realize our vision for “What We Aim to Be.” This commitment will underpin the Group’s stable and continuous growth into the future. In the near term, it will be extremely important to implement the initiatives under BBBO2014. In fiscal 2014, the final year of BBBO2014, we will step up efforts to thoroughly enhance our earning power, with the whole Group working together to build a solid earnings base that helps us realize our vision for “What We Aim to Be.” I invite you to look forward to the initiatives of the Sumitomo Corporation Group in the period ahead.

As we head toward fiscal 2019, we envision an even higher level of profit growth. BBBO2014 is guiding our efforts to reach this goal by thoroughly enhancing our earning power. As a measure to strengthen the management base that supports our earning power, we are working to maintain financial soundness and strengthen management abilities on business investment. Maintain Financial Soundness In recent years, a tumultuous financial environment has become the rule rather than the exception, as Maintain financial soundness evidenced by the financial crisis precipitated by the Control the balance sheet so that it is not overly Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, the European debt reliant on interest-bearing liabilities crisis and other events. Consequently, financial institutions are facing an increasingly strict regulatory environment. In this financial landscape, it is imperative that we control our balance sheet so that it is not overly reliant on interest-bearing liabilities.

First, we must enhance our earnings base by improving asset efficiency. Second, we must secure the financial capacity for investment by improving our capacity to generate cash. 1. Enhance the Earnings Base (Stimulate the Metabolism of our Business Portfolio) Under BBBO2014, we are working to stimulate the metabolism of our business portfolio from a mediumto-long term perspective in order to thoroughly enhance our earning power. This will entail making effective use of limited corporate resources in conjunction with adding ROA to our quantitative targets. We will continue to replace assets in our portfolio by shifting from businesses that show little potential for profit or growth to businesses which we have strengths in and that are to remain our earnings pillars in the future, and businesses that have prospects for growth over the medium to long term and that are to be fostered and developed as our new earnings pillars in the future. At the same time, we will steadily raise the value of the projects we have invested in. In certain cases, we may expect to drive higher growth by harnessing the knowledge and expertise of other companies, rather than conducting businesses independently. Here, we will expand our business by forming alliances with strategic partners, while properly managing the balance sheet.

StrengthRisk Management ening our business investment management abilities is a crucial priority for ensuring that we raise the value of these investments and have them contribute to earnings. Under BBBO2014, we have reinforced our system to ensure that Business Units and Corporate Group collaborate and follow up on large business investments, in addition to implementing preexisting investment risk management* approaches. We form project teams for each project and have a system in place to provide integrated support ranging from the stages of studying the feasibility of Pre-existing Measures Maintain and Strengthen a Diversified Business Portfolio Assets that are concentrated in a specific field or region are exposed to the risk of tremendous loss that could be incurred due to changes in the business environment or the materialization of country risk in the host country of an investment project. While working to efficiently allocate limited corporate resources, we believe that avoiding any over-concentration of business portfolio assets is crucial to ensuring the stability of our business. Guided by this belief, we have been working to build a diversified portfolio in the course of expanding businesses in many different fields and regions. In terms of business fields, we have been bolstering non-resources fields in a well-balanced manner without overly relying on profits from resource fields, and by region, we have been maintaining balanced earnings streams from Japan, developed countries and emerging countries, thereby building a diverse earnings structure. Under BBBO2014, there has been no change to this policy. We will continue to maintain a diversified business portfolio as we strive to expand our earnings base.

We also have a system in place where the Loan and Investment Committee takes the lead in intensively monitoring and exploring the necessary countermeasures with respect to projects that need to be addressed in some way or another, due to changes in the operating environment and other factors. Considering our experience with business investments in the past, we are also systematically organizing a range of issues and solutions across the entire process related to business investment, in an effort to enhance the quality of the overall business investment process and enhance investment performance throughout the Company. Keep a Balance between Risk-adjusted Assets and the Risk Buffer We introduced risk-adjusted return management* as a fundamental principle of management in 1998. Guided by this principle, we strive to keep a balance between risk-adjusted assets which are our maximum possible loss and the risk buffer which is our shareholders’ equity. This prinP65 *Please refer to page 65 for details on ciple means that even if all potential risks were to actually occur at once, shareholders’ equity Risk-adjusted Return Management would be able to absorb the losses and keep the Company in business. Our risk-adjusted assets have been on an upward trend, reflecting the increasing innovation of our business models, as exemplified by our participation in resource and energy development projects and the manufacturing sector. We have been properly controlling the level of riskadjusted assets along with increasing our risk buffer by accumulating profit for the year. As a result, we have kept a balance between risk-adjusted assets and our risk buffer.

In emerging countries centered on Asia, demand is set to rise sharply on the back of 140,000 population growth and rising incomes, while demand in advanced countries is likely to 150,000 The market in emerging countries is forecast to more than double remain stable, supported mainly by replacement demand. Global vehicle sales are projected to rise from around 85 million vehicles in 2013 to 100,000 roughly 140 million in 2030, driven by growing demand in emerging countries. At the same 85,000 time, the center of the automobile market is poised to shift from advanced countries to emerging countries, which will account for an estimated 70% of global sales. 50,000 Optimized Local Manufacturing in the Automotive Industry As transport in emerging countries shifts to the automobile, consumers in those markets will 0 ’05 ’10 ’13 ’15 ’20 ’25 ’30 mainly want low-priced models that also have generous equipment levels. That means autoEmerging countries Advanced countries makers will need to reduce costs and boost efficiency even further to generate profits, not Source: Data from various statistics compiled by SC-ABeam just increase output to satisfy growing demand. Automotive Consulting. Data from 2015 onward are forecasts. Japanese automakers in particular need to make improvements to their operating structures, which are overly dependent on domestic production, making them vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. Some companies have already made progress with building an optimum manufacturing framework by shifting production to low-cost locations close to consumer markets. Automobile Production Volume by Region (2013) Europe: China: North America: 16,310 22,120 Japan: 13,430 thousand thousand thousand 9,550 thousand Latin America: Asia and Oceania: 7,380 13,330 thousand thousand Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2014 Management Strategy and Achievements 1 23 Business Automakers are increasingly choosing Thailand that has growing clusters of auto parts makers as a base to supply other markets in Asia; and Mexico and other countries that have free trade agreements (FTA) and economic partnership agreements (EPA) with a large number of partner nations and offer significant benefits for automakers exporting to the U.S. and Europe. 02 Track Record of Growth to Sumitomo Corporation’s Automotive Business Business Model Evolution Business Model Transformation Sumitomo Corporation’s automotive business has been operating for around 60 years, and Three Key Areas of the Autostarting out in the 1950s as an exporter of buses to Myanmar. Through its vehicle trading motive Business operations, which were the starting point for the business, the automotive business has had access to market information in Japan and overseas and been able to identify automaker needs early on. As a result, we have been able to respond to changes in the business enviManufacturing ronment while operating a wide range of businesses in the automotive sector, from upstream • Parts manufacturing areas (manufacturing businesses) through to downstream areas (automotive leasing and • Finished vehicle manufacturing retail financing businesses). In upstream areas, our role in trading automotive manufacturing equipment and materials and automotive components, including with European, U.S. and other automakers, opened up more business opportunities in areas related to vehicle manufacturing when Japanese automakers began actively shifting production overseas from the 1980s. This led to our direct involvement in manufacturing operations in support of automakers’ manufacturing activities. Today, our automotive business stands out for its extensive involvement in manufacturing, operating numerous sites around the world from parts manufacturing right through to vehicle assembly. Sales and distribution In midstream areas, we moved into the vehicle distribution market through the establishment of a joint-venture sales company in the U.S. with an automaker in the 1970s, aiming to • Finished vehicle export provide support to Japanese automakers that wanted to develop overseas markets. These • Finished vehicle import sales vehicle distribution operations, which include vehicle trading, remain an important earnings pillar of the automotive business. In downstream areas, we have built a presence in auto sales financing as part of efforts to build closer links with consumers in our retail operations. These financing operations are focused on Thailand, Indonesia and other markets in Asia where Japanese automakers have a strong position. These operations, together with our domestic auto leasing business, launched in 1980 have become a significant earnings pillar. 03 Lease and retail finance • Automobile lease Expanding the Three Key Areas in Scope • Retail finance Responding to changes in the operating environment, we have expanded our capabilities in a wide range of areas across the automotive industry. Going forward, we plan to channel corporate resources into promising growth businesses in three key areas—­manufacturing, sales and distribution, and leasing and retail financing—in order to further expand and develop the automotive business. Sumitomo Corporation Annual Report 2014 24 1 Management Strategy and Achievements Feature: Thorough Enhancement of Our Earning Power Expansion in Scope of the Automotive Business to Enhance an Earnings Pillar Major Initiatives and Achievements of the Three Key Business Areas under BBBO2014 1) Manufacturing Business Area Reinforcing overseas manufacturing operations, focusing on emerging ­countries, amid growing demand for cars As automakers shifted production overseas, we have expanded production capacity at KIRIU Corporation, a specialist brake disc and drum maker that is an earnings pillar in our manufacturing operations. In response to growing demand in Asia, we boosted output in India in 2012 and in Thailand in 2013. Also, as part of ongoing efforts to expand our operations overseas, we plan to install extra capacity at the company’s site in Mexico in 2014 amid strong demand from North America. We are taking other steps to strengthen our manufacturing framework in Mexico, including a decision in 2014 to invest in the local operations of Hiroshima Aluminum Industry Co., Ltd., which has a strong presence in large casted aluminum components such as engine parts. In vehicle manufacturing, Mazda de Mexico Vehicle Operation (MMVO), our local joint venture with Mazda, began full-scale operations in January 2014 with start of mass production of assembled automobiles for shipment to North America. Looking ahead, we plan to increase exports to Latin America and Europe and expand the range of vehicle models that we can assemble, including Toyota’s compact models. In Mexico, we are generating synergies across our automotive-related operations, with MMVO sourcing components from a number of our local affiliates as part of its vehicle manufacturing process. KIRIU Corporation and Hiroshima Aluminum Industry Co., Ltd. both supply MMVO with parts made at their Mexico sites, while HIROTEC MEXICO S.A. de C.V., a joint venture with HIROTEC Corporation, supplies vehicle body panels and exhaust systems. MMVO also uses steel materials supplied by our steel service center.

We have a presence in countries such as Turkey, the Ukraine and Nigeria, giving us extensive experience in managing country-specific business risks in overseas markets. Leveraging the knowledge, expertise and risk management capabilities we have built up through a long association with those countries, we will work to expand our vehicle sales and distribution business in emerging countries with growth potential. In 2013, we established service stations in Iraq and Myanmar to provide vehicle maintenance and repair services as part of Human resource training program in Libya efforts to strengthen servicing operations in tandem with vehicle sales. Our involvement in these markets is not just about business. We also seek to contribute to their societies. Libya is one example of our approach. Since starting vehicle distribution there in 2010, we have run a human resource training program for young Libyans at our repair facilities. We will do our part to build a new Libya by offering much more than human resource training to young Libyans, who are key to the country’s future. 3) Leasing and Retail Finance Business Area Expanding the earnings base by developing the auto leasing business overseas and diversifying the retail financing business In the auto leasing business Sumitomo Mitsui Auto Service Co., Ltd. owns and manages a fleet of around 570,000 vehicles, making it one of the leading companies in the auto leasing sector. Faced with a mature domestic market, the company is working to strengthen its earnings base by expanding operations overseas. This company moved into the Thai market in 2003, followed by Australia in 2013. To meet auto leasing needs worldwide, we plan to extend our reach into the Asia–Pacific region and other promising overseas markets with growth potential. Billboard advertising and call center of In Indonesia, P.T. Oto Multiartha (OTO) and P.T. Summit Oto Finance (SOF) provide loans OTO and SOF for cars and motorcycles, respectively, driving growth in our automotive retail financing business. Both companies have branches across Indonesia, and their extensive networks and funding abilities are supporting growth in the number of loan contracts. Automotive retail financing operations in Indonesia are now a major earnings pillar for the automotive business. Sumitomo C ­ orporation has been involved in automotive retail financing in Indonesia since 1996, before the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The country later faced several other economic crises, but we continued to provide reliable services despite the turmoil, helping us to build strong relationships with car dealers.

While demand for forest resources is growing worldwide, including in the fastgrowing economies of Asia, we are building a global sales network that mainly sources timber from the Pacific Rim region. As part of those efforts, we acquired 36,000 hectares of forest in New Zealand. Timber businesses need to work in harmony with the natural environment to ensure long-term timber supplies. We have established a sustainable business model that will ensure the forest is constantly renewed through carefully planned logging and replanting operations. Our forest in New Zealand is certified by Wild horses can be seen in our forests the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®), a global certification body for forests and forest products.

Amid rising demand for mineral resources and energy on the back of global population growth and economic expansion, mainly in emerging countries, we expect the development of technologically challenging deep-sea oil fields and U.S.-led development of shale oil and gas resources to gain momentum. Meanwhile, changing lifestyles in emerging countries are likely to drive qualitative and quantitative growth in demand for food resources. In order to meet this demand, agricultural production will need to become more efficient, especially due to concerns about the impact of climate change caused by global warming on agricultural yields.
