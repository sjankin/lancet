Chaivo and Odoptu fields are developed using modern technologies and project management methods. New record was attained during drilling with Yastreb rig when the longest horizontal well in the world totaling 13 thousand meters was drilled and commissioned. The first producing well was drilled from Berkut platform in Arkutun-Dagi field. In June 2014, Berkut platform topside was successfully put on the gravity base structure in Arkutun-Dagi field. The installation set a world record in the total weight of the integrated topside assembled with a float-over installation method at sea. The drilling of the first producing well from Berkut platform started in October 2014, with the first oil produced in January 2015. At Berkut platform, for the first time in the world, the earthquake protection system that allows to sustain the earthquake with a magnitude of 9 points without performance impairment was installed. The platform sustains low temperatures (to a maximum of -44°C),withstands wave exceeding 18 meters and ice loads from two meter thick ice. Integrated drilling system on the platform essentially eliminates manual work. All operations on the platform are supported by the autonomous power system that comprises four 60 MW gas-turbine units operating on associated petroleum gas separated on platform with possibility of simultaneous use of diesel fuel if required. There is a backup system comprising three diesel generators with 13 a total capacity of 5.4 MW supporting the autonomous operation of the platform.
