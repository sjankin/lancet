Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. A Risk Management policy is set so as to limit the net financial liabilities to a pre-approved amount. The Group maintains the net financial liabilities to these specified upper limits and any deviation to these upper limits requires prior approvals. The Group held the following short-term financial liabilities as of 31 March 2014 ; Liability Maturity Amount Rs. ‘ 000 Short-term loan (Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC) 10-Apr-14 50,000 Short-term loan (Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC) 25-Apr-14 120,000 Short-term loan (Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC) 17-Apr-14 70,000 Short-term loan (Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC) 25-Apr-14 50,000 Short-term loan (Hatton National Bank PLC) 6-Apr-14 10,000 Total Overdrafts 15,930 Total Liability 315,930 The group has total cash and cash equivalents amounting to Rs. 377Mn as of 31 March 2014. 3. Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 3.1 Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on cash deposits and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency (Sri Lankan Rupee) of the Group, which are in general, US Dollar, Australian Dollar, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen. Effects of currency rate fluctuations of imported materials and ex-stock items are transferred in a reasonable manner keeping in line with the prices in the market. Subsidiary companies of the Group settle all import bills and other financial liabilities denominated in a currency other than functional currency, out of US Dollar receipts from their overseas customers. Due to the above reasons, the Group does not have a material impact from import and export activities, from changes in the exchange rates. On this basis, the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in United State Dollars exchange rates on foreign exchange deposits and borrowings with all other variables held constant.
