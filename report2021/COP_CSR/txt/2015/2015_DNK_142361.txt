In our annual report we have summarized the progress we have made in the areas of the 10 principles. We will continue our work in these areas and will report on the progress in our future reports.’ Anders Byriel, CEO Kvadrat 1 Policy We aim to maintain a good balance between our strict quality standards, environmental concerns, social responsibility and our economy. We focus on ensuring that all our products and processes live up to these standards. In a number of areas, we go beyond existing legislation while respecting necessary functional requirements. We also ensure that a number of our products comply with the relevant EU Ecolabel criteria. We apply strict standards to our suppliers, which are focused on our demands, for doing a high quality production of our exclusive products, the environmental impact of production and services and we also require that they offer a healthy working environment. All suppliers must commit to and sign our Company Social Responsibility. Furthermore, we expect them to regularly document how they are meeting our requirements. The standards we adhere to provide us with a framework for continually reducing the environmental impact of our production and internal processes, minimising the unnecessary use of raw materials, and creating a secure and healthy environment for employees. We aim, in all matters within our control, to support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and labour rights. We are strongly opposed to any kind of corruption, including extortion and bribery. Finally, we ensure that our management systems are efficiently implemented and are capable of supporting our organisation. 2 Introduction Kvadrat was established in Denmark in 1968. Kvadrat A/S, the head quarter is located in Ebeltoft. The company is owned and managed by the Rasmussen and Byriel families. The second generation of both families took over in July 2000. At Kvadrat we continuously seek to push the aesthetic, artistic and technological boundaries of textile design. We create high quality products that help architects to shape architectural spaces, designers and furniture manufacturers to produce and craft furniture, and consumers to bring tactility and colour in their private homes. This is our way to contribute to contemporary design culture. The Kvadrat collection is comprised of upholstery, curtains, acoustic panels, rugs and textile tiles. It includes: Over 150 designs and 3,500 colours. Numerous materials, such as wool, silk, linen, Trevira CS and cotton. A very wide choice of styles and constructions. Our products reflect our commitment to colour, pioneering, technological innovation and experimentation in design. Respect for both environment and people have been a key value for Kvadrat from the very beginning. Health certified since 2008. Environmentally certified ISO14001 since 1997, we evaluate the environmental impact of all our products. We use the latest technology to enhance the quality of our products and reduce their impact on the environment. Many of our textiles are awarded according to the EU Ecolabel. Products are only awarded after the product’s complete life cycle has been evaluated and confirmed to be among the best on the market in its category. EU Ecolabel is the European Eco-label system. We work with the Greenguard certification for many of our textiles. Greenguard certification is focused on improving indoor air quality using products in the b uilding with low emission to air. We are working with the GaBi database for Life Cycle Assessment on our textiles. Both as an internal tool and also providing data for our customers. Kvadrat uses specialised textile mills and print-works in Western Europe and Japan. Networking and specialisation ensure that Kvadrat helps to set standards for the industry. 3 Below, in table A, you find our focus areas in accordance with the 10 principles in the UN Global Compact and also the outcomes for the last two years: Focus Outcomes 2013 Outcomes 2014 People We must collect ideas and We visited both NOVO Implemented in some of our and inspiration as to how to Nordic and Nordea Liv health work in our subsidiaries health extend our health work to og Pension to learn from our subsidiaries them and to be inspired with new ideas Focus on health We arranged an event for All employees in our head and food for our employees all employees about fish quarter was offered a health and food and how this will check.

Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4 the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5 the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6 the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery 5 Progress The majority of our suppliers are located in Western Europe, with the largest supplier in England and one supplier located in Japan. We conclude that we do not operate in high risk countries and as a result, human rights, labour rights and the fight against corruption are covered by local laws and regulations. To make sure that suppliers show responsibility and for intent to become action, we have developed a set of guidelines, our Company Social Responsibility including our attitude against corruption. Our Company Social Responsibility is based on internationally recognized principles. All suppliers must accept, comply and sign up to this. We always, as a minimum, fulfil Danish legislation concerning human and labour rights. The guidelines in our Company Social Responsibility are not least about human rights. We oppose the violation of internationally proclaimed human rights and we will oblige both ourselves and our suppliers, to comply with local laws and standards. Furthermore the guidelines include numerous requirements for workers rights. Our Company Social Responsibility must also ensure that both we and our suppliers act responsibly in relation to the work environment. Finally, the guidelines commit the suppliers to discourage all forms of corruption. 6 Further actions We always support our customers and share experiences concerning social responsibility, to ensure that we are looking into all the elements in the supply chain. We work with students from different educational institutions and offer them the possibility to write their final projects using Kvadrat as the case. We are supporting the initiative against cancer – ‘Stafet for livet’. Once a year in Denmark it is arranged that people support this initiative. ‘Stafet for Livet’ is a day (24 hours) where we focus on the fight against cancer, fight together and celebrating life. It is an occasion to remember those who lost the battle against cancer and give hope to those who are struggling. ‘Stafet for Livet’ is community awareness and fundraising in the fight against cancer. We support, with our textiles, the socio-economic project – Place de Bleu. Place de Bleu is a social-economic enterprise that produces and sells exclusive design products. They offer employment to women with different ethnic backgrounds than Danish. The vision is to create jobs in alternative conditions of marginalized groups contribute to a more inclusive labour market and test business models for social economy enterprises. Every day we serve lunch for our employees. As much as possible of our daily lunch are organic produce. Our employees are offered free fruit every day. Our employees are offered massage for a low fee given financial support of the arrangement by Kvadrat to reduce physical health problems. Besides the national health insurance, Kvadrat are financing a private health insurance for our employees which cover further types of illness. 7 Environment We work actively to improve our environmental performance in relation to the 3 principles in the UN Global Compact. Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 8 Progress We are focusing on different environmental topics. We have for many years been focusing on both internal projects, external projects involving our suppliers, and projects concerning reduction of the environmental impacts from our textiles. Our suppliers are obliged to comply with local laws and standards related to environmental issues. Our suppliers must commit to proactively take necessary precautions and take necessary initiatives to reduce the environmental impacts of their activities. We are working with our suppliers to make our processes transparent to make it easier for customers to find product details. 9 Prioritisation of effort Working towards sustainability targets, a self-assessment was performed in 2013 according to the 10 principles in the UN Global Compact. All areas within the ‘Human rights’, ‘Labour rights’ and ‘ Anti-corruption’ were assessed as ‘good performance’. They are all covered by our Company Social Responsibility and by legislation. We work in ‘low risk countries’ and both we and our suppliers all have to fulfil the same laws for areas mentioned above, therefore we have not issued further targets for these areas.

It is a natural part of our business to incorporate environmental topics in our daily life. Environmental concerns are part of all our processes from developing a new textile until it is not usable anymore. As a result we always set up environmental demands that our suppliers must fulfil. We have, for many years now, been focusing on the EU Ecolabel certification for our textiles. Fulfilment of the demands in the EU Ecolabel is a natural part of our business and all our bestselling textiles are awarded with the EU Ecolabel. We have now been working with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for 2-3 years and in 2014 we updated our LCA database with data for new materials and already excisting materials were updated if new data was available. Together with our suppliers we are working on mapping our textiles for all substances used for production. This will help to make the processes transparent for Kvadrat and our customers. In 2014 we also visited farmers in Australia and New Zealand, where our wool comes from. This gave us valuable insight in the production of wool, and a possibility to trace our important raw material back to the starting point. Scarcity of resources is and will be an important issue in the future. Kvadrat is in the process of finding possibilities to use waste materials from textile production for manufacturing of other products to be able to up-cycle this waste material. LAUNCH Nordic is still part of our focus area. This initiative look into subjects both locally and globally and is an opportunity to collaborate with global partners on global topics also of importance for our organisation. We are buying only ‘green energy’ for our house in Ebeltoft, electricity from new Danish windmills less than 2 yeas old. The heating comes from the local heating plant using wood bricks as fuel. Both sources considered as CO2 neutral. Our CTS system now helps us reducing our consumption of energy and heat. 11 Summary Our aim is to improve our work around the 10 principles in the UN Global Compact. We continue to set new targets for the focus areas and work closely with our partners. We have, in 2014 reached our goals and will continue to work with important focus areas. 12
