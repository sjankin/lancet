Box 70 340 safety and convenience SE-107 23 Stockholm Sweden Visiting address: Klarabergsviadukten 90 Telephone +46 (0) 8 506 485 00 www.assaabloy.com Fax +46 (0) 8 506 485 85 Reduced energy losses and improved privacy and security at Stockholm Arlanda Airport An automatic sliding door from ASSA ABLOY is saving energy costs, improving the indoor environment and enhancing comfort, privacy and safety for VIPs traveling through Stockholm’s main airport. CHALLENGE: The VIP entrance to Stockholm’s Arlanda Airport provides direct access to security screening for government officials, heads-of-state and other high-profile visitors traveling from Sweden’s capital city. It requires a secure, well-insulated automatic entrance that opens and closes quickly and seals completely to preserve both the privacy and comfort of VIP travelers as they go through the security screening process. The secure nature of the access point to the airport further dictates that this door must be fully operational 100 percent of the time. SOLUTION: ASSA ABLOY supplied a Besam Slim Thermo sliding door with insulated glass and TightSeal features to limit both cold and warm air infiltration. The automatic door is equipped with an intelligent ASSA ABLOY ECO radar that senses which direction pedestrians are moving and consequently only activates the door when someone is entering the building and not just passing by. The directional sensor also closes the door quickly once the traveler is safely inside. ASSA ABLOY Entrance Systems is providing regular maintenance to ensure that the Besam Slim Thermo operates reliably and efficiently around-the-clock. Sustainability Report RESULT: According to ASSA ABLOY Entrance Systems’ 2014 energy savings calculation tool for pedestrian doors, The global leader in door opening solutions Stockholm Arlanda Airport will see a 40 percent reduction in average energy costs from the combination of insulated glass and TightSeal features in the Besam Slim Thermo. Further savings can be anticipated from the ASSA ABLOY ECO radar, which closes the door 30 percent earlier than traditional radar, thus reducing heating and cooling losses when the door is open. An additional benefit is that, on average, ASSA ABLOY ECO radar cuts the number of door openings in half compared with conventional bi-directional radar, which can produce “phantom openings” when someone passing An automatic sliding door from ASSA ABLOY is saving energy costs, improving the indoor environment and enhancing comfort, privacy by the entrance accidently enters the activation field. and safety for VIPs traveling through Stockholm’s main airport.
