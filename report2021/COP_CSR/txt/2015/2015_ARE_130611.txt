STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) To our stakeholders, It is with pleasure that I reaffirm Automotive Management Services’ continued commitment to support the principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and AntiCorruption. As a world leader in Fleet Management Solutions, AMS supports and respects the protection of human rights within the Company’s sphere of influence. We endeavour to conduct our business operations accordingly, with emphasis on standing against the exploitation of children and human trafficking. In attaining our commercial objectives and fulfilling our corporate responsibilities, integrity is crucial. It preserves our license to operate and is an essential asset which we are dedicated to protect and strengthen. We therefore expect every AMS employee to uphold high professional and ethical standards in all business conduct. In this annual Communication on Progress, we will outline ways in which we continuously support the Ten Principles. Yours sincerely, Martin Rasmussen President and Chief Executive Officer Automotive Management Services Page 3 of 10 AMS UNGC Communication on Progress 2. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES 2.1. CORPORATE POLICY AND GOALS AMS operates on a global scale in austere environments. We consider human rights an element of our duty of care to our employees and as such, human rights are taken into consideration in every aspect of our business. Our approach towards human rights is aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles for Human Rights. AMS issues all employees with an Employee Handbook, and all company policies are available in both soft and hard copy at every AMS location. These policies include but are not limited to: Policy on Human Trafficking, Adequate Employee Living Conditions, Withholding Passports and other identification documents, Disciplinary Policy, Grievance Policy, Anti-Harassment Policy, Leave Policies, Whistleblowing Policy, Health and Safety Policy, Drug-Free Workplace Statement and Travel Policy. 2.1.1. RISK ASSESSMENT As with previous COP’s, AMS has used Maplecroft’s Human Rights Risk Atlas to assess the human rights risks within our areas of operation. The table below outlines our countries of operation as well as their associated risk ratings: Country of Operation Human Rights Risk Rating Afghanistan Extreme Somalia Extreme United Arab Emirates High Uganda High Liberia High Kazakhstan High USA Medium United Kingdom Low Australia Low As seen above, the bulk of our operations and human capital are based in countries associated with a high to extreme human rights related risk. This magnifies the importance of a corporate commitment towards Human Rights and the potential impact that this commitment may have on the countries of operation. 2.1.2. GOALS AMS aims to initiate the following initiatives to continue our progress in relation to the promotion of fundamental human rights among our employees:  HIV awareness training of all employees  Cultural Awareness through enhanced country specific pre-deployment packs  Technical Training across all AMS locations 2.2. IMPLEMENTATION AMS has taken the following practical measures to avert human rights violations in our work locations: RIGHT TO LIFE AND HEALTH  Ebola disease prevention program within our operations located in Ebola high risk areas such as Liberia  Inform employees of health risks associated with deploying to post-conflict countries and secure written confirmation of voluntary deployment thereto  Provision of employee insurance benefits and security which is adequate to protect all staff from health and safety risks associated with post-conflict countries  Provide awareness to employees regarding emergency preparedness and response Page 4 of 10 AMS UNGC Communication on Progress  Assess fitness to deploy and work in austere environments through pre-employment medical testing, self-declarations and signed GP Questionnaires  Have on site cooks who ensure a well-balanced diet is followed by all staff deployed to remote areas where food supply is limited  Perform random alcohol and drug tests to ensure a safe working environment  Ensure adequate First Aid arrangements on all AMS sites  Educate staff on HSE practice to ensure safe working environment RIGHT TO JUST AND FAVOURABLE WORKING CONDITIONS  Continued dedication to UNGC commitment and awareness training for all new staff members  Formal mechanisms and controls for grievance and disciplinary formalities through corporate policies  Promotion of safe psychological working environment through the implementation of Anti-Harassment, Anti-Bullying and Anti-Victimization Policy  The provision of company provided recreational facilities for staff on major operational sites  Enforced Rest and Recreation leave when they are deployed to post-conflict countries for more than 6 months at the time RIGHT TO EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT  Contribute to local capacity building thereby ensuring development of local skillsets within the countries we operate  Personal development through basic English Training  On the job skills development through Maintenance Training for employees employed into technical positions FREEDOM OF THOUGHT, RELIGION AND CULTURE  AMS recruits using the Honour reasonable religion related requirements and activities  Make Employment Contracts available in native languages where a language barrier might significantly limit the understanding thereof  Cultural awareness training as part of the induction program for all new staff members specifically related to the country they will be working in RIGHT TO WORK / LIFE BALANCE  AMS offers employment terms which allow an extended period of annual leave between deployment periods. This enables staff to spend more time with family members and averts burn out situations  The Company continues to investment in information technology enhancements in remote locations; thereby encouraging communication between staff and their family members The initiative to promote and respect human rights is the responsibility of each and every staff member. The management of programs and policies supporting this is the Human Resources Department and is endorsed by Executive Management and the Chief Executive Officer. 2.3. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES The AMS Compliance and Business Process Departments continue to conduct regular audits throughout the organization to ensure compliance with policy and ensures that AMS business practice respects and promotes fundamental human rights. Violations detected via audits are addressed appropriately. The reporting year can be closed with no outstanding corrective actions. Page 5 of 10 AMS UNGC Communication on Progress 3. LABOUR PRINCIPLES 3.1. CORPORATE POLICY AND GOALS AMS respects and supports the values of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We show our commitment by integrating its four fundamental principles into our corporate Human Rights building blocks (section 2.1.) and standard business practice on a global scale. These four fundamental principles are aligned with the United Nations Global Compact principles on Labour. AMS issues all employees with an Employee Handbook as well as corporate policies which are aimed at promoting, respecting and realizing the ILO Four Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These policies include but are not limited to: Policy on Human Trafficking, Adequate Employee Living Conditions, Withholding Passports and other identification documents, Disciplinary Policy, Grievance Policy, Anti-Harassment Policy, Leave Policies, Health and Safety Policy, Drug-Free Workplace Statement and Travel Policy. 3.1.1. RISK ASSESSMENT The Human Rights related risks assessed in 2.1.1. emphasize that the majority of our operations and human capital are exposed to countries where human and labour rights related risks fall within the categories of high to extreme. Whilst it is clear that AMS largely operates in areas recognised for their lack of labour principles and basic human rights, the Company rigorously promotes the adherence to an international standard of human and labour rights. In our business practice we commit to abide to our own policies and/or local legislation whichever sets the highest standards 3.1.2. GOALS AMS aims to initiate the following additional initiatives to continue our progress on the enactment and promotion of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work:  Introduce formal policy for handling employees leaving the company; which will include prescribed exit interviews  Review of salary structure at each project site ensuring alignment of benefits and compensation  On-going Management/Supervisory training to ensure fair and equal opportunity, development and management 3.2. IMPLEMENTATION In support of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, AMS has taken the following measures to prevent human and labour rights violations in our work locations: RIGHT TO STRIKES, TRADE UNIONS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING  AMS will engage with relevant Unions  Where applicable, and with input from both the Union Representatives and employees, formalized Collective Bargaining Agreements will be formally discussed and renewed. FREEDOM FROM TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS  Continue to include Combatting Trafficking in Persons awareness program as part of induction programs for all staff members  Roll out of completed Whistle-blower Policy to ensure all employees are protected if they witness illegal actions Page 6 of 10 AMS UNGC Communication on Progress PROTECTION OF CHILDREN  Formal mechanism for age verification in the recruitment procedures  Formal corporate policy that child labour is not accepted in the AMS organization RIGHT TO EQUALITY, REMEDY AND FREEDOM FROM DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT  Continued delivery of our formal Anti-Harassment, Anti-Bullying and Anti-Victimization Policy to ensure equal and ethical treatment of all staff members  Focus on training and promotion of local nationals in austere environments  Recruitment and Selection Policy to ensure non-discriminatory hiring practices for all candidates  Formal Grievance Procedure and Policy for all staff members The initiative to promote and respect human and labour rights supported by the ILO Declaration is the responsibility of each and every staff member. The management supports this however the final responsibility lies with the Human Resources Department and is endorsed by Executive Management and the Chief Executive Officer. 3.3. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES The AMS Compliance Department and Business Process Department conduct regular audits throughout the organization to ensure compliance with policies and to confirm that business practice respects and promotes fundamental human rights. Violations detected through these audits were minimal and addressed appropriately. The 2014 reporting year was closed with no outstanding corrective actions. 4. ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES 4.1. CORPORATE POLICY AND GOALS The nature of many of the countries in which AMS operates is such that they have been seriously impacted by years of insecurity and poverty. Most have ill-defined regulations and codes in relation to environmental protection. AMS is committed to meet international standards on environmental and sustainability issues and therefore holds up its status of being a signatory to the UN Global Compact. We recognize the significance of improving environmental and sustainability awareness and will continue to make further commitments and actions to improve and meet clearly defined targets. Current AMS policies and procedures focus on Quality Control and Health and Safety. We provide safe working environments for our employees, sub-contractors and customers, and deliver a very high level of service. Through the provision of clear quality control procedures, underpinned by the principles of ISO 9001 Certification, we reduce risk in our operations and eradicate environmental hazard, thereby reducing environmental impact through preventative measures. 4.1.1. GOALS We acknowledge that positive environmental impacts cannot only be a consequence of existing procedures and that sustainability changes in the organization should be driven. It is with this goal in mind that AMS will focus on the following initiatives:  Achieve ISO18000 certification by the end of 2015  Provide training for all employees on the ISO18000 criteria  Educate the local communities on environmental areas where they can make a difference Page 7 of 10 AMS UNGC Communication on Progress 4.2. IMPLEMENTATION EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY AMS strives to provide the best possible living conditions within the environment for our employees, to include good sanitation for ensuring the hygiene and health of our employees are protected. The Company observes the World Bank Standards of Health and Safety regulations for accommodation, food, life support areas, and waste management, and continuously strive to improve these to secure the well-being of our employees. HAZMAT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL PLAN Whilst AMS will try as much as possible to limit the use of hazardous materials in our operations, and to choose non-hazardous and non-polluting alternatives wherever possible, we also acknowledge that it is not possible to completely avoid using hazardous materials when performing automotive repairs and services. AMS has a comprehensive HAZMAT Policy and Procedure in place to cover all aspects of hazardous goods handling in our operations. Training our employees to identify and handle HAZMAT as part of their job is a mandatory part of the induction process, and there are ongoing annual refresher trainings as part of the HSE training program. The use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are mandatory, and all hazardous substances are properly labelled with colour coded MSDS labels, and segregated from other products in isolated protected lockable areas. All HAZMAT is stored in approved drums and containers, free from rust and bulging, and protected from severe heat and / or cold. HAZMAT storage areas are well-ventilated and have concrete floors to reduce the risk of spills and potential seepage into the ground. Whilst these preventative procedures are in place, occasional spills do occur and AMS has an effective spill response process in place whereby contaminated hazardous waste resulting from spills will be contained and as a minimum, disposed of in accordance with local regulations. The initiative to protect our environment is the responsibility of each and every staff member however the final responsibility lies with the Compliance Department and is endorsed by Executive Management and the Chief Executive Officer. 4.3. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES AMS uses a rigorous Quality Control Plan and Compliance Assurance Program to monitor and maintain standards and performance in environmental safety and protection and the reporting year can be closed with no outstanding corrective actions. THE QUALITY CONTROL PLAN The Quality Control Plan is built around the inclusive participation of our workforce, and uses the principles of ISO 9001, to implement processes and procedures to measure and hold people accountable for their continuous improvement. AMS continues to use its in-house application called Tools and Assets Management System (TAMS), which tracks and reports areas of non-conformity, corrective action steps, and responsibility. TAMS has modules covering facilities, health and safety, first aid and asset management, and includes incident reporting functionality. The AMS incident reporting procedure has recently been improved and expanded to cover all incidents across the organization from minor vehicle accidents to serious environmental or security situations. The new procedure includes a rigorous decision making escalation process, and investigation follow up to ensure corrective measures are identified and implemented. COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE PROGRAM The Compliance Assurance Program supports the Quality Control Plan, and is controlled by a team of internal Compliance Managers. This structured program ensures that AMS maintains effective compliance to our contractual obligations, including health and safety and environmental commitments, as well as compliance to local and international standards. Compliance audits are carried out according to a structured calendar across Page 8 of 10 AMS UNGC Communication on Progress all of the operations, where non-conformities are highlighted and reported to Program Managers and Vice President of Operations for their corrective actions. The AMS CEO has full visibility of all audit findings, and will hold the operation to account to meet corrective actions on time. 5. ANTI-CORRUPTION PRINCIPLE 5.1. CORPORATE POLICY AND GOALS AMS continues to enforce its Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy along with a Whistle-blower Policy. These policies form an integral part of who AMS and our employees are. They are distributed amongst all our stakeholders, including shareholders, personnel and third-parties via our internal Document Control Management System (DCMS) and as well as training programs. 5.1.1. RISK ASSESSMENT AMS will utilize International Transparency’ Corruption Perceptions Index to compare corruption risks. The Corruption Perceptions Index ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be out of 226 Countries. The corruption score indicates the perceived level of public sector corruption on a scale of 0 – 100, where 0 means that a country is perceived as highly corrupt and 100 means it is perceived as clean from corruption. The table below outlines the countries of operation and their associated global rank and index score: Country of Operation Global Rank Rating Corruption Score Somalia 174/175 8 Afghanistan 172/175 12 Uganda 142/175 26 Kazakhstan 126/175 29 Liberia 94/175 37 United Arab Emirates 25/175 70 United States 17/175 74 United Kingdom 14/175 78 Australia 11/175 80 The Corruption Perception Index highlights that the majority of our operations and human capital are based in countries associated with high to extreme corruption related risks. This demonstrates the importance of a corporate commitment to advocate anti-corruption behaviour in an environment which does not encourage it. 5.1.2. GOALS AMS aims to continually develop and implement initiatives to ensure our progress on the enactment of AntiCorruption Principles. We aim to:  Continuously support and operate in accordance with the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act  Amend our contracts with business partners and suppliers by requesting that they adhere to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact which includes the abolition of Anti-Corruption  Ongoing Anti-Corruption campaign across all functions in AMS  Introducing even more rigid, unbiased, objective and formal recruitment, supplier selection and purchasing processes throughout the AMS operations 5.2. IMPLEMENTATION CODE OF ETHICS In October 2010 the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct was introduced and was initially made available to all personnel through our document management system (DCMS). This was then followed by a poster campaign throughout our operations. Since then, all new employees go through a Company induction where Page 9 of 10 AMS UNGC Communication on Progress our commitment to the UNGC is made clear and where our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct are openly addressed. UNGC COMMITMENT AMS uses a formal training program on the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, which has been rolled out to all existing employees and is continuously provided to all new staff members. ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANTI-CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY POLICY The internal AMS Compliance Department reviews the Anti-Corruption and Bribery policy on an annual basis prior to the anniversary of the policy. This policy is measured against and adapted to industry best practice. Coinciding with this is the introduction of the Anti-Corruption awareness program which uses as its base the UN program and literature. All employees undertake this awareness program on starting with the Company and regular reminders are sent to all worksites, which includes a poster/leaflet campaign that is displayed at all working environments in visible locations where staff will congregate i.e. dining facilities, etc. The initiative to promote activities against corruption within corporate guidelines is the responsibility of each and every staff member. The management of programs and policies in support hereof is however, the responsibility of the Head Office Compliance Department and is endorsed by the Executive Management and Chief Executive Officer. 5.3. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES All payment approvals for any and all payments to government organizations, suppliers and or business partners are centralized through our Finance Department in Dubai and as such provide a strong control mechanism to ensure that corruption does not occur throughout our operations across the world. AMS has not received any reports or requests claiming money or any other form of compensation from any source for the period covered in this Communication on Progress. Thusly the reporting year can be closed with no outstanding corrective actions. Page 10 of 10
