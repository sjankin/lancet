The most important trends are: While we are permanently improving our competitiveness, we still depend on the macro economic environment for our success. In January 2015, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to launch a large-scale quantitative easing program to boost the European economy. In the same month, the Swiss National Bank decided to unpeg the Swiss franc from the euro. As a consequence, the Swiss franc gained instantly versus all major currencies, leading to strong negative effects for all companies like Franke that consolidate in Swiss francs and that have a substantial cost base in Switzerland. However, we also foresee positive development: the outlook for all major European economies has significantly improved since the announcement of the ECB program and we want to make sure we take full advantage of this opportunity. Globalization and the growth of emerging economies offer new market opportunities for our products and services. At the same time, increased competition in these economies requires Franke Group to remain innovative and cost-efficient and to offer solutions/ systems rather than single products. In many countries, we face a scarcity of skilled employees. Franke Group has to remain an attractive employer in order to attract and retain talented people. 3 Franke Group Sustainability Report 2014 Key impacts, risks, and opportunities Organizational profile Name of the organization Ownership and legal form Franke Group Franke Group (Franke Holding AG) is a private company under Swiss law.

Data measurement techniques and bases for calculations Franke has been measuring non-financial data for many years.

The CO2 emissions for fossil energy (heating oil, natural gas, diesel and gasoline; Scope 1 as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol) are based on emission factors from the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment. The CO2 emissions for electricity and district heat (Scope 2) were calculated with the emission factors provided by the companies. The relative environmental and occupational health & safety data at Group level was calculated by dividing the absolute values by the net sales in Swiss francs. Effects of any restatements of information provided in earlier reports Both the availability and quality of sustainability data has improved since it was first consolidated at Group level in 2012.

Franke has commissioned a detailed analysis of the energy flows in order to identify savings potential and define a range of improvements such as waste heat utilization or replacement of the building control system. The consumption of electricity and fossil fuels was reduced by 28% in 2014 compared to 2009. In addition to cost savings, Franke was also exempt from paying carbon taxes. In April 2015, Franke inaugurated a wood chip heating system that replaced the old natural gas heating in Aarburg. Also as of 2015, Franke has purchased all electricity from Swiss hydropower. This means that all heat and electricity for the production and facilities in Aarburg stems from renewable, CO2 neutral sources.

The overall objective of CAMP is to teach all employees the purpose behind the new direction so that, by the end of 2015, they will be willing to embrace the change in their daily work environment. 50 Franke employees have been selected on a cross-regional, -divisional and -functional basis. By developing or improving their competencies (e. g. training skills, communications skills), CAMP will transform them into Change Ambassadors and trainers themselves. Then, based on the train-the-trainer concept, the Change Ambassadors will be able to share their new knowledge with their local leadership and will train them accordingly. Together, they will create local rollout teams in order to drive the global rollout forward by conveying the messages comprehensively across all Franke companies.

It integrates all Franke product groups around the four key elements of every modern kitchen – hob, oven, hood, sink and matching faucet – into a single brilliant system. Each element is designed and engineered to work together seamlessly and to enable a perfect workflow. All appliances meet the highest standards of their product group: stoves are VDE certified and are, together with hoods, in the A++ energy efficiency class. The faucets are economical in their use of hot water (hence low energy consumption) and qualify them for the class A rating. Furthermore, the stainless steel is fully recyclable. All in all, the functional and connected kitchen system is not only an allrounder for different customer needs, but also contributes to sustainable development through optimal use of resources for long-term durability and efficient product disposal. framesbyfranke.com 34 Franke Group Sustainability Report 2014 XXX Contact Should you have any questions concerning sustainability at Franke in general or regarding this report in particular, please contact: Bruno Triet Head of Risk, Sustainability & Real Estate Management Franke Group ▸ bruno.triet@franke.com 35 Franke Group Sustainability Report 2014 Contact Publisher Franke Holding AG Franke-Strasse 2 4663 Aarburg Switzerland Contact Bruno Triet, Head of Risk, Sustainability & Real Estate Management Franke Group bruno.triet@franke.com Image credits Getty Images (Cover) Gataric Photography (page 2) Balz Murer (page 24) Franke Conception/Realization Swisscontent AG, Zurich Print/Lithography DE Druck AG, Effretikon/Zurich Digicom Digitale Medien AG, Effretikon/Zurich 36 Franke Group Sustainability Report 2014 Imprint Franke Holding AG Franke-Strasse 2 4663 Aarburg Switzerland www.franke.com
