UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 STATEMENT OF CONTINUING SUPPORT: As KGL pursued new business opportunities throughout the region and the globe over the past year, it has been encouraging to see a cautious but increasing confidence in the state of the global economy. Growing side by side this gradually returning optimism is a greater awareness of the need to restore trust in markets and institutions. More pointedly, business must meet the challenge of a higher standard of social responsibility. One of the greatest losses from the global financial crisis was the loss of trust and the public at larger questioning if business can act in the public good. It is the firm assertion of KGL that we can serve both the public good and our stakeholders at the same time. The leaders I speak with in business, as well as government, not only recognize this need to be stewards of the planet, the public trust, and the bottom line, most are intent on doing something about it. A groundswell within the leadership ranks to stand up with a common commitment to values, integrity, and taking on social, community, and environmental challenges is here. The UN Global Compact (UNGC) serves an important purpose in providing consistent guiding principles for businesses to follow, which is demonstrated by the number of companies signing on to the Global Compact, especially from local economies. I am proud that KGL has been a signatory to the UNGC since 2012 and we plan to continue our commitment to the goals contained therein for many years to come. In many ways our commitment to the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) pre-dates the initiative. The ethos of the principles is embodied in the ethical practices and good corporate citizenship which are at the foundation of our business. We recognize having inspired and confident leaders working in partnership with agencies like the UNGC as central to our efforts. Looking ahead, we will explore new opportunities to develop programs and partnerships that support the UN’s missions and objectives. Moreover, we will continue to further the goals of the Global Compact through KGL’s vision, strategy and wider corporate goals. We believe that our success depends on fulfilling a larger sense of purpose, and we are committed to empower change through participating in programs that achieve solutions to pressing international issues. The returning optimism in the global economy sets a foundation for encouraging and joining with other businesses – clients, suppliers and business partners – to take a stand in responding to the world’s challenges.
