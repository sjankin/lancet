While aluminum and plastic used to make our drives with product waste in FY2014. We identified suppliers that can be recycled, many regions where Seagate products are able to recycle old disk drives into materials that are are sold do not have strong electronic waste recycling usable in new disk drives. We also worked with several programs. For this reason, Seagate drives can add to the suppliers to integrate them into the design process, with waste stream destined for incinerators and landfills. the goal of bringing materials from recycled disk drives directly into our product manufacturing. Furthermore, because the vast majority of Seagate’s products are sold as components to larger systems produced by OEMs, we have minimal leverage over how LOOKING FORWARD our products are managed at the end of their useful life. We encourage reclamation, just as we recycle our own We will expand efforts to integrate recycled materials into our manufacturing process. In particular, it is internally generated scrap, and urge users of products that our long-term goal to test the reliability of materials include our drives to participate in manufacturer take-back produced from recycled disk drives to verify whether programs. they meet our quality standards. We will also look for additional avenues to reclaim product waste. Finally, For the remainder of our products—our retail products and we will evolve our approach to product waste as servers—Seagate has made great progress in managing we begin shifting to more cloud computing, which product waste by establishing a successful take-back supports fewer, small manufactured products and program. We provide customers with drive disassembly more centralized storage devices. instructions to facilitate recycling, and manage our own take-back program for hard drives under warranty. All of these drives are refurbished or—if not repairable— recycled. Seagate | FY2014 Global Citizenship Annual Report Product Sustainability | 16 Environmental Sustainability Seagate is committed to improving environmental sustainability in all of our manufacturing operations. Seagate sets goals, tracks progress and audits systems to reduce energy, carbon emissions, waste and water. Together, these initiatives comprise the bulk of our environmental sustainability efforts.

United States Bloomington, Minn. Energy and Carbon Emissions Performance Manufacturing our drives uses energy and produces GHG Seagate’s two largest sources of GHG emissions are emissions. To combat these realities, Seagate works purchased electricity and “fugitive emissions,” or the to reduce the amount of energy and carbon required unintended release of gases. To reduce GHG emissions to produce disk drives by identifying energy efficiency intensity, each Seagate manufacturing site is required to opportunities, auditing management systems and achieve annual energy savings goals. We also conduct performance and reporting on progress throughout the a third-party verification of our GHG emissions reporting manufacturing process. every year. In addition to keeping track of factory performance for our own records (compiled annually Our primary objective is to reduce both energy use and in this report), we share our results via the Carbon GHG emissions per storage capacity we produce. Across Disclosure Project’s (CDP) investor, supply chain and our industry, these types of measurements are known as water questionnaires (our responses for the investor and “energy intensity” and “GHG emissions intensity” because water questionnaires are available publicly via the CDP they measure impact relative to the amount of economic website). Seagate continues to assess risk to the business activity taking place. How intensity is measured varies from climate change as part of our annual ISO 14000 across industry sectors and product types; Seagate management system process, and have determined that measures energy and carbon emissions intensity per our climate risks do not differ from other companies in petabyte (PB) of storage capacity shipped. our industry. Seagate | FY2014 Global Citizenship Annual Report Environmental Sustainability | 18 Seagate’s biggest challenge continues to be reducing GHG emissions overall, especially given increasing storage Electricity Consumption (MWh) capacities, product complexity (as new products have additional production steps) and acquisitions.
