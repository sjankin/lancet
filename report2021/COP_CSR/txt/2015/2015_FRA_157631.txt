The second step was the launch of the communication campaign. A letter was sent directly to the relevant customers. In this letter we presented Lyreco’s Cradle to Cradle range and some more background information. After a few weeks an email followed where the customer could request a meeting with our sales representatives. The objective of this campaign was plural.

However, continuous improvement remains a principle to apply. Thus, in order to enhance the quality of waste management and reduce the “non-recycled” items, Italy has improved the communication and staff awareness in the waste areas. A dedicated “color communication” has been introduced – as each kind of waste has its specific color and “written communication” – which is an information explaining what should be thrown and where. 28 Sustainable Development Report 2014/2015 Environmental Actions INFRASTRUCTURE LyRECO SUSTAINABLE WAREHOUSE ROOF WITH gARdEN PROJECT SOLAR PANELS Generating cheap and green electricity from sunlight Sustainable Development Report 2014/2015 our Environmental Actions Benelux Project: Not only could Lyreco benefit from reduced The 1 Lyreco installation has been live since st electricity costs, but the carbon footprint September 2014, as the roof of the Benelux will be reduced by some 1,300 tonnes / year Distribution Center (near Liege) has been (equivalent to 8 % of Lyreco UK total carbon covered with 1,000 solar photovoltaic panels, footprint), significantly reducing the envirepresenting a surface of 5,000 square meters. ronmental impact.
