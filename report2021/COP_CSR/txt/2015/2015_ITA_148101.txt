CECED Italia is an association that represents more than 100 companies in the household appliances industry. The CECED Code of Conduct confirms the commitment by the European domestic appliance industry to support behaviour that is ethical and fair. The Code aims at promoting ethical and sustainable standards as regards working conditions and safeguarding the environment in order to support fair competition in global markets. The manufacturers that adhere to the code voluntarily commit to implement conditions of dignity at work, that respect shared standards relating to minimum age, working hours, hygiene and safety conditions, freedom of association and collective bargaining, as well as environmental regulations. The signatory companies also commit to making their suppliers aware of the principles of the Code of Conduct, and to encourage them to adhere to these principles. The signatory companies ask, through the suppliers, that the principles are recommended to the whole supply chain. In this context, the Sabaf Annual Report is the tool through which the Group reports each year on the practical implementation of the code’s principles and the progress achieved, as specifically required of participating companies. Sabaf is a member of the Global Compact In April 2004 Sabaf formally subscribed to the Global Compact, the United Nations programme for companies that commit to supporting and promoting 10 universally accepted principles covering human rights, labour rights, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. By publishing the 2013 Annual Report, we are renewing our commitment to making the Global Compact and its principles an integral part of our strategy, our culture and our daily operations, and we also undertake explicitly to declare this commitment to all our employees, partners, customers and public opinion in general.

Safety for Sabaf is not mere compliance with existing standards, but a Sabaf carefully monitors and enhances the value of its true “intangible assets” – management philosophy striving for continuous improvement in performance i.e. the great technical and professional skill of people working in the company; in order to guarantee end users an increasingly safe product. Besides investing its image now synonymous with quality and reliability; and its reputation as a in new-product R&D, the Group has chosen to play an active role in fostering a company attentive to social and environmental problems and to the needs of safety culture, both by promoting the sale of products featuring thermoelectric its counterparts. Advocating the idea of work and relations with stakeholders safety devices, and via a communication policy aimed at promoting the use of as “the passion for a project founded on common ethical values in which products with thermoelectric safety devices. Sabaf has long been a worldwide everyone recognises themselves” is not only a moral commitment, but also promoter in the various institutional environments of the introduction of a real guarantee of enhanced exploitation of intangible assets (intellectual regulations making the adoption of products with thermoelectric safety devices capital). From this perspective the sharing of ethical values is the link between obligatory. Safety has proved to be a key factor for success, partly because the promotion of a business culture oriented towards social responsibility and the Company has succeeded in anticipating demand for products with safety enhanced exploitation of the Company’s intellectual capital. devices in the European market and in stimulating the spread of such products in developing countries. More recently, Sabaf has become a promoter, together with the Brazilian regulatory authority, of the ban on the use of zamak (a zinc and aluminium alloy) for the production of gas cooking valves due to its inherent risks. Today, however, the use of zamak is still permitted in Brazil, Mexico and in other South American countries, limiting business opportunities in the valves segment for Sabaf, which does not plan to consider the production of valves using zamak. 26 Social responsibility in business processes In order to translate the values and principles of sustainable development into decisions regarding of action and operating activities, Sabaf applies a structured methodology, whose key factors are as follows: 1 2 3 the sharing of training and an internal control and audit values, mission communication; system capable of monitoring and sustainability risks (including ethical and strategy; reputational risks) and of verifying that commitments to stakeholders are fulfilled; 4 5 6 a stakeholder engagement key performance a clear and complete reporting indicators(KPI), capable of system, able to inform the system, to deal with the monitoring our economic, social various categories of stakeholder expectations of all stakeholders and environmental performance; effectively; and to receive useful feedback with a view to continuous improvement. Prudent approach Awareness of the social and environmental implications of Group activities, together with consideration both of the importance of a cooperative approach with stakeholders and the Group’s own reputation, has led Sabaf to adopt a prudent approach to the management of the economic, social and environmental variables that it encounters on a daily basis. Accordingly, the Group has developed specific analyses of the main risks faced by its business entities.

A varied picture Manufacturers of gas cooking appliances – Sabaf’s core market – consist of: • large multinational groups with a well-established international presence in sales and production and possessing strong brands; • manufacturers located in countries with low-cost labour that aim both to exploit opportunities in their home markets and to grow fast globally; • manufacturers focused on specific markets in which they are the market leader; • manufacturers (mainly Italian export firms) occupying segments featuring greater product differentiation (built-in hobs and ovens, free-standing cookers, for example).

It executes transactions in other currencies, such as the US dollar and the Brazilian real. Group results depend to a large extent on the work of executive directors Since sales in US dollars accounted for 10% of consolidated revenue, and management. The loss of a key staff member for the Group without the gradual depreciation expected in the coming months could lead to an adequate replacement and the inability to attract new resources a loss in competitiveness on the markets where sales are made in that could have negative effects on the future of the Group and on the quality currency (mainly South and North America). of financial and economic results.

The sale prices of products are generally renegotiated semi-annually or annually; as a result, Group companies may not be able to immediately pass on to customers changes in the prices of commodities that occur during the year, which has an impact on profitability. RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES The Group protects itself from the risk of changes in the price of brass and aluminium with supply contracts signed with suppliers for delivery up to twelve months or, alternatively, with hedging instruments on the physical market. As of the date of this report, the Sabaf Group has already fixed purchase prices for 50% of its expected requirement of aluminium, steel and brass for 2015. Any further increase in the price of commodities not hedged could have negative effects on expected profits.

Sabaf has decided to opt for a fibre-optic laser marking system which makes it possible to print all the necessary PROGRAMME AND OBJECTIVES characters on products, without any limitations. Between 2013 and 2014, with an investment of €250,000, all the ink-jet systems will be replaced with fibre-optic laser marking systems, thereby eliminating the management costs. Sabaf has always been mindful of the environment, constantly seeking to reduce the impact of its industrial operations. The Company’s awareness of the importance of ecological balance is reflected in the various decisions taken over the years, which not only respect legal requirements but also aim to achieve PRODUCT INNOVATION AND constant progress in the Company’s environmental performance.

The most significant product and process innovations introduced by Sabaf in terms of environmental impact are detailed below. High-efficiency burners For many years Sabaf has been a pioneer in presenting to the market burners which offer much higher yields than standard burners. After the launch of the PROCESS INNOVATION AND Series III, AE and AEO, in 2012 Sabaf introduced a new family of high-efficiency ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY burners, the HE burners, which achieve yields of up to 68%. The HE burners are also almost completely interchangeable with Series II burners. In 2013 the DCC range of specialist burners was completed; these burners have Washing of metals energy efficiency of above 60%, the highest currently available on the market for burners with more than one ring of flame. The production process for valves requires the washing of metals in several phases. Traditionally, the metals were washed using systems which use chlorine-based solvents.

Depreciation is calculated according to rates deemed appropriate to reliably. When it is considered that these future economic benefits will not be spread the carrying value of tangible assets over their useful working life. generated, the development costs are written down in the year in which this Estimated useful working life, in years, is as follows: is ascertained.

If there is any indication in this sense, the recoverable amount Vehicles and other transport means 4-5 of said assets is estimated so as to determine the total of the write-down. If it is not possible to estimate recoverable value individually, the Group estimates the Ordinary maintenance costs are expensed in the year they are incurred; recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. costs that increase the asset value or useful working life are capitalised and In particular, the recoverable value of the cash generating units (which generally depreciated according to the residual possibility of utilisation of the assets to coincide with the legal entity which the capitalised assets refer to) is verified which they refer. by determining the value of use. The recoverable amount is the higher between Land is not depreciated. the net selling price and value in use. In measuring the value of use, future cash flows net of taxes, estimated based on past experience, are discounted Leased assets to their present value using a pre-tax rate that reflects fair market valuations of the present cost of money and specific asset risk. The assumptions used for Assets acquired via finance lease contracts are accounted for using the calculating the value of use concerns the discount rate, growth rate, expected financial method and are reported with assets at their purchase value, less changes in selling prices and cost trends during the period used for calculation, depreciation.

As regards acquisitions completed prior to the date of IFRS adoption, the Sabaf When there is no longer any reason for a write-down to be maintained, the Group has used the option provided by IFRS 1 to refrain from applying IFRS 3 – carrying value of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the new value stemming concerning business combinations – to acquisitions that took place prior to the from the estimate of its recoverable amount – but not beyond the net carrying transition date. Consequently, goodwill arising in relation to past acquisitions value that the asset would have had if it had not been written down for has not been recalculated and has been posted in accordance with Italian impairment of value. Reversal of impairment loss is recognised as income in GAAPs, net of amortisation reported up to 31 December 2003 and any losses the income statement. caused by a permanent value impairment. After the transition date, goodwill – as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life – is not amortised but subjected annually to impairment testing to check for value loss, or more frequently if there are signs that the asset may Real estate investment have suffered impairment. As allowed by IAS 40, non-operating buildings and constructions are assessed at cost net of depreciation and losses due to cumulative impairment of value. The depreciation criterion applied is the asset’s estimated useful life, which is considered to be 33 years. 112 If the recoverable amount of investment property – determined based on the market value of the real estate – is estimated to be lower than its carrying Reserves for risks and contingencies value, the asset’s carrying value is reduced to the lower recoverable amount, recognising impairment of value in the income statement.

The fundamental passages for the recognition of revenues according to the new model are: • the identification of the contract with the customer; • the identification of the contract’s performance obligations; • the determining of the price; • the allocation of the price to the contract’s performance obligations; • the recognition of revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The principle applies from 1 January 2016 but early application is permitted. Although the systematic analysis of the various cases is not yet completed, taking into consideration the type of activity conducted by the Group and the types of contracts, the Directors do not expect the application of the new standard to have a significant impact. On 24 July 2014, the IASB published the final version of IFRS 9 – Financial instruments. The document includes the results of the phases relating to the classification and valuation, impairment and hedge accounting, of the IASB project designed to replace IAS 39. The new standard, which replaces the previous versions of IFRS 9, should be applied by financial statements from 1 January 2018 onwards. 116 Comments on significant balance sheet items 1.
