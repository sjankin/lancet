December 5, 2015. Ban Ki Moon, Secretary General The United Nations New York, NY 10017 Dear Mr. Secretary General I am pleased to confirm that DISEÑO Y METALMECANICA SA DE CV reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labor Rights, Environment and Anti-­‐ Corruption. In this SIXTH Annual Communication of Progress , we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. THE UPDATES TO OUR ONGOING PROGRAMME ARE NOTED IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES IN RED-­‐CAPITAL LETTERS Sincerely Yours PILAR SANCHEZ CHIEF DEPUTY OFFICER DISEÑO Y METALMECANICA SA DE CV HUMAN RIGHTS UPDATE: ASSESMENT , POLICY AND GOALS At Diseño y Metalmecanica we support and respect the protection of basic and Internationally proclaimed Human Rights No human right abuses are perpetuated in our premises and it is our responsibility that our actions surpass Diseño y Metalmecanica and that our employees know and execute in their lives the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is the basis of a peaceful environment of mutual respect within our workforce. UPDATE : IMPLEMENTATION Diseño y Metalmecanica ´s protection of Human Rights is backed up by two basic forces: • The Labour Laws in our country that are based Human Rights protection • The additional benefits given by our company that surpass the Lawfully required • 5 S´s PROGRAMME : We have started a 5 S program with all the employees to improve our cleanliness and organization. This is a culture change that intends to have a lean and more modern system, from the desk to the machine. 18 months into the programme, we have made this a lifestyle. Still under constant evaluation, the personnel has learned and applies the 5S principles on a daily bases. Internal grades keep increasing and all areas are averaging much better grades than 12 months ago. THE PROGRAMME HAS BEEN EXXTENDED TO USE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND OFFICE AREAS TO ASSURE THAT ALL EMPLOYEES REALLY LIVE BY THE ORDER AND NEATNESS PRINCIPLES. • ONGOING QUALIFICATION PROGRAMME FOR “NEW MANAGERS” : This started as an initiative to train 15 supervisors into leadership issues and has evolved into and ongoing programme. The subjects are varied and the attendance is all across the board in the Org. Chart. o Graduates have opportunities to grow in the organization. o This incentivates intenral promotion which is both, cost effective and professioanly desirable. • WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A NEW BENEFIT FOR OUR WORKERS THAT CONSIST OF LOANS AT A VERY LOW RATE : The objective is to facilitate the availability if funds 24/7 for emergencies , and now enabling them to borrow more so they can start a project. • This enables our coworkers to: o Have complete peace of mind in of access to funds in the case of an emergency. o Substitute very high rate loans with (informally given by coworkers) with a reliable lower cost option. o Acces funds with a solid collateral (their own salary) up to 3 times their salary. • In 2014 we signed up to FONACOT, a government loan system to remolde and furnish the homes. All workers are candidates to loans. This year we extended the program for larger loans so we have a complete spectrum of financial support for our colleagues. WE HAVE ADDED TWO MORE COMPNIES TO PROMOTE INTERNAL COMPETITION AND BETTER PRICES TO OUR COLLEAGUES. We do not discriminate against race, religion, sex , social origin, property, birth, colour, politics or any other status. Our employees have the right to express their opinions in many manners (from directly with their supervisors to any level and thru a suggestion box where they can remain anonymous or not) Our code of conduct requires that employees treat each other with respect and consideration. We do periodical Organisational Climate questionnaires to evaluate the overall relationship of the different levels of management and plant employees. IN 2016 WE WILL APPLY TO “BEST PLACE TO WORK MEXICO 2016“ , THIS IN ORDER TO INSTITUCIONALIZE OUR GOOD PRACTICES AND ALSO TO BE EVALUATED BY AN EXTERNAL ORGANISM IN ALL OUR LABOUR AND HUMAN POLICIES. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES The turnover rate at Diseño y Metalmecanica REMAINS AT less that 3% annualy. The average tenure of our employees is 5 years. In Mexico it is quite usual that workers sue the employer whenever the employee is fired. We do not have any open sues. LABOUR ASSESMENT , POLICY AND GOALS Diseño y Metalmecanica has Unionized and non-­‐unionized employees. The Collective Contract we have with our unionized employees is extended to all other employees and therefore gives all of them the same rights. The rights and obligations all coincide with the Mexican Labour Law, that recognices UN Global Compact principles 3 to 6 as follows : • The right to free association and collective bargaining • The prohibition of forced labour • The prohibition of child labour • The elimination of discrimination for employment and occupation IMPLEMENTATION All employees sign and recognise their rights and obligations as they are hired. The labour risks are explained to each and every employee and safety investments are done on a recurrent manner, plus no employee can be in the factory without safety equipment. HUMAN RESOURCE PROGRAMME : In 2014 we invested a good amount of resources in time and money to profesinalize people management. Six months of work resulted in: o Job descriptions for 100% of the positions o Skills matrix for all productive jobs o Evaluation system based on performance o Bonus system based on the previous evaluation o Work climate assesments o Individual assesments to top management All employees are subject to have higher qualifications independently of their sex and age. We do in-­‐house training for all skilled employees. LEADERSHIP AND 5S´s PROGRAMMES ARE INCLUDED HERE WITH GREAT SUCCESS. Our employees can present demands and/or requirements at any time be it thru their Union Representative or in person with the immediate Supervisor. Additionally , and annual negotiation of Contract occurs thru the Representative to negotiate salaries and other benefits. IN 2015 WE CONDUCTED THE FIRST PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS WITH INTERESTING RESULTS. IT IS EVEIDENT THAT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION HAS AN IMPACT ON GOAL SETTING AND FOLLOWING UP ON PROJECTS. WE WILL STRIVE FOR A MORE DEMANDING EVALUATION SYSTEM THAT ENABLES OUR WORKERS TO GIVE THEIR 110% AND BE REWARDED ACCORDINGLY. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES The workforce at Diseño y Metalmecanica continues to negotiate peacefully and successfully year after year. Unionized and Non Unionized workers meet and negotiate to present a joined proposal every January. OUR NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE TO BE DONE YEARLY. 2016 NEGOTIATION WILL START IN JANUARY.
