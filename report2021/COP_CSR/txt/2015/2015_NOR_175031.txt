Letter from General Manager 2 October 2015 To whom it may concern Prosafe is committed to maintaining high ethical, social, environmental and governance standards, and creating sustainable values for the benefit of all stakeholders – shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, society at large and the communities where the company operates. In order to advance our commitment to sustainability and corporate citizenship, we signed up as a member of the United Nations Global Compact in October 2008. By being a member of the UN Global Compact, we want to express our commitment to aligning our operations, policies and strategies with UN Global Compact’s ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. I am pleased to confirm Prosafe’s continued support for the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. We intend to continue to embrace, support and implement these principles within our sphere of influence. In this Communication on Progress, we describe our efforts to continually improve integration of the UN Global Compact and its ten principles into our policies, culture and daily operations. This information will also be shared with our stakeholders on our website www.prosafe.com. Georgina Georgiou General Manager, Prosafe SE (original signed) Page 3 of 31 Communication on Progress 2.

Corporate Social Responsibility in Prosafe Prosafe views corporate social responsibility as an integral part of being an effective, valuecreating business. We are committed to maintaining high ethical, social, environmental and governance standards and creating sustainable values for the benefit of our stakeholders. 3.1 Governing documents Prosafe has established a number of governing documents that guide the company in its day-to-day operations. The Core Values, Code of Conduct and Corporate Strategy provide the overlying framework of governing principles which range from defining preferred individual behaviour to the strategic direction of the company. Core values Prosafe’s Core Values the environment, focus, ambition, safety, innovation, respect and profitability are the pillars upon which the company is built. Our Core Values are “the way we do things in Prosafe”. They define the way we should act as individuals and as a company, and are a standard to refer to when in doubt. Code of conduct Prosafe’s Code of Conduct is the cornerstone of the company’s commitment to integrity. It applies to Prosafe SE and its subsidiaries and must be respected by all managers, employees and temporary staff in the Prosafe Group. The Code of Conduct also applies to all members of the Board of Directors of the Prosafe Group. Policy for Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) Prosafe endeavours to comply with the UN Guiding principles of Business and Human Rights. Prosafe’s CSR Policy is based on the company’s Core Values, Code of Conduct and Corporate Strategy. Prosafe’s CSR Policy draws on the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the key conventions of the International Labour Organisation, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Page 5 of 31 Communication on Progress 3.2 Continuous focus on Core Values and Code of Conduct The Code of Conduct and Core Values are regularly raised at workshops, quarterly business reviews, annual safety days and employee meetings. The Core Values and Code of Conduct have also been elaborated upon in articles in the company magazine Prosafe NOW. In addition, they are described on the company’s website and on the company’s intranet. Any contravention of the Code of Conduct and Core Values is considered to be a serious incident and will be dealt with appropriately, underlining the importance of these values in the way that Prosafe employees are expected to integrate such standards in carrying out day-today business activities. Code of Conduct and Core Values brochures are issued to all permanent and temporary employees and are made available together with relevant posters to all Prosafe offices and vessels. 3.3 Induction programme Prosafe has developed a structured Induction Programme for all employees joining Prosafe. The Induction Programme is designed to introduce the company to new employees with particular emphasis given to the company’s corporate culture, business ethics, Code of Conduct and Core Values. Managers are responsible for ensuring that the Code of Conduct, Core Values and Corporate Policies are understood and implemented. 3.4 UN Global Nordic Prosafe is a member of the Global Compact Nordic Network (GCNN), the forum in which participants from Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway meet and discuss implementation of the ten principles and common challenges, enabling companies to gain a broader understanding of appropriate means to implement the UN Global Compact’s ten principles. Page 6 of 31 Communication on Progress 3.5 Supply Chain Management Prosafe encourages suppliers, consultants and other business partners within its sphere of influence to follow the company’s Core Values, Code of Conduct and its standards for corporate social responsibility, health and safety, the environment, quality assurance and training and competence. In this respect, Prosafe has implemented an Approved Supplier Verification questionnaire which current and potential suppliers are encouraged to complete. The CSR section of the questionnaire specifically refers to Prosafe’s Code of Conduct and to the fact that Prosafe will act in an ethical and socially responsible manner, and will endeavour to uphold the UN Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights, the key conventions of the International Labour Organisation, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the principles of the UN Global Compact. 3.6 Reporting Mechanisms Prosafe’s Ethics Committee is the body within Prosafe to which concerns about possible breaches of Prosafe’s Code of Conduct and violations of human rights can be reported. Referrals can be made by sending an e-mail to a dedicated e-mail address or by sending an anonymous letter. All such reporting is handled with discretion and in a professional manner, with no retaliation imposed on those who report suspected or unethical behaviour. The Ethics Committee is responsible for making recommendations, providing advice on dealing with ethical dilemmas, and ensuring that any alleged breaches are investigated properly and fairly. Page 7 of 31 Communication on Progress 4. Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Statement of support Prosafe supports the principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The company endeavours to ensure that its operations are conducted in accordance with basic human rights standards. This statement of support can also be found in Prosafe’s CSR Policy. 4.1 Assessment and policies Assessment of Human Rights related risks Prosafe operates in the international oil and gas industry, which is a strictly regulated industry within which there is a strong presence of trade unions. Prosafe requires that human rights are respected within its own operations and those of its suppliers. Policy on respecting Human Rights Respecting human rights is an important theme in Prosafe’s Code of Conduct, which states the following: “Human rights and diversity Respect is one of Prosafe’s core values. Prosafe will show respect for all individuals and will ensure that all its activities are conducted in accordance with basic human rights standards. Prosafe does not accept any form of discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, race, national or ethnic origin, cultural background, disability, sexual orientation, age or political opinion. Prosafe does not tolerate abuse or harassment toward employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or others.” Page 8 of 31 Communication on Progress 4.2 Implementation Annual appraisal dialogues It is the company’s aim that, in additional to regular discussions, employees should meet with their line managers on at least an annual basis to review individual work performance and the achievement of personal objectives, giving and receiving feedback and setting objectives for the following year. Any deviation from Prosafe’s standards as defined within the Code of Conduct and Prosafe’s Core Values will be challenged and discussed with the employee. In 2014, 73 per cent of the employees completed such appraisals. Suppliers Current and potential suppliers are encouraged to complete an “Approved Supplier Verification Questionnaire”. Suppliers are encouraged to: uphold and support Prosafe’s Code of Conduct comply with applicable laws and regulations engage in fair competition conduct their business without bribery or corruption respect all individuals and basic human rights standards uphold labour standards and prevailing trade union agreements (if applicable). Partnerships Prosafe has made substantial donations to various social programmes in countries where the company conducts its business activities. Since 2006, Prosafe has had a long-term cooperation with SOS Children’s Villages, and donations have been made to SOS Children’s Villages in Nigeria, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. These donations have financed the building and running of a number of family houses and the running of a family programme in the Philippines. Prosafe believes that in these situations, offering children a home and education is the most valuable aid the company can give. In the longer term, this will contribute to a better future for the children and the country in which they live. Page 9 of 31 Communication on Progress 4.3 Measurement of outcomes Since Prosafe became a member of UN Global Compact in October 2008, the company has increased its focus on ensuring that human rights are supported and respected in the course of carrying on its business, and that Prosafe is not complicit in human rights abuses. Response to Human Rights violations No legal claims have been received from any employee in respect of any violation of human rights, nor any breaches of the Code of Conduct in relation to human rights in 2014. 4.4 Goals Review of 2014 goals Status Include more direct reference to human rights in the Induction Completed Programme. Redesign the management training courses in order to increase Ongoing the understanding of human rights. Arrange special awareness sessions regarding human rights Carried forward to 2015 (lunch and learn session). Proposed 2015 goals Continue to develop the management training courses in order to increase the understanding of human rights. Arrange special awareness sessions regarding human rights (lunch and learn session). Page 10 of 31 Communication on Progress 5. Labour Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Statement of support Prosafe respects and promotes the four fundamental principles and rights at work as described in the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Core Conventions: Freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour Effective abolition of child labour Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 5.1 Assessment and policies Assessment of labour-related risks Prosafe operates in the international oil and gas industry. This is a strongly regulated industry, with a strong presence of trade unions. The knowledge and training required in order to be allowed to work offshore and the application of national tariff agreements eliminate the possibility for using child labour. It is Prosafe’s understanding that the ILO Core Conventions are respected within its own operations, and within the operations of its suppliers. Page 11 of 31 Communication on Progress Policy for Corporate Social Responsibility Prosafe’s Policy for Corporate Social Responsibility draws on the key conventions of the International Labour Organisation. The policy states the following regarding labour standards: Freedom of association Prosafe respects the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. Elimination of all forms of forced labour Prosafe requires that all employees enter into employment with the company of their own free will. The company does not accept any form of forced or compulsory labour. Abolition of child labour and young workers Prosafe will not employ children or support the use of child labour, except as part of government approved youth training schemes (such as work-experience programmes). Elimination of discrimination Prosafe does not accept any form of discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, race, national or ethnic origin, cultural background, disability, sexual orientation, age or political opinion. Employment related decisions shall be based on relevant and objective criteria. Working hours Prosafe will comply with all applicable local and national standards on working hours and overtime. Remuneration Prosafe will ensure that wages paid meet or exceed local and international legal minimum standards concerning wages and benefits including compensation for overtime. Notification Prosafe gives fair notice to employees of significant changes that could substantially affect them. Page 12 of 31 Communication on Progress Policy for Human Resources Prosafe’s Policy for Human Resources is based on Prosafe’s Code of Conduct and Core Values. In accordance with its Core Values and Code of Conduct, Prosafe shall: promote respect and tolerance amongst the whole workforce. The company values diversity and strives to ensure that every employee has an equal opportunity to succeed without fear of discrimination on the basis of gender, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, cultural background, disability, sexual orientation or age, nor on any grounds which cannot be objectively justified. Recruitment, selection and promotion related decisions shall solely be based on relevant and objective criteria. endeavour to continuously develop employees’ knowledge and skills through effective training and facilitate arrangements for their professional and personal development. seek to provide a stimulating working environment and to maintain strong levels of employee motivation by offering challenging and meaningful job opportunities. Prosafe will encourage personal achievement and growth, through continuously seeking to develop employees’ knowledge and skills throughout their career. encourage a good balance between the employee’s personal and professional life. The company supports flexible working conditions as appropriate, whenever this is feasible. strive to provide a safe and secure working environment for all. The company will seek to develop a workplace which is healthy, challenging and motivating. maintain effective employee communications at all levels and encourage open and honest dialogue between all individuals, groups, and management teams. 5.2 Implementation Employment council Prosafe SE was incorporated as a Societas Europaea in February 2007. In order to comply with EU regulations, Prosafe’s corporate management and employee representatives Page 13 of 31 Communication on Progress entered into an Involvement Agreement, which was revised and renewed on the 4th July 2011. Employee representatives are appointed to represent Prosafe companies in the EEA/EU area and may arrange regular meetings with management in order to be updated and to discuss transnational issues. Suppliers Current and potential suppliers are encouraged to complete an “Approved Supplier Verification Questionnaire”. We encourage our suppliers to: ensure that child labour or forced labour does not occur in their organisation and that they encourage their suppliers and other business partners to do likewise give high priority to basic employee rights such as the entitlement to collective bargaining, to receive minimum wage and to have regulated working hours 5.3 Measurement of outcomes Since Prosafe became a member of UN Global Compact in October 2008, the company has increased and intensified its focus on labour standards and in ensuring that the four fundamental principles and rights at work as described in the ILO Core Conventions are respected and promoted. All new employees are given an introduction to Prosafe’s commitment to labour standards as part of the group-wide training of new employees. Collective bargaining The following collective bargaining agreements were in force during 2014: • International Transport Federation (ITF) • Norwegian Maritime Unions • Norwegian Ship Owners Association (NSA) Page 14 of 31 Communication on Progress • Industri Energi (IE) These agreements will continue to operate during 2015. Diversity and equality Prosafe’s diverse and talented workforce is one of the company’s most important competitive advantages in satisfying clients’ requirements. Attracting, developing and retaining the best employees, regardless of gender, age, nationality, cultural background or religion gives the company access to new ideas, promotes better decision making, and creates a workforce that understands and mirrors the company’s clients and the world at large. Prosafe’s workforce comprised 796 individuals at the end of 2014, as compared to 595 in the previous year. Prosafe’s global presence was reflected in the fact that its employees came from 29 countries around the world. The overall workforce turnover in the group was 8.0 per cent in 2014, an increase from 7.0 per cent in 2013. As at 31 December 2014, the age distribution in Prosafe was as follows: 20 – 29 years: 12.7% 30 – 39 years: 29.5% 40 – 49 years: 28.4% 50 – 59 years: 21.2% 60 – 69 years: 7.6% The company’s policy is that full equality should exist as between women and men. However, men have traditionally made up a greater proportion of the recruitment base for offshore operations, and this is reflected in Prosafe’s gender breakdown. As at 31 December 2014, women accounted for 12.9 per cent of the overall workforce and 44.1 per cent of the onshore employees. Women constituted 14.6 per cent of the managers as at 31 December 2014. Page 15 of 31 Communication on Progress Implementation of policies Policy implementation is monitored continually through regular meetings of the management, quarterly business reviews, and monitoring and evaluation of various key performance indicators. Response to Labour Standards violations There have not been any reported possible breaches of Labour Standards since Prosafe became a member of the UN Global Compact in October 2008. No legal claims have been made against the company by any employee regarding a breach of Labour Standards. 5.4 Goals Review of 2014 goals Status Continue to reinforce knowledge of labour standards in Ongoing.

Page 16 of 31 Communication on Progress 6. Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Statement of support Prosafe respects and promotes UN Global Compact’s three fundamental principles regarding the environment and will: support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 6.1 Assessment and policies Assessment of environmental risks Prosafe owns and operates a fleet of accommodation vessels and supports installations in the offshore oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry is an industry with a strong focus on protecting the natural environment. National authorities require companies operating in their waters to demonstrate compliance to strict rules and regulations. In addition to complying with national laws, Prosafe has internal policies and guidelines for risk management, based on international standards. Prosafe conducts Environmental Impact Assessments for each of the vessels that the company manages or operates prior to entering into new business activities, new geographical areas or new contracts. These assessments take into account the mode of operation of the vessel together with generic geographical considerations. Local Page 17 of 31 Communication on Progress assessments are typically performed with clients who will usually be operating under the terms of an Operators Permit. Policy for Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Quality (HSSEQA) Prosafe’s policy for Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Quality (HSSEQ) states that the company is committed to minimising risk and harm to the personnel, the environment and assets through the adoption of a zero mind-set. Prosafe shall: ensure compliance with applicable legislation or higher voluntary standards to which Prosafe may subscribe implement a systematic approach to Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Quality through an integrated management system that demonstrates a systematic approach to risk management throughout all of Prosafe’s activities promote a culture where stakeholders can participate and demonstrate their individual commitment to safe working practices and a safe working environment set goals and objectives for continual improvement of Prosafe’s management systems, its assets and the services the company provides to its clients report and investigate all incidents and implement remedial actions measure its performance through internal monitoring and review and allow for the transfer of information and best practices across all levels of the company select contractors and suppliers that perform to Prosafe’s HSSEQ requirements. 6.2 Implementation Integrated Management System Environmental management is at the core of Prosafe’s Integrated Management System. By integrating environmental considerations in its risk assessments, the company endeavours to Page 18 of 31 Communication on Progress minimise the impact of its day-to-day operations on the environment. Prosafe produces Environmental Impact Assessments for each of the vessels the company manages/operates. The assessments take into account the mode of operation of the vessel together with generic geographical considerations. Local assessments are typically performed with the clients who will usually be operating under the terms of an Operators Permit. Prosafe cooperates actively with customers and suppliers to set in-house goals, make continuous improvements to its own routines and shape attitudes towards protecting the natural environment from pollution by its operations. All accidental discharges and emissions are reported and followed up. Reducing the company’s ecological footprint Prosafe actively seeks solutions to reduce emissions in order to further reduce its impact upon the environment. Environmental considerations are an important aspect when planning vessel refurbishments and upgrades. NOx reductions: In 2009, Prosafe joined the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise's (NHO's) Environmental Agreement on NOx. By signing the Agreement, Prosafe has committed to prevent and reduce environmental problems caused by emissions of nitrogen oxides in its offshore operations. When refurbishing vessels, Prosafe endeavours to replace old engines with low NOx engines which results in a reduction in the vessels’ diesel and lub oil consumption, and the annual NOx emission, and consequently contributes to reducing environmental impact. An example of this is the replacement of the diesel engines of Safe Caledonia which took place in the second half of 2012 and beginning of 2013, which will result in a further reduction of NOx emissions. Going forward, we will continue to gradually implement new technology and refurbish equipment in order to further reduce emissions. Page 19 of 31 Communication on Progress International Air Pollution Prevention (IAPP) certificates, International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) certificates and International Sewage Pollution Prevention (ISPP) certificates are issued in respect of Prosafe’s vessels. These certificates are all issued under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and are subject to periodic renewal survey. Waste management When a Prosafe vessel is working alongside an offshore installation, it will operate under the umbrella of the host installation's operating permits. Prosafe and its client's management systems are cross-referenced within interface documents, and responsibilities are clearly defined. All Prosafe vessels are subject to MARPOL requirements and have implemented a waste management system that is documented in the Garbage Management Manual. The plan includes assessments of all potential waste products originating on board together with the requirements for waste segregation for transportation ashore. Ballast water Ballast water management on Prosafe’s vessels is controlled within the confines of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) regulation. Discharge of sewage The discharge of sewage is controlled within the confines of IMO regulation. All vessels within the fleet have been subject to International Sewage Pollution Prevention (ISPP) surveys and have been issued certification in accordance with MARPOL Annex IV by the relevant Flag. Spills and emissions The company measures oil spills and chemical spills to sea. Prosafe had no accidental discharges to the natural environment in 2014, which is wholly in line with the company’s target. Prosafe calculates the emissions of CO2, CO, NOx, SO2, CH4 and VOC for the managed fleet based on the fleet’s diesel consumption. Page 20 of 31 Communication on Progress It is important to note that the amount of diesel consumed and the resulting emissions will vary largely depending on: the number of vessels that are under Prosafe’s management the fleet utilization (i.e. the amount of time that the vessels have been operating) the vessels’ operation mode dynamic positioned vessels maintain their position by means of thrusters and will therefore use far more diesel, and thereby also have substantial higher emissions, than vessels that maintain station by moorings The number of vessels that use dynamic positioning (DP) and the number of days that these vessels use DP can vary from year to year. Calculated 2014 Calculated 2013 Calculated 2012 Calculated 2011 total (tonnes) total (tonnes) total (tonnes) total (tonnes) Consumed diesel 22 475 18 348 19 238 23 000 CO2 71 920 58 713 61 561 73 871 CO 427 348 365 438 NOx 1 415 1 155 1 212 1 454 SO2 135 110 115 138 CH4 3.1 2.5 3 3 VOC 42 35 37 43 Revitalization of the Safety Observation System (SOS cards) In order to increase the awareness of personal responsibility for health, safety and the environment (HSE), Prosafe’s employees are encouraged to submit SOS cards whenever they observe situations that might have a negative or positive consequence for health, safety or the environment. Prosafe’s Safety Observation System promotes both positive and negative intervention, provides a valuable indicator of the company’s health, safety, and environmental culture, and Page 21 of 31 Communication on Progress ensures transfer or experience. Observations are analysed and actioned initially onboard the vessels by shipboard management before being reviewed by onshore management. Part of bonus scheme Prosafe’s bonus scheme assesses and rewards the overall performance of the business and the relevant employees. The bonus depends on achieving defined results relating to earnings, the attainment of operational and strategic goals, the attainment of health, safety and environmental results and the attainment of individual goals. Suppliers Current and potential suppliers are encouraged to complete an “Approved Supplier Verification Questionnaire”. In the Environmental section of the questionnaire, suppliers are encouraged to: have an environmental management system in place provide a detailed environmental analysis report monitor emissions describe how they handle waste disposal Continuous process Prosafe aims to instil a zero accident/incident mind-set in respect of HSSEQ in its employees and sub-contractors. In order to achieve this, a number of management tools are included within the company’s Integrated Management System: vessel inductions for all personnel visiting our vessels worksite monitoring to ensure that safe working practices and conditions are in place safety tours to identify risks to persons, detect nonconformities as regards health, safety and environmental protection standards, and to encourage all crew members to keep a high focus on safety at all times Page 22 of 31 Communication on Progress permit to work audits to ensure that health, safety and environmental standards are maintained through compliance with the permit to work system Annual Safety Day attended by onshore and offshore managers and employees. By bringing people together, they can share resources and best practices and develop stronger relationships to the benefit of the company as a whole. 6.3 Measurement of outcomes Since Prosafe became a member of UN Global Compact in October 2008, the company has intensified the work related to enhancing employee awareness relating to these matters and to minimising the impact of the company’s operations on the environment. Carbon Disclosure Project Prosafe participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project, reporting on its greenhouse gas emissions, water use and climate change strategies. The Carbon Disclosure Project is an independent not-for-profit organisation holding the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world. Internal and third party audits Prosafe measures achievement of continuous improvement through internal audits and external and third-party audits. The audits are also used as tools to ensure that procedures and management systems are properly implemented and observed. A total of 66 audits were carried out in 2014, including 17 by clients and 17 by certification bodies and authorities. No major non-conformances from the company’s quality systems were identified. Page 23 of 31 Communication on Progress Certification Through ISO and International Safety Management (ISM) standards, Prosafe maintains an up-to-date quality management system with an Integrated Safety and Environmental Management System. The company’s quality management systems are certified according to ISO 9001. Since September 2011, Prosafe has been certified according to OHSAS 18001. Aberdeen office, Singapore office and Safe Concordia are certified according to ISO 14001. As the Integrated Management System incorporates the requirements of ISO 14001, best practice is applied to other sites and vessels. Safety management systems for the fleet are approved to the ISM code. Prosafe’s accommodation vessels have been certified to the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code. The company was not served enforcement notices by any regulatory authority during 2014. Prosafe’s vessels have International Air Pollution Prevention (IAPP) certificates, International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) certificates and International Sewage Pollution Prevention (ISPP) certificates, all issued under MARPOL. These certificates are subject to periodic renewal surveys. Environmental incidents Prosafe has not had any accidental discharges to the natural environment since the company became a member of UN Global Compact in October 2008, thereby achieving the company’s zero accidental discharge target. Contingency plans Prosafe has established contingency plans to limit harm to people, the environment and material assets in order to be able to handle potential incidents. These plans will also ensure that correct, relevant and timely information is provided to the outside world if and when required. Prosafe carries out regular emergency response exercises in cooperation with its customers and third parties to ensure that the company is well prepared to deal with a possible crisis.

Statement of support Prosafe will act in an ethical and socially responsible manner and uphold the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Prosafe promotes transparency and fights corruption, believing that this is vital to ensure good governance. The company promotes effective markets and sustainable development, and respects national and international laws. 7.1 Assessment and policies Assessment of risk of corruption and bribery Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index from October 2014 ranks 177 countries by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys. A country’s score indicates the perceived level of public sector corruption on a scale of 0 100, where 0 means that a country is perceived as highly corrupt and 100 means that a country is perceived as very clean. A country's rank indicates its position relative to the other countries/territories included in the index.

The company is committed to fair and open competition in markets around the world.” Code of Conduct Prosafe's Code of Conduct provides the framework for what Prosafe considers to be responsible conduct, but is not exhaustive. In the event that laws and regulations in a particular country are more stringent than Prosafe's Code of Conduct, local rules shall apply. Prosafe’s Code of Conduct includes the following business principles: Legal compliance In its business activities, Prosafe will comply with applicable laws and regulations and act in an ethical and socially responsible manner. Fair competition Prosafe is committed to fair and open competition in markets around the world. Prosafe companies and employees must under no circumstances engage in any anti-competitive practices such as illegal fixing of prices, sharing of markets or other actions which prevent, restrict or distort competition in violation of applicable antitrust laws. Bribery and corruption Prosafe will not offer customers, potential customers, governments, agencies, or any representatives of such entities any rewards or benefits in violation of either applicable law or reasonable and generally accepted business practices. Page 27 of 31 Communication on Progress The Code of Conduct includes the following rules relating to personal conduct: Conflicts of interest Employees must avoid entering into any situation in which personal or financial interests or that of persons or companies with which they have ties or links may conflict with those of Prosafe. If employed on a full-time basis by Prosafe, no outside professional activities should be exercised without first obtaining the written approval of the immediate superior. No one must work on or deal with any matter in which they themselves, their spouse, partner, close relative, or any other person with whom they have close relations, has a direct or indirect financial interest. Prosafe's property or information acquired through your position in Prosafe must not be used for personal advantage or for the purpose of competing with Prosafe. Any conflict of interest or suspicion of conflict of interest must be flagged. If in doubt, the employee should consult your immediate superior or the Ethics Committee. Gifts and hospitality Employees must not offer, make, seek or accept any payment, personal gift or entertainment that might reasonably be believed to influence business transactions or that is not within the bounds of customary business hospitality. During commercial negotiations, extra care is merited. Employees must never request or solicit personal gifts, favours, entertainment or services. When providing or receiving third party gifts and entertainment, good judgment must be exercised in each case, taking into account pertinent circumstances, including the character of the gift or entertainment; its purpose; its appearance; the positions of the persons providing and receiving the gift or entertainment; the business context; reciprocity, and applicable laws and social norms. Gifts of nominal value, small promotional items, occasional meals and social events may be acceptable if there is a clear business reason. Hospitality must be kept at a moderate Page 28 of 31 Communication on Progress level. Travel, accommodation and other expenses for the individuals themselves in connection with such hospitality must always be approved in advance by the immediate superior, and paid for by Prosafe. The above principles also apply in the reverse direction, so that no individual acting on behalf of Prosafe may, in their dealings with customers, suppliers and other parties, offer or agree to pay for gifts, hospitality or other expenses that would violate these principles. Bribery Bribery exists when an attempt is made to influence someone in the conduct of their duties through the provision of an improper advantage to obtain an improper commercial or personal advantage. Trading in influence exists when an improper advantage is provided to someone in order to influence the performance of a third party's duties. Such improper advantage can take different forms, such as cash, objects, credits, discounts, travel, accommodation or services. Employees must not offer or provide an undue monetary or other advantage to any person or persons, including public officials or customer employees, in violation of laws and the official's or employees' legal duties, in order to obtain or retain business. Agreements with consultants, brokers, sponsors, agents or others intermediaries must not be used to channel payments to any person or persons, including public officials or customer employees and thereby circumvent Prosafe's policies regarding bribery and corruption. Contributions to political parties, political committees and to individual politicians should not be given. 7.2 Implementation Transparency Prosafe aims to ensure that stakeholders are in possession of accurate, clear and timely information about company operations and conditions. Actions taken to meet this aim include prompt and comprehensive reporting of the company’s annual and quarterly results.
