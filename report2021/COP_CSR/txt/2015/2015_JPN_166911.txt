Tetsuji Ohashi President In FY2011, we stated that Komatsu is committed to contributing to society through core businesses, and we designated our CSR Themes: “Enhancing quality of life” by providing products required by society, “Developing people,” which Komatsu has emphasized since its founding, and “Growing with society” by fulﬁlling our corporate responsibilities in such areas as governance and compliance. In our Mid-term Management Plans, underway since FY2011, we have also clariﬁed and begun to implement worldwide the speciﬁc Key Business Activities we will pursue for each CSR Theme. Here are a few examples. Solving Issues through SMARTCONSTRUCTION We set out our growth strategies based on innovation in the Mid-range Management Plan “Together We Innovate GEMBA Worldwide,” which covers the period ending March 31, 2016. Our goal is to expand business domains by providing new value through our “DANTOTSU” (unique and unrivaled) solutions, in which we take part in managing and raising the efﬁciency of entire construction projects for KOMATSU customers CSRinREPORT addition to providing 2015 02 our products and services.

Our goal is to expand business domains by providing new value through our “DANTOTSU” (unique and unrivaled) solutions, in which we take part in managing and raising the efﬁciency of entire construction projects for customers in addition to providing our products and services. The most recent example of this strategy is the “SMARTCONSTRUCTION” business launched in Japan in February 2015. This solution service is intended to realize the safe and highproductivity job sites of the future by connecting all information on worksites through information and communication technology. We are promoting SMARTCONSTRUCTION to contribute to the solution of other anticipated on-site issues for customers, including the severe shortage of experienced workers. In pursuing innovations such as these, Komatsu also values its collaborations with partners and participates in joint projects involving industry, academia and government, as well as industry-to-industry collaboration. By quickly adopting superior technologies from outside the company and promoting them through our business, we seek to promptly respond with solutions and value that address the challenges faced by our customers and by society at large. Activities for Reducing Electricity and Environmental Action throughout the Value Chain At the Awazu Plant in Ishikawa Prefecture, one of our main plants, the completion of a new assembly line in May 2014 was followed by the commencement of operations of a highly efﬁcient biomass steam boiler system in April 2015. Using wood chips from forest thinning, the system is capable of using exhaust heat for air conditioning and other purposes in addition to generating power. We expect to meet our FY2015 goal of reducing the annual volume of purchased electricity by approximately 90% compared to FY2010. These initiatives are already being applied to our plants in Japan, in Oyama, Tochigi and Osaka. Moreover, about half of the improvements actually implemented at Komatsu have been selectively adopted by business partners that manufacture our components. Many of these companies have already reported reductions in their electricity use, and we believe we can contribute to raising the competitiveness of our business partners through this initiative, which facilitates the reform of their production processes while reducing their environmental footprint. Reducing CO2 emissions is another area that requires not only in-house action but also a response based on an understanding of the entire value chain. The KOMTRAX remote vehicle management system installed in our products is capable of monitoring how construction equipment is being used at customer job sites, providing us with a tool for proposing fuelefﬁcient operations. This system also enables Komatsu to gain an accurate grasp of the KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 03 volume of CO2 emitted at the operating sites where our products are used.

We will continue to develop products that minimize environmental impact and will strive to reduce CO2 emissions throughout our value chain. Pursuing Social Contribution Activities Unique to Komatsu While our basic principle is to “Contribute to society through core business,” we also aspire to fulﬁll our social responsibilities by engaging in social contribution activities that make the best use of our strengths. Led by our local subsidiaries, Komatsu engages in human resource development and local community support activities that meet local needs in countries around the world. In undertaking these social contribution activities, it is important to focus on those that address issues faced by the local community, to join hands with good partners, and to participate consistently. We aim to engage in social contribution activities that are unique to Komatsu by making use of the know-how accumulated in our businesses and through the participation of our employees, and to enhance the value of these activities by sharing related information across the Group. We will continue to pursue basic activities for safety, the environment, compliance and quality assurance by bolstering our corporate governance and by having all employees share in the KOMATSU Way in order to enhance our business performance, improve our business foundation, and fulﬁll our social mission in a balanced manner. We are also actively participating in initiatives such as the United Nations Global Compact and the WBCSD, to take responsibility for doing our part in the world as a global corporation.

Back to TOP KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 05 CSR Themes and Key Business Activities KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 Home > CSR > Our Approach to CSR > CSR Themes and Key Business Activities Our Approach to CSR CSR Themes and Key Business Activities We pursue the following three CSR Themes in our efforts to contribute to society through core business, and Key Business Activities are designated for each theme to reﬂect our latest midterm management plan and social issues. As for our social contribution activities, we set themes under which Komatsu can apply technologies and know-how which we have accumulated in our core business. Formulation Process and Review of Komatsu's CSR Priority Issues and Themes Komatsu conducted a materiality analysis to determine its CSR Priority Issues and Themes with the support of Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), a U.S. nonproﬁt organization, as a third party. During this process, we identiﬁed a set of CSR Priorities, consisting of social issues important both to Komatsu's business and to our stakeholders, as issues Komatsu should address on a global scale. Through repeated internal discussions related to these priority issues, we identiﬁed the three CSR Themes. As we developed these activities, we realized that in addition to undertaking CSR activities through our core business, it wasKOMATSU also important to engage CSR REPORT 2015 in06social contribution activities in the local communities in which we operate. Consequently, we revised our approach in FY2015 CSR Themes and Key Business Activities KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 Our Approach to CSR Formulation Process and Review of Komatsu's CSR Priority Issues and Themes Komatsu conducted a materiality analysis to determine its CSR Priority Issues and Themes with the support of Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), a U.S. nonproﬁt organization, as a third party.

Thus, we seek to earn the trust society has placed in us as we pursue sustainable growth. In our social contribution activities, we pay due consideration to prevailing issues in the regions where we operate and think through how we can apply our strengths to undertake “activities with a human face“ that are uniquely associated with Komatsu. zoom Back to TOP KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 08 Comparison with Global Principles KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 Home > CSR > Our Approach to CSR > Comparison with Global Principles Our Approach to CSR Comparison with Global Principles Items Komatsu has identiﬁed as being its own CSR priority issues are in line with the international standards such as ISO26000 core subjects/issues and the United Nations Global Compact.

An updated version of these priorities are shown in the materiality section of this report. Since then, BSR has worked with Komatsu to make progress on these priorities and address new stakeholder expectations that have arisen in recent years. For example, during 2014 we worked with Komatsu to undertake a corporate-wide human rights impact assessment to identify potential risks and opportunities in Komatsu's key business units and geographies. BSR concluded that Komatsu's overall human rights risk proﬁle is “medium-low risk.” This is due to the fact that Komatsu's main risks are upstream in the supply chain and downstream through product misuse by its customers. Komatsu also has several opportunities to advance human rights through its business, particularly through its mining business working in local communities to provide skilled jobs and increased economic beneﬁts. During 2012, BSR engaged internal Komatsu stakeholders and global mining companies to identify how Komatsu can most effectively meet the CSR expectations of key mining sector customers. The review emphasized the importance of understanding local regional expectations, and the role of Komatsu's product innovation to address environmental impacts that directly inﬂuence the local social license to operate, such as air emissions, dust, and noise. It was for this reason that an engagement between BSR and Komatsu to review the company's social contribution program resulted in an emphasis on local contribution activities. BSR also facilitated a stakeholder engagement for Komatsu at its Osaka plant. During this time we have witnessed Komatsu make progress in other areas, too. For example: • Conducting regular CSR Steering Committee KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015with meetings, 14 senior Komatsu executives setting CSR direction for Komatsu; Komatsu also has several opportunities to advance human rights through its business, particularly Dialogue with through its mining business working in local communities to provide skilled Our Stakeholders jobs CSR REPORT 2015 KOMATSU and increased economic beneﬁts.

BSR also facilitated a stakeholder engagement for Komatsu at its Osaka plant. During this time we have witnessed Komatsu make progress in other areas, too. For example: • Conducting regular CSR Steering Committee meetings, with senior Komatsu executives setting CSR direction for Komatsu; • Developing an internal global network on CSR by identifying CSR representatives from major subsidiaries, and sharing leading practices; • Implementing a new CSR procurement guide, including conﬂict minerals; and, • Establishing ambitious energy saving objectives at major manufacturing plants. Komatsu has a clear grasp of its CSR priorities, risks, and opportunities. However, as a global company operating and selling in many markets, the main challenge now is implementing CSR strategies at the local level. This implies increasing the capacity of local staff to address CSR issues. It also means ensuring CSR factors are effectively integrated into company policies and procedures, especially in higher risk regions and organizational functions. Back to TOP KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 15 Organization to Promote CSR KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 Home > CSR > Our Approach to CSR > Organization to Promote CSR Our Approach to CSR Organization to Promote CSR The CSR Department reports directly to the president, and the CSR Committee chaired by the president provides opportunities for top management to take part in regular discussions on the direction of Komatsu's CSR strategy. Policies for each activity and related issues are discussed by the CSR Steering Committee, which mainly consists of executive ofﬁcers in supervisory positions and is entrusted with governance functions particularly with respect to the implementation of social contribution activities. Our CSR activities are one and the same as our daily business activities, and we engage in them through dedicated divisions and committees organized at all Group companies. With respect to our major overseas subsidiaries, we communicate with staff responsible for CSR activities on a daily basis and share information in an effort to bolster our organization and promote CSR activities in each region. zoom Reinforcement of Our CSR Systems Evaluation Tools for CSR Activities We evaluate new initiatives to determine whether they are beneﬁcial both to Komatsu's business and to our stakeholders. Particularly with respect to social contribution activities (donations), we have been monitoring their effectiveness as CSR activities since FY2013 by using the Check Sheet we created to assess quantitative effects from these two perspectives and by having the CSR Steering Committee, consisting of executive ofﬁcers involved in CSR, evaluate the content.

Global Information Sharing Until recently, we regularly conducted questionnaires to collect information on the CSR activities we have undertaken around the world. In FY2015, we launched a bulletin board on our corporate intranet to provide daily updates and facilitate information sharing globally. We plan to increase the amount of practical information available on the bulletin board toward developing it as a work-ready tool for staff on the frontlines of our CSR activities.

Back to TOP KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 32 Quality and Reliability —Responsible Commitment to Customers KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 Home > CSR > Enhancing Quality of Life —Providing Products Required by Society > Quality and Reliability Quality and Reliability—Responsible Commitment to Customers The fundamental principle of Monozukuri (manufacturing competitiveness) lies in Komatsu's commitment to quality and reliability in order to provide products—both hardware and software —that customers are happy to own. To achieve this, Komatsu puts the customer ﬁrst as one of its Basic Managerial Policies, with the pursuit of maximum customer satisfaction at the foundation. The company carries out a continuous process of reform and reﬁnement with all divisions responsible for putting this policy into practice, whether in development, manufacturing, sales, after-sales service, or administration. In practical implications, Komatsu includes the global environment, quality assurance, and the education and training of human resources within the scope of its quality management and uses indices to promote such management. Our Principles (Komatsu's Principles Governing Quality Assurance) Komatsu has established the following principles on quality in its products and services, which all subsidiaries and employees are responsible for putting into practice. Principles that Increase Quality and Reliability Provide products, services, and systems that are environment friendly, safe, and innovative from the perspective of the customer. Deﬁnition of Quality Assurance The company has a responsibility to take actions that will ensure it is able to provide products and services that the customer can purchase and use with a sense of assurance and satisfaction and use for many years to come. Principles Governing Quality Assurance (1) Putting customers ﬁrst, being receptive to the views of the customer, and responding appropriately to the customer, thereby earning the customer's satisfaction, are fundamental to the job of every employee and constitute the responsibility of every employee. (2) Complying with international standards and the legal requirements particular to individual countries as a matter of course, and providing products and services that, from the perspective of the customer, have incorporated proper regard for safety and a sense of assurance and that do not easily malfunction, are fundamental to the job of every employee and constitute the responsibility of every employee.

Mechanisms for Quality Assurance At Komatsu, all employees in each division, from product planning to development, manufacturing, sales, and after-sales service, share a sense of working as a single unit to continually develop products that are safe, innovative, and of high quality. Through a strengthening of Komatsu's unique Monozukuri system, the company is able to introduce competitive DANTOTSU products to the market and provide services and systems with substantial features. At each step of the development and manufacturing system, meetings are held to consider and evaluate the product. The product's suitability is then assessed and enhanced until the ultimate goal is attained. In this way, the company conducts quality assurance activities that ensure quality and reliability is fully achieved. Through such approaches the company is able to strengthen safety assurance and satisfaction for customers while simultaneously providing products and services that take the global environment into account and comply with both international speciﬁcations and the regulatory requirements of individual countries.

First, Komatsu believes it is extremely important to give serious consideration to customers' views and examine them on a continuous basis. Consequently, the company conducts regular customer satisfaction surveys, including postlaunch ﬁeld surveys. Komatsu uses the results to improve both the products themselves and the structure promoting quality assurance. The surveys help furnish new value to customers as the company develops DANTOTSU products that anticipate customer needs in advance and delivers services with distinct features. Komatsu is able to raise the level of customer satisfaction through these approaches.

Komatsu's Structure for Quality Assurance zoom Post-launch Field Surveys and Feedback of Results Komatsu's post-launch ﬁeld survey is part of its system for comprehensively assessing customers' degrees of satisfaction, with company personnel visiting purchasers of newly launched products to request product evaluations. In concrete terms, these personnel listen to customers' feedback on a day-to-day basis regarding the degree of satisfaction toward the quality and reliability of its products. The company pays careful attention to the evaluations, views, and requests concerning its sales and after-sales service and replacement parts. Komatsu processes and analyzes the gathered data to decide upon objectives for improvement. The resulting information is shared across the company, notably with top management, and provided as feedback to divisions at every step in the process, including development, manufacturing, and sales and after-sales service. With the means to improve upon problems and revise the quality assurance system, the company can deliver products and services that satisfy customers. KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 36 Quality and Reliability —Responsible Commitment to Customers KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 zoom Surveys Tracking Vehicles in Operation for Extended Hours* Komatsu pursues improvements in product durability and reliability through a system of surveys tracking vehicles in operation for extended hours. This allows the company to provide products that satisfy the customer and consume fewer resources. Most recently, conﬁrmation of equipment operating conditions has been made possible by the utilization of an ICT remote management system called KOMTRAX Plus. With the information provided by KOMTRAX Plus, we are able to conﬁrm and analyze the status of the machine in terms of durability, efﬁciency and functionality. The company assesses whether or not the results satisfy customers' expectations and the degree to which their demands match product quality objectives at Komatsu. The company designs proposals to rectify areas not achieving the desired quality levels, later integrating these proposals into product revisions or the development of new products. This process increases product durability and reliability and thus extends product lifecycles, leading to greater customer satisfaction and less resource consumption and waste. *Deﬁned as vehicles with an operating history of 5,000 hours or more Using ICT to Support Customers throughout the Product Life Cycle Komatsu uses ICT-based remote vehicle management systems known as the Komatsu KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 37 Tracking System (KOMTRAX) for conventional construction equipment and KOMTRAX Plus Plus, we are able to conﬁrm and analyze the status of the machine in terms of durability, efﬁciency and functionality.

Quality Assurance Activities at the Global Level Komatsu provides products of the highest quality at every location throughout the world by fully implementing quality assurance activities globally. For this purpose, the company aims for uniform technical drawings, manufacturing systems, inspection methods, information collection, and quality management across the globe. Komatsu labels as “mother plants” certain global manufacturing locations with product development capabilities. These plants serve at the center of worldwide development and manufacturing activities, with their leading-edge technologies and techniques then transferred to other manufacturing locations around the world. This improves technology and enhances product quality, making them uniform throughout the company. Standards for Product Safety Komatsu puts safety and assurance at the forefront in its quality assurance activities. The company has formulated Standards for Product Safety and associated principles and has all employees comply with them in order to deliver products that are safe, provide a sense of assurance, and can be used for many years. Information System for Product Safety and Services In seeking to obtain information on problems with product safety as early as possible, Komatsu has established an information system for product safety and promptly deals with issues. It continuously strives to make improvements so that the company, including top management, can respond quickly through coordinated actions, including (1) assessing the cause of the incident and procedures to be taken, (2) contacting the relevant governing authorities, and (3) deciding to take remedial measures such as a recall of products still on the market. Standards for Product Safety (1) Compliance The provision of products and services that comply with international standards and the legal requirements particular to individual countries is fundamental to the job of every employee and constitutes the responsibility of every employee. (2) Safety via prevention The provision of products and services that are safe and provide a sense of assurance, and do no harm to the customer is fundamental to the job of every employee and constitutes the responsibility of every employee.

The company seeks to address each particular situation with, for example, engineers or top management visiting customers as the situation might require. System for Dealing with Recalls In recent years, customers have become more concerned about product safety in general and product recalls in particular. To help ensure product safety in the market, Komatsu is reinforcing its recall-related organizational strength, comprehensive response capabilities, procedures for prompt corrective measures, and proactive information disclosure while conducting increasingly rigorous monitoring. Procedure regarding recalls: (1) Proposal for rectiﬁcation of the situation based on information regarding the defect; decision regarding what measures the company will take toward the market (2) File a notice with relevant authorities as provided under the law (3) Inform customers by appropriate means (4) Take appropriate corrective measures including, for example, repair, replacement, or refund Means for preventing recalls: (1) Strengthening of system for collecting information on product quality in the market (2) Promotion of technical veriﬁcation of the problem involved in the recall and timely decision making (3) Regular auditing of recall-related operations Komatsu strictly oversees compliance with legal requirements.

Following the transfer to our new plant in June 2011, we opened a space for accident simulations at the skill training facility that offers about twenty types of simulations, and we are striving to enhance our safety awareness and risk prediction capability by regularly conducting sensory training for all employees. Under the slogan “Let's pay attention to the smallest signs and seek improvements to create a safe plant,” KCCM has sought to identify and eradicate risk factors through efforts that have included “Zero Accident” circle activities, interdepartmental safety patrols, enhanced risk prediction training, and the effective use of the safety diary. Despite these efforts, accidents occurred over three consecutive months beginning with April 2014, prompting us to declare an emergency in June to pursue special safety activities. As part of these safety reinforcement activities, we consulted with every employee on safety, conﬁrmed the priority management tasks, re-emphasized the preventive measures for past accidents, and strengthened facility inspections. We sought to raise the level of safety for the entire plant by clarifying potential risk factors and improving our risk countermeasures. During our safety consultations, we spoke with a cumulative total of 668 employees (100% of target employees), clariﬁed 828 potential risks and implemented solutions (completed 100% of the improvements). In addition, we decided to conduct safety consultations on a regular basis. We also implemented special safety education for all onsite staff during the period of activities. We provided repeated training sessions for a cumulative total of 360 staff members until they achieved perfect scores in the conﬁrmation tests (implemented for 100% of targeted staff). In addition, we reinforced our risk prediction activities and re-emphasized pointing and calling. We were able to raise the safety awareness of all employees by posting our slogan for the special safety reinforcement activities and internally broadcasting safety precautions. As a result, we have maintained zero accidents since July 2014. There are no shortcuts to making safety our top priority and ensuring safety. Ever mindful of the Safety First philosophy, we will continue to raise and strengthen safety awareness among all employees. We are committed to steadfastly pursuing the creation of a truly safe workplace.

Another accident occurred on August 18 at the business site of Shizuoka Forklift Co., Ltd. in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, during reassembly of a tire rim, in which the side ring blew off as air was being pumped, resulting in the death of one employee. We are once again going back to the drawing board to work on our safety and health measures more aggressively than ever so that tragic incidents such as these will never happen again. Our Response to the Occupational Accident at Komatsu Castex Immediately following the accident, Komatsu set up an emergency headquarters and on May 2 established an Accident Investigation Committee, including three external specialists. The committee met seven times until November to investigate the cause of the accident and to deliberate on preventive measures. The Final Report of the Accident Investigation Committee was published on December 5 (for more information, please see the press release). In response to the accident, we plan to introduce permanent measures, including the convening of a Safety Assessment Meeting of Safety Assessment Ofﬁcers, which will include internal specialists, whenever equipment is being installed. Also in response to the recommendations of the Accident Investigation Committee, Komatsu Castex is striving to enhance the safety awareness of each employee by raising the standard of daily safety activities, such as risk assessment and safety diaries, implementing training for site supervising managers toward raising the level of health and occupational safety management, and internally sharing good practices.

Even if the other elements remain constant, if people change, the results will be different. Thus, people—the employees of Komatsu Group companies—are an irreplaceable asset for the Group. Komatsu recognizes the role of the personnel system in enhancing the quality and reliability of the company's human resources. It therefore endeavors to foster a work environment with opportunities for challenges and creativity. The company works to maximize the sum of trust given to it by its employees.

Personnel System that Accurately Reﬂects Employee Abilities and Achievements Personnel systems in Japan are typically based on the assumption that employees will work for a single company for many years. Therefore, when designing a system, a company must keep in mind the degree to which continuous employment should be considered. Komatsu believes that personnel systems emphasizing length of service do not necessarily reﬂect employees' abilities and achievements fairly. Instead, Komatsu has always strived to accurately evaluate the performance of employees as individuals, incorporating employees' achievements and abilities into its personnel system as the basis for fair evaluations. Fair and Appropriate Evaluation For a company to create a workplace environment where employees can work without undue KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 53 worries, it must treat employees fairly.

Fair and Appropriate Evaluation For a company to create a workplace environment where employees can work without undue worries, it must treat employees fairly. As described above, Komatsu's personnel system now takes into account employee abilities and achievement. Therefore, our challenge is to ensure that employee evaluations are fair and appropriate for each employee. For this purpose, in April 2004 the company organized refresher training for all managers on how to conduct evaluations. Since then, evaluation training has been given to newly appointed managers, backed by e-Learning based follow-up education. An evaluation committee has been established jointly with the labor union at each business unit to conﬁrm that evaluations are conducted properly. Komatsu has provided individual feedback on evaluations to managers since 1998 and to non-managerial employees since 2001. The company has also set up a consultation ofﬁce through which employees can express complaints and concerns. DATA All data except for (5) Number of employees (Komatsu Group) is data for Komatsu Ltd.

In FY2014, the seminar was held in October with the participation of eight executives representing subsidiaries in Brazil, Chile, Sweden, Indonesia, Thailand and China. The overall objective has been to deepen understanding of the KOMATSU Way based on Komatsu's corporate history, and of the company's approach to production, marketing and development, so that participants will be able to clearly convey the information as their own. We also provide Global Management Training for selected employees toward developing executive candidates capable of holding global leadership roles. About ten general managers with potential are selected every year in Japan as well as top managers at overseas subsidiaries for enrollment in short-term courses at international business schools. In FY2014, seven individuals attended training at the London Business School (England) and IMD (Switzerland). Management System In order to effectively promote global management, Komatsu runs various global meetings, including the Komatsu Global Executive Meeting convened for the top management of all Komatsu Group companies in Japan and overseas, management committees for each region and business area, and other meetings for speciﬁc purposes, such as the Quality Meeting; Occupational Safety, Health & Environmental Affairs Meeting; and Legal Meeting.

(BKC) I have been serving as the president of BKC since April 2013. In October 2014, I had the opportunity to attend the Global Management Seminar in Japan. During the seminar I was particularly impressed by the passion behind the KOMATSU Way. This experience gave me conﬁdence to fulﬁll my professional responsibilities. Global Management Seminar, October 2014 Komatsu management understands our situation and entrusts each individual to deliver the best results for the company. Each member of the management team contributes through leading by example. Since completing the program, I have personally vowed to become an example to my own organization. I was also impressed by the strong relationships that developed among all the participants in the course of the program. They had gathered from various regions and some of them were long-time Komatsu employees while others had just joined the company. We were able to exchange views from our different perspectives based on comparisons of our organizations. And in the end, we left with the conviction that we share in the powerful foundation of the KOMATSU Way. As a Thai national in top management, I have been working to strengthen the teamwork between Japanese staff in Thailand and local staff. Having each individual respect the spirit of the KOMATSU Way is an ideal approach. By doing so, we can work together toward the future as a united Komatsu team.

CSR Theme Promoting Women's Careers Approach and Goals Komatsu is committed to creating a working environment where female employees are able to demonstrate their capabilities. We actively support the career development of women by setting targets for the number of women hired, the ratio of female employees and the ratio of female managers (on a non-consolidated basis). In Japan, our goal is to increase the ratio of women in managerial positions to above 5% by April 2016. Systems and Status in FY2014 In 2014, we set up a study group by bringing together labor and management to consider measures for promoting women's careers and encouraging men to participate in childcare. We began offering career planning training for female employees in Japan in FY2014. The training focuses on business units in Japan and targets women who are at least thirty years old but are not yet in a managerial position. Participants review their past work experience and then consider career plans. The training has been conducted at the KOMATSU Way Global Institute in Komatsu City, Ishikawa Prefecture, with daycare provided to enable employees with young children to participate. We also created the “Corporate Guide for Women” to introduce Komatsu to female job-seekers at universities during recruiting efforts for FY2016. In terms of external recognition, Komatsu was selected as a Nadeshiko Brand company by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange as a listed company that excels in promoting career development for women. The commendation noted the number of women in managerial positions at Komatsu, including executive ofﬁcers, and the company's work-life balance initiative for actively promoting employee childcare and nursing care leaves regardless of gender. “Corporate Guide for Women” for FY2016 recruitment (left) and Nadeshiko Brand logo (right) DATA Women at Komatsu (employed at Komatsu Ltd. in Japan) KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 61 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 Diversity Initiatives KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 Developing People CSR Theme “Corporate Guide for Women” for FY2016 recruitment (left) and Nadeshiko Brand logo (right) DATA Women at Komatsu (employed at Komatsu Ltd. in Japan) FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 Number (ratio) of women employed 942(9.5%) 1,050(10.3%) 1,091(10.5%) Number (ratio) of women in 50(3.4%) 55(3.5%) 64(4.0%) management positions Number (ratio) of women in executive 2(4.3%) 2(4.7%) 2(4.7%) positions Number (ratio) of women hired* 30(12.0%) 32(15.0%) 20(10.9%) *Note: Data is for Komatsu Ltd.

FEATURES Nadeshiko Activities at Business Units in Japan Nadeshiko activities for quality control and kaizen efforts have been developed in each business unit in Japan by teams of mainly female employees. In FY2014, the Awazu plant in Ishikawa Prefecture celebrated the tenth anniversary of these activities, which were launched in FY2005. Twelve members from production, Members of the Nadeshiko Team at development, procurement and defense the Awazu plant systems are engaged in ongoing efforts to reduce costs and improve efﬁciency.

Initiatives to Support Women Working at Japanese Construction Sites Since the 1990s, the workforce in the Japanese construction industry has continued to shrink due to the aging population and a decrease in the number of new college graduates, which has given rise to concerns about a labor shortage. As a result, there are moves in the malecentric construction industry to increase the number of female workers. Komatsu Qualiﬁcation program for women at the Miyagi has launched its own activities to support Center of the Komatsu School for Construction Machinery Operation the advancement of women at construction sites. So that more women can take part in programs aimed at providing the necessary qualiﬁcations for operating construction machinery, we set up a course exclusively for women at the Komatsu School for Construction Machinery Operation. Our particular aim has been to support the Tohoku region, which is grappling with a serious shortage of labor for the ongoing reconstruction work required after the earthquake disaster that struck the area. We launched the initiative at the Miyagi Center and, on ﬁve occasions since December 2014, have held courses on forklifts and compact equipment. In addition to preparing facilities and equipment such as locker rooms and gear, we provide childcare services upon request and have earned praise for our efforts from the participants. We have also addressed the issue of toilets at the construction site by developing a temporary lavatory that is responsive to the needs of women through a joint effort between Komatsu Rental Ltd. and a toilet manufacturer. We are now working to introduce this lavatory to sites where women operate machinery. Employing Persons with Disabilities Approach and Goals Komatsu actively seeks to employ persons with disabilities across the Group. Our goal is to achieve an employment ratio of 2.3% on a consolidated basis (the current statutory employment ratio is 2.0%) for the Group in Japan by April 2018. In April 2008, Komatsu established the Business Creation Center (BCC) within the Human Resources Department in Japan as a dedicated organizational entity for promoting the hiring of persons with disabilities.

CSR Theme Employing Persons with Disabilities Approach and Goals Komatsu actively seeks to employ persons with disabilities across the Group. Our goal is to achieve an employment ratio of 2.3% on a consolidated basis (the current statutory employment ratio is 2.0%) for the Group in Japan by April 2018. In April 2008, Komatsu established the Business Creation Center (BCC) within the Human Resources Department in Japan as a dedicated organizational entity for promoting the hiring of persons with disabilities. Persons with mental or developmental disabilities are employed by the BCC in nine business units in japan. Advisors are assigned to each business unit to provide training and advice on daily tasks. Each BCC staff member meets with an advisor every six months to discuss goals, instead of simply handling a delimited set of tasks. Linking salary to individual performance assessments, we encourage employees with disabilities to work on their goals toward achieving independence and self-reliance. Through these efforts Komatsu is not merely focused on achieving a targeted employment ratio; it is seeking to create a workplace that provides a sense of fulﬁllment for all individuals, and where employees with disabilities work alongside other staff members. Status in FY2014 The employment ratio of persons with disabilities was 2.58% (for Komatsu Ltd. in Japan) as of April 2015. A total of 94 workers were employed by the BCC at nine business units in Japan. The BCC has expanded to begin taking on work that had previously been outsourced, as well as internal tasks that tend to be time-consuming. As a result, it has helped raise efﬁciency and reduce costs for the company.

Komatsu Ltd. has worked in coordination with labor unions on this issue to formulate numerical targets, which are now set at 2,100 or less working hours per year, and at least 17 days of paid vacation taken per year. Systems and Status in FY2014 In an effort to achieve appropriate working hours, every workplace in the Komatsu Group formulates a concrete action plan for reducing overtime and encouraging employees to take more of their paid annual leave, which in turn allows them to seriously consider and address working hour management on a daily basis. Childcare leave and shorter working hours are contributing factors in the creation of an environment that facilitates productive careers. In 2007, Komatsu was certiﬁed by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare to display the Kurumin Mark as a company that is supporting the development of the next generation. We subsequently launched the “Panel on Fostering Future Generations“ to further advance discussions on working conditions. As a result of our continuing efforts to expand our childcare support system, we were again granted use of the mark in 2010. We have continued these efforts through initiatives such as increasing periods of childcare leave (to a maximum of three years) in 2011, granting childcare leave for employees when a spouse is transferred, and increasing the subsidy for childcare support service expenses through the “Cafeteria Plan“ in 2013. Aside from our efforts to reduce working hours, we are also supporting the achievement of work-life balance for our employees through the “Life Support Leave System“ introduced in FY2014. Life Support Leave is separate from regular annual leave, in which employees can take paid time off for personal circumstances such as non-work related illness, pregnancy, childcare and family-care. An employee is allotted ﬁve days of this type of annual leave per year and may accumulate up to 40 days of annual leave. Also, in FY2013 we focused on family-care, and have introduced an allowance that can be received during family-care leave to provide ﬁnancial support. We have also launched an internal website that publishes information on family-care. Komatsu will continue to work on helping our employees achieve a healthy work-life balance.

By holding these values in common, employees of the Group can build global teamwork that transcends nationalities and generations to amass and fortify the Group's workplace (gemba) capabilities—the dynamism of all workers and the entire organization—plus the ability to improve their own workplaces. This in turn enhances quality and reliability, heightening the trust given to the Group by society and all stakeholders. System and Status in FY2014 The KOMATSU Way is based on the corporate strengths that Komatsu has cultivated over time. To disseminate the KOMATSU Way to Group companies across the world, focusing around the KOMATSU Way Global Institute, Komatsu is conducting various dissemination and human resource development activities. We deepen the employees' understanding and comprehension of the KOMATSU Way by applying it to their training and setting up opportunities for exposition and group debate. Regular sessions are convened at workplaces to explain this way of thinking and have employees relate stories of their own experiences so that communication between different generations is stimulated, which allows for this knowledge to be handed down and rooted in the younger generation. To promote the KOMATSU Way at Group companies outside Japan and help this foundation take root, Komatsu has made the KOMATSU Way easy to understand and relevant to local conditions, while being mindful of the differences among customs and cultures. Furthermore, by utilizing ICT (Information Communication Technology), Komatsu employees all over the world can browse KOMATSU Way-related information though a global portal site. Every month, the “K-Way.net“ is sent out, which posts KOMATSU Way analects, expositions and employee stories of actual experiences relating these topics. In 2011, Komatsu distributed a revised edition of the KOMATSU Way to all Group employees. The edition had been revised to make the established values and way of thinking more comprehensible by increasing the number of case studies. It also introduces Komatsu's approach to brand management with the concept of increasing trust and developing our relationship with customers, which is to say we ﬁll an irreplaceable role for them so that we will always be chosen as their partner.

We have designated the third Saturday of every October as “Technical Day” and hold all-Komatsu technical competitions on this day. Participants include employees from overseas subsidiaries and business associates, whose aim is to maintain and improve the Komatsu Group's technical capabilities by mutually dedicating themselves to their studies. In addition, Komatsu established the Meister system for passing down technical capabilities from the production site in FY2006. Techniques and skills that merit handing down are divided into 9 ﬁelds of 15 capabilities, and a First Meister is certiﬁed for each capability. Under Komatsu's Mother Plant System, production plants with product development capability are positioned as Mother plants, which are responsible for overseeing the safety, quality, cost and delivery of overseas Child plants that produce the same products. Meisters are certiﬁed for their high level of proﬁciency in speciﬁc technical areas and dedicate their time to guiding and nurturing engineers at plants in Japan as well as at overseas Child plants. Komatsu is also enthusiastically conducting improvement activities. Every year on the third Saturday of November, we hold the all-Komatsu quality control competitions, and similar to the technical competitions, many people from overseas subsidiaries and business partners in the supply chain participate.

We have two training programs for services personnel human resource development: internal human resource development for services support and distributor human resource development. We have created an internal training program called “Product Support College” for training our Japanese staff, and the Komatsu Human Resource Development Center for training essential personnel who will be working at future mining sites, and conduct planned training within departments and at overseas sites by rotation. Distributor human resource development, depending on the content, will be created or supported by the head ofﬁce, and for the basic courses on products and services, Komatsu provides the curriculum and training materials and conducts the training on site (at the local company and distributors). We also provide advanced courses by inviting senior managers and mechanics to Japan to conduct the training, and technical training provided by the local company's training center (mother training center) for more specialized training. We track each type of training via the LMS (Learning Management System) to continue making sure that we can see and fortify the services personnel's human resource development. For places that do not have a training system at the distributors, or if there is an urgent need for human resource development, Komatsu ﬁnds ways to efﬁciently develop human resources, such as by establishing a training center in Africa and working with local schools in Russia, Brazil and China to start a construction equipment training course. To further strengthen our distributor human resource development, in April 2014 we created the Department for Promotion of Distributor HR Development at the Komatsu Head Ofﬁce. We intend to continue developing our structure for providing long-term support to our distributors by clearly establishing our global development structure and performance appraisal standards in areas such as marketing, parts and services and by offering varied training systems and programs.

Become Invaluable to Our Customers, who Both Create and Assess Our Corporate Value Komatsu embodies this concept in our statement that “our corporate value is the total sum of trust given to us by society and all stakeholders.” We have made raising the company's corporate value the basic stance of management. If we group our various stakeholders into those who create corporate value and those who evaluate corporate value, the former role would fall to employees, business partners, and sales and after-sales service agents, and the latter would include society, shareholders, investors and the media. As we see it, only our customers take on both of these roles. Customers create and assess our corporate value and feed the result back to us. “Heightening the trust placed in us from our customers” was then deﬁned as “increasing the degree to which our company is indispensable to our customers and as a result continues to be selected as the partner of choice.” Initiatives in this regard for brand management activities have been underway since 2007. Realizing Our Customers' Vision and Mission “from the Customer's Perspective” Komatsu's basic policy regarding brand management activities is “from the customer's perspective.” People often think that marketing activities are about ways to differentiate one's products from those of competitors, and about positioning oneself in the market. However, this is not the case. Acting from the customer's perspective refers to the ideal and the mission of discovering what customers want and of responding to these needs. To realize this, we are engaged in activities designed to develop and improve our own management resources and capabilities on an ongoing basis. In the past, these initiatives tended to rely on experience and intuition, but in the context of Komatsu's brand management activities, we are now using a variety of tools and methods to develop case studies and accumulate know-how to pass on to the next generation. Recent Activities and Future Plans When we began in FY2007, the scope of our activities was limited to Japan, North America, Chile, South Africa and Australia. By FY2013, we had expanded these activities to include China, Southeast Asia, Europe, Brazil, Oman, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the forestry business.

However, this Brand Management Initiatives KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2015 is not the case.

To realize this, we are engaged in activities designed to develop and improve our own management resources and capabilities on an ongoing basis.

Recent Activities and Future Plans When we began in FY2007, the scope of our activities was limited to Japan, North America, Chile, South Africa and Australia. By FY2013, we had expanded these activities to include China, Southeast Asia, Europe, Brazil, Oman, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the forestry business. In FY2011, we declared our approach as the KOMATSU Way of relating to customers by compiling the “KOMATSU Way of Brand Management.” In FY2014, we sought to raise the standard of the comprehensive strengths of our distributors, overseas subsidiaries and Komatsu by holding Brand Management Meetings in Japan, Europe, Russia and North America, and Brand Management Conventions in Japan, China and the English-speaking regions. We also published a leaﬂet to more broadly build understanding and share best practices. The idea is not simply to raise sales and proﬁts and increase market share in the short term, but instead to use these activities to interact with customers and heighten customer trust by visiting their workplaces, while at the same time improving the skill levels of our employees and strength of our organization.

Upholding Thorough Compliance So that employees remain continuously aware of compliance, the Group is working to raise their consciousness of best business practices by displaying in every Komatsu Group business unit posters listing The Five Principles of Compliance, a condensed version of Komatsu's Code of Worldwide Business Conduct. The Group engages in awareness-raising initiatives, with a page dedicated to compliance on its intranet as well as well-developed compliancerelated education and training that corresponds to each employee rank and and their respective duties. The Group strives to detect risks early and implement reforms at Komatsu business units and Group companies through monitoring during ﬁnancial audits and compliance and risk audits. The monitoring covers compliance in highly important areas such as safety and environmental practices.

The company has adopted the following measures to counter these risks. Basic Principles and Structure for Risk Management • In addition to the basic policy for risk management to ensure business continuity and stable development, Komatsu has established Risk Management Rules to correctly recognize and manage risks. • Komatsu has established a Risk Management Committee to devise relevant policies for the entire Group, review the risk management system, and evaluate and improve upon response measures in place for each risk, as well as to take control of risks when they arise. The committee regularly reports on its deliberations and activities to the board of directors. • Komatsu will establish an emergency headquarters when serious risks occur and implement appropriate measures to minimize damage. Systems and Status in FY2014 Implementing a Business Continuity Plan for Komatsu In order to quickly conﬁrm the safety of employees and their families in the event of an accident or disaster, and to be able to continue or quickly restart important business operations, Komatsu has formulated a business continuity plan (BCP). In addition, at our head ofﬁce buildings and all production plants, we assume the possible occurrence of earthquakes and conduct regular training so that in the event of a disaster everyone will be able to act quickly and appropriately. Furthermore, at our production plants, we are working on seismic strengthening for buildings and equipment, as well as reinforcement against damage from torrential rains, according to the production plant's plans. Also, in case of an outbreak or epidemic of a new type of inﬂuenza, we will establish a special committee and take appropriate measures. For our employees we have compiled a manual with information regarding preventative measures and what actions to take in case of infection, and we also provide training sessions to promote a thorough understanding of these measures.

Conducting Compliance and Risk Audits As a part of its risk management activities, Komatsu has been conducting compliance and risk audits (CR audits) since FY2008. These cover areas not included in the J-SOX audits, which are conducted in accordance with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan to evaluate internal controls related to ﬁnancial reporting and identify potential compliance risks within the company, with a particular focus on conﬁrming and evaluating the status of legal compliance. Our internal specialist team conducts the internal audits at Komatsu and its Japanese and overseas afﬁliates, as well as at sites operated by independently-owned distributors. The audited items are: 1. Safety; 2. Environment; 3. Labor; 4. Finance and Treasury; 5. Quality Assurance and Recall; 6. Vehicle Inspections and Speciﬁc Voluntary Inspections (inspections done on construction equipment, similar to vehicle inspections); 7. Export Control; 8. Information Security; and 9.

Human Right Management Issues Komatsu signed the United Nations Global Compact in 2008. In an effort to apply its major principles for protecting human rights, Komatsu with the help of external experts conducted a human rights risk assessment for all of its construction/mining equipment and forestry machinery businesses worldwide in 2014, referring to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The results showed that the degree of urgency for problems occurring is low, while the degree of effect if a problem does occur is moderate. They also pointed to the need for Komatsu to move beyond its current assessment efforts toward evaluating the activities of partner companies, such as parts suppliers and our network of distributors that provide products and services to our customers. In light of the results, we intend to continue implementing the necessary measures.

Komatsu believes that engaging in CSR procurement will contribute to our business partners' expansion and therefore endeavors to do so in cooperation with our partners. Approach and Policy Komatsu's Procurement Policy Komatsu's basic policy is to produce a product in the area where there is demand for it. Out of the 39 plants that manufacture construction and mining machinery, 27 are located outside of Japan. In following with the manufacturing of machinery at an overseas plant, we are actively working on procuring parts and materials from the same area. Aside from engines and main components that are shipped everywhere in the world from Japan, and a few speciﬁc parts that are only supplied by specialized manufacturers, the overseas plants are on their own in terms of procurement, to promote local and optimal procurement for parts such as sheet metal. CSR Procurement Guidelines In 2011 we formulated the CSR Procurement Guidelines, which lay out key compliance and CSR information for all our business partners. We have posted the guidelines on our Japanese and English websites and are now making sure that our partners are aware of this information. Coverage of the CSR Procurement Guidelines The guidelines Guidelinesare areavailable availableon at:page 102.

At the regular meetings, where the management members of each company are present, such as the general assembly, general meetings and New Years' special meetings, Komatsu's top executives explain our policies, emphasize the importance of CSR management and request that awareness be raised in regard to CSR management. In North America, Europe and China, there are Midori-kai organizations made up of Komatsu's major business partners. We hope that these chapters will take advantage of the characteristics of each region to further expand their business activities. Support to Member Companies Komatsu supports Midori-Kai member companies in a variety of ways. Support activities during FY2014 are described below. Environment We are making certain certiﬁcations, such as ISO14001 and Eco Stage, mandatory, and directing and supporting efforts to obtain these certiﬁcations. In our efforts to reduce electricity consumption, we set a target for reducing electricity consumption by at least 15% from 2010 levels. We are also working to reduce energy consumption among business partners, focusing on implementing Komatsu's initiative (as part of our production system reforms) to reduce electricity consumption by 50% across our business partners. Safety We have implemented the Japan Industrial Safety and Health Association's Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Occupational Health and Safety Assessment for 97 companies, with Komatsu bearing the cost of the assessment fees, to request that each company increase the level of safety on their sites. In addition, we opened safety training centers in each Komatsu plant that our business partners can use so that their employees can experience simulated workplace hazards and be trained to anticipate dangerous situations. Personnel Development To develop young top management at our business partners, we hold “Management Salons” as occasions for Komatsu management and young top management to exchange views. With this approach we intend to develop “win-win” relationships with our business partners while aligning our respective management policies and implementing PDCA cycles. Furthermore, we select model companies as part of our efforts to support our business partners in overall improvement and advance their technological resources by capitalizing on Komatsu expertise toward strengthening their organizational capabilities.

Each company selects themes, such as safety, the environment, and advanced element technology, and then takes part in kaizen (improvement) activities in collaboration with Komatsu. Information on best practices is shared by all members in the group. In the area of safety, business partners emulate the strong points of other companies and keep an eye on each other to identify and respond to any problems that may arise. Management System Checking System for New Business Transactions and Agreements Komatsu uses a check sheet before it starts doing business with a new supplier, not only to conﬁrm basic conditions related to quality, cost and delivery, but also to verify their efforts in environmental protection and employee education. To conduct a business transaction in accordance with the CSR Procurement Policy, our basic agreement includes clauses pertaining to environmental protection and compliance.

We input the location and production content for each of the over 20,000 sites of all our partner companies to create a database for “visualization,” and assessed the degree of risk. In addition to considering prevention measures for each partner company that have higher levels of risk, the procurement staff will be able to consider risks from this aspect when considering new agreements, so that we can heighten the accuracy of the information. In the event of an emergency, we will dispatch security personnel from our plant to our partner companies—as we did following the Great East Japan Earthquake—to help support speedy production recovery. Conducting Audits Komatsu is striving to raise awareness of CSR among its business partners through safety, environmental and compliance audits. Policy and Actions Regarding Conﬂict Minerals Komatsu has adopted a policy of not using conﬂict minerals produced by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or its neighbors (Angola, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Southern Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia) from our corporate social responsibility perspective. During the regular meetings we hold with our suppliers at each Komatsu plant in Japan, we explained this policy as well as Komatsu's response to the conﬂict minerals issue and related requests to our suppliers. With the cooperation of suppliers, we conducted a country-of-origin survey to determine the location of origin of the conﬂict minerals we use. Looking ahead, we will continue taking steps to prevent the use of conﬂict minerals from the DRC and its neighbors and thereby restrict funding for military groups. We will immediately discontinue any use of conﬂict materials that we discover.

Various Areas and Forms of Support Developing Human Resources Tailored to Regional Needs Worldwide Using the know-how cultivated through our core business, Komatsu is supporting development of the kind of human resources that are needed, not only internally by our company, but for local communities. Expectations for human resources can vary greatly from community to community. At Komatsu, as we do business on a global scale, we try to understand what each community needs and work on providing that support accordingly, in various areas and in different forms. The pyramid graph below shows the different areas in which Komatsu is supporting human resource development. It also shows that the closer you get to the top of the pyramid, the more closely linked the program is with Komatsu businesses. The base of the pyramid shows our active support of activities such as science classes in elementary schools, mainly in different parts of Japan, the U.S.A. and Europe. The next level up is to provide basic education, which is support given to people who cannot or were not able to receive the level of education necessary to ﬁnd employment, due to circumstances speciﬁc to the country or region. We currently run such programs in Chile and South Africa. At the next level, we support universities and vocational training schools in many regions by providing Komatsu's curriculum and equipment, as well as instructors. At the top of the pyramid, we are working with national and local governments and with our customers to develop human resources, particularly in regions where human resource development is a social challenge. The actual content of the support given includes Komatsu providing instructors and trainers; providing teaching materials, equipment and facilities; accepting apprentices; and various other means through which the daily cultivated know-how can be put to best use.

Although the country was severely affected by the spread of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in FY2014, Komatsu has been supporting the training of construction machinery operators at a facility that was jointly constructed by the Japanese government and the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and opened in June 2014, just before EVD began to spread. Before it opened, four instructors from the facility visited Japan in May 2014 to learn about basic operations and maintenance of construction machinery at Komatsu. After returning to Liberia, they had to wait until the spread of EVD was contained before getting back to work. During that time, they supported the construction of a sanitary facility in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, applying the skills they had acquired in Japan. In the meantime, Komatsu continued to support them, including by responding to their technical questions by email. The construction machinery donated by Komatsu arrived in Liberia in April 2015. The machinery, alongside the expertise of the young instructors, is contributing alongside the cooperation of local dealers to the quality of training at the school, where the class has restarted. Komatsu will continue to provide its support with the cooperation of local distributors, including the training program itself, until the facility can be operated on its own.

(KIPL) CSR Activities and their Background in India At Komatsu India Pvt. Ltd. (KIPL) we carry out social contribution activities under the CSR policy formulated in FY2007. Following the policy's formulation by the Komatsu head ofﬁce, we revised it in 2010 and identiﬁed four priority categories: education, employment, social demands, and the environment. We conduct our CSR activities under these categories. Over this period, a major change occurred in the environment surrounding our CSR activities; the Companies Act was amended for the ﬁrst time in 57 years. Under the amended act, passed in August 2013 and enforced in 2014, companies that meet certain conditions are required to conduct CSR activities. The act speciﬁcally stipulates that companies must allocate at least two percent of their net income over the past three ﬁscal years to CSR activities in areas speciﬁed by the act. Companies are also required to establish CSR committees under their boards of directors, formulate policy, promote activities and disclose information. As for the background of this legislation, India is still facing very large social challenges in areas such as the environment, poverty and inadequate infrastructure, despite the rapid economic growth of recent years. It has been said that India is the ﬁrst country to legally mandate corporate CSR activities.

That same day, the president of Chile declared a state of catastrophe and a health alert for three northern regions of the country, affecting a population of roughly 1,750,000 people. Komatsu Cummins Chile Ltda. (KCC) responded to the situation and decided to execute its Disaster Relief Program, the activities of which the company has been continuing, as of June 2015. Here we report from an operational point of view on how these activities have been planned and implemented. Cities and towns that typically see little rain suffered severe damage.

Volunteer activities • Besides having equipment at no cost, it is advisable to organize corporate Volunteer Days to enable the assistance to victims of the disaster or have labor for other activities necessary for overcoming the emergency, such as cleaning, sorting aid, and childcare support. • Planning the Volunteer Days according to the requirements raised in Gemba is important, as emergency volunteers not having a task could be counterproductive (as well as the risk to which the volunteer is exposed). According to planning, assigning volunteers in teams of four people is suggested, with one leader in charge to provide a clear roadmap for each team. • Assigning roles for a Volunteer Day is important, as well as having a team (or person) manage and oversee the timely delivery of materials or resources (food, tools, transportation, etc.) required for volunteers to work effectively. • Training the volunteers prior to the intervention in the community is important in areas such as security, crisis intervention, basic principles of community relations, and a psychosocial description of the community that will be attended to. Vaccines are recommended for volunteers before going to the site, and hospitals as well as ﬁrst aid centers have identiﬁed nearby, which are operational. • Always maintain visibility and control over the related costs and expenses. At the present, June 2015, the area affected by the ﬂood in Northern Chile is gradually returning to normal in terms of basic services: Hospital infrastructure is almost 100% operational, potable water, sewage, and roads are 99% recuperated. In terms of housing, in the month of June the construction of 664 emergency homes were ﬁnalized, of which 66 were built in Los Loros. During this month the Master Reconstruction Plan was announced by the Government. This plan will allow proper coordination of public policies to advance the delivery of deﬁnitive housing solutions to families affected by the disaster plan. Our mining customer Caserones Lumins Copper has continued to support the Town of Los Loros, either through the debris removal; the channeling of the Copiapo River; carrying out work for the reconnection of the drinking water and sewer repair; and the delivery of basic kits (kitchen, dining room, bunk bed with mattresses, dishwasher, gas cylinder, among others) to families affected by the emergency. July is scheduled to begin a new phase of community work together with our client Caserones, which aims to strengthen local school education in Los Loros.
