Employee Training and Awareness Virtusa has in place several measures to ensure that employees are knowledgeable of all aspects of the corporate sustainability program. Employees are trained on corporate policies at On-boarding and must pass mandatory exams for confirmation of employment. Exams include Environment, Health and Safety, Business Continuity Management, Information Security, and Anti-Bribery and Corruption. In addition, several mediums are used to create awareness on different aspects of sustainability such as health and safety and good environmental practices. These include e-mail campaigns, social media, and special events such as Earth Hour and World Environment Day. Supply Chain Management We follow ethical practices in all our sourcing and attempt to ensure that our suppliers adhere to accepted standards in labor, human rights, environmental practices, and anti-bribery and corruption. We review our suppliers’ sustainability practices using the Virtusa Supplier Survey. During the reporting period we reviewed and updated our Supplier Regulations which set out the standards and practices that Virtusa’s Suppliers are required to uphold. Compliance with Laws and Regulations As a responsible corporate citizen, Virtusa adheres to the laws and regulations relevant to our operations. During the reporting period there were no instances of monetary or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and regulations related to any aspects of our business operations including human rights violations, labor practices, environmental regulations, and bribery and corruption. 9 Human Rights Assessment, Policy and Goals Virtusa is committed to ensuring the protection of human rights and maintaining a harassment-free workplace. Virtusa has several policies in place to ensure the protection of human rights. These policies include the Harassment-Free Workplace Policy, Sustainability Policy and the Social Responsibility Policy. As per our Social Responsibility Policy, Virtusa is committed to respecting human rights and will follow the framework laid down in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) as far as possible. Virtusa also has a Harassment-Free Workplace Policy to prevent against any form of discrimination based on age, race, color, national origin and ancestry, religion, sex or gender, sexual orientation, disability, and other areas protected by law. Our stringent code of conduct practices ensure protection of human rights. Implementation Employees are educated on all corporate policies such as the Harassment-Free Workplace Policy at On-boarding. We believe robust communication channels promote human rights expression and exchange. Thereby, we have institutionalized and internalized a formal communication framework tagged as “Work-Learn-Share-Connect”. This promotes clear, real time communication through the internet, intranet, video messages, Yammer groups, conference calls, team meetings, etc. Town Halls, Vircomm (20 types of sessions) and open houses are the secondary platforms used for sharing information on any domain of choice of the individual. Under the Virtusa Supplier Regulations, our suppliers are required to adhere to accepted standards in human rights practices. Measurement of Outcomes It is clear that when human rights are infringed, it affects employee engagement holistically. Therefore, human rights and employee engagement is tightly stringed to our PIRL values; these policy regulators have been institutionalized at critical employee touch points. These regulators serve as governance nodes and assessment measures for agile adoption. Above all, this engaging performance culture has built a positive impact on our organization's productivity, revenue and success parameters such as Employee Delight Index (EDI), Client Delight Index (CDI), Delivery Maturity Index (DMI) and Engineering Excellence. The bi-annual assessment and high knowledge scores on the adoption and practice of these values indicates the robust internalization of the PIRL values in our teams. Any complaints related to the infringement of the PIRL values and Harassment-Free Workplace Policy can be brought to the notice of the HR Partners appointed for each business unit. 10 Labor Assessment, Policy and Goals As a technology services company, child labor, forced labor and bonded labor are not significant risk factors in our operations. Our Social Responsibility Policy commits us to upholding the abolition of child labor and upholding the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. This is partly due to the open communication and cordial relations maintained with employees. Also, in India and Sri Lanka, where the majority of our workforce is, collective bargaining is not a common practice in white collar industries. Organizational Responsibility The Global Head of HR is responsible for all labor practices at Virtusa, with location HR leaders reporting to him. Within location HR, separate teams focus on specific areas such as recruitment, training, career development, and compensation and benefits. The HR team is also responsible for investigating any violations related to HR policies and procedures. Stringent HR risk audits are conducted in a timely manner. Implementation Employee Engagement & Communication Channels of employee engagement range from company-wide updates and town hall sessions to open social media fora such as Yammer. These are supplemented by multiple surveys such as the Internal Service Group Survey that allows employees to provide feedback on all service groups within the company. Employees also have the opportunity to provide their feedback through pulse check surveys conducted periodically during their career at Virtusa (e.g. Onboarding Survey, 5th Month Survey, 18 Month Survey, and Exit Survey). Employee Health & Safety We strive to provide a safe and secure work environment for all Virtusans. Our Advanced Technology Centers in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Colombo are OSHAS 18001 certified. Health and Safety committees at each location are responsible for the Environment, Health and Safety initiatives for their respective location. These committees consist of members from the HR and Admin teams, as well as volunteers from across the organization. Training on environment, health and safety is provided as part of our On-boarding program. Basic training on First Aid and Fire Safety are available to employees on a voluntary basis. 11 Measurement of Outcomes FY14 Total Workforce India Sri Lanka US & Europe US Other Singapore Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Permanent 3549 1421 1537 737 583 86 98 26 15 2 Cadre Contract 96 53 18 11 118 13 36 4 17 Outsourced 134 15 39 3 18 1 Table: Total workforce by employment type, employment contract, and region, broken down by gender FY14 New Hires India Sri Lanka US & Europe US Other Singapore Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Under 30 923 590 295 124 24 4 11 7 4 1 30–49 407 77 114 20 81 17 4 3 Over 50 1 5 221 29 40 3 1 Table: Total number and rate of new employee hires by age group, gender, and region FY14 Employee Turnover India Sri Lanka US & Europe US Other Singapore Age Group Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Under 30 453 215 166 96 11 2 11 3 30–49 322 78 76 22 48 7 8 7 2 Over 50 3 1 1 1 29 5 5 1 1 Table: Total number and rate of employee turnover by age group, gender, and region 12 Diversity India Sri Lanka US & Europe Non Heritage Singapore Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Tier 0–Tier 1 89% 11% 85% 15% 90% 10% 87% 13% 80% 20% Tier 2–Tier 4 69% 31% 66% 34% 85% 15% 79% 21% 100% Table: Percentage of employees by gender and by level FY14 Remuneration Ratios India Sri Lanka US & Europe Male Female Male Female Male Female Tier 0 1.04 1 0.94 1 1.32 1 Tier 1 1.09 1 1.05 1 0.95 1 Tier 2 1.07 1 1.15 1 0.96 1 Tier 3 1.04 1 1.18 1 1 Tier 4 1.12 1 1.11 1 1 Table: Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men FY14 Training Data India Sri Lanka US & Europe Tier 0 4.88 4.12 2.11 Tier 1 3.26 2.84 1.21 Tier 2 2.79 2.89 1.14 Tier 3 2.98 2.61 1.26 Tier 4 5.26 2.70 1.27 Tier 5 3.85 1.32 1.00 Table: Average hours of training per year per employee by gender and by employee category Note: We do not track training hours by gender as we provide equal training opportunities for our male and female employees. 13 Environment Assessment, Policy and Goals We are committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our products and services and have adopted a precautionary approach. As such, we have taken proactive steps by formulating effective policies to measure, manage, benchmark, and consistently improve our environmental performance. Our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint and adhering to all environmental regulations is set out in the following policies: Environment, Health and Safety Policy, Energy Policy, Climate Change Policy, Waste Policy, and Water Policy. Implementation Code Green, our internal branding for environmental management, was initiated in 2009. Code Green encompasses measures to manage the significant environmental aspects of our business operations: emissions, energy and water usage, and disposal of waste material. Since the inception of Code Green, we have improved our environmental performance consistently and achieved ambitious reductions in emissions, energy usage and water usage. International Standards Our ATCs in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Colombo, which constitute 87% of our real estate, is certified for ISO 14001 by the British Standards Institute. In addition, our Hyderabad Campus was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) India 'Gold' rating by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) in 2013. Organizational Responsibility The Facilities Management teams in each location manage day to day activities related to environmental management such as tracking emissions, energy and water usage, recycling activities, ISO14001 certification, and aspects of environmental reporting. Carbon Disclosure Project Virtusa has been responding to the Carbon Disclosure Project since 2011, and in 2013 we received a score of 74 out of 100. In 2014 our score increased to 84, which is 31 points higher than the supplier chain average for the year. Our Performance Band was “B”. Emissions Management We calculate emission using the guidelines of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol). The main source of emissions is from the usage of purchased electricity, and to a lesser extent from business travel (both air travel and road travel). Emissions from the usage of the diesel generator forms a minute percentage of our emissions. 14 Energy Management We initiated our energy management program in April 2008. We have optimized our energy usage through space and server consolidation as well as the use of building management systems (BMS), renewable energy sources and energy efficient products. In 2012 we implemented an initiative to convert the lighting system in the Sri Lanka, Hyderabad and Chennai facilities to LED. By the end of FY14, we had converted 70% of lighting to LED in Sri Lanka and 37% in Hyderabad. Lighting in the Bengaluru facility is 100% LED. We also a have a policy to hibernate or switch-off idle machines wherever possible. Business Travel Management We have reduced the impact from business air travel through the use of audio and video conferencing. An automated system helps to track and manage shuttle services provided for employees working late or during weekends. The use of optimized transport routes has also helped to reduce emissions from road travel. Emissions from business air travel reduced by 9.11% in FY14. However, emissions from road travel increased by 10.42% due to increased headcount and business requirements. Water Management As a services company, water is used mainly for drinking, hygiene, facility operations, and landscaping. Our main source of water is the municipal water supply and our operations do not significantly affect any local water body as water is not used for production. The water management data is for our operations in Sri Lanka, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. This data does not include drinking water, which we do not target for reduction. Strategies for water management include more efficient water usage in facilities maintenance and creating awareness among employees about conserving water. At present, we are able to recycle waste water only at the Hyderabad Campus where approximately 60% of water used is recycled, which amounts to 6.4 km3. E-waste Management The Sri Lanka ATC has in place a program where e-waste is handed over to a certified vendor, which is then shipped internationally for recycling. Virtusa is a member of the Co-operate E-waste Management Project initiated by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) of Sri Lanka. We are the first IT company in Sri Lanka to receive a Scheduled Waste Management License from the CEA. Apart from e-waste, no other types of waste was donated for recycling during the reporting period. Paper Usage We have reduced paper usage through several measures such as duplex printing with usage and paying for farmed paper. All departments are encouraged to use paperless forms, notifications and reports wherever possible. 15 Measurement of Outcomes External Verification and Audits Annual audits are performed as part of the re-certification process for ISO 14001. In FY14 our emissions calculations received limited assurance of ISAE3000 compliance by EY. Performance for FY14 84 Carbon Disclosure Project Score Carbon Disclosure Project score for 2014 was 84 and the performance band “B”. 18% Reduction in GHG Emissions Intensity of GHG emissions from scopes 1 and scope 2 reduced from 1.54 MTCO2eq per full time employee in FY2013 to 1.25 MTCO2eq per FTE in FY2014. 22% Reduction in Energy Usage Intensity of energy consumption per full time employee reduced from 176 kWh in FY13 to 136 kWh in FY14. 18% Reduction in Water Usage Per capita water usage reduced from 0.66 m3 in FY13 to 0.54 m3 in FY14. 1307 kg of E-waste Recycled 1307 kilograms of e-waste was donated for recycling. 63% of Paper Recycled Recycled 2487 kilograms of paper, which amounted to 63% of usage. 16 Performance since Baseline Year of FY11 GHG emissions per FTE (1) Energy Consumption 42% 2.50 38% (kWh/FTE/month) (2) 2.07 2.00 250 1.73 2.04 1.59 236 1.78 200 1.50 1.28 Virtusa 210 1.54 176 150 1.00 1.25 Industry 136 100 Benchmark 0.50 50 FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 Chart: GHG Emissions – Per Full Time Employee Chart: Energy Consumption – Per Full Time Employee Notes: Water Consumption 32% (KL/month/person) (3) • (1), (2): All ATCs (Approximately 90% of office space) (3): ATCs except Chennai. • All FTE figures taken average 0.79 0.79 for the year. During years of 0.66 growth this provides a more 0.54 conservative figure. FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 Chart: Water Consumption – Per Employee 17 Anti-Corruption Assessment, Policy and Goals Virtusa’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics provides the ethical and business standards by which Virtusa requires all of its employees to conduct themselves. The Code applies to all directors and employees worldwide. Day-to-day responsibility for administering the Code rests with the Compliance Officer who is also the General Counsel. A current copy of the Code is available at http://www.virtusa.com/investors/corporate-governance/. The Virtusa Anti-Bribery Policy implemented in 2012 was revised in 2013 with two policies being published: the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Policy and the Virtusa UK Anti-Bribery Act Policy. The policies set out a zero tolerance approach to acts of bribery and corruption, and reaffirms our commitment to complying with all relevant anti-bribery legislation wherever we do business. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics was updated to emphasize the importance of anti-bribery. These policies are applicable to all our employees in all locations. Implementation The above policies are supported by ongoing training programs and annual certification requirements for employees. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the anti-bribery policies are available on the corporate website. Employees and other interested parties can report any behavior that contravenes the Code of Ethics, any accounting irregularities or conduct that undermines the integrity of the Company’s financial statements or the Anti-Bribery policies using the Whistleblower Hotline, through a web-based submission tool or in writing. Complaints are forwarded to the Chairman of the Audit Committee as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of such complaints. More information on the Whistleblower Hotline is available in the Audit Committee Complaints Procedure at http://www.virtusa.com/investors/corporate-governance/. Measurement of Outcomes Virtusa’s Internal Audit Department periodically audits, monitors and reviews the extent of compliance with the Policy through scheduled, as well as random, Anti-Bribery Legislation Audits. 18 Global Compact Principles Category UNGC Principle HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.
