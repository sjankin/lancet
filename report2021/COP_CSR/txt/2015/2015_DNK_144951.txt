The internal control Certain events may prevent the Group from achieving its system contains clearly defined roles and areas of responsibility, objectives in whole or in part. The likelihood that such events will reporting requirements and procedures for attestation and occur is an element of risk of which the Group is well aware. Some approval. Internal controls are examined by the auditors and risks can be managed and/or reduced by the Group itself while reviewed by the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee. others are external events over which the companies have no control. The Group has identified and prioritised a number of risks based on a holistic approach. As part of the work with these issues, the Board of Directors receives a report on an annual basis. The greatest risk to accessibility is a prolonged interruption to a traffic link caused by a ship colliding with a bridge, terrorist activity or the like. The likelihood of such incidents is remote, but the potential consequences are significant. The potential financial losses for the Group from such events, including operating losses for up to two years, are, however, covered by insurances. Sund & Bælt’s objective is to ensure that safety on the links should be high and at least as high as on similar Danish facilities. So far, this objective has been met and the proactive safety work continues. The work is supported by regularly updated risk analyses. In partnership with the relevant authorities, Sund & Bælt maintains a comprehensive contingency plan, including an internal crisis management programme for handling accidents etc. on the company’s traffic facilities. The programme is tested regularly through exercises. Long-term traffic development is a significant factor in the repayment period for the Group’s debts, c.f. notes 23 and 24, where the calculations and uncertainty factors are described. In addition to the general uncertainties that are inherent in such longterm forecasts, there is a special risk related to adjustment to prices introduced by the authorities, e.g. in the form of EU directives. The introduction of road taxes may also impact on the bridges’ market position. Development in long-term maintenance and reinvestment costs is subject to some uncertainty too. Sund & Bælt works proactively and systematically to reduce such factors and it is unlikely that these risks will have a major effect on the repayment period. Work on holistic risk management has defined and systemised a number of risks linked to the company’s general operations. These include the risk of computer breakdowns or a failure of other technical systems, unauthorised access to computer systems, delays to, and cost increases for, maintenance work etc. These risks are handled by day-to-day management and the line organisation.

Additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports are laid down in the IFRS order issued pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act and NASDAQ OMX. The accounting policies are in accordance with those applied in the Annual Report 2013. The companies have elected to use the so-called Fair Value Option under IAS 39. Consequently, all financial assets and liabilities (loans, deposits and derivatives) are measured at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. Loans and cash at bank and in hand are classified for fair value measurement at first recognition in the balance sheet while derivative financial instruments are always measured at fair value, c.f. IAS 39. The rationale for using the Fair Value Option is that the companies consistently apply a portfolio approach to financial management, which means that the intended exposure to various financial risks is managed through different financial instruments, both primary instruments and derivatives. Accordingly, in the management of financial market risks, the companies do not distinguish between, for example, loans and derivatives, but solely focus on the total exposure. The choice of financial instruments for managing the financial risks could, therefore, result in accounting asymmetries were the Fair Value Option not used. It is the companies’ opinion that the Fair Value Option is the only principle under IFRS that reflects this approach as the other principles lead to inappropriate asymmetries between otherwise identical exposures depending on whether the exposure is established in the form of loans or the use of derivative financial instruments or requires comprehensive documentation as in the case with “hedge accounting”. As derivatives, financial assets and loans are measured at fair value, the measurement in the financial statements will produce the same result for loans and connected derivatives when the hedging is effective. Thus the company will achieve accounting symmetry. Loans without connected derivatives are also measured at fair value in contrast to the main rule in IAS 39 pursuant to which loans are measured at amortised cost. This will naturally lead to volatility in the profit/loss for the year as a result of value adjustments. The consolidated accounts and the parent company accounts are presented in DKK, which is also the Group’s functional currency. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are disclosed in DKK million. In order to assist users of the Annual Report, some of the disclosures required by IFRS are also included in the Management’s Report. Similarly, information that is not considered material to the financial reader is omitted New accounts adjustment With effect from 1 January 2014, the Group has implemented IFRC 10, 11 and 12, IFRIC 21 as well as amendments to IAS 32, 36 and 39. The following amendments to existing and new standards and interpretations have not yet come into force and are not applicable in connection with the preparation of the Annual Report for 2014: IAS 16, 19, 27, 38 and 41 as well as IFRS 9, 14 and 15. The new standards and interpretations will be implemented when they become effective. The implementation of IFRS 9 changes, among other things, the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. The implementation of this standard is expected to have an impact, but the overall effect has not yet been calculated. The implementation of the other standards and interpretations are not expected to have any financial effect on the Sund & Bælt Group's results, assets and liabilities or equity in connection with financial reporting for 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, when they are expected to enter into force. Recognition and measurement in general Assets are recognised in the balance sheet when, as a result of a previous event, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the value of the asset can be reliably measured. Liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when an outflow of economic benefits is probable and when the liability can be reliably measured. On initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. Subsequently, assets and liabilities are measured as described below for each individual item. Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trading day and recognition is discontinued at the trading day when the right to receive/settle payment from the financial asset or liability has expired, or when sold, and all risks and yields tied to the instrument have been transferred. In recognising and measuring assets and liabilities, any gains, losses and risks occurring prior to the presentation of the annual accounts that evidence conditions existing at the balance sheet date are taken into account. Income is recognised in the comprehensive income statement as and when it is probable that this will add economic benefit to the company. Equally, expenses incurred to generate the year's earnings are recognised in the comprehensive income statement, including depreciation, amortisation, impairment losses and provisions. Reversals as a result of changes in accounting estimates of amounts which were previously recognised in the comprehensive income statement are also recognised in the comprehensive income statement. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 39 Accruals Closing provisions have been made of all significant income and expenses. Consolidation The consolidated accounts cover the parent company Sund & Bælt Holding A/S and the wholly-owned subsidiaries A/S Storebælt, A/S Øresund, Sund & Bælt Partner A/S, Femern A/S, BroBizz A/S and A/S Femern Landanlæg. Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is recognised in the consolidated accounts according to the equity method whereafter the Group’s share of the annual results and equity, corresponding to 50 per cent, are included in the consolidated accounts. Any negative equity is recognised as a provision since Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is structured as a partnership with joint and several liability. The consolidated accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounts for Sund & Bælt Holding A/S and the subsidiaries by the addition of items of a uniform nature. The accounts on which the consolidation is based are submitted in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. On consolidation, elimination is made of internal income and expenses and internal balances. The parent company’s participating interests in the subsidiaries are offset against the corresponding equity. Newly established companies are included in the consolidated accounts from the time of establishment. Operating income Income from sales of services is included as the services are supplied and if the income can be reliably calculated and is expected to be received. Income is measured excluding VAT, taxes and discounts relating to the sale. Other income comprises accounting items of a secondary nature in relation to the company’s activities, including income from the use of fibre optic and telephone cables. Public subsidies Public subsidies are recognised when it is reasonably probable that the subsidy conditions have been fulfilled and that the subsidy will be received. Subsidies to cover expenses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement proportionally over the periods in which the associated expenses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. The subsidies are offset in the costs incurred. Public subsidies related to the settlement of the road and rail links are deducted from the asset’s cost. Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment, investments and intangible fixed assets are subject to an impairment test when there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (other assets are covered under IAS 39). Impairment losses are determined at the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the recoverable amount, i.e. the higher of an asset's net selling price or its value in use. The value in use is the expected future cash flows from the asset using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market return. In determining impairment, assets are grouped in the smallest group of assets that generate cash flows that are independent of the cash inflows from other assets (cash-generating units). See also note 24: Profitability. Impairment losses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. Tax on the year's result The company is covered by the Danish regulations concerning compulsory group taxation of the Sund & Bælt Group's companies. The subsidiaries are included in the Group taxation from the time they are included in the consolidated accounts and until such time when they may be omitted from the consolidation. Pursuant to legislation, the subsidiaries Sund & Bælt Partner A/S and BroBizz A/S constitute a separate joint taxation group. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S is the administrating company for joint taxation and therefore settles all tax payments with the tax authorities. Sund & Bælt Partner A/S is the administrating company for the special joint taxation group with BroBizz A/S. Balances under corporation tax legislation’s interest deduction limitation rules are distributed among the jointly taxed companies in accordance with the joint taxation agreement. Deferred tax liabilities relating to these balances are recognised in the balance sheet while deferred tax assets are recognised only if the criteria for recognition of deferred tax assets are met. Current Danish corporation tax is duly apportioned through payment of the joint taxation contribution between the jointly taxed companies in relation to their taxable incomes. In conjunction with this, companies with tax losses receive tax contribution from companies that used such losses against their own taxable profits. Tax for the year, which comprises the year’s current tax, the year's joint taxation contribution and changes to deferred tax – including the change in the tax rate is included in the comprehensive income statement with the proportion attributable to the year’s results and directly in the equity with the proportion attributable to the items directly in the equity. 40 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Current tax and deferred tax Sund & Bælt Holding A /S and the jointly taxed companies are liable for income taxes, etc. for the jointly taxed companies and for any obligations for withholding tax on interest, royalties and dividends for the jointly taxed companies. The same applies to the separate joint taxation group of Sund & Bælt Partner A/S and BroBizz A/S. Current tax liabilities and tax receivable are recognised in the balance sheet as computed tax on the year's taxable income, adjusted for tax on previous year's taxable income as well as for paid taxation on account. Tax owed and joint tax contribution receivable are included in the balance sheet under outstandings with affiliated companies. Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the balance-sheet oriented liability method of all interim differences between the carrying value and the tax value of assets and liabilities. In cases where the computation of the tax value can be carried out on the basis of the various taxation rules, the deferred tax is measured on the basis of the management's planned utilisation of the asset or the disposal of the liability. Deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax losses entitled to be carried forward are recognised under other non-current assets at the value at which they are expected to be used, either through the setting-off of tax on future earnings or by the offsetting of deferred tax liabilities, within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Balances under corporation tax legislation’s interest deduction limitation rules are distributed among the jointly taxed companies in accordance with the joint taxation agreement. Deferred tax liabilities relating to these balances are recognised in the balance sheet while tax assets are recognised only if the criteria for deferred tax assets are met. Adjustment of deferred tax is carried out relating to eliminations made of unrealised intra-group profits and losses. Net financials Net financials comprise interest income and expenses, realised inflation indexation, foreign exchange gains and losses on cash at bank and in hand, securities, payables, derivatives and transactions in foreign currencies. In addition, realised gains and losses relating to derivative financial instruments are included. The difference in the fair value at the balance sheet date represents the net financials which, in the comprehensive income statement, are split into financial income, financial expenses and value adjustment. Financial income and expenses comprise interest income, interest expenses and realised inflation indexation from payables and derivatives. Foreign exchange gains and losses and exchange rate translation for financial assets are included in the value adjustment. Financial expenses for financing assets in progress are recognised in the cost of the assets. Financial assets and liabilities Cash at bank and in hand, which includes bank deposits, are initially recognised at fair value in the subsequent measuring in the balance sheet. Differences in the fair value between balance sheet dates are included in the income statement under net financials. On initial recognition, all cash at bank and in hand items are classified as assets measured at fair value. Holdings and returns on treasury shares are set off against equivalent issued bond loans and are therefore not recognised in the consolidated accounts’ comprehensive income statement and balance sheet. Loans are recognised at fair value both at initial recognition and subsequently in the balance sheet. At the time of recognition, all loans are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through comprehensive income. Irrespective of interest rate guarantees, all loans are measured at fair value with ongoing income recognition of the fair value adjustments, stated as the difference in fair value between the balance sheet dates. The fair value of loans is stated as the present value of future and known and expected cash flows discounted at relevant rates, as there are typically no current and traded quotations listed for the companies’ issued bonds and no quotations are available for unlisted bond issuers and bilateral loans. The discounting rates used are based on market rates on the balance sheet date assessed to be available for the Group as a borrower. The fair value of loans with structural financial instruments attached are determined together and recognised and standardised valuation methods are used to determine the fair value of the option element in the interest and instalment payments where volatility on reference rates and foreign exchange are included. Loans falling due in more than one year, according to the contract, are recognised as non-current debt. Derivative financial instruments are recognised and measured at fair value in the balance sheet and initial recognition in the balance sheet is measured at cost. Positive and negative fair values are included in Financial Assets and Liabilities respectively, and netting of positive and negative fair values on derivatives is only made when the Group has the right and the intention to settle several financial instruments net. Derivative financial instruments are actively used to manage the debt portfolio and are therefore included in the balance sheet as current assets and current liabilities respectively. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 41 Derivative financial instruments include instruments where the value depends on the underlying value of the financial parameters, primarily reference rates and currencies. All derivative financial instruments are OTC derivatives with financial counterparts and thus there are no listed quotations on such financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments typically comprise interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options, FRAs and interest rate guarantees and swaptions. The market value is determined by discounting the known and anticipated cash flow. The discount rate is determined in the same way as loans and cash at bank and in hand, i.e. based on current market interest rates that are expected to be available to the Group as borrower. For derivatives with an option for the cash flows, i.e. foreign currency options, interest rate guarantees and swaptions, fair value is measured on the basis of generally accepted valuation methods where the volatility of the underlying reference interest rates and currencies are included. Where derivatives are tied to several financial instruments, a total fair value is determined as the sum of the fair value on each derivative. According to IFRS 13, financial assets and liabilities, which are recognised at fair value, must be attributable to a 3-layer hierarchy for valuation methodology. Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy includes assets and liabilities recognised on cash and available exchange rates. Next, level 2 valuation of assets and liabilities using quoted market prices as input to generally accepted valuation methods and pricing formulas. Finally, level 3 with assets and liabilities in the balance sheet that are not based on observable market data, and therefore require special mention. The Group has based fair value pricing on quoted market data as input to generally accepted standard valuation methods and formulas for all items, thus all financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value are included in level 2, see valuation hierarchies in IFRS 13. There were no transfers between the levels over the year. Foreign exchange translation On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the transaction date. Foreign exchange differences arising between the exchange rates at the transaction date and at the date of payment are recognised in the comprehensive income statement under financial income and financial expenses. Receivables and payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The difference between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and at the date at which the receivable or payable arose is recognised in the total comprehensive income statement under financial income and financial expenses. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, which have not been revalued to fair value, are translated at the time of transaction to the rate of exchange at the transaction date. Translation of financial assets and liabilities recognised in value adjustments and translation of receivables, payables etc. are included in financial income and expenses. Intangible fixed assets On initial recognition, intangible fixed assets are measured at cost. Subsequently, the assets are measured at cost less depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the expected useful life, not exceeding more than 5 years. Property, plant and equipment On initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price and any expenses directly attributable to the acquisition until the date when the asset is available for use. Subsequently, the assets are measured at cost less depreciation and impairment losses. During the construction period, the value of the road and rail links is determined using the following principles:  Expenses related to the links are based on contracts entered into, and contracts are capitalised directly  Other direct or indirect expenses are capitalised as the value of own work  Net financing expenses are capitalised as construction loan interest  EU subsidies received are set off against the cost price Significant future one-off replacements/maintenance work are regarded as separate elements and depreciated over the expected useful life. Ongoing maintenance work is recognised in the comprehensive income statement as the costs are incurred. Depreciation Depreciation on the road and rail links commenced when the construction work was finalised and the facilities were taken into use. The facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives. For the road and rail links across Storebælt and Øresund’s road link, the facilities are divided into components with similar useful lives.  The main part of the links comprises structures designed with minimum expected useful lives of 100 years. The depreciation period for these parts is 100 years.  Mechanical installations, crash barriers and road surfaces are depreciated over useful lives of 20-50 years.  Software and electrical installations are depreciated over useful lives of 10-20 years  Technical rail installations are depreciated over 25 years. 42 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S A/S Øresund's rail link is depreciated over a useful life of 100 years. As Banedanmark is financially responsible for the maintenance of this link and for normal reinvestments, no differentiation of the depreciation period has been made. Other assets are recognised at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the assets’ expected useful life: Administrative IT systems and programmes (software) 0-5 years Leasehold improvements, the lease period, but max. 5 years Acquired rights 7 years Other plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 5-10 years Port facilities and buildings at the ports 25 years Buildings for operational use 25 years Wind turbine facilities 25 years Amortisation and depreciation are recognised as a separate item in the income statement. The method for depreciation and the expected useful lives are reassessed annually and are changed if there has been a major change in the conditions or expectations. If there is a change in the depreciation method, the effect on depreciation going forward will be recognised as a change of accounting estimates and judgements. The basis for depreciation is calculated with due regard for the asset’s scrap value and is reduced by any depreciation. The scrap value is determined at the time of acquisition and is reviewed annually. If the scrap value exceeds the asset’s carrying value, depreciation ceases. Profits and losses in respect of disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the difference between the sales price less sales costs and the carrying amount at the time of sale. Profits and losses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement under other operating expenses. Other operating expenses Other operating expenses include expenses relating to technical, traffic-related and commercial operations of the links. These comprise, inter alia, expenses for operation and maintenance of technical plant, marketing, insurance, IT, external services, office expenses and expenses for office premises. Staff expenses Staff expenses comprise overall expenses for employees, the Management Board and the Board of Directors. The total expenses include direct payroll costs, pension payments, training expenses and other direct staff-related expenses. Staff expenses as well as payroll taxes, holiday allowance and similar costs are expensed in the period in which the services are performed by the employee. Operating leases Operating leases are recognised in the comprehensive income statement on a straight-line basis over the leasing contract’s leasing term unless another systematic method better reflects the lessee’s benefit within the contract term. Leasing contracts have been entered into with a leasing period of 1-9 years. Operating leasing comprises office premises and vehicles. Participating interests in subsidiaries Participating interests in subsidiaries are measured at cost or lower recovery value. Participating interests in jointly managed company Participating interests in the jointly managed company are measured in the balance sheet according to the equity method after which the proportion of the company’s carrying value is recognised. Any losses on the participating interest are recognised under provisions in the balance sheet. Securities Listed securities are recognised under current assets and measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Holdings of treasury shares are set off against equivalent issued bond loans. Inventories Inventories are measured at cost determined by the FIFO method or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost of merchandise, raw materials and consumables includes cost plus delivery costs. Net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the selling price less costs of completion and costs incurred to effectuate the sale, and determined with regard to marketability, obsolescence and development in the estimated sales price. Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at the amortised cost price. Trade receivables comprise amounts owed by customers and balances with payment Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 43 card companies. Write-down is made for expected bad debt losses. Receivables also comprise accrued interest in respect of assets and costs paid concerning subsequent financial years. Other receivables Other receivables are measured at the current value of the amounts expected to be received. Prepayments and accrued income Prepayments and accrued income comprise expenses paid concerning subsequent financial years. Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand comprise cash holdings and short-term bank deposits and securities which, at the time of acquisition, have a maturity of less than three months, and which can readily be converted to cash at bank and in hand and where there is only an insignificant risk of changes in value. Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost which usually corresponds to the nominal value. Pension obligations The Group has established defined contribution schemes and similar agreements for the majority of the employees. Defined contribution schemes are recognised in the comprehensive income statement in the period to which they relate and any contributions outstanding are recognised in the balance sheet as Trade and other payables. Any prepayments are recognised in the balance sheet under Receivables. Deferred income and accruals Deferred income and accruals comprise accrued interest and payments received concerning income in subsequent years. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of events in the financial year or previous years, and it is probable that the obligation will require drawing on the Group’s financial resources. Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the expenses necessary to settle the liabilities on the balance sheet date. Provisions with an expected maturity later than one year from the balance sheet date are measured at present value. With planned restructuring of the Group’s operations, provision is made solely for the liabilities relating to the restructurings, which, on the balance sheet date, have been decided in accordance with a specific plan, and where the parties concerned have been informed about the overall plan. Cash flow statement The consolidated cash flow statement has been prepared in accordance with the indirect method based on the comprehensive income statement items. The Group’s cash flow statement shows the cash flow for the year, the year's changes in cash and cash equivalents as well as the Group’s cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the year. Cash flow from operating activities is calculated as the profit/loss for the year before net financials adjusted for non-cash operating items, computed corporation taxes and changes in working capital. The working capital comprises the operating balance sheet items under current assets and current liabilities. Cash flow from investing activities comprises purchase and sale of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments. Cash flow from financing activities comprises the raising of loans, repayment of debt and financial income and expenses. Cash at bank and in hand comprises cash and short-term marketable securities with a term of three months or less at the acquisition date less short-term loans. Unused credit facilities are not included in the cash flow statement. Information on operations The Group’s operations are divided into Road, Railway, Ports and Ferry Services, Wind Turbines, Consultancy and Issuer Operations as evidenced by the Management’s Report. The operations comply with the Group’s risk as well as managerial and internal financial control. Reporting-based operations disclosure is prepared in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Income and expenses from operations comprise those items that are directly attributable to each operation as well as items that can be allocated to each operation on a reliable basis. Allocated income and expenses primarily comprise the Group’s administrative functions, tax on income, etc. Financial ratios The financial ratios have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Society of Financial Analysts' Recommendations and Financial Ratios 2010 . 44 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S The financial ratios given in the key figures and financial ratios summary have been calculated as follows: Profit ratio: Operating profit (EBIT) less other earnings in percentage of turnover. Rate of return: Operating profit (EBIT) less other earnings in percentage of the total assets. Return on facilities: Operating profit (EBIT) less other earnings in percentage of investment in road and rail link. Note 2 Significant accounting estimates and judgments Determining the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities requires an estimate on how future events will affect the value of these assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Estimates which are significant for the preparation of the financial statements are, for instance, made by making a computation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment of road and rail links and computation of the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities. Depreciation of road and rail links is based on an assessment of the main components and their useful lives. An ongoing estimate of the assets’ useful life is undertaken. A change in these assessments will significantly affect the profit/loss for the year, but will not affect cash flows and repayment periods. For certain financial assets and liabilities, an estimate is made of the expected future rate of inflation when calculating the fair value. Calculation of repayment periods is subject to significant judgement, see note 24, Profitability. In calculating relevant financial ratios and financial assumptions, the Group has made estimates in respect of the following significant parameters underlying the calculations: Repayment periods:  Real rate assumptions  Interest rate development  Traffic growth  Inflation  Reinvestments  Operating expenses Assessment of need for impairment write-downs (impairment test):  Discount rate  Traffic growth  Inflation  Capital return requirements  Terminal value  Beta (asset’s risk in relation to general market risk)  Asset’s risk compared to general market risk  Operating expenses The determination of fair value on financial instruments is based on estimates of the relevant discounting rate for the Group, volatility on reference rates and currency for financial instruments with an option for cash flows and estimates for the future inflation trend for real rate loans and swaps. The estimates made are as much as possible tied to tradeable market data and continuously adjusted to actual price indications, see note. 1.

Deferred tax will be offset as the underlying assets and liabilities are realised, including that the companies in the joint taxation under Sund & Bælt Holding A/S achieve positive taxable income. The Group has managed the construction of the fixed link across Storebælt and Øresund and during the construction phase, the companies realised tax losses in that the revenue base can only be realised when the links are ready to use. The use of the companies’ losses carried forward extend over a longer period than five years, but as the main components of the companies’ property, plant and equipment have an estimated service life of 100 years, it is deemed prudent to recognise the tax value of the losses carried forward without impairment.

(2013: DKK 1.039.1 million) is recognised in the income statement as Share of result in jointly managed company. Note 16 Financial income and expenses The Group recognises changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities through the income statement, c.f. accounting policies. The difference in the fair value between the balance sheet date constitutes the total financial income and expenses divided into value adjustments and net financing expenses where the latter comprises interest income and expenses. Net financing expenses comprise accrued nominal/real coupon rates, realised inflation indexation and amortisation of premiums/discounts while premiums and expected inflation indexation are included in the value adjustments. Value adjustments comprise realised and unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities and corresponding foreign exchange gains and losses.

Net financing expenses for the Group are DKK 281.9 million lower in 2014 compared to 2013, which is primarily related to the impact of a lower inflation level. Note 17 Receivables Trade receivables and services comprise amounts owed by customers and balances with payment card companies. As at 31 December 2014, payment card companies represent approximately 11 per cent of total receivables. As at 31 December 2014, included in the amounts owed by customers of DKK 282 million is a provision for unsecured claims of DKK 4.5 million, which constitutes the calculated risk of customer losses. The book value of receivables thus represents the expected realisable value. There are no significant receivables due that are not impaired. Receivables also comprise accrued interest in respect of assets, receivables in respect of affiliated companies and other receivables. 54 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Sund & Bælt Group 2013 2014 2014 2013 2.1 1.9 Sales and services 281.7 352.6 110.9 484.8 Group enterprises 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Affiliated company, Øresundsbro Konsortiet 15.0 10.5 Accrued interest, financial instruments 0.0 0.0 (see note 22) 364.6 410.1 0.8 0.1 Other receivables 301.6 155.9 113.8 486.8 Total receivables 962.9 929.1 Accrued interest 0.0 0.0 Deposits and securities 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Investments 2.7 3.5 0.0 0.0 Payables 0.1 17.1 0.0 0.0 Interest rate swaps 233.8 200.5 0.0 0.0 Currency swaps 128.0 188.5 0.0 0.0 Forward exchange contracts 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 Total accrued interest 364.6 410.1 Note 18 Derivatives The fair value adjustment of financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the comprehensive income statement. 2014 2013 Sund & Bælt Group Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Interest rate swaps 1,924.4 -4,531.9 1,545.8 -3,213.1 Currency swaps 1,389.0 -426.2 1,403.8 -295.4 Forward exchange contracts 1.0 -2.7 0.4 -6.3 Currency options 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total derivatives 3,314.4 -4,960.8 2,950.0 -3,514.8 2014 2013 A/S Storebælt Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Gross value derivatives 1,927.0 -3,348.5 1,828.1 -2,404.0 Accrued interest 240.9 -198.6 256.6 -255.2 Offsetting, c.f.

The Board of Directors determines an overall financial policy and an annual financing strategy, which regulates borrowing and liquidity reserves for specific years and sets the framework for the companies’ credit, foreign exchange, inflation and interest rate exposure. Financial risk management is also supported by operational procedures. The overall objective is to achieve the lowest possible financing expenses for the infrastructure facilities over their useful lives with due regard for an acceptable risk level as acknowledged by the Board of Directors. A long-term perspective has been applied in the balancing of economic performance and the risks associated with financial management. The following describes the companies’ funding in 2014 as well as the key risks. 58 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Funding All loans and other financial instruments employed by the companies are underwritten by the Danish state. In general, this means that the companies can achieve capital market terms equivalent to those available to the State, even if the companies do not have an explicit rating from the international credit rating agencies. The adopted financial strategy seeks to maximise funding flexibility in order to take advantage of developments in the capital markets. However, all loan types must adhere to certain criteria partly because of the demands from the guarantor and partly because of internal guidelines set out in the companies’ financial policy. In general, the companies’ loan transactions shall consist of common and standardised loan constructions that, as far as possible, limit the credit risk. The loan transactions do not contain any special terms that require disclosure with reference to IFRS7. In certain cases, lending itself can profitably occur in currencies in which the companies cannot expose themselves to currency risks (see below). In such cases, the loans are translated through currency swaps into acceptable currencies. Thus, there is no direct link between the original loan currencies and the companies’ currency risk. A/S Storebælt has established a standardised MTN (Medium Term Note) loan programme in the European bond market with a maximum borrowing limit of USD 5 billion of which USD 1.1 billion has been utilised. Thus, an available credit limit of USD 3.9 billion remains. In addition, the company has a Swedish MTN programme of SEK 5 billion of which SEK 0.6 billion has been utilised. A/S Øresund has also established a standardised MTN (Medium Term Note) loan programme in the European bond market with a maximum borrowing limit of USD 1 billion of which almost USD 50 million has been utilised. Thus, an available credit limit of USD 950 million remains. Since 2002, the companies have had access to direct loans from Danmarks Nationalbank on behalf of the Danish state based on a specific government bond, and subject to the same conditions under which the bond is traded in the market. In 2014, funding requirements were mainly covered by direct loans from Danmarks Nationalbank, which were a particularly attractive source of funding. A/S Storebælt raised direct loans to a nominal value of DKK 2.6 billion and A/S Øresund loans of DKK 0.7 billion. The extent of A/S Storebælt’s funding in any individual year is largely decided by the size of the repayments on the existing debt (refinancing) and the impact from operations. In 2015, such refinancing will amount to approx. DKK 4.1 billion, and the expected net borrowing requirements will be around DKK 3.6 billion. This is beyond what is needed for the financing of any extraordinary repurchase of existing loans. The extent of A/S Øresund’s funding in any individual year is largely decided by the size of the repayments on the existing debt (refinancing) and the impact from operations. In 2015, such refinancing will amount to approx. DKK 1.5 billion and the expected net borrowing requirements will be around DKK 1.6 billion. This is beyond what is needed for the financing of any extraordinary repurchase of existing loans. The companies have the flexibility to maintain a liquidity reserve of up to 6 months’ liquidity consumption with the objective of reducing the risk of borrowing at times when the general loan terms in the capital markets are temporarily unattractive. Financial risk exposure The companies are exposed to financial risks inherent in the funding of the infrastructures and linked to financial management as well as operational decisions, including bond issuance and loans from credit institutions, the use of derivatives and deposit of liquid funds for liquidity reserve, receivables from customers and trade payables. Risks relating to these financial risk exposures primarily comprise:  Currency risks  Interest rate risks  Inflation risks  Credit risks  Liquidity risks Financial risks are identified, monitored and controlled within the framework approved by the Board of Directors as determined in the companies’ financial policy and strategy, operational procedures and in accordance with the guidelines from the Danish Ministry of Finance/Danmarks Nationalbank, which has issued guarantees for the companies’ liabilities. Currency risks The companies' exposure to currency risks primarily relates to the part of the net debt denominated in currencies other than the base currency (DKK). Financial derivatives and liquid funds are recognised in the disclosure of the currency risk measured at fair value. A/S Storebælt’s currency exposure at fair value in DKK million 2014 and 2013 Fair value Fair value Currency 2014 Currency 2013 DKK -16,495 DKK -12,746 EUR -9,774 EUR -13,757 Other 71 Other 56 Total 2014 -26,198 Total 2013 -26,447 Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 59 Other Other EUR -0.3% -0.2% 37.3% EUR 52.0% DKK 48.2% DKK 63.0% A/S Øresund’s currency exposure at fair value in DKK million 2014 and 2013 Fair value Fair value Currency 2014 Currency 2013 DKK -9,299 DKK -7,824 EUR -3,785 EUR -4,671 Other 1 Other 1 Total 2014 -13,083 Total 2013 -12,494 EUR Other Other 28.9% 0.0% EUR 0.0% 37.4% DKK DKK 62.6% 71.1% The Danish Ministry of Finance has stipulated that the companies may have currency exposures in DKK and EUR. The companies’ currency risks are managed within the limits of the composition of the currency allocation and can be distributed with no constraint between DKK and EUR. Based on the stable Danish fixed exchange rate policy and the relatively narrow fluctuation band vis-a-vis EUR +/2.25 per cent in the ERM2 agreement, exposure in EUR is not considered to represent any substantial risk. The currency distribution between DKK and EUR will, over the coming years, depend on the exchange rate and interest rate relationship between the two currencies. In 2014, the companies reduced the proportion of EUR in the net debt as the repayment of the debt denominated in EUR was refinanced in DKK. Other currencies comprise AUD, JPY, NOK, USD and SEK, and are attributed to the hedging of bond loans in these currencies where premium/discounts in the currency swap result in an exposure based on market-to-market values although the cash flows are completely hedged. Foreign exchange sensitivity for A/S Storebælt amounted to DKK 41 million in 2014 (DKK 48 million in 2013) calculated as Value-at-Risk. Foreign exchange sensitivity for A/S Øresund amounted to DKK 16 million in 2014 (DKK 16 million in 2013) calculated as Value-at-Risk. Value-at-Risk for foreign exchange sensitivity expresses the maximum loss as a result of an unfavourable development in the exchange rate within one year, with a 95 per cent probability. Value-at-Risk has been calculated based on historical volatility and correlations within one year in the currencies that pose a risk. Interest rate and inflation risks The companies’ financing expenses are exposed to interest rate risks because of the ongoing funding for the refinancing of debts maturing, refixing of interest rates on floating rate debt and deposit of liquidity from operations and investments. The uncertainty arises as a consequence of fluctuations in market interest rates. 60 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S The companies’ interest rate risk is actively managed by several lines and limits, and the combination of these limits the interest rate risk on the net debt. For A/S Storebælt, the following framework for 2014 is applied in the interest rate risk management:  Interest rate refixing risk may not exceed 40 per cent of the net debt  Duration target on net debt is 3.5 years (variation limit:3.0-4.25 years)  Limits for interest rate exposure with fluctuation bands. For A/S Øresund, the following framework for 2014 is applied in the interest rate risk management:  Interest rate refixing risk may not exceed 45 per cent of the net debt  Duration target on net debt is 5.0 years (variation limit:4.0-6.0 years)  Limits for interest rate exposure with fluctuation bands. The companies' interest rate risk is actively managed through the use of interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives. Floating rate debt or debt with a short remaining maturity imply that the loan must have the interest rate reset at market interest rates within a given time frame, which typically involves higher risks than fixed rate debts with long maturity when fluctuations in the current interest expenses form the basis of the risk management. By contrast, financing expenses are usually a rising function of the maturity, and the choice of debt allocation is thus a question of balancing financing expenses and risk profile against fluctuations for the same. The debt allocation between fixed and floating rate nominal debt and real rate debt in conjunction with the maturity profile (maturity on the fixed rate debt) and the currency distribution comprise the uncertainty on the financing expenses. Besides representing an isolated balancing of financing expenses and interest refixing risk on the net debt, the companies’ risk profile is also affected by the correlation between revenue from operations and financing expenses. As a result, a debt composition with a positive correlation between revenue and financing expenses may involve lower risks when revenue and uncertainties from the companies’ assets and financial liabilities are assessed in combination. This correlation between revenue and financing expenses has been evident through the recent downturn when a sluggish trend in traffic revenues was offset by lower financing expenses. Typically, floating rate debt and the inflation indexation on the real rate debt have a positive correlation with general economic growth because monetary policy will often seek to balance the economic cycle by hiking interest rates when economic growth and inflation are high – and vice versa. The economic relationship between operating revenue and financing expenses justifies a relatively large proportion of floating rate debt. Developments in road traffic revenue, which is the primary income source, are particularly dependent on economic conditions and low economic growth typically entails low traffic growth, and thus a less favourable development in revenue. This revenue risk can, to a certain extent, be offset by a high proportion of floating rate debt in that adverse economic trends normally lead to lower interest rates, notably at the short end of the maturity spectrum. Fixed rate debt may, on the other hand, serve as a hedge against stagflation, with low growth and high inflation, which cannot be passed on to the tolls for crossing the bridge. In addition to the above considerations concerning the correlation to socio-economic developments, there is also an isolated balancing of financing expenses and interest rate refixing risk on the nominal debt. Furthermore, the companies have a strategic interest in real rate debt where the financing expenses comprise a fixed real rate plus indexation dependent upon general inflation. The reason is that operating income, by and large, can be expected to follow inflation developments as both road tolls and rail revenue are normally indexed. Real rate debt, therefore, represents a very low risk and functions as a hedge of operating revenue and the companies’ long-term project risk. Based on the overall financial management objective to attain the lowest possible financing expenses within a risk level approved by the Board of Directors – the companies have established a strategic benchmark for the debt portfolio’s interest rate allocation and the nominal duration. This benchmark serves as an overall guideline and a financial framework for the debt management and implies that the companies target a real rate debt allocation of 25-45 per cent and a duration of 3.5 years for A/S Storebælt and 5.0 years for A/S Øresund on the nominal debt. Maximum variation limits for the interest rate allocation and duration target are established. The basis for determining the strategic benchmark in the debt management is economic model simulations that estimate the outcome and expected earnings development of the companies’ assets and liabilities on a large number of relevant portfolio combinations with different interest rate allocations and maturity profiles, and consists of a balancing of financing expenses and revenue risk. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 61 Besides the above-mentioned strategic elements, the interest rate risk is also managed on the basis of the expectations for short-term interest rate developments. The duration of the strategic benchmark for 2015 was reduced for A/S Storebælt to 3.25 years. The target for the real rate debt ratio remained unchanged, but the term was extended by the partial repurchase of the bond issue maturing in 2019 and the simultaneous raising of direct loans in the state’s real rate bond maturing in 2023. For A/S Storebælt the actual duration was in the interval of 3.4-4.0 years, i.e. close to the upper limit of the strategic benchmark and the real rate debt ratio remained unchanged. A/S Storebælt has entered into interest rate swaps with fixed rate payment for the ongoing extension of the duration. For A/S Øresund, the duration of the strategic benchmark for 2015 was maintained as it was in 2014 and the target for the real rate debt ratio also remains unchanged. For A/S Øresund the actual duration was in the interval of 5.3-5.6 years, i.e. close to the upper limit of the strategic benchmark. The real rate debt ratio increased by DKK 200 million towards the end of the year, which is eqvivalent to offsets 2 per cent of the net debt. Contrary to consensus expectations at the start of the year, interest rates on longer maturities fell in Denmark and Europe by more than 1 percentage point in 2014. This was primarily driven by geopolitical unrest and uncertainty regarding global growth prospects coupled with low inflation and continued easy monetary policy. The development in interest rates has led to an unrealised loss of DKK 820 million for A/S Storebælt. The development in interest rates has led to an unrealised loss of DKK 913 million for A/S Øresund. . The management of the interest rate risk aims at attaining the lowest possible longer-term financing expenses with no specific regard for the annual fluctuations in the fair value adjustment. The fair value adjustment has, however, no impact on the companies’ economy, including the repayment period. The yield exposure on the net debt is based on the nominal value (the notional) split in time buckets at the earliest of the time to maturity or the time to the next interest rate refixing. Thus, the floating rate debt is included in the next financial year and shows the cash flow exposure to the interest refixing risk. The companies use derivatives to adjust the allocation between floating and fixed rate nominal debt and real rate debt, including, primarily, interest rate and currency swaps, FRAs, swaptions and interest rate guarantees.

As regards real rate debt, this is exposed to the Danish Consumer Price Index (CPI). The financing expenses’ sensitivity to an interest rate change of 1 percentage point can be estimated at DKK 23 million and the impact will be symmetrical since there is no optionality in the interest rate exposure. With the current inflation level of close to 0 per cent, sensitivity to a change in inflation will be asymmetrical as a “floor” has been is sold below for inflation below 0 per cent on a principal of EUR 190 million. An increase in inflation of 1 percentage point will increase financing costs by DKK 36 million while a corresponding fall in inflation would reduce financing costs by DKK 29 million. When interest rates change, this affects the market value (fair value) of the net debt and, in this respect, the impact and risk are greater on fixed rate debt with long maturities. This is primarily owing to the discounting effect and offsets the alternative cost or gain relating to fixed rate debt obligations in comparison to financing at current market interest rates. The duration denotes the average remaining maturity on the net debt. A long duration implies a low interest rate refixing risk since a relatively small proportion of the net debt needs to be reset to the current interest rate. The duration also expresses the interest rate sensitivity on the net debt stated at market value.

A/S Storebælt’s duration totalled 5.1 years at the end of 2014, of which 4.0 years relates to the nominal debt and 6.7 years to the real rate debt. Rate sensitivity can be calculated at DKK 13.4 million, when the yield curve is shifted in parallel by 1bp. This will imply a positive fair value adjustment in the income statement and balance sheet when interest rates rise by 1bp, and vice versa. 64 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Duration, A/S Øresund 2014 2013 Duration Duration (years) BPV Fair value (years) BVP Fair value 5.3 4.5 -8,439 Nominal debt 5.3 4.6 -8,552 12.3 5.7 -4,644 Real interest debt 11.6 4.5 -3,942 7.8 10.2 -13,083 Net debt 7.3 9.1 -12,494 Basis point value (BPV) expresses the rate sensitivity to a parallel shift in the yield curve of 1 bp. A/S Øresund’s duration totalled 7.8 years at the end of 2014 of which 5.3 years relate to the nominal debt and 12.3 years to the real rate debt. Rate sensitivity can be calculated at DKK 10.2 million, when the yield curve is shifted in parallel by 1bp. This will imply a positive fair value adjustment in the income statement and balance sheet when interest rates rise by 1bp, and vice versa. The sensitivity calculations have been made on the basis of the net debt on the balance sheet date, and the impact is similar in result and balance sheet as a result of the accounting policies where financial assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value. Credit risks Credit risks are defined as the risk of losses arising as a result of a counterparty not meeting its payment obligations. Credit risks arise in connection with the deposit of excess liquidity, receivables from derivative transactions and trade receivables. The credit policy for the deposit of excess liquidity has continuously been tightened with increased requirements for rating, credit limits and maximum duration to ensure diversification and limit exposure with individual counterparties. The size of the liquidity reserve is a balance between credit risk and attaining financing on favourable terms. The deposit of excess liquidity as bank deposits has been modest and undertaken solely with financial counterparties with high credit ratings. In addition, the companies have invested in German government bonds for pledging of collateral. There have been no incidents with overdue payments or impairment as a result of credit events on the companies’ cash flow. The companies’ derivative transactions are regulated by an ISDA master agreement for each individual counterparty. It is explicitly set out that netting of positive and negative balances will apply. The credit risk on financial counterparties is managed and monitored on a daily basis through a specific line and limit system which has been approved by the Board of Directors in respect of the companies’ financial policy and determines the principles for calculating these risks and limits for acceptable risks. The allocation of limits for acceptable credit exposures is determined on the basis of the counterparty’s lowest long-term rating by either Standard and Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) or Fitch Ratings. The credit risk is limited to the greatest possible extent by diversifying the counterparty exposure and reducing the risk exposure on individual counterparties. The financial counterparties must adhere to high standards for credit quality and agreements are only entered into with counterparties that have a long-term rating above A3/Aunless rigorous collateral requirements are met and the country of the counterparty meets the rating requirements of at least Aa2/AA, after which a rating of a minimum of Baa2/BBB is acceptable for the counterparty. The companies have entered into collateral agreements (CSA agreements) with the majority of the financial counterparties and since 2005 have only entered into derivative contracts that are regulated by such agreements. The CSA agreements are two-way and imply that both the company and the counterparty must pledge collateral in the form of government bonds or mortgage bonds with high credit quality when the balance is in favour of one of the parties. The parties have title of right to the collateral with mandatory return of income and securities in the absence of bankruptcy. Credit exposure is effectively limited by a rating-dependent threshold value for unhedged receivables and greater collateral is required for counterparties with lower credit quality, among other things as a result of a rating-dependent threshold value of 0 for financial counterparties with a rating in the A-category and the requirement for additional collateral for lower ratings. The bonds, provided as collateral, must have a minimum rating of Aa3/AA-. A process has been initiated to make collateral agreements conform to the market standard, which should be seen in light of the fact that the companies are not covered by EMIR's central clearing obligation for derivative transactions. The financial counterparties are offered a two-way collateral agreement with a symmetrical threshold value of 0 in order to restrict the liquidity premium in derivative transactions. Previously, collateral agreements were entered into with a rating-dependent threshold value, which in practice meant that the companies, by virtue of their high credit quality, should only pledge collateral when the counterparty exposure exceeded a threshold value of EUR 65 million while the financial counterparties had EUR 10 million or 0 in threshold value with a rating of Aa/AA or lower. The majority of the companies’ financial counterparties are located at the low end of the rating scale as a consequence of the increasingly protracted financial and economic crisis. Solvency among the companies’ financial counterparties is deemed to be intact and predominantly covered by collateral. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 65 The IFRS accounting standard stipulates that the credit risk is calculated gross excluding netting (offsetting of positive and negative balances with the individual counterparty), unless there is an intent and a legal right of set off. Net exposure is disclosed as additional information and is a better measure of the companies' actual credit risk.

In order to avoid significant fluctuations in the refinancing for individual years, the objective is for the principal payments to be evenly dispersed.

Interest payments are recognised at agreed terms and implicit forward interest rates and inflation form the basis for the variable interest payments and inflation indexation. Repayments, principal amounts and interest payments are disclosed for the net debt and neither refinancing nor cash flows from operating activities is included, c.f. IFRS 7. Note 24 Profitability A/S Storebælt A/S Storebælt’s debt will be repaid from the revenue from road and rail traffic. For calculating the repayment period, a real rate of 3.5 per cent was previously used as the basis for the long-term profitability calculations. This assumption was last revised in 2006. In the light of recent years' interest rate developments and the subdued expectations going forward, the real rate prior to the 2014 financial statement was reduced to 3.0 per cent. The repayment period has improved by one year to 31 years compared to the most recently published repayment period, which was estimated at 32 years in the 2014 interim report. Here, A/S Storebælt’s rail fee was reduced by DKK 200 million with effect from 2015 under the political agreement concerning the growth package. As a consequence, the repayment period was extended by one year to 32 years. The reason why the repayment period has once again been reduced to 31 years is due to the higher traffic forecast for 2015 and, to a lesser extent, the reduction in the real rate. A/S Storebælt expects to pay dividend to the Danish state of DKK 9.0 million (2008 prices) until the financial year 2022. This is part of the cofinancing of the political agreement on “A green transport policy”, as decided by the Danish parliament on 29 January 2009. In 2014, DKK 900 was paid in dividend, and a similar amount is expected to be paid out in the coming years. The main uncertainties in the profitability calculations relate to the long-term traffic development and the real rate, which is estimated at 3.0 per cent. Traffic growth is expected to average 1 and 1.5 per cent for lorries and private cars respectively. Operating expenses are expected to rise in line with inflation. Moreover, there is some uncertainty in relation to the size and timing of reinvestments in the rail link. A/S Øresund Investments in the Øresund fixed link’s landworks will be repaid partly through fees from Banedanmark for use of the Øresund rail line and partly through dividend payments from Øresundsbro Konsortiet of which A/S Øresund owns 50 per cent. Moreover as a consequence of the joint taxation with the Group’s other companies, A/S Øresund obtains a liquidity benefit. This benefit is achieved because joint taxation with A/S Storebælt means that A/S Storebælt can utilise the tax loss in A/S Øresund in return for paying the proceeds of the tax savings to A/S Øresund. A/S Øresund can thus advance the use of its tax loss over time. A/S Øresund expects to assume responsibility for maintenance of the Øresund line and associated reinvestments from Banedanmark during the second half of 2015. The impact of the increased costs in the form of maintenance expenses and investments has been included in the repayment period. For calculating the repayment period, a real rate of 3.5 per cent was previously used as the basis for the long-term profitability calculations. This assumption was last revised in 2006. In light of recent years' interest rate developments and the subdued expectations going forward, the real rate prior to the 2014 financial statement was reduced to 3.0 per cent. The repayment period for A/S Øresund is now calculated at 45 years, which is 3 years shorter than the previous year. The main explanation for this can be attributed to the reduced real rate. A/ S Øresund is sensitive to changes in the economy of the above two companies.

Work under contracts amounted to DKK 380 million (DKK 338 million in 2013). Operating leasing comprises contracts with a maturity of between 1-9 years. The leasing liability totals DKK 177.6 million (DKK 95.6 million in 2013) of which DKK 30.5 million falls due in 2015. In accordance with the Act on Ferry Operations, the company is required to maintain to a defined extent car ferry operations between Zealand and Jutland across Kattegat and between Spodsbjerg and Tårs. For the Spodsbjerg and Tårs service, this means that the company has signed a contract with Danske Færger A/S concerning the operation of the service until 30 April 2018. In 2015, the costs are expected to total DKK 43 million. In 2013, the Court of Arbitration ruled in the case brought by an Italian contractor who was involved in the construction of the Storebælt Bridge. The case concerned claims relating to the abolition of AMBI back in 1992. The Arbitration Board absolved A/S Storebælt of liability and ordered the Italian entrepreneur to pay the costs incurred as a result of the case, including DKK 1.5 million in legal costs for A/S Storebælt. The Italian contractor has not yet paid these costs to A/S Storebælt, which is why A/S Storebælt has initiated a judicial recovery of the debt in Italy. The Italian contractor has also taken A/S Storebælt to the Civil Court in Rome claiming that the Court of Arbitration’s ruling should be declared invalid. The management is of the view that the contractor is not entitled to compensation at the Civil Court either. On this basis, no amount has been allocated in the accounts to cover this. In connection with the authorities’ approval of Sprogø Offshore Wind Farm, A/S Storebælt is obliged to dismantle the wind turbines 25 years from the date of establishment. At the present time, it is not possible to estimate the financial implications. In cooperation with the Ministry of Transport and Banedanmark, the intention is for A/S Øresund to assume responsibility for the maintenance of the Øresund railway and associated reinvestments from Banedanmark during the second half of 2015. The impact of the increased costs in the form of maintenance costs and investments is included in the specified repayment period contained in note 24. 70 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S The EU Commission has ruled on the complaint concerning state aid to Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S. The Commission found that Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is covered by the rules on state aid, but that the specific state aid in the form of state guarantees and, in Denmark's case, the special tax rules are compatible with the EU Treaty. Scandlines Øresund has brought the European Commission's decision concerning Danish state aid for Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S to the European Court of First Instance. The case also includes the tax rules to which the Sund & Bælt Group is subject. A number of complaints have been filed with the European Commission concerning Danish state aid for Fehmarnbelt. The complaints also include the tax rules to which the Sund & Bælt Group is subject. On this basis, the European Commission has asked the Danish authorities for a detailed response to the accusations. A/S Storebælt and A/S Øresund have entered into two-way collateral agreements (CSA agreements) with a number of financial counterparties and are, as a result, obliged to provide collateral by way of depositing bonds for outstandings on derivative contracts in the counterparty’s favour. A/S Storebælt has currently provided collateral of DKK 1,248 million for outstandings with 3 different financial counterparties in their favour. A/S Øresund has provided collateral of DKK 231 million for outstandings with a financial counterparty in its favour. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S is the management company in a Danish joint taxation. According to corporate tax legislation, the company is jointly and severally liable, from and including 2013, with the other jointly taxed companies for overall corporation tax of DKK 0 million and from and including 1 July 2012 for any liabilities for withholding tax on interest, royalties and dividend for the jointly taxed companies.

If adopted, it means that Femern A/S and A/S Femern Landanlæg will be authorised to construct and operate respectively, a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt and the Danish landworks, as well as to carry out the steps necessary for implementing the projects. The total construction budget, including reserves comprise DKK 55.1 billion for the coast-to-coast link and DKK 9.6 billion for the Danish landworks (2015 prices). The repayment period for the entire installation is expected to be 39 years, based on the assumptions made for traffic, revenues, operating costs and financial expenses. The Danish government will provide an assurance from the State Treasury for the liabilities in relation to loans and other financial instruments. Moreover, and without further notification of each individual case, the Danish state will guarantee the companies’ other financial liabilities, such as those undertaken in the context of the construction project. Also at the end of February, the bill for the Act concerning an amendment to the law on Sund & Bælt Holding A/S, the Act on the planning of the fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt with associated landworks in Denmark and the Corporate Tax Act were presented to parliament. The bill also contains an abolition of the special tax rules that currently apply to Sund & Bælt Holding A/S, A/S Storebælt, A/S Øresund, Femern A/S and A/S Femern Landanlæg. The special rules relate to loss carryforwards, depreciation rules and tax exemption on free transfer of loans between the companies. The abolition of the special rules means that all companies in the Group will, with effect from 1 January 2016, follow the tax legislation’s ordinary rules. The amendment to the rules is deemed not to significantly affect the Group's economy. Scandlines Øresund etc. have brought the European Commission's decision concerning Danish state aid to Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S before the EU Court of First Instance. The case also covers the taxation rules to which the Sund & Bælt Group is subject. A number of complaints have been made to the European Commission concerning Danish state aid to the Fehmarnbelt. The complaints also include the taxation rules to which the Sund & Bælt Group is subject. On this basis, the European Commission has asked the Danish authorities for a detailed response to the complaints. Apart from this, there are no events of importance to the Annual Report for 2014 that occurred after the balance sheet date.
