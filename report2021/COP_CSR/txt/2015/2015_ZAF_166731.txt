It impedes economic growth, distorts competition and represents serious legal and reputational risks. It has a major impact on poor communities and corrodes the very fabric of society. As a signatory of the UN Global Compact (UNGC), RBPlat is committed to incorporating the UNGC principles in our Board’s decision-making processes. In terms of corporate governance and risk management we are working to ensure that we apply Principle 10, which states that businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. The prevention of fraud and corruption is good business practice. We have taken a number of steps to mitigate fraud and corruption risks in our business and our operating environment and continually review their effectiveness.

The BRPM JV is an unincorporated joint venture and is consolidated into the group. Auditor’s responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and separate financial statements based on our audit.

The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Disposal of Concentrate Agreement financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the The Disposal of Concentrate Agreement regulates the terms on which RBR disposes of its share of the concentrate produced by the BRPM circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.

Risk and ownership passes to RPM once the concentrate leaves the gates of the concentrator plant.

Thereafter, while RBR retains the right to sell 50% of the BRPM JV concentrate to RPM for the life of BRPM it is also entitled to terminate the relationship on 11 August 2017 by giving written notice by no Opinion later than 11 August 2015.

IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held-for-sale and Discontinued Operations Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. The amendment clarifies that, when an asset (or disposal group) is reclassified from ‘held for sale’ to ‘held for distribution’, or vice Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure versa, this does not constitute a change to a plan of sale or distribution, and does not have to be accounted for as such.

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as There are two amendments to IFRS 7. transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in 1. Servicing contracts equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. If an entity transfers a financial asset to a third party under conditions which allow the transferor to derecognise the asset, IFRS 7 requires disclosure of all types of continuing involvement that the entity might still have in the transferred assets. In the Company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments. Cost also includes directly attributable IFRS 7 provides guidance on what is meant by continuing involvement in this context.

Cost includes development cost following the completion of an economic evaluation equivalent to a pre-feasibility study. This economic expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. evaluation is distinguished from a pre-feasibility study in that some of the information that would normally be determined Pre-production expenditure, incurred to establish or expand productive capacity or to support and maintain that productive in a pre-feasibility study is instead obtained from the existing mine or development. This information when combined with capacity incurred on mines, is capitalised to property, plant and equipment. The recognition of costs in the carrying amount existing knowledge of the mineral property already being mined or developed allows the Board to conclude that more of an asset ceases when the item is in the location and condition necessary to operate as intended by management. Any net likely than not the Group will obtain future economic benefits from the expenditures. income earned while the item is not yet capable of operating as intended, reduces the capitalised amount. Interest on borrowings, specifically to finance the establishment of mining assets, is capitalised during the construction phase. 2.5 Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest The present value of decommissioning cost, which is the dismantling and removal of the asset included in the environmental method, less provision for impairment. A provision made for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is rehabilitation obligation, is included in the cost of the related assets and changes in the liability resulting from changes in the objective evidence, e.g. when amounts are overdue for a significant period of time, that the Group will not be able to collect estimates are accounted for as follows: all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.

The difference in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of processing to concentrate as the final product and selling expenses. between the proceeds received and the carrying amount of the house is recognised in profit and loss as a gain or loss on disposal of employee housing. 2.10 Impairment of assets 2.10.1 Non-financial assets 2.4 Exploration and evaluation assets Assets that are subject to depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances Exploration and evaluation assets acquired are initially recognised at cost. Once commercial reserves are found, exploration indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

No amortisation is charged during the exploration and the asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use is less than the carrying amount. An impairment loss is evaluation phase. recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

Group accounting policies (continued) 2.13.2 Loans and receivables 2.11 Revenue recognition Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets except for maturities greater than 12 months after the Income is recognised on an accrual basis when it is probable that both the economic benefits associated with the transaction statement of financial position date.

In terms of the Group’s concentrate offtake agreement Subsequent measurement revenue is therefore recognised on the delivery of concentrate to RPM. Where material is concentrated through a tolling agreement, revenue is also recognised once that concentrate is delivered to RPM. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. In terms of the agreement, the commodity prices and R:US$ exchange rates used in the calculation of the concentrate 2.13.3 Receivable from employees for housing assets payment are based on the average daily rates for the third month following the month of delivery. Payment is due on the last Initial recognition day of the fourth month following delivery. When the employee housing assets are sold to employees, the Group recognises a financial asset receivable from the employee at fair value. The best evidence of the receivable’s fair value on initial recognition is the transaction price. The adjustment to trade debtors to reflect the actual amount to be received for concentrate sold is recognised through However, due to the employees paying a preferential interest rate of CPI plus 1%, the fair value may differ from the revenue. transaction price. The Group therefore determined a market-related rate for the financial asset based on an average Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking account of the principal outstanding and the effective rate over the credit profile per band of employees to determine the effective interest rate for this receivable. The Group recognises period of maturity, when it is probable that such income will accrue to the Group. the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price as an employee benefit. The effective interest rate for the receivable from employees for housing assets is based on a market related interest rate based on Subsequent measurement average credit profile per band of employees. The financial asset receivable from the employee is accounted for at amortised cost (recognised at fair value on initial recognition and transaction cost) using the appropriate effective interest rate as determined above. Levy income is recognised on an accrual basis as it is invoiced every month and is classified as other income for the Group. For the financial asset receivable from the employee, the portion to be realised within 12 months from the reporting Dividend income is brought to account as at the last day of registration in respect of listed shares and when declared in period is presented as part of current assets, the balance of the amount is presented as a non-current asset in the respect of unlisted shares. statement of financial position. 2.13.4 Borrowings (liabilities at amortised cost) 2.12 Leases Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings Determining whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement, and requires an are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between proceeds (net of assessment of whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period arrangement conveys the right to control the asset. of the borrowing. Leases of assets under which substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are expensed to profit or loss on the straight-line basis over the life of the lease. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be (or group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which termination takes place. relevant period.

Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as part of other income when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. Subsequent measurement Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are subsequently measured at the quoted current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific inputs. 212 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2014 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2014 213 SUMMARY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) for the year ended 31 December 2014 2.

If the employee’s service period differs from the initial expectation on occupation Income generated from the treatment of stockpiles generated from the on reef development tonnes is treated as revenue. The cost date, the change in expectation is recognised as a profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. The portion of of sales associated with this revenue excludes any extractions costs (which form part of development capital expenditure) and the short-term employee benefit to be realised within 12 months from the reporting period is presented as part of current includes only the marginal rehandling and processing costs. assets, the balance of the amount is presented as a non-current asset in the statement of financial position. Stoping 2.22 Foreign exchange transactions As part of the ramp-up phase of Styldrift l project stoping will commence whilst other parts of the mine are still being developed. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of The costs incurred during stoping, i.e. the tonnes mined when Styldrift enters the stoping phase, will be capitalised to inventories. the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of These tonnes and their associated costs will not form part of the capital project cost but will be shown as current assets under such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in inventories (stockpiles). As these stockpiles are treated, the costs thereof will be expensed to cost of sales and the associated foreign currencies, are recognised in income under other income. revenue will be reflected in revenue in the statement of comprehensive income. Development costs during the ramp-up phase will continue to be capitalised as part of the project. 2.23 Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decisionProduction maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the Once Styldrift l project commences with its production phase, all operating costs will be expensed as cost of sales with the operating segments, has been identiﬁed as the Executive Committee that makes strategic decisions. associated revenue shown in the statement of comprehensive income. Ongoing development costs, e.g. the equipping of new levels, will be capitalised. At the production stage, the project will be commissioned and the asset will move from capital work in 3. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions progress to mining assets and will be depreciated over the life of the Styldrift l project shaft on a unit of production basis. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom Environmental rehabilitation obligations (Note 20) equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below: The Group’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. The Group recognises management’s best estimate for asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are Goodwill (Note 7) incurred. Actual costs incurred and actual timing thereof in future periods can differ materially from the estimates. Additionally, Goodwill was calculated as the difference between the purchase consideration for the 67% interest in the BRPM Joint Venture and future changes to environmental laws and regulations, life of mine estimates and discount rates can affect the carrying amount of the Group’s share of net assets acquired when the Group assumed control over BRPM upon listing on 8 November 2010. No this provision. goodwill was attributed to non-controlling shareholders’ interest. Estimated long-term environmental provisions, comprising pollution control, rehabilitation and mine closure, are based on the Goodwill is allocated to BRPM. The recoverability of goodwill was assessed using the fair value less costs to sell methodology based Group’s environmental policy taking into account current technological, environmental and regulatory requirements. Provisions for on the in-situ value for 4E resource ounces outside the life of mine plan and the net present value of the current life of mine plan future rehabilitation costs have been determined, based on calculations which require the use of estimates. using the following assumptions: Key assumptions used were: For mineral rights included in life of mine plan and mining assets the following key real long-term life of mine prices were used: 2014 2013 > Platinum US$1 777 per ounce (2013: US$1 905 per ounce) Current cost estimate R (million) 206.1 179.5 > Palladium US$945 per ounce (2013: US$920 per ounce) Real pre-tax risk free discount rate (%) 4 4 > A long-term real rand/US dollar exchange rate of R11.00/US$1 (2013: R9.64/US$1) > A real discount rate of 7.5% (2013: 7.5%) Share-based payments > Life of mine of 30 years (2013: 30 years). The Group has various share-based payment plans in place. All share-based payment schemes are treated as equity-settled and therefore measured on grant date. If all assumptions remain unchanged then a decrease of 2.4% (2013: 2.0%) in the sales prices will result in a break-even position. Alternatively if all assumptions remain unchanged, a 1.3% (2013: 2.3%) increase in the discount rate from 7.5% to 8.8% will result Bonus share plan in a break-even position. As can be expected the margin is small as the assets were fair valued in 2010. The Company has established a bonus share plan (BSP) for its executive directors and senior managers, which is linked to the employee’s annual cash bonus. The Remuneration Committee of the Company is responsible for operating the BSP. Mineral rights outside the life of mine plan For in-situ 4E resource ounces a value of US$10 per 4E ounce (2013: US$10 per 4E ounce) was used. This was based on Following the announcement of the Company’s audited annual results, employees participating in the BSP are awarded a number of independent experts’ views of the value of these resources at the time of the listing of the Company.

Segmental reporting The Group is currently operating one mine with two decline shafts and the Styldrift I project. These operations are located in the North West province of South Africa, 120 kilometres from Johannesburg, 30 kilometres from Rustenburg and 17 kilometres from Phokeng. With the increase in the capital spend and progress on the Styldrift 1 project, it was decided to show BRPM and Styldrift I as separate segments from 2014 onwards. In addition, due to the different nature and significance of the employee home ownership scheme, it was also decided to show housing as a separate segment. The Executive Committee of the Company is regarded as the chief operating decision-maker. 238 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2014 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2014 239 240 Corporate Corporate BRPM Styldrift BRPM JV RBPlat office and BRPM JV RBPlat office and mining mining mining housing consolidation Total mining housing consolidation Royal Bafokeng Platinum segment segment segment segment adjustment 2014 segment* segment adjustment 2013 R (million) R (million) R (million) R (million) R (million) R (million) R (million) R (million) R (million) R (million) Concentrate sales 3 761.9 5.6 3 767.5 – – 3 767.5 3 251.1 – – 3 251.1 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED Houses sold to employees – – – 129.9 (129.9) – – – – – Cash cost of sales (2 363.9) – (2 363.9) – 37.2 (2 326.7) (2 092.8) – 36.0 (2 056.8) Integrated Report 2014 Cost of housing assets for employees – – – (129.9) 129.9 – – – – – Depreciation (258.8) – (258.8) – – (258.8) (262.7) – – (262.7) Movement in inventories 10.4 – 10.4 – – 10.4 6.6 – – 6.6 Other operating income 20.2 4.6 24.8 0.4 – 25.2 76.8 – – 76.8 Share-based payment expenses (non-cash) (21.8) – (21.8) – (19.5) (41.3) (35.8) – – (35.8) 33.
