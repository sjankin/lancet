(+27% passengers), Copenhagen (+146% passengers) and Vienna (+18% passengers). Nevertheless, Luxair Luxembourg Airlines still has difficulty developing its unit revenue and profitability. There is still a significant drop in the number of “high-yield” passengers (business class passengers or passengers holding tickets allowing maximum flexibility). Nevertheless, for the first time Luxair Luxembourg Airlines has managed to stabilise this drop in the business class sector (a continual drop had been noted since 2008). “Leisure” tickets or trips for personal reasons continue to be the most popular option for Airline passengers. 59% of all “point to point” tickets sold in 2014 were Primo tickets, which are economy fare tickets sold at a starting price or available during special promotions. With a turnover of EUR 155 million, a 15% rise compared to 2013, Airline activity closes with operational losses of EUR 8 million, which is less than the EUR 12 million loss in 2013. 16 Annual report 2014 17 Perspectives for 2015 Although the situation tends to be improving for long-haul flight operators, performance of ­regional European transporters will still be af­ fect­ed by the current difficult economic conditions, according to IATA. Nevertheless, Luxair continues to develop its airline activity and pursues its efforts to boost its flight plan and its capacities. The introduction of a new Boeing 737-800 to the fleet means that a Boeing 737-700 will be avail­ able to operate certain flights to regular des­ tinations from the beginning of 2015. So that passengers will be able to travel more comfortably on a selection of flights to Rome, Nice, Madrid, Munich and Barcelona, whilst benefiting from increased seat capacity. An additional flight to London City as well as increased flights to Stockholm, Dublin, Hamburg, Bari and Venice will optimise the range of products available. Airline activity reported a passenger increase of 19% in 2014 Confirmed consolidation 4,679 LuxairTours operator sold a total of 4,679 charter, flight only or all-inclusive package holiday flights in 2014. 20 Annual report 2014 LuxairTours 2014 proved to be a year of consolidation at LuxairTours had a turnover of EUR 242 million LuxairTours with a slight increase in capac(+1.5%) and managed to optimise its profitability (+2%) and relative stability in passenger ity by +7% compared to 2013. numbers (-0.4%).

In the same way, special offers were less suc­cess­ ful in 2014 and “grouped seat reser­vations” by third-party travel agencies dropped by 17% in 2014 (following the 8% decrease registered in 2013). On the other hand, demand for “flights only” increased by 5% in 2014 after a 10% increase in 2013. This mainly reflects significant demand for Spanish and Italian destinations. The share of direct sales also increased by 5%. LuxairTours sold 4,679 flights, a figure ­slightly The share down compared to 2013 (-0.3%).

However, the 2014 increase did not enable LuxairCARGO to reach levels handled before the recession. Since 2011, Luxembourg airport has lost its position as the fifth European air-freight platform. It oscillates between the seventh and eighth position. Airports which ­ host the European platforms for specialised inter­national express delivery and transportation operators (UPS in Cologne, TNT in Liège and DHL in Leipzig) have overtaken Luxembourg in this sector. Turnover increased by 3% to reach EUR 78 million. The number of aircraft movements increased by 4% to reach 5,038. The air-freight handling activity, historically a driver for LuxairGroup profitability, registered an end of year profit of EUR 1.7 million, as in 2013.

LuxairCARGO Business Unit’s development of pharmaceutical product handling required the introduction of new training programs in the same way. The general increase in activity for all operational units, as well as the difficult task of organising on-site training, due to the diversity of jobs and disparity of working hours, has led Luxair to extend its range of on-line training courses, which explains the increase in the number of hours of training per employee. The percentage of female representatives holding top management positions could not be improved in 2014. However the proportion of female staff members has increased slightly in managerial positions, which shows that efforts towards greater diversity are being made. In a wider perspective, LuxairGroup HR policy aims for flexibility, mobility and promotes the integration of disabled people. 50 Annual report 2014 51 People making up LuxairGroup: snapshot of the company at 31 December 2014 Parental leave, maternity leave, unpaid leave Seniority Ground staff and crew Residence 35-39 years 0.9% / 24 Other European countries Maternity Unpaid Belgium 0.5% leave leave 30-34 years 2.3% / 57 2.9% EU 25-29 years 4.0% / 102 2 / 0.1% 40-44 years B 50 22 Crew 210 Ground 13% L Parental leave Part-time maternity leave 20 y staff Luxembourg Germany 8.3% -24 87% 63.7% 12.2% 55 21.4% France 5 ea r 49 24 15 -19 y s 543 20.7% D ea rs 0-4 y ea r s F Total 145 21.9% 20.1% Nationalities Flexible or fixed Change to s 5 -9 ar working times permanent contract ye Luxembourgish French Portuguese German Others Belgian 10 ye 786 588 579 264 214 101 -1 20.9% 4 ar s FLEX 52 0 9 51 Apprenticeships 2 31% 23% 23% 10% 8% 4% 19% Determined contracts 34 Average age FIXE Adem* contracts 3 516 539 519 436 81% Total 39 376 Distribution Departures and hirings 273 Active staff members LuxairGroup Male % Female % Departures Hirings 210 Permanent contracts 2,268 Management 88 12 Permanent contracts 115 42 Fixed term contracts 249 Employees 74 26 Fixed term / seasonal contracts 121 297 95 92 Apprenticeships 6 10 Apprentices 100 0 Apprenticeship 2 4 4 1 Adem* Employees 0 100 Adem* contracts 1 2 Internships 7 0.2% 3.8% 8.3% 14.8% 20.4% 20.5% 17.2% 10.8% 3.6% 0.4% 0.0% Trainees 29 71 Internships / students 185 190 Adem* contracts 2 15 -2 4 -2 9 -3 4 -39 -44 49 -5 4 -59 64 69 Total 2,532 -19 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Total 75 25 Total 424 535 * measures aimed at job creation
