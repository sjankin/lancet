Insurance A In Nov. 2014, DGB Financial Group acquired the stakes of NongHyup (NH) Financial Group in Woori Aviva Life Insurance and renamed Issue 1 Launch of DGB Life Insurance it DGB Life Insurance, proclaiming the official launch of its 6th subsidiary after appointing a new CEO.

We have been able to diversify the sources of income and create new synergy among affiliates. Management All this will serve as a foothold for another round of take-off as a truly comprehensive financial group. Q Please tell me more about the status and sales activities of DGB Life Insurance. A We should say the business of DGB Life Insurance was launched back in 1988, then with the name of Busan Life Insurance. Later on, the company had to change its name from Hansung to Lucky, and to LIG whenever it had new owners. Now, with its long business history for more than 27 years, DGB Life Insurance has begun to make a renewed growth to become a life insurance company loved by all, regardless of regions or generations, as part of DGB Financial Group; it was incorporated into the Group as of Jan. 2015. DGB has KRW 5.0865 trillion in assets with 38 branches in 14 regions nationwide, employing a total of 250 workforces and 1,000 insurance planners. The corporate vision of DGB Life Insurance is to be a “Life Partner Trusted by Customers”. To come closer to the vision, we are pushing 3 major missions selected for this year: choosing, focusing, and securing strategically important regions; developing customer-tailored products and providing superior services; and pursuing sustainable growth through smart management control. Management Philosophy • Corporate Philosophy: Sharing Dream and Prosperity with Local Communities • Vision: Life Partner Trusted by Customers • Mission: To promote customers’ financial, physical, and psychological security • Core Value: Service, Integrity, and Passion Q What are the key strategies and plans of DGB Life Insurance for 2015? A We will take Daegu and Gyeongbuk as key posts since the brand “DGB” has a better awareness in the two areas with a loyal customer base. Thanks to bancassurance (the selling of insurance products by a bank to its customers), we aim to earn KRW 1.9 billion in net profit. The Group will create a win-win strategy to maximize synergy, and will focus more on developing the next key posts to raise DGB brand awareness. Interview Regional financing leads to a generation of new income source and a new round of donation. In other words, it contributes to the economic, social, and environmental development of the region, either directly or indirectly. To become a sound financial institution enhancing the quality of life of all the residents in Korea, it should improve the organizational culture to better respond to changes outside; it should maximize synergy among affiliates, and should keep focusing on developing more competitive strategies and products. I expect DGB Financial Group to emerge as a key player to financially support each and every person in Korea. Park, Jae-seok, Dept.

The unit was set for each phase, we are going to fulfill our role as a fast follower of the future financing. later united with another loan-related dept. to form “Loan Business Unit” whose main mission is to find new sources of income for the future. In addition to this, a new TFT named “Future Finance Response Council” was formed at the group level to continue to develop ideas on the future finance; the TFT consists of 12 professionals from different internal departments (e.g. Banking Strategy, Marketing, and IT) and other affiliates such as DGB Data System and U-payment. Interview Now, any business in the non-financial sector may start financial services and the overall financial market environment is rapidly changing recently. That results in fiercer competition, more complex ways of business, and more diversified financial products. In order to respond to such shifts, I believe the Group should make itself distinctive, on a basis of relationship banking, with newly-developed regionally-engaged services and products. And, it should also take Smart Finance as a new opportunity to aggressively expand its market and customer base beyond the local area. To that end, small-but-strong businesses should be further nurtured, and fair practice in lending loans should be promoted. Financial products contributing to the public good and environment should be developed and launched. With all this in the background, the Group should fulfill its social responsibility as a financial institution (e.g. privacy protection); then, it will secure the customer trust and competitiveness of the Group. I have much expectation over the diversification strategy and synergy with DGB Life Insurance. But it will only be possible when it unfolds based on sustainable finance. I hope DGB Financial Group will stand firm as a truly glocal (global+local) institution as well as a leading company contributing to the local community.

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. 2. Basis of Preparation (e) Changes in accounting policy (a) Statement of compliance Except as described below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in Note 3 to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (“K-IFRS”), as prescribed in the Act on External Audits of Corporations in the Republic of Korea. The Group has applied the following amendments to standards and interpretation, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2014. The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors on February 4, 2015, which will be submitted for approval to the shareholders at a Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities (Amendments to K-IFRS No. 1032) meeting to be held on March 20, 2015. Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets (Amendments to K-IFRS No. 1036) K-IFRS 2121 ‘Levies’ (b) Basis of measurement The nature of the changes are explained below. The change had no significant impact on the measurements of the Group’s assets and liabilities. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following material items in the consolidated statements of financial position: (i) Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities (Amendments to K-IFRS No. 1032) derivative financial instruments measured at fair value financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss measured at fair value The Group has adopted amendments to K-IFRS 1032, ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’ since January 1, 2014. The amendments clarify the meaning of 'currently available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value has a legally enforceable right of set-off'. According to the amendments, the right to set off should not be contingent on a future event, and legally enforceable in the normal course liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements measured at fair value of business, in the event of default, and in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity and all of the counterparties. The amendments also state that some gross settlement ‌liabilities for defined benefit plans recognized at the net of the total present value of defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets and systems would be considered equivalent to net settlement if they eliminate or result in insignificant credit and liquidity risk and process receivables and payables in a single unrecognized past service costs settlement process or cycle. (c) Functional and presentation currency (ii) Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets (Amendments to K-IFRS No. 1036) These consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean won, which is the Parent Company’s functional currency and the currency of the primary economic environment in The Group has adopted amendments to K-IFRS 1036 ‘Impairment of Assets’ since January 1, 2014. The amendments require the disclosure of information about the recoverable which the Group operates. amount of impaired assets, if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal. They also require the disclosure of additional information about that fair value measurement. In addition, if the recoverable amount of impaired assets based on fair value less costs of disposal was measured using a present value technique, the amendments also require the (d) Use of estimates and judgments disclosure of the discount rates that have been used in the current and previous measurements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with K-IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application (iii) K-IFRS No. 2121, ‘Levies’ of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Group has adopted K-IFRS No.2121, ‘Levies’ since January 1, 2014. K-IFRS No. 2121 is an Interpretation of K-IFRS No. 1037 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in on the accounting for levies imposed by governments. K-IFRS 1037 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement for the entity to have a present any future periods affected. obligation as a result of a past event (or ‘obligating event’). K-IFRS 2121 clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. (i) Uncertainties of assumptions and estimation Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included in the The interpretation does not provide guidance on the accounting for the costs arising from recognizing the liability to pay a levy. Other K-IFRSs should be applied to determine following notes: whether the recognition of a liability to pay a levy gives rise to an asset or an expense. Note 14 – Allowance for loan losses Note 24 – Provisions Note 25 – Defined benefit obligations Note 46 – Commitments and contingencies (ii) Measurement of fair value The valuation team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of K-IFRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified. 104 105 DGB Financial Group 2014-2015 Integrated Sustainability Report DGB FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT AREAS: STRATEGY & BOARD OF DIRECTORS FINANCIAL SECTION APPENDIX GROUP PROFILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ZOOM-IN DGB PERFORMANCE Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3. Significant Accounting Policies Interests in associates and the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised initially at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and OCI of equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence The significant accounting policies applied by the Group in preparation of its consolidated financial statements are included below. The accounting policies set out below have been or joint control ceases. applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements except for the changes in accounting policies as explained in note 2.(e). (c) Cash and cash equivalents (a) Operating segment Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and are used by the Group in management of its short-term commitments. Generally equity investments are excluded from cash that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s CEO to make decisions about and cash equivalents. However, redeemable preference shares, for which the period from the acquisition to redemption is short, are classified as cash and cash equivalents. resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. (d) Non-derivative financial assets The Group has five operating segments which consist of Corporate, Individuals, Public, Money Market Center and Others, as described in note 4. The Group recognizes and measures non-derivative financial assets by the following four categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, (b) Basis of consolidation loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group recognizes financial assets in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. (i) Business combinations Upon initial recognition, non-derivative financial assets are measured at their fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless it is a combination involving entities or business under common control. are directly attributable to the asset’s acquisition or issuance. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or (i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss equity securities. The costs to issue debt or equity securities are recognized in accordance with K-IFRS No.1032, 'Financial Instruments: Presentation' and K-IFRS No.1039, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'. A financial asset is classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss if it is held for trading or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Upon initial recognition, transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss when incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. profit or loss. Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement (ii) Held-to-maturity investments is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. A non-derivative financial asset with a fixed or determinable payment and fixed maturity, for which the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, are classified If share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards), then all or a portion of the as held-to-maturity investments. Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the marketbased measure of the replacement awards compared with the market-based measure of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to pre(iii) Loans and receivables combination service. Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are (ii) Subsidiaries measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method except for loans and receivables of which the effect of discounting is immaterial. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the (iv) Available-for-sale financial assets ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments or loans and receivables. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value, which changes in fair value, net of any tax effect, (iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation recorded in other comprehensive income in equity. Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured and derivatives that are linked to and must be settled by delivery of such unquoted equity instruments are measured at cost. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee.a Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as When a financial asset is derecognized or impairment losses are recognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. equity to profit or loss. Dividends on an available-for-sale equity instrument are recognized in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. (iv) Non-controlling interests(NCIs) (v) De-recognition of financial assets NCIs are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability. (v) Loss of control If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred financial assets, the Group continues to recognize the transferred financial assets and recognizes financial liabilities for the consideration received. When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. (vi) Offsetting between financial assets and financial liabilities (vi) Interests in equity-accounted investees Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position only when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts, and there is the intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates and a joint venture. Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. 106 107 DGB Financial Group 2014-2015 Integrated Sustainability Report DGB FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT AREAS: STRATEGY & BOARD OF DIRECTORS FINANCIAL SECTION APPENDIX GROUP PROFILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ZOOM-IN DGB PERFORMANCE Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (e) Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting (g) Impairment of financial assets Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below. A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future (i) Hedge accounting cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. However, losses expected as a result of future events, regardless of likelihood, are not recognized.

The Group In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment. designated derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments (a fair value hedge). If financial assets have objective evidence that they are impaired, impairment losses should be measured and recognized. On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s), including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. (i) Financial assets measured at amortized cost Fair value hedge An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of its estimated Changes in the fair value of a derivative hedging instrument designated as a fair value hedge are recognized in profit or loss. The gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Group considers instrument at fair value for a derivative hedging instrument and the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in profit or loss in the same line that there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be item of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss either directly or by adjusting an allowance account. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. Any adjustment arising from gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from the date the hedge accounting is (ii) Financial assets carried at cost discontinued. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has occurred on an unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value because its fair value cannot be reliably Cash flow hedge measured, or on a derivative asset that is linked to and must be settled by delivery of such an unquoted equity instrument, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the When a derivative is designated to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted difference between the carrying amount of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax, and presented financial asset. Such impairment losses shall not be reversed. in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in profit or loss. (iii) Available-for-sale financial assets If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss in the When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognized in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, periods during which the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognized the cumulative loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment even though the immediately in profit or loss. financial asset has not been derecognized. Impairment losses recognized in profit or loss for an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale shall not be reversed through profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an (ii) Separable embedded derivatives event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognized in profit or loss. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately only if the following criteria has been met: (h) Property and equipment (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract; Property and equipment are initially measured at cost and after initial recognition, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of (b) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and property and equipment includes expenditures arising directly from the construction or acquisition of the asset, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location (c) the hybrid instrument is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. Changes in the fair value of separable embedded derivatives are recognized immediately in profit or loss. Subsequent to initial recognition, an item of property and equipment shall be carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. (iii) Other derivative financial instruments Subsequent costs are recognized in the carrying amount of property and equipment at cost or, if appropriate, as separate items if it is probable that future economic benefits Changes in the fair value of other derivative financial instrument not designated as a hedging instrument are recognized immediately in profit or loss. associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the dayto-day servicing are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. (f) Deferred recognition of day-one profit or loss The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (the fair value of the consideration given or received) unless the fair value of Property and equipment, except for land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis or a declining-balance basis over estimated useful lives that appropriately reflect the pattern in that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. only data from observable markets. If the valuation technique incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data, the difference between the transaction price and the fair value based on the valuation technique (day-one profit or loss) is not recognized in profit or loss upon initial recognition but deferred. Deferred day-one profit or A component that is significant compared to the total cost of property and equipment is depreciated over its separate useful life. loss is recognized over the period between the trade date and the date when the variables are expected to become observable in the market, or over the life of the trade (whichever is shorter). Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment and are recognized in profit or loss.

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than assets arising from employee benefits, deferred tax assets and non-current assets held for sale, are reviewed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill Amortization of intangible assets except for goodwill is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, are tested for impairment use. The residual value of intangible assets is zero. However, as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which club memberships are expected to be available for use, this annually by comparing their recoverable amount to their carrying amount. intangible asset is determined as having indefinite useful lives and not amortized. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets The estimated useful lives of the Group’s assets are as follows: or groups of assets (“CGUs”). A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The value in use is estimated by applying a pre-tax Useful lives (years) discount rate that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU for which estimated future cash flows have not been adjusted, to the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or CGU. Computer software 4 Contributed acceptances 10 – 20 An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Usable and profitable donation assets 10 – 20 (m) Leases Amortization periods and the amortization methods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The useful lives of intangible The Group classifies and accounts for leases as either a finance or operating lease, depending on the terms. Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards assets that are not being amortized are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite useful life of ownership are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. assessments for those assets. Changes are accounted for as changes in accounting estimates. (i) Finance leases (i) Research and development At the commencement of the lease term, the Group recognizes as financial assets and financial liabilities in its consolidated statements of financial position, the lower amount of Expenditures on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. Any initial direct costs are added to the Development expenditures are capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic amount recognized as an asset. benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Other development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent rents are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are (ii) Subsequent expenditures incurred. Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditures, including The depreciable amount of a leased asset is allocated to each accounting period during the period of expected use on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy expenditures on internally generated goodwill and brands, are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. the lessee adopts for depreciable assets that are owned. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. The Group reviews to determine whether the leased asset may be impaired. (j) Borrowing costs (ii) Operating leases The Group capitalizes borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognized in expense as incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that requires a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Financial assets and assets that Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any are ready for their intended use or sale when acquired are not qualifying assets. incentives received from the lessor) are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. To the extent that the Group borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Group determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for (iii) Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease capitalization as the actual borrowing costs incurred on that borrowing during the period less any investment income on the temporary investment of those borrowings. To the extent that the Group borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the Group shall determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible Determining whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease shall be based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether fulfillment of the for capitalization by applying a capitalization rate to the expenditures on that asset. The capitalization rate shall be the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets (the asset) and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. borrowings of the Group that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. The amount of borrowing costs that the Group capitalizes during a period shall not exceed the amount of borrowing costs incurred during that period. At inception or reassessment of the arrangement, the Group separates payments and other consideration required by such an arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a financial lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, the Group recognizes an (k) Investment property asset and a liability at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset that was identified as the subject of the lease. Subsequently, the liability shall be reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance charge on the liability recognized using the purchaser's incremental borrowing rate of interest. Property held for the purpose of earning rentals or benefiting from capital appreciation is classified as investment property. Investment property is measured initially at its cost. Transaction costs are included in the initial measurement. Subsequently, investment property is carried at depreciated cost less any accumulated impairment losses. (n) Non-current assets held for sale Subsequent costs are recognized in the carrying amount of investment property at cost or, if appropriate, as separate items if it is probable that future economic benefits associated Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day held for sale. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. servicing are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. The assets or disposal group that are classified as non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Investment property except for land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 40 years as estimated useful lives. The Group recognizes an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of an asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell, and a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, up to the cumulative impairment loss previously recognized in accordance with K-IFRS No. 1036 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting date and adjusted, if appropriate. The change is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate. A non-current asset that is classified as held for sale or part of a disposal group classified as held for sale is not depreciated (or amortized). 110 111 DGB Financial Group 2014-2015 Integrated Sustainability Report DGB FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT AREAS: STRATEGY & BOARD OF DIRECTORS FINANCIAL SECTION APPENDIX GROUP PROFILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ZOOM-IN DGB PERFORMANCE Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (o) Non-derivative financial liabilities (iii) Determination of fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities in accordance with the substance of the Deposits, loans and receivables contractual arrangement and the definitions of financial liabilities. The Group recognizes financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group The estimated fair values of money market deposits and deposits with a residual maturity of less than 6 months are the carrying amounts. The estimated fair values of non impaired becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial liability. deposits, loans and receivables are the present value of contractual cash flows discounted at current market rates by factoring in the default rates and credit spreads. The estimated fair values of individually assessed impaired deposits, loans and receivable are the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. The (i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss estimated fair values of collectively assessed impaired deposits, loans and receivables are the carrying amounts less allowances for loan losses. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading or designated as such upon initial recognition. Subsequent to initial recognition, Held-to-maturity financial assets financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss. Upon initial recognition, transaction costs that are The fair values are the quoted prices in the market or fair values evaluated by a credible evaluator. If there is no such information, their fair values are estimated by using observable directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. market prices of financial assets with similar credit level, maturity and profit rate. (ii) Other financial liabilities Depository liabilities The carrying amounts of non-interest bearing deposits and deposits with no stated maturity or a residual maturity less than 6 months are assumed to be fair values. The estimated Non-derivative financial liabilities other than financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are classified as other financial liabilities. At the date of initial recognition, other fair value of an interest bearing deposit is the present value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rate (market rate) of a recently issued deposit with the similar maturity. financial liabilities are measured at fair value minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Borrowings The carrying amounts of borrowings with readjustable term for floating rate or a contract maturity less than 6 months are assumed to be fair values. The estimated fair value of The Group derecognizes a financial liability from the consolidated statement of financial position when it is extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is borrowings not quoted in an active market is the present value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rate (market rate) of a recently issued borrowing with the similar discharged, cancelled or expires). maturity.

When an employee has rendered service to the Group during an accounting period, the Group recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service. The best evidence of fair value is quoted prices in an active market. If the market for a financial instrument is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, as reference to the current fair value of (ii) Other long-term employee benefits another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models. If there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, the Group uses that technique. Other long-term employee benefits are employee benefits that are settled beyond 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service, and Periodically, the Group calibrates the valuation technique and tests it for validity using prices from any observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on include the cost of training overseas which the Group grants to long-serving employees. The calculation method of the Group’s obligation is consistent with defined benefit plans. any available observable market data. (iii) Retirement benefits: defined contribution plans Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques. When an employee has rendered service to the Group during a period, the Group recognizes the contribution payable to a defined contribution plan in exchange for that service as (ii) Classification and level of disclosure for fair value a liability (accrued expense), after deducting any contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for service before the end of the reporting period, the Group recognizes that excess as an asset (prepaid expense) to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund. K-IFRS No. 1107 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires the Group to classify its financial instruments held at fair value according to a hierarchy that reflects the significance of observable market inputs. The classification of a financial instrument is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels (iv) Retirement benefits: defined benefit plans of the fair value hierarchy are defined below. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the Level Description current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. Level 1 Financial instruments are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset If there are no quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets, financial instruments classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions Level 2 observable in an active market. to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. Financial instruments are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable Level 3 Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, inputs). excluding interest), are recognised immediately in OCI. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. 112 113 DGB Financial Group 2014-2015 Integrated Sustainability Report DGB FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT AREAS: STRATEGY & BOARD OF DIRECTORS FINANCIAL SECTION APPENDIX GROUP PROFILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ZOOM-IN DGB PERFORMANCE Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (v) Termination benefits (t) Equity capital Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when the Group is committed demonstrably, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Termination benefits any tax effects. for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. If benefits are payable more than 12 months after the reporting period, then they are discounted to their present value. When the Group repurchases its share capital, the amount of the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction from equity and classified as treasury shares. The profits or losses from the purchase, disposal, reissue, or retirement of treasury shares are not recognized as current profit or loss.

If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. Interest income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. A provision shall be used only for expenditures for which the provision was originally recognized. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses. Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at fair value through profit or loss, are subsequently measured at the higher of: The calculation of the effective interest rate includes all fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental the amount of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period ; and costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability. the amount initially recognized less, cumulative amortization recognized on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period.
