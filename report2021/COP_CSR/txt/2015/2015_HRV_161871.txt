SD is incorporated in HSE activities and responsibilities and in SD&HSE organization of INA Group companies. Coordinative SD working group has continued its work, aiming to ensure involvement of all the relevant INA Group organizational units and businesses in sustainable development. Besides that, SD Council, established in 2012, has had regular quarterly meetings, in order to participate in internal and external communication on SD related issues, analyse sustainability related data and information received from external evaluators, and support, verify INA GROUP HEALTH, SAFETY, and control sustainability reporting on the INA Group level. SD governance structure and management of the SD related issues in INA Group companies is defined by Sustainable Development Guideline. ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL Second year in a row, SD Guideline implementation audits were held in different INA, d.d. organisational units and INA Group companies. For the 4th time in a row, INA participated in the Croatian Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Index, an annual comparative assessment of the IMPACT POLICY most successful Croatian companies based on their responsibility and sustainable business principles application. The activities of companies are evaluated in six key areas: economic sustainability, inclusion of CSR in business strategy, working environment, environmental protection, market relations and community relations. INA´s results have been continuously improving.

The publication date determines the start of the four year period for implementation of eventual new measures 2013 needed to comply with. Refinery BAT Conclusions now include an integrated emission management technique (“bubble”) as one of BAT for overall 2014 reduction of SOx and/or NOx emissions at a refinery site. 40000 That technique is especially suitable to oil refining sites with a recognised site complexity, multiplicity of combustion and process units interlinked in terms of their feedstock and energy supply; with frequent process adjustments required in function of the quality of the crude received and with a technical necessity to use a part of process residues as internal fuels, causing frequent adjustments of the fuel mix according to process requirements. Bubble allows refineries to treat all their stacks as they are enclosed by a giant bubble and provides flexibility in choosing witch unit 20000 shall be upgraded based on the lowest cost, so long as overall resulting emissions are equal to or lower than emissions that would be achieved through a unit-by-unit application of the individual Best Available Techniques Associated Emission Levels (BAT-AELs). European directives with most significant financial impact are European directive on emission trading scheme (EU ETS), Industrial Emissions 0 Directive (IED), the REACH&CLP Regulation, Directive on Renewable Energy (RED), Directive on the prevention of major accidents (SEVESO), Fuel Quality Directive (FQD), Directive on the reduction of sulphur content of certain liquid fuels (SLFD) and regulation relating to the marine fuels Rijeka Refinery Exploration & Production Sisak Refinery (MFD). Air emissions The gases released into the atmosphere as a result of natural gas processing at the Fractionation Facilities Ivanić Grad and Gas Processing Facilities Retail Molve are shown as venting. Since the beginning of the EOR project (October 2014), CO2 emitted into atmosphere at the Gas Processing Facilities In 2014, 88 stage II petrol vapour recovery units (VRU II) were installed during capital reconstruction and modernization of INA d.d. petrol stations Molve has being injected into the fields in order to achieve enhanced oil recovery, which directly decreases venting emission quantities. (FS), so the total number of petrol stations with installed VRU II is now 165 out of 172 on which it has to be installed. From this number, 16 of them Total CO2 emissions from E&P venting process in 2014 are 358,947 tons. have a flow rate of more than 3,000 m3 per year and should install stage II petrol vapour recovery units by 31st of December 2018. Nine of them already have built-in VRU II and on the rest it will be installed during capital reconstruction. Sisak Refinery During 2014, in Sisak Refinery two projects that significantly reduce air emissions have been completed. By installing new recompression stations on the flares, collection of sour gases rich with hydrogen sulfide is enabled, as well as their directing to the Claus plant where hydrogen sulfide is isolated and converted to elemental sulpfur. Cleaned and dry gas is then used for firing. This measure will completely eliminate continuous burning of gases on the flares, which will result in total emissions reduction from the flares and by processing refinery gases in desulfurization unit SO2 and H2S emissions will be also significantly reduced. 77 sustainability Water Significantly reduce of hydrogen sulphide emissions to the environment On Power plant and Atmospferic and Vacuum destillation furnaces fuel electricity production at refinery site and need for aditional cooling were achieved by replacement of two 44 years old coke chambers at oil consumption was reduced by 15% compared to 2013 due to higher For its activities, INA Group uses water from all types of sources: surface of heat exchangers.

Starting from 1 January 2013, BD Retail, which includes selling of fuels and commercial goods in retail stations and logistics, was for segment reporting purposes merged to BD Refining and Marketing. Starting from 1 January 2014 due to organizational change Crosco Group is no longer part of BD Upstream and it is consolidated in BD Corporate and other. Comparative data was restated to be comparable with current year and to reflect change. Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Profit from operations is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the result of certain segments. However, Group financing (including finance costs and finance income) and income taxes are managed on Group basis and are not relevant to making business decisions at the level of business segments. Intersegment transfer represents the effect of unrealized profit arising in respect of transfers of inventories from BD Exploration and Production of Oil and Gas to BD Refining and Marketing. Evaluation of inventories of domestic crude, finished and semi-finished products in BD Refining and Marketing is based on the transfer price from BD Exploration and Production to BD Refining and Marketing. Through intersegment transfer is performed elimination of unrealized profit (difference between transfer price and cost of domestic crude). For segmental reporting purposes the transferor segment records a profit immediately at the point of transfer. However, at the company level profit is only reported when the related third party sale has taken place. 179 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2014 (all amounts are presented in HRK millions) by business by geographical Intersegment Exploration CorpoRepublic of Other Refining and transfers and INA Group Syria Total INA Group and rate Total Croatia countries marketing consolidation production and other adjustments 31 December 2014 31 December 2014 Property, plant and equipment 12,651 620 767 14,038 Assets and liabilities Intangible assets 318 118 21 457 Property, plant and equipment 7,270 5,107 1,774 (113) 14,038 Investments in associates 22 22 Intangible assets 318 19 120 457 Inventories 1,787 3 134 1,924 Investments in associates 22 22 Trade receivables, net 1,154 844 1,998 Inventories 152 1,844 262 (334) 1,924 Not allocated assets 3,776 Trade receivables, net 630 983 701 (316) 1,998 Total assets 22,215 Not allocated assets 3,776 Total assets 22,215 Other segment information Property, plant and equipment 1,450 199 1,649 Trade payables 479 1,123 427 (316) 1,713 Intangible assets 43 (3) 40 Not allocated liabilities 8,842 Capital expenditure: 1,493 196 1,689 Total liabilities 10,555 Other segment information 31 December 2013 Property, plant and equipment 1,039 467 143 1,649 Property, plant and equipment 12,321 2,213 1,445 15,979 Intangible assets 8 3 29 40 Intangible assets 385 105 34 524 Capital expenditure: 1,047 470 172 1,689 Investments in associates 22 22 Depreciation and amortisation 1,344 570 218 2,132 Inventories 3,010 17 192 3,219 Impairment losses PP&E, net recognized in profit and loss 1,380 387 17 1,784 Trade receivables, net 1,604 960 2,564 Other impairment losses, net recognized in profit and loss 99 180 10 (21) 268 Not allocated assets 3,601 Total impairment charges, net * 1,479 567 27 (21) 2,052 Total assets 25,909 31 December 2013 Other segment information Property, plant and equipment 8,581 5,589 1,865 (56) 15,979 Property, plant and equipment 1,522 242 1,764 Intangible assets 389 16 119 524 Intangible assets 137 110 247 Investments in associates 22 22 Capital expenditure: 1,659 352 2,011 Inventories 509 2,779 305 (374) 3,219 Trade receivables, net 936 1,432 585 (389) 2,564 Not allocated assets 3,601 Total assets 25,909 Trade payables 873 1,949 408 (389) 2,841 Not allocated liabilities 10,193 Total liabilities 13,034 Other segment information Property, plant and equipment 1,062 540 162 1,764 Intangible assets 194 5 48 247 Capital expenditure: 1,256 545 210 2,011 Depreciation and amortisation 1,400 645 216 2,261 Impairment losses/(income) PP&E, net recognized in prof. and loss 1,340 734 2,074 Other impairment losses, net recognized in profit and loss 528 167 33 (33) 695 Total impairment charges/(income), net * 1,868 901 33 (33) 2,769 * See note 8. 181 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2014 (all amounts are presented in HRK millions) Revenues from external customers 6.

For the same change Commodity price risk management (price risk) of HRK versus the relevant currency in the opposite direction, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit. The volatility of crude oil and gas prices is the prevailing element in the business environment of INA Group. INA Group buys crude oil mostly through short-term arrangements in US dollars at the current spot market price. Out of gas quantities imported in 2014, INA Group imported gas mostly in EUR based on spot prices, while only smaller portion was imported in USD based on fixed prices. INA Group Currency USD Impact Currency EUR Impact In addition to exploration and production, and refinery operations, one of the main core activities of INA, d.d. are marketing and sale of refinery products and natural gas. Prices of crude products were determined in accordance with the Highest Retail Refined Product Pricing 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 31 December 2014 31 December 2013 Regulation until it was repealed, after which prices were determined weekly based on market principles, which enables quicker responses to Loss (102) (242) (198) (208) market prices fluctuations.

In 2014 INA, d.d. entered into short-term forward INA, d.d. swap transactions to hedge its exposure on changes in inventory levels, changes in pricing periods and fixed price contracts. The transactions Loss (63) (164) (152) (220) were initiated to reduce exposures to potential fluctuations in prices over the period of decreasing inventories at the refineries, as well as to match the pricing period of purchased crude oil and crude products with the crude oil processing and refinery product retail pricing periods. (63) (164) (152) (220) These transactions were hedging transactions and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under IFRS in case of matching the pricing period of purchased crude oil and crude products with the crude oil processing and refinery product retail pricing periods. The exposure on the 10% fluctuation in the exchange rates for the currencies presented above is mostly attributable to the outstanding liabilAt 31 December 2014 fair value of hedged items under commodity derivative transaction designated as fair value hedge was a net receivable ities towards suppliers and borrowings denominated in US dollars (USD) and euros (EUR). of HRK 56 million and net payable of HRK 35 million. The corresponding figures at 31 December 2013 were HRK 26 million receivable and HRK 54 million payable (see Note 25). Interest rate risk management The INA Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the INA Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. Most of the Foreign currency risk management INA Group's borrowings are contracted with floating interest rates. As INA Group operates both in Croatia and abroad, many of its transactions are denominated and executed in foreign currencies, hence INA, As an energy company, the Group does not speculate on fluctuations in interest rates, and therefore primarily chooses floating interest rates. d.d. is exposed to exchange rate risks. However, in certain instruments and certain macro environment, the selection of fixed interest rate can be more favourable. INA Group has a net long USD and EUR, and a net short HRK operating cash flow position. Generally, the Group manages its currency risk using INA, d.d. in accordance with the Risk Management and Hedging Policy for INA Group, can use interest rate swap transactions in order to mannatural hedging, which is based on the principle that the combination of currencies in the debt portfolio should reflect the currency position age the relative level of exposure to interest rate risk on cash flows related to borrowings with floating interest rates.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: • The fair value of hedge commodity transactions is calculated on the basis of actual historic quotations from Platts and market forward quotations of the underlying commodities. • The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts has been determined on the basis of exchange rates effective at the statement of financial position date and an embedded derivative has been determined as the difference between the cumulative inflation index of the contracted inflation escalation index and the inflation rate in the country of contract execution. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. 229 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2014 (all amounts are presented in HRK millions) Derivative financial instruments 44. APPROVAL OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement derivative financial instruments are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value, with the fair value changes being reported through profit or loss. These financial statements were approved by the Management Board and authorised for issue on 18 March 2015. The Group has concluded certain long-term purchase contracts that contain embedded derivatives as defined by IAS 39. An embedded derivSigned on behalf of the Company on 18 March 2015 by: ative is a component of a non-derivative host contract, with the effect that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. As required by IAS 39, such embedded derivative instruments should be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. The fair value of foreign exchange András Huszár Zoltán Sándor Áldott forward contracts has been determined on the basis of exchange rates effective at the statement of financial position date. The value of the Executive Director for Finance President of the Management Board embedded instrument to replace the inflation index has been determined as the difference between the cumulative inflation index of the contracted inflation escalation index and the inflation rate in the country of contract execution. Any long-term effect of the embedded derivatives has been discounted at a discount rate similar to the interest rate on Government bonds. Managements consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recognised in the financial statements are approximate their fair values.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Tax Inspection for the financial years 2010 and 2011 INA, d.d. received the Tax Resolution from the Ministry of Finance, Tax Authorities on 30 December 2014 following the tax inspection covering value-added tax and corporate income tax for the years 2010 and 2011. The additional tax liability and penalty interest determined by the Tax Resolution amounted to approximately HRK 319 million. INA, d.d. has filed the Appeal against the Tax Resolution on 29 January 2015 within the prescribed deadline. On 6 February 2015 the Tax Authorities issued the Resolution on dismissal of INA d.d.’s appeal to the Tax Resolution as untimely due to procedural error. Consequently, INA, d.d. settled the tax and penalty interest liability determined in the Tax Resolution as at 10 February 2015. INA d.d. will file an Appeal to the Resolution on dismissal of the Appeal and shall undertake all available legal action in order to dispute the Resolution on untimely submission of Appeal. Since this subsequent event is considering event that requests the adjusting after the balance sheet date INA, d.d. recorded a liability at 31 December 2014 of HRK 325 million. Decision by the High Administrative Court INA-Industrija nafte, d.d. received the verdict by the High Administrative Court accepting INA's lawsuit and annulling the Resolution of the Ministry of Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship from 29 July 2011, which has revoked INA’s license for mineral resources exploration in the exploration area “Drava“. Although the exploration license has once again became valid with this verdict, deadline for exploration activities expired at the end of 2014 and there is also a significant overlap of concession area “Drava” with the blocks currently involved in the Croatian onshore exploration bid round. Therefore prior to starting any exploration process INA, d.d. will request for the prolongation of the exploration license validity for the period from the revocation of the license until reaching a verdict by the Republic of Croatia High Administrative Court. 231
