KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2014 3 1 Introduction Back 8 Directors’ Report and Financial Statements 86 Corporate Governance 100 Shareholder’s information 104 Sustainability Report 149 Financial calendar and contact information PRESIDENT AND CEO WALTER QVAM Dear fellow shareholders! 2014 marked yet another important chapter in the technology company KONGSBERG’s history. The anniversary year was a year to honour and recognise the journey of one of the world’s oldest technology companies; but beyond that, it was a year for looking ahead at the opportunities the future holds. As the anniversary year came to an end, we embarked on the next 200 years of KONGSBERG’s history. We can look back on a year where we celebrated our history, our partners and our customers, and delivered yet another year of good results. 2014 was a year of continued positive development for the Group. The expertise, technologies and products we possess have seen high demand in their respective market segments. KONGSBERG’s maritime activities continued the growth they’ve had in recent years. In 2014, customers continued to choose us for their new projects and operations in both Norway and internationally within all our maritime areas – subsea, offshore and the merchant fleet. Statoil chose us for its pre-FEED study on the Johan Sverdrup field, Petrobras chose KONGSBERG technology for several new pipe-laying vessels, our “Full Picture” solution was chosen for 17 new United Arab Shipping Company container vessels that are being constructed at Hyundai Heavy Industries, and AXA Engehnaria Submarina and Deep Ocean, Fugro and DOF are just a small selection of the key players that chose our autonomous underwater vehicles for their respective operations, to mention a few examples. We experience that the KONGSBERG brand has a strong position in the market, which is also reflected in the increasing service and aftermarket for our maritime portfolio. The aftermarket share grew in 2014 in parallel with the rest of the business area, and accounts for about one-third of the maritime business area’s total revenues. In 2014, we also saw an increased turbulence in the security situation in several locations in the world, and the defence budgets in many countries are now increasing again. For our part, we saw clearly increasing demand for our modern core products in many countries. The record-­ breaking contract for the air defence system NASAMS in January, a number of contracts for deliveries to F-35, the The fact that the world is changing is news to no one, nor Phase III contract for development of the Joint Strike that the pace of change is increasing. We are a technology Missile (JSM) and the billion-kroner contract for coastal company with relatively few resources tied up in large, artillery for Poland are just some of the highlights that made costly production lines and production facilities.

In the autumn of 2013, we implemented a Group-wide efficiency program DeltaOne, which aims to improve the efficiency of KONGSBERG’s operations by NOK 1 billion a year by the end of 2016. This work is off to a good start, and in 2014 we can already see how programs for sourcing, project management, technology sharing and other areas are yielding results. DeltaOne is continuing in full force in 2015 and 2016.

KM and Kongsberg Defence Systems (KDS), which constitute about 84 per cent of the Group’s sales, had a good year, while Kongsberg Protech Systems (KPS) and Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies (KOGT) had unsatisfactory underlying earnings. Total revenues for the Kongsberg Group in 2014 amounted to MNOK 16,613, an increase of 1.8 per cent compared to 2013. A large share of this growth can be attributed to KM, which increased its revenues by 17.4 per cent. While development in KDS has been relatively flat in recent years, it saw a sharp upswing in order inflow in 2014, which will provide a solid foundation going forward. KPS had reduced revenues in 2014, but built its order backlog. KOGT also had a challenging year, characterised in part by the decline in the oil and gas market. EBITDA for the Group in 2014 amounted to MNOK 2,060, Important events in 2014 compared to MNOK 2,142 in 2013. The Board decided to write-down goodwill in KOGT by MNOK 300 at the end of 2014 was an eventful year for KONGSBERG. The defence 2014.

On this basis, the Board of Directors will before, both as a result of new, major international contracts propose an ordinary dividend for the 2014 accounting year and collaboration agreements, but also as a result of the of NOK 4.25/share (4.25) and an extraordinary dividend of generally increased focus towards some of KONGSBERG’s NOK 5.00/share (1.00) – a total of NOK 9.25/share (5.25). product portfolios. The market within offshore, oil and gas In determining the extraordinary dividend, the Board took is more difficult, mainly due to the significantly reduced oil a basis in KONGSBERG’s strong equity and liquidity at the price in the second half of 2014. This development led to end of 2014 and the need to support the company’s growth challenges in KOGT. Despite the challenging offshore strategy going forward.

The mortality and disability risks are based on public tables and observations of disabilities at KONGSBERG. The probability that an employee in a given age group will become disabled or die within one year, and the life expectancy is as follows: Disability % Mortality % Estimate life Age Men Women Men Women Men Women 20 0.1 0.2 89 94 40 0.3 0.4 0.1 0.0 88 92 60 1.4 1.8 0.4 0.3 87 90 80 4.4 3.0 90 92 The disability rate in IR 73 was chosen because it offers the best approach to KONGSBERG’s disability statistics. This is based on KONGSBERG’s historical figures, where about 25 per cent of the disability pension has been reimbursed through an international pool.

Sensitivity analysis In connection with impairment tests of goodwill, sensitivity analyses are carried out for each individual cash generating unit. Kongsberg Maritime and Kongsberg Defence Systems will not be in an impairment situation before there are relatively large changes in the key assumptions, and these changes are considered to be outside the probable outcome. For Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technology, as mentioned above, goodwill has been impaired by MNOK 300. However, the business area is still in a start-up phase and therefore more sensitive to substantial changes. These factors will still be included in an assessment of the future development in the business area. 14 Finance income and finance expense MNOK 2014 2013 Interest income from assets at amortised cost 76 36 Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss 13 8 Foreign exchange gain 40 26 Other finance income 8 25 Finance income 137 95 Interest expense from liabilities at amortised cost 30 43 Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss 12 9 Foreign exchange loss 20 23 Discounts of non-current provisions 3 3 Other finance expenses 45 32 Finance expenses 110 110 Net finance item recognised in income statement 27 (15) 50 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2014 1 Introduction Back 8 Directors’ Report and Financial Statements 86 Corporate Governance 100 Shareholder’s information 104 Sustainability Report 149 Financial calendar and contact information 15 Income tax Income tax expense MNOK 2014 2013 Tax payable Norway 12 Tax payable abroad 135 86 Change in deferred tax 270 321 Income tax expense 405 419 Reconciliation from nominal to effective tax rate MNOK 2014 2013 Profit before tax 1 285 1 644 Result from joint arrangements and associated companies (68) Profit before tax excluding joint arrangements and associated companies 1 217 1 644 Tax calculated at tax rate 27% (28%) of profit before tax 329 460 Effect of reducing the tax rate to 27% (33) Effect of tax differences and unrecognised tax benefits abroad 6 (12) Impaired goodwill 81 Sale of property shares (17) Tax effect of contingent compensation for purchases, disposals and impairment of shares 1 Other permanent differences 6 3 Tax expense 405 419 Effective tax rate 33.2% 25.5% Income from long-term construction contracts is not recognised for tax purposes until the risk and responsibility has been transferred to the customer.

Most of the projects executed by Kongsberg Maritime and Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies have a duration of less than two years, and revenues from the individual projects account for a limited share of total income. The projects performed by Kongsberg Defence Systems are of longer duration and the revenues from each individual project make a significant contribution to the Group’s total income.

The specified forward currency exchange contracts mentioned above are intended to hedge all contractual currency flows. This implies that in addition to hedging accounts receivable in foreign currency, the currency forwards will be used to hedge the invoicing remaining on signed contracts. KONGSBERG is also exposed to other currencies, but this is insignificant compared to the exposure in USD and EUR.

The part not considered to be an effective hedge is recognised through profit and loss. 2) The figures in the table linked to values based on agreed exchange rates and net fair values also include currencies other than USD and EUR. Loan hedges are currency hedges related to foreign currency loans. 3) The total change in value on hedged projects during 2014 is MNOK 1,387 (reduction of MNOK 663 in 2013). Derivatives used as project hedges have had corresponding negative values throughout the year, and the hedging has therefore been 100 per cent effective. Change in value is recognised in accounts receivable and construction contracts in progress (assets and liabilities). In addition to the exchange rate on 31 December, the fair value of forward contracts is affected by interest rate differences in the currencies in question. The interest yield curves applied in the valuation are received from Reuters which retrieves data from a variety of market participants. More information is provided in Note 4 “Fair value” and Note 21G “Financial instruments Assessment of fair value”. Sensitivity analysis A strengthening of NOK against the USD and EUR at 31 December 2014 of 10 per cent (10 per cent in 2013) would have increased the statement of comprehensive income with the amounts included below. The analysis assumes that the other variables remain constant. Estimated effect on other comprehensive income (after tax): Provided other variables remain constant, a corresponding weakening of NOK against USD and EUR would have the same MNOK 31 Dec 14 31 Dec 13 monetary effect, but with the sign reversed. Cash flow hedges are considered to be 100 per cent effective, USD 609 645 and all effects from a currency fluctuation will therefore be recogEUR 94 99 nised in other comprehensive income. For fair value hedges, neither other comprehensive income, nor the profit and loss will be affected Total 703 744 as long as the hedges are 100 per cent effective. As KONGSBERG has a hedging strategy that generally hedges all contractual currency flows and receivables in foreign currency, foreign exchange fluctuations will not fully affect the profitability of contracts signed.

The gains/losses arise when the forward contracts relating to the cash flow hedges are realised and new forward contracts are established for the projects. Any incurred gain/ loss is deferred and realised in line with the progress of the project. 2) The net effect of cash flow hedging before tax, recognised in other comprehensive income, represents MNOK -1,111 in 2014 (MNOK -461 in 2013). 58 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2014 1 Introduction Back 8 Directors’ Report and Financial Statements 86 Corporate Governance 100 Shareholder’s information 104 Sustainability Report 149 Financial calendar and contact information D) Interest rate risk on loans 2014 2013 Nominal Nominal interest Years Nominal Carrying interest Years Nominal Carrying Amounts in MNOK Due date rate to maturity amount amount Due date rate to maturity amount amount Bond issue KOG 07 11.9.19 4.80% 4.7 250 250 10.9.19 4.80% 5.7 250 250 Bond issue KOG 06 11.9.17 3.28% 2.7 500 500 10.9.17 3.46% 3.7 500 500 Other long-term loans 104 104 61 61 Total long-term loans 1) 854 854 811 811 Bond issue KOG 05 14.4.14 5.44% 0.28 500 500 Other short-term loans 26 26 Total loans 854 854 1 337 1 337 Credit facility (not utilised) 7.4.19 1 500 1.7.15 1 000 1) The deviation between the carrying value in the consolidated statement of financial position and amounts in this note is due to the excess value of the interest rate swap related to bond issue KOG 07 of MNOK 19. See table below (interest rate swaps). In 2014, Kongsberg Gruppen ASA established a new syndicated credit facility with Danske Bank, DNB, JP Morgan Chase, Nordea and SEB. The facility is for general business purposes. The new facility has a term of five years with an option to extend by one year, twice. The interest rate is NIBOR + a margin that depends on the ratio between net interest-bearing loans/EBITDA and can vary from 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent. The credit facility requires that net interest-bearing debt shall not exceed three times the EBITDA, but can be up to 3.5 times the figure for a maximum of three quarters. The covenants in the loan agreements are met. The facility was undrawn in 2014. Kongsberg Gruppen ASA had three bond loans at the beginning of 2014, of which one loan of MNOK 500 was due in April 2014. The bond loans were issued in NOK and are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The interest is 3 month NIBOR + 1.8 per cent for loans of MNOK 500 with maturity in 2017 and a fixed interest of 4.80 per cent for bond loans of MNOK 250 with maturity 2019. The loans are capitalised at their amortised cost using the effective interest method. Other loans comprise minor debts incurred directly by individual subsidiaries in local banks.

No adjustments are made related to these prices. Level 2: Fair value is measured based on other data than traded prices as described for level 1, but that are from observable market data either directly or indirectly. These reserves entail some valuation uncertainty. Level 3: Fair value is measured using models that are mostly not based on observable date. This entails considerable uncertainty regarding determination of fair value. See also Note 4 “Fair value” and Note 17 “Available-for-sale shares” for information on the measuring of fair value.

The State’s stake is managed by the Ministry of Trade and Fisheries. The process we have used to define the content of the report ensures that we are reporting in accordance with the expectations posed to us through the White Paper on ownership. Global Compact The Group joined the UN Global Compact in 2006. This requires that we submit a report to the UN each year, describing our activities and the advances we have made in the field of sustainability. The Group’s Sustainability Report serves as such a report – a COP (Communication on Progress). We would maintain that the report complies with Global Compact’s criteria for ‘Advanced Level’. For more details about the Global Compact, see their website at www.unglobalcompact.org Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) We use GRI’s guidelines for voluntary reporting on sustainable development. The guidelines cover financial, environmental and social dimensions related to operations, and they are the leading global initiative in this field. In 2013, GRI published a new version of its guidelines (G4), calling for obligatory implementation as from the 2015 reporting year. For 2014, we are reporting pursuant to an earlier version, GRI G3.1. The transition to G4 means, among other things, that we must carry out a materiality analysis related to sustainability in 2015. In our opinion, our reporting practice is generally compliant with GRI’s reporting principles. GRI version 3.1 uses a classification that indicates the extent to which a company applies GRI’s definitions and disclosure requirements. KONGSBERG complies with the requirements for level B+. The ‘+’ indicates that the report has been independently verified. The answers to the indicators can be found directly in the text. The report’s final pages contain a reference to the individual GRI indicators and where they are discussed in the report. For more details about GRI, see their website at www.globalreporting.org C C+ B B+ A A+ Obligatory Self-declared Independently verified Optional GRI verified The Norwegian Accounting Act The Accounting Act requires large enterprises to report on their corporate social responsibility either in the Directors’ Report or in a separate report. The report is to cover consideration for human rights, employee rights and social conditions, the outdoor environment and anti-corruption activities. Special regulations stipulate that reporting pursuant to the UN Global Compact or Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) can supersede the requirement for reporting in the Directors’ Report. It is our assessment that the Sustainability Report for 2014 is fully adequate and compliant with the requirements of the Norwegian Accounting Act. 1 Introduction 8 Directors’ Report and Financial Statements 86 Corporate Governance 100 Shareholder’s information 104 Sustainability Report 149 Financial calendar and contact information Board treatment SUSTAINABILITY REPORT The Group’s Sustainability Report has in its entirety been reviewed and approved by Corporate Executive Management and the Board of Directors.

Sustainability and corporate social responsibility will be very central to our further development. responsibility to continue this unique history, passing on to coming generations a KONGSBERG that is even stronger and better than when we took over. For us, this is what corporate social responsibility is all about. Stronger international presence We will continue to expand our international presence, meaning more focus on corporate social responsibility, including anti-corruption, labour rights, human rights, climate challenges and the follow up of a responsible and sustainable supply chain.

Today, we are an important partner for customers in the defence, aerospace, and maritime industries, as well as in oil and gas industry. The defence industry Norway generally exports to allied forces.

Thus, we help make improvements in industries Export control implies that defence materiel, technology that will play a crucial part in future global development. and services can only be exported with an export licence issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There are two reasons for controlling exports: 1. to ensure that the export of defence materiel from Norway takes place in compliance with Norwegian security and defence policy. 2. to ensure that the export of multi-purpose products does not contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical and biological weapons). What types of defence products does KONGSBERG sell? Category A materiel consists of weapons and ammunition.

Our Technological innovation is a key element for resolving the serious global challenges facing the earth. position For KONGSBERG, this may offer business opportunities in several markets, seen in the light of our broad technology base and competency platform. Our The Group’s work with sustainability and corporate social responsibility is an integral part of its other strategic challenges processes. The work is based on the challenges facing the Earth with a view to climate changes and shortages of important resources such as energy, as well as food, access to clean water and minerals. In addition, there are issues related to urbanisation, the loss of biological diversity, etc. The perspective of opportunity – The anticipated challenges of the future will call for the use of advanced technology. In the course of our work with innovation and the further development of our technologies, the opportunities this will open up will be important drivers. The perspective of risk – The anticipated development will also present challenges for our own operations. We try to stay ahead of this through energy conservation and other specific measures. In addition, our ‘licence to operate’, i.e. the right to conduct our business relative to the traditional themes in corporate social responsibility, constitutes an ongoing risk that is taken into consideration in our strategic planning.

We have zero tolerance for corruption among our employees, consultants and business associates. As an enterprise with substantial international activities, KONGSBERG has implemented a comprehensive anti-­ corruption programme, and high ethical standards are an integral part of our business activities.” Walter Qvam, Chief Executive Officer Our KONGSBERG has zero tolerance for corruption. Our attitude is expressed clearly through the corporate position Code of Ethics that we adopted in 2003, our endorsement of the UN Global Compact, the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and our membership of Transparency International. The Board and executive management devote considerable attention to this work. Our KONGSBERG operates in both the defence industry and the oil and gas industry, which, according to Transparchallenges ency International, are two of the sectors most susceptible to corruption. Our activities involve the use of agents and market representatives. The use of third parties is generally known to imply a high risk of corruption, so we pay special attention to that part of our anti-corruption programme. We have developed in-house regulations for signing and following up agreements with market representatives. The regulations include assessments of a market representative’s ethical standards and reputation. Further, risk is assessed based on the industry, country and company, and approval procedures have been introduced for the use of standard terms of business and the verification of payments, as well as for follow up during the agreement period, including training and possible audits. What have We have focused in particular on anti-corruption rules related to gifts and representation, sponsorship, the signing we achieved? and follow up of agreements with market representatives (agents) and supplier conduct. In recent years, we have further developed the Group’s compliance system, placing considerable emphasis on compliance being a line responsibility and part of day-to-day operations. Training and notification routines are important measures. In addition, we regularly perform in-house inspections to ensure compliance with our Code of Ethics in connection with the use of market representatives, including verification of payments. Anti-corruption is an area in which we maintain continuous focus on prevention, risk mitigation measures and the identification of possible non-compliance. In 2014, we evaluated our anti-corruption programme with the assistance of an independent law firm. The evaluation showed that our programme is satisfactory in the light of internationally recognised laws and parameters. Compared with similar Norwegian companies of the same size and level of international activities, our programme is considered to be among the best. Some areas were identified where there was room for improving our programme and appropriate initiatives were implemented. Our We base our efforts on systematic risk assessments, internal controls and reporting. We will continue to develop ambitions our training programme, revise our corporate Code of Ethics, and further develop in-house guidelines for due diligence in connection with our business partners. The charge of corruption in Romania KONGSBERG takes the prevention of corruption very seriously. The activity at issue in Romania was concluded in 2008. We work systematically and continuously to further develop our anti-corruption programme. Rules, routines and practices have been implemented to detect any activities that may signal corruption. Our anti-corruption guide can be downloaded at www.kongsberg.com.

Our KONGSBERG supports and respects the international human rights and labour rights enshrined in the UN’s position Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ILO conventions (International Labour Organization) and the UN Global Compact Initiative. Respect and continuous improvement are significant elements of our approach to human rights and labour rights. Our Through the establishment of new ventures and the use of suppliers outside Norway, KONGSBERG’s level of challenges internationalisation is growing year by year. This means that we must also devote more attention to and learn more about dealing with human rights and labour rights. What have During the year, we have developed governance documents based on the ‘UN Guiding Principles on Business we achieved? and Human Rights’. Against this background, a course was held on human rights and labour rights for about 60 individuals, including many senior executives. We also conducted an audit related to corporate social responsibility at our units in India. Compliance with human rights and labour rights was part of the audit. No non-compliance of significance was found in relation to these topics. Discrimination – In 2014, one alert was received claiming harassment, among other things. The case was dealt with pursuant to KONGSBERG’s Code of Ethics. Child labour and compulsory labour – The Group’s own activities are of such a nature that issues related to child labour and forced and compulsory labour are considered to be of limited relevance. We are working to survey the situation in the value chain. There have been no reports of cases involving these topics. The use of security personnel at the international level – We use security personnel in the areas in which we consider it necessary. Thus far, the scope of this has been very limited. Indigenous rights – The Group has not been involved in any violations of indigenous rights. Suppliers – The follow up of human rights and labour rights in the supplier chain follows current in-house procedures. Self-declarations and audits are important tools in these efforts. Our We will comply with international standards for human rights and labour rights as expressed in our corporate ambitions Code of Ethics and our Policy for Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility. In 2015, for the first time, we will carry out a systematic evaluation of our own activities related to human rights and labour rights. This is in accordance with the recommendations in the ‘UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights’. 126 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2014 1 Introduction Back 8 Directors’ Report and Financial Statements 86 Corporate Governance 100 Shareholder’s information 104 Sustainability Report 149 Financial calendar and contact information AREA OF FOCUS 2014–2015 Climate challenges Global warming is one of the most serious threats facing the Earth. According to the UN’s Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the average temperature may rise more than four degrees by 2100 if emissions continue at the same rate. The IPCC’s 5th major assessment report published in 2014 paints a dismal picture. However, the report points out that there is still time to avoid the most extreme effects, but we must act quickly. Our KONGSBERG is an enterprise with moderate GHG emissions, but we must still do our part to ensure the position necessary reduction. Our absolutely largest contribution, notwithstanding, will be the development of sustainable solutions, systems and products that enable our customers to cut their emissions. This will also entail significant business opportunities for us. Our The climate accounts indicate that our emissions of CO2 are growing year by year. More than 50 per cent of these challenges emissions are related to air travel. Travel is an important part of the Group’s operations and we face a challenge with a view to reducing this type of emissions. Our targets for reducing emissions are relative, so that as we grow, actual emissions may increase even though we reach our targets for relative reductions in emissions. This is a dilemma, given that the global challenge is to cut GHG emissions. What have The Group has several product areas that have had positive environmental impacts in a variety of ways. we achieved? Moreover, two new main segments have been defined for innovation that offers a substantial potential for sustainable growth. See the discussion in the chapter entitled ‘Sustainable Innovation’. Our KONGSBERG shall reach its long-term business targets while contributing as little as possible to global warming. ambitions We will accomplish this by: • Finding product solutions that can reduce our customers’ greenhouse gas emissions • Reducing direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from own operations • Using environmental profiling as one of several assessment criteria when choosing suppliers We will work systematically to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions, with special focus on products, infrastructure and transportation. We will be drawing up a new strategy for climate and the environment in 2015.

We are of the opinion that systematic, good work with corporate social responsibility is a moral imperative. At the same time, such work reduces our risk and improves the quality of the products we buy. Our KONGSBERG uses roughly 5,500 suppliers the world over, 3,000 of which are in Norway. This means we help to position safeguard jobs and build competence, not only where we have proprietary operations, but also to a large extent, where we have subcontractors. The suppliers are an important part of our value creation, at the same time as we are important and in many cases decisive for their value creation. This implies an obligation. Basically, we take responsibility for ensuring that the whole value chain linked to the Group’s products complies with our standards for sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Our There is still work to be done before we have a satisfactory overview of the assessed risk in the supplier chain. challenges This work is time-consuming, and we devote considerable attention to it. What have We have drawn up principles and systems of governance for how we would like our suppliers to deal with we achieved? sustainability and corporate social responsibility, and how we will follow this up. In 2014, we continued training programmes for auditors from previous years. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive training programme related to directives and the use of computer tools for following up the supplier chain for large parts of our international maritime operations. Our One main principle is that we will collaborate with suppliers to seek continuous improvement. The goal is to ensure ambitions that elements that fail to meet the standards to which we aspire will be adapted and improved through dialogue. Further, we must ensure that we maintain close control of risk. We also aspire to collaborate with other companies to enhance expertise and the quality of the work and to make operations as rational and efficient as possible. Conflict minerals are minerals extracted from conflict zones and sold by countries in conflict. The mineral are generally sold to perpetuate armed conflicts, oppression and violence perpetrated on the local population. This is a particular problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the adjacent countries (Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). The most important conflict minerals are coltan, gold, cassiterite and tungsten (wolframite). As a result of the Dodd Frank Act adopted in the USA in 2010, and the OECD guidelines, companies are expected to be able to report which ‘conflict minerals’, if any, are used in their products, in which products, where the minerals originated and in which part of the value chain the minerals are introduced. KONGSBERG has drawn up routines for dealing with the expectations described above. 128 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2014 1 Introduction Back 8 Directors’ Report and Financial Statements 86 Corporate Governance 100 Shareholder’s information 104 Sustainability Report 149 Financial calendar and contact information AREA OF FOCUS 2014–2015 Our employees KONGSBERG exists thanks to the knowledge and expertise of our employees. Accordingly, we work systematically to make KONGSBERG an exciting, attractive and stimulating place of work. It is important for us to attract appropriate expertise and to ensure that we continuously help our employees to develop. Leadership at Leadership at KONGSBERG is all about creating value. The key to success is the combination of good leadership KONGSBERG and dedicated co-workers. Leadership is based on our values, code of ethics and leadership principles. Leadership@KONGSBERG is our leadership platform. It is based on leadership development, talent management and management by objectives. This platform encompasses all the Group’s managers and ensures a uniform process for the follow-up and development of leaders. Our leaders have clear goals and have reconciled those goals with their immediate superiors, including a review of the superiors. We have a good selection of in-house and independent management development programmes. Our leadership platform also includes structured processes for following up planning and talent development. Leadership@KONGSBERG is intended to contribute to creating a continuous inflow of management talent. KONGSBERG has a global HR policy that is one of our governance documents for human resource management the world over. Recruitment One prerequisite for achieving the Group’s growth targets is our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and develop­co-workers. Accordingly, we endeavour to strengthen our position in the labour market and to be at the forefront ment of the competition for the best and the brightest. Each individual business hires people locally with the assistance of local managers. Outside Norway, we usually hire local employees except in certain managerial positions and positions that require special expertise. The Group offers an extensive range of further and continuing education through a combination of in-house and independent programmes and courses. They include professional and personal development, and leadership development. Our employees’ career paths should be open to lateral as well as vertical movement throughout the Group. Employee We believe in involving our employees and their union representatives in the development of the company. relations KONGSBERG recognises employees’ freedom of assembly and right to engage in collective bargaining in accordance with the ILO conventions. Where this conflicts with local legislation, local legislation shall have precedence. Where legislation prohibits the right to organise, efforts will be made to apply alternative means of ensuring a good dialogue between management and employees. Every second year, a global job satisfaction survey is conducted to provide feedback on how employees experience working conditions and the working environment. Diversity In tandem with growing internationalisation and a global business model, we strive to make KONGSBERG a robust, widely diverse organisation. Our 7,700 employees the world over reflect great diversity and that is important for protecting our market position. We work towards this end in a systematic, goal-oriented manner by recruiting, developing and retaining men and women of various nationalities and all age groups in all types of positions. One of our goals is to recruit more women into managerial positions. This is done inter alia by focusing on female talents in our leadership development programmes. KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2014 129 1 Introduction Back 8 Directors’ Report and Financial Statements 86 Corporate Governance 100 Shareholder’s information 104 Sustainability Report 149 Financial calendar and contact information Health and Through our global HR policy, we require that all companies work systematically with HSE to ensure a good safety working environment, prevent injuries and accidents, and to reduce absence due to illness. HSE work is organised through formal bodies made up of representatives of management and the employees. Each business area, as well as the Group’s other entities, has a cooperation structure to deal with legislative and regulatory requirements, as well as with operational needs. We have well-developed HSE routines in our Norwegian operations. All employees in Norway have access to company health services. This varies in accordance with local practices and legislation for our foreign businesses. In Norway, the formal bodies are the works council, joint consultative committees, divisional committees and working environment committees. In addition, ad hoc committees are created for special projects. Both management and the employees are represented on these committees. Our international HSE work is based on our global HR policy, and on applicable legislation and regulations in the country in question. Most countries require that a designated HSE manager be assigned responsibility for ensuring compliance with local and national legislation and regulations. KONGSBERG adapts to countries’ national public health services and supplements them through special agreements as needed. Employees stationed abroad, their families and travelling personnel are given special attention by the company health service, and offered seminars on the cultural differences. They are also covered by more comprehensive insurance schemes. KONGSBERG does not currently have permanent employees stationed in countries that require special safety measures for employees and their families. In connection with new ventures and the build-up of operations in Nigeria, for example, the necessary security measures are taken. The Group has designated fora that determine how employees can travel as safely as possible all over the world. Travel may not be advised or even be prohibited for political, financial, environmental, safety-related or health-related reasons. We also have routines for how employees should conduct themselves on business trips. HSE data is collected from all companies in the Group and reported to Corporate Executive Management and then the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The data are also reported to the appropriate authorities in compliance with statutory requirements in different countries. Absence due Systematic efforts are made to follow up absence due to illness. We see that a good working environment, to illness interesting work and good career development opportunities have a positive impact on absence due to illness. See the details on page 141. Injuries Injuries and near-accidents are registered in the individual unit and reported to the Group each quarter. See the details on page 141. Wages KONGSBERG will reward its employees on the basis of results achieved and desirable conduct. We will be competitive but not a wage leader. Starting salaries will reflect this.

We do this to ensure that the information we provide is structured, transparent and relevant in the light of international guidelines for reporting sustainability. Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) GRI is a voluntary international framework for how companies should report on their work with corporate social responsibility and their vision and strategy for sustainable development. KONGSBERG has reported pursuant to the GRI index since 2004. FNs Global Compact The Global Compact is the UN’s initiative for cooperating with business and industry to promote sustainable development. The initiative was taken by then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 1999. The principles consist of 10 points related to human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption. KONGSBERG joined the initiative in 2006. Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) CDP is an international framework that encourages companies to measure and report externally on the company’s strategy in relation to climatic change and to publish the figures for the company’s emissions of greenhouse gases.

Kongsberg Gruppen INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE KONGSBERG SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 We have reviewed certain information presented in the KONGSBERG Sustainability Report 2014 (“the Report”), presented on pages 104 – 148 in the KONGSBERG – Annual and Sustainability Report 2014. The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of the Company. Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on the international standard ISAE 3000 “Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the Company and included the subject matters on which we provide our conclusion below. Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have conducted interviews of managers responsible for sustainability aspects at corporate and at Kongsberg Maritime Strandpromenaden Horten (Norway), as well as comparing reported data with source documentation for this unit and for the reporting units Kongsberg Maritime China Jiungsu (China) and Kongsberg Gallium (Canada). We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to draw a conclusion with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than would be the case had an audit-level engagement been performed. Conclusions Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention causing us not to believe that:  Kongsberg Gruppen has applied procedures to collect, compile and validate sustainability information for 2014 from its reporting units to be included in the Report, as summarised on pages 106 – 107. Information presented for 2014 is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately presented in the Report.  Data reported for 2014 from the reporting units specified above, has been reported according to the procedures noted above and is consistent with source documentation presented to us.  Information about attainment of targets, as presented on page 138, appropriately reflects performance related to the objectives for 2014.  The Report fulfils the content requirements for reporting in regards to sustainability as stated in the (Norwegian) Accounting Act, § 3-3c, article one.  Kongsberg Gruppen applies a reporting practice for its sustainability reporting that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (version 3.1) reporting principles and the reporting fulfils Application Level B+ according to the GRI guidelines. The GRI Index presented on pages 144 – 147 appropriately reflects where relevant information on each of the elements and performance indicators of the GRI guidelines is presented.
