Our current and future product offering is driven by the three megatrends that we have identified as the most relevant for us. Resource scarcity, energy and environment The population is growing fast, but the Earth’s resources are not. Demand for energy, minerals, and natural resources keeps on increasing and they are being depleted at a faster pace than they can be renewed. At the same time people around the world are increasingly concerned about the deteriorating quality of water, air, and soil. This state of affairs is not sustainable in the longer run and we have to find ways to do more with less. Emerging needs in healthcare Our needs for healthcare are changing fast, especially in the Western world with aging populations. It’s more convenient to perform various kinds of medical testing and diagnostics at home or on-the-go rather than at hospitals. Simultaneously, the increased amount of untreatable infections at hospitals raises the performance requirements for protective fabrics in operating rooms to a new level. Demographics and urbanization The world’s population continues to increase and the middle class is ever wealthier, particularly in emerging nations such as China, India, and Brazil. Also, more and more people are moving from rural areas to the metropolises and cities of the world. This change in living standards and lifestyles puts huge pressure on resources and housing. In addition, there’s a growing concern over securing safe and sustainable food supply. Ahlstrom Yearbook 2014 Megatrends and Strategy 11 “The megatrends inspire our business strategy and reshape the market needs.” Megatrends changing the end-user needs T he megatrends inspire our business strategy and reshape the market needs. They change enduser behavior and affect our customers’ needs. Our response to the challenges stemming from resource scarcity, urbanization and healthcare are products for a clean and healthy environment. Our filtration solutions for clean indoor air and water improve the quality of life for millions of people. Our fiber-based products also play a critical role in improving the efficiency of gas and wind turbines. We are the global leader in environmentally friendly transportation, offering a comprehensive range of filtration media that lower fuel consumption and improve engine efficiency. Emerging needs in healthcare are challenging the industry and its providers. Responding to the needs of aging populations, our fiber-based components enable improved specimen collection and costeffective diagnostics with ease of use. Our medical fabrics offer superior comfort and softness to doctors and nurses in operating theatres. At the same time, they are puncture resistant and protect against cuts and contamination. Demographics and urbanization create new areas where our products are needed to enhance daily living standards. In fast-growing Asian countries in particular there is a clear need for clean air and safe construction materials. Our construction and decoration materials give end-users new and sustainable options that are easy to use. We also provide sustainable and safe products for food and beverage packaging with an innovative touch. 12 Megatrends and Strategy Ahlstrom Yearbook 2014 Strategy We will grow with a high performance product offering for a clean and healthy environment.

Viscose fiber used in some specialties is also made from forest fiber. Other natural fibers that we use include annual fibers such as abaca, cotton Energy efficiency management, surveys, plant certifications linters, jute and some sisal and flax. Abaca, which is used in our food grades, is clearly the most important of them. Abaca is sourced from the Philippines as well as Ecuador.

The Yearbook describes how we create value over time in a sustainable manner and our interaction with different stakeholders. Not only does it take a look on the past year, but also on how we see the future and what are our forward looking plans and goals. Corporate responsibility reporting is embedded to the publication in an integrated approach and we no longer publish a stand-alone sustainability report (previous CONTACT DETAILS sustainability report was published in March 2014). Based on our own assessment, the reporting complies with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 guidelines at “core level”. Ahlstrom Financials 2014 includes audited consolidated Communications financial statements, report of operations as well as corporate governance and information for shareholders sections. All GRI related data in 2014 reporting refers to continuing operations unless otherwise stated and covers all functions under Ahlstrom’s control, including all subsidiaries. Discontinued operations included the Brazilian operation of the former Home and Personal business area until February Liisa Nyyssönen 10, 2014.

In addition, we have a well-functioning internal HSE audit system and our sites are also subject to many customer audits for the qualification of our products.
