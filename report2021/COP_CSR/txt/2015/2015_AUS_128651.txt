In March 2014, the Board of the United Nations Global Compact Network Australia (GCNA) approved Landell’s research proposal to undertake, in conjunction with Victoria University, a social procurement survey of the top 200 Australian Stock Exchange (ASX200) companies and all GCNA members. The purpose of the survey was to gather baseline information on the involvement of these major companies and organisations in social procurement. Since that time, the survey has broadened to include:  Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) as a co-sponsor;  supply chain risks as a joint focus of the survey; and  the extension of the survey to include the top 50 companies on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX). The survey is believed to be the first large-scale cross-Tasman research into social procurement and supply chain risk. The research has made a great progress to date:  The survey was released by the CGNA on 25 August 2014 and closed on 21 November2014.  Landell analysed the survey data and the first draft of the survey results are been reviewing by CGNA.  The CGNA, Victoria University and Landell have started interviewing key companies and organisations regarding their supply chain sustainability and social procurement performance. The survey findings, together with a number of case studies, will be collated into a joint GCNA-CAANZ publication, which is anticipated to be released in the first half of 2015. 3.2 Values of Government and Procurement (VGAP) In December 2013, Landell launched “Values of Government and Procurement” (VGAP), which is an accreditation scheme designed to equip professionals with an understanding of Victorian Government values, policies and practices to enable them to make good commercial and ethical decisions when involved in procurement and service delivery activities. The VGAP accreditation scheme aims to provide professionals with the knowledge and skills to work effectively in the Victorian Public Sector, including providing assurance to the government and to the community that the use of taxpayer funds is prudent and ethical. In 2014, Landell started to deliver VGAP courses to clients in partnership with the Institute of Public Administration Australia (IPAA). Page 7 • 15 landell.com.au 3.3 Continued Development of Social Procurement Toolkit Landell has updated two toolkits  Social Procurement Toolkit for the Public Sector (updated); and  Social Procurement Toolkit for Victorian Councils (updated). The toolkits include useful templates, case studies and guides to implementing social procurement policies and initiatives in business organisation. 3.4 Membership of Social Procurement Australasia (SPA) In October 2013, Landell became a founding member of Social Procurement Australia (SPA). To date, Landell has endeavored to promote social procurement initiatives in Australian through SPA by providing in-kind investment, including the development of social procurement publications for the SPA website, promoting the sign up of SPA newsletters to Landell’s government clients and contributing thoughts in 2015 planning meeting. SPA is committed to the advancement of social procurement in Australia and the region. SPA’s work focuses on raising awareness of social procurement and then linking interested people to the information and resources needed to socially procure. SPA provides Landell with the privilege of a seat at the thought leaders table and the opportunity to influence the agenda and be a change agent. 3.5 Update of Landell’s Commitment to Environment Policy As a member of United Nations’ Global Compact, Landell supports a precautionary approach to environmental challenges and endeavour to reduce our own operational environmental impact. In July 2014, Landell reviewed and updated its Environmental Policy, with clearer and boarder targets to increase energy and water efficiency, and seek opportunities for reducing and recycling waste, as tabled below.  Identifying and responding to climate change risks, by working to achieve maximum reduction of consumption and recycling waste in our operations.
