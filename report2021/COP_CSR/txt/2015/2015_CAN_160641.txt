As 2014 is a non-reporting year in Kinross' biennial CR reporting cycle, additional 2014 environmental and safety data was not assured. See 2014 Independent Limited Assurance Report. n/r = not reported 1 All figures are reported from continuing operations unless otherwise noted. 2 All figures are reported based on Kinross’ percent of ownership (Kupol 75% up to April 27, 2011, 100% thereafter, Chirano 90% and Round Mountain 50%). 3 Figures shown are rounded and may not add up due to rounding. 4 Aggregated data from 2010-2013 includes La Coipa. 5 Frequency rates in all safety data are for 200,000 hours worked and represent data for both employees and contractors. 6 Scope 3 emissions for 2014 were 208,000 tonnes CO2e [A]. Scope 3 emissions were previously presented within the analysis of GHG emissions section of Kinross' 2013 Corporate Responsibility Report. 7 Because of the remote location of most operations, municipal water use is minimal and not reported. 8 Kinross began tracking this indicator in 2012. 9 The methodology consists of total water withdrawn less discharges and changes in on-site water storage. 10 Based on Kinross’s share of ownership and excludes tonnes of ore processed from Tasiast and Chirano, which were acquired in September 2010. 11 In 2014, Kinross modified the Water Recycling calculation. Water Recycled Percentage is the water recycled as a percentage of the sum of the water consumed plus recycled. Data for 2012-2013 has been revised according to the improved methodology.
