Principle 6 | Labor | 28 India: Getting suitable off-the-rack talent from the market is becoming very difficult, costly and timeconsuming and the talent available directly from universities is also not directly utilizable. The “Graduate Engineer Trainees (GET) project for people cost reduction and increased bench strength” is a different approach:  The Armacell India team has taken on eight fresh graduate engineer trainees from different engineering institutes across India. During their first year at Armacell, these trainees are being trained in five phases in different functions: Manufacturing, Technical & Application Support, Product Development & Marketing, and Sales. The final, fifth phase will be a live project. After appropriate assessment, they may be placed in a suitable role if vacancies are available. This process will be repeated every year.  While the GETs gain experience while being paid for it and have a good chance of finding their dream job at Armacell, Armacell India saves substantially on recruitment costs for hiring people from outside and avoids the time lag between a vacancy occuring and a suitable employee joining the company.  This facilitates internal recruitment at junior and middle level for current and future needs. A further advantage is that GETs are familiar with our company culture from the beginning. A real win-win situation which makes the GETs project the A.R.M.A. Way Award winner in the category: Act To Empower Our Employees. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 6 | Labor | 29 Armacell places great emphasis on education and training:  In and around Muenster (Germany): Organizing and sponsoring discussions, workshops and seminars for pupils and students, informing them about measures to reduce energy consumption.  30 internships for pupils in 2014.  As in previous years, regular events especially for pupils, such as: 9 Plant tours for young people: six visits in 2014; schools, organizations: Fürstin-von-Gallitzin-Realschule Amt für Schule und Weiterbildung Jugendausbildungszentrum JAZ Münster Hans-Böckler-Berufskolleg Martin-Luther-King-Schule Karl-Wagenfeld-Realschule 9 Careers forum at Hauptschule Hiltrup: Information stand on apprenticeship programs available at Armacell as part of a project to form partnerships between schools and companies (Partnerschaft Schule-Betrieb“) 9 Careers day (Aktionstag Schule und dann?): Armacell invited pupils in grades 9 to 11 from various schools to take part in an exciting day at the company.

Three further plants followed in 2014: Mebane (USA), Pune (India) and Friesenhofen (Germany).  All employees at these plants were invited to kick-off meetings to gain preliminary insights into what WAM is and how it might effect their daily work.  In the first major WAM Audit, the project teams in Muenster (Germany) presented their progress in the various areas to the Management in 2014. Employees are at the very center of WAM. Only when every individual employee contributes his skills and everyone pulls together is it possible to get things moving and change processes. Further audits will follow in 2015. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 7 | Environment | 33 7| Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Policies  Environmental protection is an integral part of Armacell’s business strategy.  Environmental guidelines are in place in all our companies and manufacturing plants: all Armacell employees worldwide are obliged to behave responsibly towards the environment and conserve natural resources on and off the job.  Armacell commits itself to manufacturing products which pose no threat to the environment.

Germany  In 2013, Armacell needed almost 20 gigawatt hours of gas and over 12 gigawatt hours of electricity at the Muenster site alone. This is equivalent to the electricity requirements of a town with 2,000 households. To record all energy-relevant data systematically, Armacell introduced an energy management system which is part of the integrated management system alongside and on an equal footing with quality and environmental management. It obliges all employees to conserve energy. It is based on DIN EN ISO 50001. In October 2014, the energy management systems in Muenster and Friesenhofen were audited by the independent certification company Bureau Veritas and certified. By 2020, the energy requirement at the German sites is to be reduced by 5 % (compared to 2013). ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 7 | Environment | 36 Muenster: Various measures to improve energy efficiency: 9 Renewing the air compressors 9 Reducing cleaning of the silos 9 Replacing the glazing with a better window energy rating 9 Replacing the energy-intensive hall lighting in the warehouse area Friesenhofen:  An employee suggestions scheme was promoted; employees made suggestions regarding environmental issues and these were implemented (e.g. reducing oil consumption, reducing dangerous waste, various energy savings) Thailand:  Armacell Thailand joined the Energy Saving Project scheme run by the Thailand Ministry of Energy. This scheme involves an annual audit of the site by certified bodies.  All production waste is managed and handled by a certified industrial waste management company. Oldham (UK)  Printed materials are only sourced from sustainable suppliers within 15 miles of the plant to reduce the carbon footprint. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 8 | Environment | 37 8| Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Policies  Preserving and enhancing the quality of the environment around us is an integral part of the Armacell business strategy, explicitly stated in our Environmental Guidelines http://corporate.armacell.com/en/our-story/sustainability/ and in our Code of Conduct http://corporate.armacell.com/en/our-story/values/ Actions and Outcomes  Armacell actively supports appropriate associations to increase insulation standards for energy efficiency.  Armacell has been providing CE-certified products since 2011 and was the first manufacturer of flexible pipe insulation to do so.  The company is a member of and plays an active role in the US Green Building Council, EuroACE (European Alliance of Companies for Energy Efficiency) and numerous other national organizations targeting renewable and green energy industries worldwide. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 8 | Environment | 38 For example, Armacell’s involvement in associations in Europe North:  CEFEP European Interest Group of FEF and PEF manufacturers: In 2014 Armacell ensured that the further development of our product standards was carried out appropriately. In future, product standards will contain sections concerning the designation and reduction of critical substances. In a next step, the focus will be on the sustainability of our products (Environmental Product Declarations EPDs).  Standardization work (on a national level on DIN committees; on a European level in CEN working groups)  Strong involvement on the board of the GSH (European quality assurance association for thermal insulating products). Here we are primarily concerned with fair conditions in the market for all those involved. This includes appropriate control and monitoring mechanisms (market surveillance). We are currently the chair of the GSH.  Armacell is a founding member of the European Industrial Insulation Foundation (EiiF). The aim is to raise awareness of energy-saving potential which can be realized through the optimal use of insulation, especially amongst industry and governments.  In 2015, Armacell re-joined the European Alliance of Companies for Energy Efficiency (EuroACE). EuroACE works together with the official institutions to help Europe move towards an efficient use of energy in buildings, thereby contributing to the EU's commitments on carbon emissions reductions, job creation and energy security. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 8 | Environment | 39 Oldham (UK):  Rigorous audit process to check that the company meets the Building Confidence scheme’s requirements in a number of key areas, including: product integrity, health and safety, environment and sustainability, ethics and values.  Practical training activities and seminars on the professional installation of elastomeric insulation materials provided in many different locations worldwide; special emphasis laid on environmental aspects and on the correct installation of the flexible insulation material to ensure that no energy losses occur.  In the training center at the company’s headquarters in Muenster (Germany) and on site, 123 seminars were held in 2014 for insulation contractors, specifiers, engineers, installers, trainees, construction supervisors, etc. In total 1173 persons were trained in the EMEA region.  In APAC a new training center was opened in 2014, training activities have started and will be broadened in future. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 8 | Environment | 40  Europe North: For 2015, various projects for 2015 are underway to improve the training process. For example: 9 Introducing a special Armaflex tool case which contains all the tools and auxiliaries needed to install Armaflex tube and sheet material, quickly and, above all, professionally. 9 Filming two additional application videos (as an annual supplement to the 24 video clips already filmed in 2014) and uploading these to the Internet for customers and installers. 9 Launching an Armaflex training passport for participants in our training sessions to intensify the customer retention impact of training and certification. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 8 | Environment | 41  Armacell France: 9 Armacell France improved installers’ technical skills by organizing the ArmaSchool and further technical training courses. Armacell representatives held around 25 training sessions on building sites for around 10 installers every time. 9 Furthermore, Armacell France fosters the development of technical skills for young installers by sponsoring the Euroskills initiative in Lilles. A European competition for young people under 25, EuroSkills focuses on the performance of hundreds of European talents, selected after competitions in their own country. We were asked to support the Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning contest in the Construction and Building Technology category. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 9 | Environment | 42 9| Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Policies  Armacell implemented a worldwide R&D strategy based on the principles of sustainability and environmental protection with specific research aims, including constant further development of product formulations that pose no threat to the environment. Actions and Outcomes  Following the development of formulations for the worldwide substitution of the widespread brominated flame-retardant agent decabrom-diphenylether (deca-BDE), which has been under discussion in recent years due to its negative environmental impact, deca was substituted four years ago already.  Developing elastomeric foams with excellent fire behavior but without brominated flame retardants and antimony trioxide which are suspected of being potentially carcinogenic for humans. In 2014 additional formulations without MCCPs (as a plasticizer) have been developped.  Substitution of phosphor-based plasticizers, which is known to be harmful to the environment. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 9 | Environment | 43 Zero waste generation products for high-quality noise control:  Product developments such as ArmaSound with the effect of zero waste generation: trim material that cannot be re-worked back into the process may be re-engineered into a highperformance acoustic foam, resulting in a win-win scenario for the environment and our customers. 9 Re-using waste materials reduces the impact of disposal, while at the same time offering a solution for noise pollution. 9 Acoustic insulation is an important attribute of living comfort today. 9 Effective acoustic insulation measures such as Armacell’s noise control products minimize noise at the source, increasing both the living comfort and the value of the property.  In recent years, Armacell Thimister (Belgium) has worked actively to replace virgin PET with post-consumer materials. Through research, screening and testing Armacell is now able to control the polymer characterization during granulation. This information is then used to predict the behavior in production. This granulation project received a 15 % grant from the Wallon region as it fully met the criteria for environmental projects defined by the European Commission. The project was also recognized internally with the runner-up prize in the “Raise our efficiency” category of the A.R.M.A. Way Award. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 9 | Environment | 44 Further recycling initiatives in the regions, e.g. :  Friesenhofen (Germany):  100% of the PVC waste is recycled and re-used.  100% of the metal scrap is recycled.  Panyu (China):  Energy savings on chilled water lines.  Mixer seal oil is recycled.  80% of waste is recycled to produce other products. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD. Principle 9 | Environment | 45 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA):  Continuous research on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was first conducted in 2009 for Armaflex, the main elastomeric insulation product, based on the ISO 14040 methodology. The aim was to investigate systematically its environmental impact, relying on data from all Armacell production facilities and markets worldwide. 9 Energy balance: assuming an average service life of 20 years, 140 times more energy is saved through the use of Armaflex than is needed for its production, transport and disposal. 9 The carbon / climate footprint of the product: 150 times more CO2 emissions are prevented over an average lifetime of 20 years than are emitted during production. 9 In heating applications, where a service life of 30 years can be assumed, the ecobalance is even better: 270 times more energy is saved and 500 times more greenhouse gas emissions are prevented compared to production requirements. 9 The pay-back time for energy input needed to produce Armaflex is just 50 days.  In 2014, we were one of the first companies in the FEF market to begin a major LCA / EPD project to investigate numerous environmental aspects of our FEF products. When this is completed in the middle of 2015 we will have information about the raw materials used and the impact of these substances and our products on the environment. Here the aspect of energy saving is of key importance. With this step Armacell is being very transparent towards its customers. With the EPDs the specifier will be able to recognize the environmental impact of our products in future. ARMACELL – MAKING A DIFFERENCE AROUND THE WORLD.
