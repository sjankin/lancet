Topics 38th Kinoshita Prize from the Japan Packaging Institute Kao was awarded the 38th Kinoshita Prize in the field Research & Development by the Japan Packaging Institute for its development of an environmentally conscious refill container for powder detergent. This package is a completely new product that allows the whole pack to be placed in the product box before being opened. This makes it easier to refill the powder laundry detergent and eliminates the worry of powder spilling or flying out. This refill system was realized using special processing and converting technology for the pack, which enables the pack to be easily opened by hand using a hand-tear tab. The tab enhances ease of use by enabling the pack to be opened straight across at the top without stress. The pack is also designed to Attack Highly Active Bio EX refill pack, which goes directly into the box (left), and adhere to the sides of the box, making it easy to scoop out the powder the pack opened inside the product box detergent until the pack is empty. Environmental considerations also include (right) reuse of the product box and measuring spoon. Using the refill pack thus allows packaging waste to be reduced by approximately 90%. This sytem was recognized for its environmental consciousness as well as Universal Design perspective, which had not been a focus of past refill packaging design, and led to the award. Participating in a campaign to reduce waste in nine cities and prefectures Kao Group in Japan From October 1 to 31, 2014, Kao participated in a campaign to reduce waste in nine cities and prefectures. The campaign to promote waste reduction was sponsored by the nine local governments of Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo and Kanagawa prefectures and Yokohama, Kawasaki, Chiba, Saitama and Sagamihara cities, which are supporting 43 companies working to reduce the volume of their containers and packaging. Kao has participated in this campaign and declared a “container and packaging diet” every year since 2010. The campaign introduces company initiatives and products to consumers through PR activities in retail stores as well as posters and leaflets created by local governments featuring Attack Highly Active Bio EX refill pack recommended products from the participating companies.

These discoveries can lead on to new improvements from a UD perspective. In 2014, 16 workshops empathizing with elderly people were held, with a total of 177 Kao employees taking part. *‌Level 1 Nursing Care An individual who has gone from requiring support (someone who is able to handle basic activities of daily life—ADLs—on their own, but who may require some assistance, or who may require support with instrumental ADLs as a way of preventing a need for full nursing care), to requiring partial nursing care due to a deterioration in the ability to handle instrumental ADLs.

In addition, the wide bottle mouth There is a makes it easy to refill the container.

Also, to ensure that users don’t get confused as to where the easy-open tab is, a dotted line has been added at the point where users need to cut to create the spout, along with the message “Cut along the dotted line.” In addition, to make it easier for users to cut properly, a message saying Refill bags labeling “Hold here” has been added.

The old packaging The new packaging Topics Adoption of Tactile Identification Labeling for Kao’s Body Soap Containers The improved Bioré-u body soap range containers that were launched in April 2015 feature a line-type tactile cue on the top of the dispenser pump and on the side of the container, to enable visually impaired people to tell that it is a body soap container. In 1991, responding to requests from consumers noting that “Shampoo containers and hair rinse containers are confusingly similar; it would be helpful if you could make the shape of the containers different,” “It would be much appreciated if you could modify the design of the containers to take account of the needs of visually impaired people like me,” etc., Kao added an indented notch to its shampoo containers to make them easier to tell apart from hair rinse bottles. This improvement was recognized in both the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) and ISO as an accessible packaging design. Today, almost all shampoo bottles sold in Japan have this kind of notch on them. However, it was clear that visually impaired people would also appreciate it if it was easier to identify body soap containers, another product that is commonly used in the bathroom. Responding to their requests, Kao joined a tactile identification strategy formulation working group established by a major industry organization, and in May 2014, as a result of an industry organization led initiative, the relevant Japan Industrial Standards (JIS) were revised to add provision for a “Line Type Tactile Cue” for body soap containers. Starting with the new Bioré-u containers that were launched in April 2015, Kao will continue to introduce tactile cues on all of our body soap products.

The children who attended the presentations have found them very enjoyable, making comments such as “I was amazed to learn that such an ordinary, everyday thing as a shampoo bottle, which you usually don’t pay much attention to, could be so meaningful,” and “I hadn’t really thought much about shampoo or hair rinse until now, but this got me interested in them.

Topics Obtaining fatty acids from algae, a world first Some of the fats and oils that are raw materials in products such as detergents and shampoos are the same fats and oils that are consumed as food. As the global population continues to grow, competition with edible oil is a concern. The Eco-Technology Research Center promotes research on forward-looking and sustainable environmental technologies centering on advanced use of biomass. In its research on algae, it has succeeded in finding some strains that contain a large number of medium-chain fatty acids, a raw material for surfactants in detergents and shampoos, as well as an enzyme that contributes to production of medium-chain fatty acids. This is the first such identified from algae in the world and was announced at the 1st Asian Searching for useful algae Conference on Oleo Science in September 2014.
