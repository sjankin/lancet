Nature of business Kamstrup is a world-leading manufacturer Our products are known for their reliability of energy meters and provider of solutions and high quality. Our quality, environmental for energy metering. and IT certifications speak volumes about the service we deliver. Our meters measure heat, cooling, water, electricity and gas. We also develop We have more than 40 years of experience automated solutions for managing energy in collaborating with utility companies of meters, collecting meter readings and all sizes. So far we are represented in 65 billing. For some customers we look countries worldwide by Kamstrup sales and after the entire process of installing and subsidiary offices and by our distributors. maintaining energy meters, and providing technical support. 2. Statement of support for the UN Global Compact Society today faces many challenges. As an international player in the world Values energy market we want to help to create a more balanced society and a For over 60 years we have led our cleaner environment. industry through breakthrough innovation and product development. We joined the UN Global Compact in January 2010. The reporting associated We are committed to creating more with the UN Global Compact helps us to understand where we stand as a intelligent and sustainable solutions sustainable company, and to see what we should focus on in the future. for the benefit of nature and people. Constant development through parallel initiatives is how we create growth, We are also committed to creating a and also how we improve our social and environmental performance; in this working environment that supports way the UN Global Compact helps us take us to the next level. and develops our people. Where Climate, fossil fuels and smart energy meters they are encouraged to thrive and Climate change and the long-term availability of fossil fuels are subjects challenge our own standards and of worldwide concern. Both of these issues are driving the development of expectations to deliver even higher more efficient energy systems, including distributed local power supply and value for our customers. We never storage, and smart grids for electricity distribution. Smart energy meters settle for second best and we expect are a vital part of this development. our people to always seek better ways to do what they do. New metering applications include charging stations for electric vehicles, metering of local solar power production, district cooling consumption and Our values of inspire, lead and deliver many more. As utility meters become more advanced they will increasingly define the very essence of what connect to home automation and grid control systems, as well as being read makes us unique and ensure that remotely. These and other market developments will call for new solutions we always exceed expectations. from Kamstrup, and we will do our best to deliver. After all, one of our two We inspire through deep customer main values is customer orientation. understanding, superior quality and breakthrough innovation. We lead Knowing–Understanding–Saving by being committed to creating a To save energy you need to understand how you are consuming it, and brighter water and energy future, that in turn is only possible if you have appropriate meters installed. This always turning vision into action. is the essence of Kamstrup’s smart energy meters. Data from the meters And we deliver on our promises, keeps our customers informed about how much energy they consume always measuring our success by over different periods and across different appliances. For instance, the progress we create for others. information from all of a household’s utility meters – heat, water, electricity We believe this is the way to develop and gas – can be shown on a single display. our company and create long-term By showing energy consumption clearly partnerships. and accurately, our products encourage end-users to protect the environment by The 10 universal principles managing their use of resources. This report shows what we have achieved, and what we plan to achieve in the future, in adopting the Global Compact’s 10 universal principles. During 2013 and 2014 we have chosen to pay attention to development of environmentally friendly products and CSR audits at supplier’s premises. We will continue working on all of the principles, with special emphasis on CSR audits and the mental working environment in 2014. Per Asmussen, CEO 5 3.

The standard does not itself state positive impact on solutions”. Subsequently specific environmental performance criteria, we point out our intention to use energy, but instead shows how the organisation water and raw materials with care. can set its own environmental goals, taking into account the law and those aspects of environmental protection which it can influence. 6 3.2.2. Energy consumption (headquarter) The graph below shows a generally steady drop in energy consumption per unit of production since 1998. During 2009 and 2010 there were a small increase in energy use per unit because production fell during the recession; as a result, the fixed component of our energy consumption increased as a proportion of the total. The actual decrease of the graph is due to the increase of the production. In 2012/2013 there was a small increase due to cold weather (heat) and new building activities (electricity). Energy consumption per meter produced 1999-2014 20 Electricity consumption (kWh) 15 Heat consumption (kWh) Consumption 10 5 0 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Year 3.2.3. Water consumption (headquarter) In our production facilities the only water we use is for calibrating meters, and this is reused. The great majority of our water is therefore used as drinking water and for sanitary purposes. Most of our washrooms now have taps with sensors and variable-flush cisterns. In 2014 we have recorded an unexplainable increase of the water consumption – so in 2015 we will investigate the origins of that, in order to get it back on track.

A full set of emergency procedures, plans, equipment and training is in place to protect health and safety. For more information please see the section 6. 9 3.3.2. Carbon footprint Since 2010 we have calculated the carbon footprint of our products. Carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, expressed in tonnes CO2 equivalent, generated by a product through its entire life cycle. To carry out this initiative we have bought the life cycle analysis tool SimaPro, including the EcoInvent database. The resulting calculations can be used to identify possible environmental improvements and so develop cleaner product technologies. 3.3.3.

Future focus areas Driven by consumers’ needs and values we will continue to develop energy-saving meter solutions. Besides this, we will continue to: • Third party Energy review, in order to reduce energy consumption in our buildings at Head office in Stilling • Establish environmental targets at all production sites in the Kamstrup Group • Inspire to energy saving initiatives throughout the Kamstrup Group • In March 2015, start collecting paper from all office work places, and having it recycled. • New approach to our annual Environmental Report, which as of the report for 2014, will be based on the headings of our Environmental policy – how they have been implemented and what has been accomplished in 2014. • Design and issue a leaflet describing Kamstrup’s Supplier Environmental Requirements. • Carry out local environmental initiatives according to our environmental action plans for 2015. 4.

Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses 14 5. Anti-corruption cf. principle 10 Principle 10: Business should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery In Kamstrup corruption is never acceptable. Our CSR policy says: “…none of Kamstrup’s employees may receive or give gifts, loans, payment or other remuneration which may incite dishonesty or illegal acts, or which may be seen as an attempt to influence the objectivity of commercial decisions”. We do not have a separate policy covering anti-corruption measures for the simple reason that we have not seen the need for one so far. Our CEO Per Asmussen stresses: “If we are offered entering into corrupt agreements, the answer is always NO”. Our intolerance for corruption is well known to everyone within Kamstrup who may face this issue. Future focus areas We will continue our strong stand on this issue. 15 6.
