Ltd φ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 1.0 INTRODUCTION In 2014, GMC actively mined Pit C and started a development and dewatering project at Pit B. According to the pit and waste dump designs of the Life of Mine plan (LOM), GMC will move into the other pits in the near future. The mining method employed is exclusively open-cast; comprising drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. Thereafter, the ore is processed (crushed and screened with no chemical addition) and stockpiled for transportation by rail and road to Takoradi Port for shipment. The management of Ghana Manganese Company Limited, conscious that mining and its associated activities affect the environment in which it operates, therefore ensures that within its economic limits and the need to be internationally competitive, the Company’s activities are carried out with due cognizance of the Environment. 2.0 Mining Operations Total ore mined during the year under review was 1,679,179 tonnes. This represents 102.0% of the total budget figure of 1,646,320 tonnes. Refer to table 1 below. Total waste mined during the year under review was 17,333,289 tonnes. This represents 100.7% of the total budget figure of 17,212,388 tonnes, resulting in an ore to waste stripping ratio of 1:10.3 (ton: ton). See table 2 below.

The geology department carried out infill and exploration bore hole drilling programme on the mine in 2014. The activities also included the exploration drilling carried out by Atlantic drilling within the same period. 3.1.0 Exploration Sites For the year 2014, exploration and infill borehole drilling were executed in the following mine pits: • Pit A • Pit B • Pit C Central West • Pit C Central East • Pit C North 3.1.1 Diamond Drilling Information Three (3) wire line core drill rigs were used for the infill and exploration drilling within the period (i.e. Atlas Copco wire line core drilling rigs, model CS14; Christensen). Its purpose was to investigate the possible extension of the manganese carbonate ore zones and also bridge the gabs between ore bodies in the mine pits which were not captured in previous drilling activities. Depth to be drilled varied, depending on the extent to which the ore body began and terminated within the earth crust. 4.0 CARBONATE PROCESSING PLANT During the year under review, no major structural changes were undertaken in the plant as well as in the Takoradi Port. However, GMC designed and install a new secondary stage mobile Plant (Portable) attached to the existing primary stage (stationary) to complete the circuit for full plant production. The new secondary stage mobile Plant (Portable) mobile plant has 125 tons/ hr. adding extra 35.7% to increase sales of crushed Manganese carbonate to be able to sustain the company as a result of low manganese price and increasing operational cost. ω March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 The Plant layout would consist of Primary section (stationary) and Secondary stage (Portable) mobile Plant. The Primary Section already installed consists of the following: • Feed hopper • Feeder • Jaw crusher • Discharge belt New Secondary Stage Mobile Plant (Portable) • Feed belt • Triple deck screen • Recycling belt • Product belts ( 3 ) Equipment and product stockpile area: 50 metre square (already in place). Plant Layout Feed Capacity: 125 tons / hour. The Plant layouts consist of Primary section (stationary) and Secondary stage (Portable) mobile Plant as indicated in plates 10 and 11 underneath. Plates 12 and 13 below also show LAYOUT – transfer point from primary section to US 316 mobile unit.

This silt trap is big enough to control any silt laden run-offs from washing plant bottom and bungalow 28 environs. The 4m3 silt-trap at the 28 Gate was also constructed to improve the flow of water at this point which hitherto seemed stagnant and also to supplement the activity of the 5m3 storm water containment with pen stock valve on its opposite side. The silt traps are regularly de-silted and maintained especially after heavy rains to prevent overflow of material into the Kawere stream. Plates 14 and 15 show the Golf course and CP 28 Gate silt traps respectively. ϋ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 Plate 14: Golf Course silt trap Plate 15: Silt trap at CP 28 Gate 5.1.1 Dust Suppression System As part of our continuous efforts to reduce dust concentrations within our operational area, advanced dust suppression technologies were deployed in the carbonate plant as well as the new secondary stage mobile Plant (Portable) installations where materials are processed dry, hence naturally fine dust is developed. The technology is based on high pressure, atomized water which attracts dust particles and agglomerates and drops them to the ground where they integrate into the normal stockpile. See plates 16 and 17 showing fog make systems in operation. Plate 16: Showing the initial test Plate 17: Showing atomizers during operation tests 5.1.2 Gold Series Dust Collector The company uses the Gold Series Dust Collector and dust mask as control measures for dust generated in the Sample Preparation Unit of the Assay laboratory. In 2014 the mine installed the Gold Series Dust Collector for dust minimisation in the lab. The Gold Series Dust Collector is a piece of air cleaning equipment used to eliminate dust contaminants from the workplace (Sample Preparation Unit), making the place safer and healthier. The operations of the equipment are such that it extracts all the dust being generated through the crushers and pulverising mills via the extracting ducts into a bin collector. In the collector dust –laden air passes through a specialized gold cone cartridge (Filters).The clean filtered air rises from the gold cone cartridge, through the clean air plenum and into the fan, where it is exhausted into the environment. Also when incoming dust –laden air enters the collector the baffle forces the larger or heavy particles to drop out of the air stream to fall into the hopper and that of the ones collected on the cartridges also fall into the hopper and are collected (precipitated dust) into a discharge device – Drum. The drum is normally emptied once within the week depending on the workload within the week. ό March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 5.1.3 Gases and Fumes in the Lab The list of gases generated in the lab includes the following: • Carbon dioxide from sample digestion • Hydrogen Chloride acid fumes from sample digestion However with the introduction of the Acid Fume Scrubber, most of the possible hazardous gases and fumes generated are converted into a safer form. The operation of the fume scrubber is such that all the acid generated in and around the fumehood is extracted into a mixing chamber. In the mixing chamber, the fume and gas come into contact with a target compound (concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution) and a scrubbing solution (which is mainly Water) in the case of our lab. The sodium hydroxide solution will react with the gas especially the chlorine to form sodium chloride salt in solution, hence leaving a clean air (Carbon dioxide and oxygen). The sodium chloride in solution will be later discharged into waste drain system for further treatment. The somehow clean gases and fumes are often released through a smoke stack vent into the environment. The control measures placed in reducing fumes and gases in the lab are the Acid fumes Scrubber, the use of Respirators (Gas Mask) and external fan extractor. 5.1.4 Reclamation of Waste Dump Care and maintenance of the Pit B and Carbox Stockpile reclamation sites continued steadily for the year under review. In 2014, daily agronomic practices mostly slashing in the plantations, weeding around the palm trees and application of NPK (15:15:15) fertilizer were done, pruning dead branches to improve aeration were carried out in the plantations to promote healthy growth and high yield. See plates 18 and 19 showing current state of the palm trees and fruits harvested. ύ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 Plate 18: Shows current state of the palm trees Plate 19: Shows fruits harvested Pruning of lower palm branches at the Hill B plantation continued; this is to improve aeration and bigger fruit bunch formation. It was observed that fruit bunches became bigger at the latter part of the fruiting season, that is around July. 5.1.5 Sale of Palm Fruits from Reclaimed Sites Palm fruits harvested either weekly or bi-weekly from Hill B and Taysec oil palm plantations by farmhands drawn from nearby communities were conveyed to a buyer at Nsuta. Major harvesting spanned from January to July. Bunches of the palm fruits were counted and prices haggled based on prevailing market price to a suitable conclusion for both parties. The agreed amount is communicated to the commercial department and an invoice is issued to that effect. Payment is then made at the pay office by the buyer. For the year 2014, total bunches of 4,192 were sold for an amount of GH¢4,230.00. 5.1.6 Tree Seedling Nursery Various trees species were nursed within the year under review. At the nursery tree species such as Leucinea, Acacia alata, Roystonea regia (Royal palm), Weeping willow and Azura seedlings were raised in poly pots and transplanted in various locations at the golf course and the mine village. See table 7 showing types of trees species planted during the year under review. υτ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 Table 7: Shows Types of trees species planted during the year under review Item no.

The program which was organized by the Environmental Department of GMC was held at the company’s function hall and subsequently to the Nsuta community for outdoor activities. Participants included hundred (100) pupils and fifteen (15) teachers from six schools in communities closest to GMC, five (5) representatives from each department in GMC, chiefs from the communities, Directors/Heads of various institutions including the Municipal Health, Forestry Commission, Environmental Protection Agency and managers from GMC. Speeches given by dignitaries addressed the importance of trees to the environment especially in relation to the climate which makes it imperative for all and sundry to grow trees especially the school children who can develop it as a hobby. There were poetry recitals, singing and cultural display by the pupils as well. The school children and teachers were then grouped into two; one group planted thirty-three (33) Acacia tree seedlings at the golf course of GMC while the other picked litters from part of the Nsuta community and the hospital under the supervision of officers from the Environmental Section. See plates 20, 21, 22 and 23 for pictures taken during the World Environment Day. υυ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 Plate 20: Showing students at the function Plate 21: Showing GMC staff and Nananom Plate 22: Shows Participants at the Golf Course Plate 23: Showing School children planting trees 5.1.9 Re-afforestation Programme Reafforested sites including the teak and “ofram” plantations around the main security gate to the hatchery area and the hospital surroundings were vigorously maintained by regularly slashing weeds during the year under review to promote ecological integrity of the sites and surrounding landscapes. Tamso and Nsuta roundabouts were regularly cleaned of litter, grass mowed and hedges trimmed to improve their aesthetic value. 6.0 COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME During the year 2014, the Ghana Manganese Company Ltd undertook a number of activities to strengthen relationship and to ensure peaceful co-existence with its catchment communities under its Community Relations Programmes (CRP). The CRP covered areas such as infrastructural projects, community meetings, stakeholder engagements, and sustainable υφ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 alternative livelihood programmes (SALP). Others included medical interventions, bursaries, complaint management, crop compensation, renovation of existing infrastructure and road maintenance. In 2014, US$314,298.52 was used for the community assistance programme. 11.1 Sustainable Alternative Livelihood Programme (SALP) The last beneficiary of the 2011 batch of community youth that GMC sponsored to acquire employable skills through the GMC sponsored apprenticeship programme graduated on November 29, 2014. He graduated from the Gyanvik Automobile Services at Tamso. Although two candidates were sponsored to undergo apprenticeship at Gyanvik Automobile Engineering Services, only one of them was able to successfully graduate. The other person dropped out because of personal reasons. The Ghana Manganese Company sponsored the entry fee, supported the candidate with monthly allowances, bought working tools for the apprentice and paid for the graduation fee. Below in plates 70 and 71 are some pictures of the graduation ceremony. Plate 70: Shows Anthony receiving his certificate of Plate 71: Shows Anthony in a group picture with graduation at Gyanvik Automobile Services family members after the graduation ceremony 11.2 Medical intervention Early in the year, the Manganese ladies organized the second phase of the Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening Exercise for Enyinase, Domeabra, Teacherkrom and Esuoso. The project which sought to reduce breast cancer among the women in the communities benefited four hundred women from the four communities with seven cases recorded for further examination. At the end of the exercise, the women expressed their profound gratitude to υχ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 manganese Ladies for having taken such an initiate to save their lives. As part of GMC’s and the Association’s commitment in helping the women battle the disease, the medical bills for the women who were diagnosed with possible breast cancer cases were covered by the association. Plates 72 and 73 below demonstrate the breast cancer awareness and screening exercise at Enyinasie. Plates 72 and 73: Show Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening Exercise at the Enyinasie Community 11.3 Sanitation Exercise The Nsuta market which was built for the community by GMC has over the years seen little maintenance, resulting in poor conditions of the market. This situation has however contributed to the less patronage of the market by most of the workers. Manganese Ladies Association on the 8th December, 2014 renovated the market to improve the condition of the facility. The ladies as well led a clean-up exercise at the market and its surroundings to help improve sanitation and prevent any communicable diseases. At the end of the exercise the objective to raise awareness and get the people to know the relationship between sanitation and health was achieved, as the community members were again admonished to inculcate cleanliness into their daily lives. The market women and the community members expressed their profound gratitude to the ladies for such a remarkable work and asked the ladies to constantly come to their aid. The total cost of this intervention was US$766.79. See plates 74 and 75 showing Manganese Ladies Association clean-up exercise at the Nsuta market. υψ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 Plates 74 and 75: Show Manganese Ladies Association clean-up exercise at the Nsuta market 11.4 Community Infrastructural Project (CIP) CIPs are the physical infrastructural projects that are normally constructed by the company or in partnership with community or other stakeholder(s), under the CSR programme. In 2014, new projects were undertaken including the following in table 18 underneath.

Communities were united under one umbrella body, the Esuaso Divisional Stool Council headed by Nana Kwesi Atobra II, chief of Esuaso and president of the Council. Several meetings were held with the company’s host communities at the cost of US$18,070.74 which includes protocol and meeting allowances. Community-wide meetings which involved all stakeholders including women and the marginalized were held in Nsuta-Zongo, Akyem and Tarkwa Banso. These meetings were used to either review the impact of mining on the communities or to discuss progress on community projects. Meetings with community leadership were held in all the 17 catchment communities to discuss community priority needs, projects and to share information. In most cases, engagements with community leadership were held at the community level while in selected cases, community leaders were invited to a meeting on the mine facility. For example, Bonsawire, Enyinase, Bonsa, Agona-Wassa, Anomakokrom, Esuaso, Akyem etc. visited the Community Relations Office to discuss community needs. 11.5.1 Akyem The leadership of Akyem met with GMC management on four occasions within 2014. Generally, the meetings sought to discuss the stoppage of encroachment and illegal mining activities on GMC concession. GMC security in partnership with government security agencies such as the Police and the BNI has been very much involved in handling such matters. Some level of achievement has been made from such meetings but there is much room for improvement. Other φτ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 engagements were used to discuss issues such as GMC’s intention to conduct feasibility studies at Akyem in connection with the prospects of mining at Pit A which the community agreed to. 11.5.2 Akyempim Some engagements were held between GMC Management and Akyempim leadership on encroachment issues. The purpose was to discuss out-of-court settlement to foster peaceful coexistence with the community and to protect the company’s concession. The last meeting was held on October 16, 2014 and was chaired by the MD of GMC. Both parties of the meeting showed a high level commitment to getting the case settled out of the Tarkwa High Court. 11.5.3 Tarkwa Banso As part of GMC’s intention to extend its mining operations in Pit C to the northern side (CNorth), the Tarkwa Banso community were engaged severally to explain the steps involved in the permitting process as well as to clarify issues and address concerns of the community. The Tarkwa Banso–GMC Negotiating Committee (TBGMCNC) which is comprised of representatives of the Tarkwa-Nsuaem Municipal Assembly, the Esuaso Stool Divisional Council, Lands Valuation Board, GMC and Tarkwa Banso met several times to discuss progress made and addressed challenges. These regular meetings helped to address uncertainties and calm tensions in the community related to the C-North project. 11.5.4 Esuaso Divisional Stool Council (EDSC) The EDSC has been vehicle through which formal engagements with communities within the catchment area of GMC are done. For year 2014, the EDSC was actively involved in engagements with Tarkwa Banso in connection with the C-North project both at the Committee level and at the community level. The Council was also involved in discussing matters such as land encroachment and illegal mining activities in Akyem and Akyempim. Again, the Stool Council led the award of bursaries to students within the catchment community. In addition, the EDSC was at the fore-front of submitting proposed CSR projects for 2015 based on the prioritized needs of the 17 catchment communities. Lastly, the EDSC participated in monitoring and commissioning 2014 CSR projects. For example, GMC through the EDSC on May 22, 2014, met with representatives of all the 17 catchment communities to review and φυ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 improve CSR activities such as award of bursary and community projects. The Council was also at the forefront in commissioning community projects. 11.5.5 Agona Wassa The Community Relations team met with the chiefs and opinion leaders of the Agona Wassa community at the Chief’s palace in July 2014. The meeting was chaired by the Agona Wassa Divisional Chief. Among other developmental needs that were discussed, the community emphasized the need for GMC to assist them to complete their already started Social Centre. The community leaders were advised to channel their request through the EDSC for consideration as one of the 2015 proposed community projects which the community did. 11.5.6 Tarkwa-Nsuaem Municipal Assembly (TNMA) GMC collaborated with the Tarkwa-Nsuaem Municipal Assembly (TNMA) on some issues during 2014. One of such engagements is when GMC participated in the People’s Assembly meeting that was organized in March 2014. In another development, the Community Relations office held a discussion with Feeder Roads and Urban Roads Engineers of TNMA to discuss how GMC could support the TNMA to improve road networks in the catchment communities of GMC. Following these discussions, a quantity of mine waste material was approved for the Department of Urban Roads to help repair potholes in the Tarkwa Township. Again, the Community Relations office held a meeting with the Planning Unit of the TNMA to outline projects that GMC has already undertaken in its host communities since 2010 and the current priorities of the catchment communities. The overall goal of this meeting was to help the TNMA to avoid duplication of efforts in terms of project implementation and also for updating their records on communities. 11.5.7 Other stakeholder engagements In special cases such as land encroachment, illegal mining and out-of-courtsettlement issues, community leaders have been invited to meet with GMC management with the view to make peace and seek redress. Instances of such meetings are as below: φφ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 11.6 Complaint Management Meetings GMC has a complaint management system in place for addressing community concerns especially, those that are related to mining and exploratory activities. During 2014, the Community Relations department registered six (6) main complaints from community members. There were some complaints that were delivered through phone calls and so were not recorded in the Complaints’ Book but follow ups were made on such issues. The complaints bordered on areas such as: • destruction of farms as a result of exploratory activities; • poor water yield from a borehole facility; • cracks in building walls and faulty TV sets as a result of blast vibrations; • Dust pollution, especially on our community haulage roads. The Community Relations office in a joint effort with the Environmental Office conducted investigations into all these complaints to establish the veracity of these claims. At the end of the investigations, claims that could not be attributed to GMC operational activities were discounted and were duly communicated to the complainants at a meeting. Following that meeting, the complainants of such claims were made to sign-off in the Complaints Register to indicate their acceptance of the findings. On the other hand, GMC responded to complaints such as dust pollution and repair of borehole facilities during the period. 11.7 Donations made in 2014 The Ghana Manganese Company made several donations to the tune of US$ 157,576.05 to society in different fields. Amongst these donations are the following: • GMC donated assorted medical equipment to the Tarkwa-Nsuaem Municipal Health Directorate to support improvement in health delivery in the Municipality. The Health directorate upon receipt of the items wrote an appreciation letter to Management of GMC for this kind gesture; • GMC bought Dstv for Tarkwa Banso Community; • Huge quantities of mine waste material were donated to communities and churches to repair their roads or maintain their surroundings from the effects of erosion. φχ March 30, GMC’S COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) – UN GLOBAL COMPACT 2014 GMC again made some cash donations.
