At Peñoles we fully believe that sustainability is the best path for us to responsibly create value for our stakeholders, and thus it is the basis on how we do business. In 2014 we made important strides in our business strategy. In light of this, and as we have done for the last thirteen years, we are publishing our Sustainable Development Report, which contains our achievements thus far, future challenges, and the strengths and opportunities that we will continue to develop. The report is also our ninth Communication on Progress, in compliance with the United Nations Global Compact. Our leadership position commits us to stay on the leading edge of our sector and with the competitiveness that distinguishes us. This year in particular, we faced great economic challenges, such as the low price of metals and the tax regulations for the mining sector in Mexico; these situations show us that we must continue to act with commitment and perseverance to continually adapt to the economic, environmental and social changes around us. We have consistently followed the path of sustainability at Peñoles. Our operations are productive, safe and respectful of the environment. We base our work culture on prevention, thus protecting life, health and ecosystems, in harmony with the community. In this way, we generate value for our stakeholders and give life to our Mission to “add value to non-renewable resources in a sustainable manner.” 04 MESSAGE FROM THE CEO 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT_AS GREAT AS OUR PEOPLE This year was important for our sustainability strategy as we further strengthened our Vision by revising it to include ethics. Thus, the new Vision of the company is “To WE CONTINUE TO ADHERE TO INTERNATIONAL be the most recognized Mexican company worldwide in INITIATIVES THAT PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH: its sector, for its global approach, the quality of its proWE REPORT OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN cesses, excellence of its people and the ethical conduct THE CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT (CDP) AND HAVE of its business.” PREPARED THIS REPORT WITH THE NEW G4 VERSION OF THE GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI).

This year, that work environment was monitored by the Great Place to Work Institute, which conducted a survey across all company employees. Thus today, more than ever, Peñoles is “As great as our people.” 05 MESSAGE FROM THE CEO 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT_AS GREAT AS OUR PEOPLE FURTHER TO THESE ACTIONS, THIS REPORT PRESENTS MORE EXAMPLES OF OUR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY, WHICH ENABLES US TO ENSURE BOTH THE VIABILITY AND LONGEVITY OF OUR COMPANY, AND THE CREATION OF ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL VALUE AMONG OUR STAKEHOLDER GROUPS.
