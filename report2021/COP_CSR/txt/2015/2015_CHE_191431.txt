This includes all aspects of ecological sustainability, together with a broad range of matters relating to social and economic sustainability (in particular security and risk analysis). We are convinced that, against a background of globalisation and rapid technical and economic development, it is a long-term necessity to recognise and tackle deficits in the ecological, social and security spheres. As the world becomes more transparent and communications more immediate and direct, it is increasingly difficult to conceal or put off these deficits. Forward-looking corporate policies, an Dr. Jürg Liechti environmentally-friendly attitude towards resources and confidenceinspiring relations with all our business partners and stakeholders are therefore competitive advantages that make a crucial difference. CEO and President An annual report drawn up in accordance with the principles of the of the Board of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a valuable instrument for reporting Directors progress towards sustainability to an interested public. Although this standard is primarily aimed at larger companies, a “GRI Report” provides us with the optimum link between our desire to draw up a report for external interested parties and our integrated management system, which requires a review report. Consequently we use the information we process to help us improve our management, as well as passing it on to interested parties. We also offer support to our customers for their own reporting, especially if they are already working with management systems. In this context, our report may also serve as an example of how SMEs can be actively involved in preparing sustainability reports. We are therefore pleased to present you with the fifth GRI-compliant Neosys AG sustainability report. We are as convinced as ever by this instrument, and warmly invite you as a stakeholder in our company to join us in reviewing our activities and services during 2014. This report is also the Communication on Progress (COP) for the UN Global Compact which covers the period January 1st to December 31st 2014. I would like to address our stakeholders directly and to emphasize:I am pleased to confirm that Neosys reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In this annual COP, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. I would like to thank all our employees for their excellent contributions and our customers for their trust in us during the previous year! 4 Sustainability report Neosys AG Our company in 2014 Developments – Impact – Opportunities The financial year 2014 was characterised on the one hand by very good business performance and on the other by major fluctuations and interesting new developments. It was “full speed ahead” in 2014 with many of the services developed by Neosys AG over recent years as part of our strategic objectives. Particular reference should be made here to legal services, CO2 services and services in the waste and chemicals sector. Taken together with a very good general economic situation, this has led to an above-average annual turnover and some very hectic periods of activity. But at the same time there have also been a lot of staff changes, making this a year with one of the highest staff fluctuation rates to date, involving people at all levels. 2014 was also the year with the greatest ever investment in new measures and the continuing development of services. The ‘LexPLUS’ database was created, both in order to rationalise our data management, and also to achieve a more attractive and more professional image for our legal services. This tool will facilitate the growth of our legal services over the coming years. Our own Neosys app, developed to our specifications, has created an original aid for the quick and easy production and management of risk assessment portfolios in the workplace. We have been able to start up pilot projects in various target areas, enabling us to develop new services in areas such as nanomaterials and their associated risks, energy services and the environmental footprints of companies and organisations. In order to adapt our own Internet presence to changing expectations and methods, we have renovated our website, thus implementing a measure that was decided upon during the previous year. Two staff changes represent a major turning point: CFO and co-founder of the ‘new’ Neosys, Rolf Scheidegger, retired and passed the baton to Barbara Lanz. As the general administrative management is part of this post, the effects of this changeover are felt by all the staff. We are confident that our ‘interior ministry’ is in good new hands. Clemens Lang, co-founder of the CSR Business Unit and for 14 years one of the best-known Neosys faces – not least because of his role as President of the ISO 26000 Standards Committee – will be a hard act to follow. His departure has triggered an examination of the orientation of the CSR Business Unit. Although 2015 started with the shock of the Swiss franc revaluation in January, which is still raising a large question mark over the economy, the opportunities for the future business activities of Neosys are still looking very good. Through well-considered continuous development and investment, we have ensured that we are ideally placed to shape the services offered in certain sectors of the market. It is now a matter of turning this great starting point into consistent results. We intend to focus in particular on the following developments: • Our legal compliance services are in great demand. By developing our new software solution we have put ourselves in a position where we can respond to the demand more widely and efficiently (i.e. more competitively), and offer a modern, attractive instrument. • Our capacity for offering energy services has grown substantially and we are using it to the full. The political significance of the ‘energy transition’ may be waning a little, but the practical (usually economic!) energy measures in the industrial and commercial sectors 2014 5 will be a hot topic for some time to come. A special USP of ours in this context is that we combine practical measures with an energy plan in accordance with ISO 50001, and are able to integrate this energy management system into the management system of a company. • We have established ourselves in the field of CO2 services, both as validators of target agreements and as developers of compensation projects. The continuation of the Swiss CO2 policy beyond 2020 is already an important issue. Regardless of the precise way in which the framework conditions for this phase are implemented, CO2 will remain a significant issue, and with our expertise we are soundly placed to continue providing valuable services in this area. However it is also important to be aware of other, rather ominous developments. The Technology-Environment and RisCare Business Units have a solid and attractive mix of products, which, however, are mainly aimed at industrial customers. The deindustrialisation of Switzerland is still progressing and, with the new financial policy of the National Bank, even accelerating. Every year customers are lost or take their industrial activities abroad, and this represents a significant risk to Neosys. Our reaction to this is, firstly, to develop services aimed at the tertiary sector and public organisations, such as new eco-rating systems for businesses and organisations. New industrial and service activities are also constantly emerging, and we observe these actively. Secondly, we also seek to strengthen our presence in certain markets that are showing a trend towards contraction in such a way as to ensure a long-term profitable situation (e.g. services relating to the transport of hazardous cargo and hazardous substances).

Wasserversorgung Zürich, the city of Zurich’s water supply department, employs 280 people, supplying water to a population of around 900,000 and numerous businesses in a 660 km2 catchment area. Water from lakes, rivers, springs and groundwater is treated, pumped and delivered to consumers with an energy expenditure of approx. 38 GWh (2012). Although targets have been agreed with the Federal Government and the Canton, those responsible wanted to undertake a systematic analysis and take greater control of their use of energy. They decided to establish an energy management system according to ISO 50001, and called on professional support from Neosys. The project was structured in 8 phases, the individual elements of which were incorporated wherever possible into the existing management system for quality, the environment and occupational safety (ISO 9001+14001, OHSAS 18001). Throughout the project, two perspectives were adopted: the reduction in energy consumption and/or the increase in energy efficiency of any organisational or technical measures applied. Existing procedures were reassessed and expanded to include energy optimisation, for example in the areas of procurement and production planning/strategies. Energy planning formed a core element of the project, with an evaluation of the existing data and visualisation using a Sankey diagram, to show the energy flows (electricity, fossil fuels) and their use (production, mobility, the running of buildings, etc.), and to determine areas where there is potential for improvement. Targets were set and the developments monitored using key energy indicators. An energy team meets regularly, to exchange information and findings and to decide on the next steps. Wasserversorgung Zürich passed the certification audit by SQS straight away. The management are convinced that the energy management instruments help them to provide an even more energy-saving and energy-efficient supply of healthy drinking water. Barbara Linz, Simon Kröni, Silvio Borella Neosys AG – MSC and Technology-Environment 8 Sustainability report Neosys AG Economy The success of our company Current status and indicators The net turnover (DB1) is slightly above the budgeted level, even though the budget was ambitious (see table below for the essential indicators). This reflects the good market situation. Extraordinary staff costs, as well as a rather too low offset level (see staff productivity) have meant that the planned profit (EBIT) has not been achieved despite the good turnover figures. The reasons for these discrepancies have been clearly analysed: staff fluctuations led to recruitment costs and reduced productivity during the induction periods. In addition, the development projects (LexPLUS database, Neosys app) caused an aboveaverage level of work that could not be offset. Despite these factors, the EBIT of CHF 225,000 was substantially above the previous year’s level and gave a profit margin of 6.7%. This is within the target range (yield acceptance level) of 5.0 to 10.0%. The Technology-Environment and RisCare Business Units showed particularly positive results for the reporting year. The results of the MSC Business Unit were somewhat diminished by writing off from the database project and the large amount of development work. The CSR results were affected by the departure of the head of the Business Unit. Staff productivity again fell slightly in comparison with the previous year (1.47) and is not satisfactory as it is still below the long-term reference value of 1.50. The reasons have already been mentioned above. There were no special financial influences in 2014, which means that the operating profits and the cash flow are at a good 80% of the budgeted value, in line with the EBIT situation.

A comparison with the previous year shows that the percentage expenditure on staff and premises has fallen, and that, on the other hand, the depreciation and advertising costs represent a larger slice of the cake. The depreciation is a natural result of the high level of investments. The essential cause of the increased advertising costs is the renewal of the website. It is still the 2014 9 case that the material expenditure makes up around 20% of the costs, the remaining 80% being direct and indirect staff costs. This makes clear that the expenditure at Neosys is dominated by staff costs and that the performance of the company depends on a good staff return, that is, a high offsetable utilisation of the existing staff capacities. Composition of costs in 2014 0.72% 3.20% 2.33% 0.73% 3.95% 1.49% Wages and salaries 4.35% Social security contributions 3.19% Further training Other staff costs 1.59% Rent and utilities Maintenance / Repairs 13.08% Property insurance 65.38% Vehicles / Travel and rep. Office and administration Advertising costs Depreciation Assessment The financial parameters are all in the satisfactory range, with turnover expectations slightly exceeded and anticipated EBIT and yields not quite achieved. The reasons for the discrepancies were satisfactorily explained. Measures • Improved account balance through increasing the efficiency of non-productive activities • No introduction of additional unproductive activities • Further pay scale adjustments where possible • Introduction of a new pension fund model with defined contributions Our customers Current status and indicators Our customers are companies, authorities (departments and municipalities) and organisations (associations, international organisations, NGOs, etc.) in Switzerland and 10 Sustainability report Neosys AG abroad. Our customer base has included a broad range of industries for many years. Neosys AG provides personal support and consulting services that are tailored to our clients and their requirements. Our customer relations, strongly characterised by personal contact, have provided us with direct feedback about our customers’ satisfaction with our work and the services we offer. In addition, we systematically use a questionnaire to obtain information on customer satisfaction, to enable us to continually improve. The rate of return of customer questionnaires in 2014 was 19% of those sent out (24 out of 124), which is slightly less than last year (over 20%). Overall, customer satisfaction, while still at a very high level (almost all the parameters in the survey were rated at around 90%), saw a slight overall drop, although as in the previous year almost all the assessments were “good” and “very good”. For the parameters we consider to be the most important, i.e. the level to which we and our services fulfilled customer expectations and our specialist and project management expertise, the average values have been in the same region for the past three years. In the reporting period we received no complaints from customers. 2014 11 Unit of Target Indicator measure2014 2013 2012 2014 ment Weighted Overall average customer satisfaction percentage 0.881  0.90 0.90 0.88 Overall average customer satisfaction % “very good” 67.7 --71.5 68.6 Weighted Average of criteria 1-8 percentage 0.893  0.90 0.91 0.90 Average of criteria 1-8 % “very good” 70.6 --75.3 73.3 Assessment We have achieved a high level of customer satisfaction for years. This is pleasing and motivating for us, but the slightly negative trend gives us food for thought and spurs us on to improve to our previous level and beyond. Measures • Further monitoring of the trends indicated by the customer survey and of the return rate • Regular (monthly) examination and assessment by the company management of the feedback from the questionnaire and any complaints • Use of the annual project manager continuous development training (since 2012) to improve the perception of the project managers in their dealings with customers (e.g. presentation techniques) Successful project management, from situation analysis to implementation “As we were overtaxed with the renovation of our foundry’s exhaust air system, we sought support from Neosys and instructed them to draw up a restructuring plan. The Neosys AG project manager led the project very skilfully, from the preparation of the situation analysis and drafting of the specifications through to obtaining quotes and comparing procedures and tenders. He also ensured that the necessary guarantees were obtained from providers. We were given transparency at all times regarding the anticipated investment and operating costs. In negotiations with providers and the authorities, he demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of the legislation relating to various disciplines. We felt we were receiving excellent advice in this field at all times and are convinced that the project will be implemented successfully and to schedule.” Peter Koller. Processing manager at Georg Fischer JRG AG 12 Sustainability report Neosys AG Our suppliers Current status and indicators Supplier management is of secondary importance for Neosys as most of the value chain comes from the work of the employees and only very little is contributed by suppliers. For our basic operational needs, we have important suppliers in the areas of IT, mobility, office material and laboratory services. There were no negative incidents involving suppliers in 2014; we assessed one supplier after completing an internal project. Neosys has defined a code of conduct that includes the locally valid environmental, occupational safety and occupational legislation, as well as the ILO core conventions and the payment of social security contributions and taxes. Service partners and suppliers with a purchase volume in excess of CHF 1000 per annum have been informed of this code and asked to confirm their compliance by means of self-declaration. In 2014 a call for tenders was organised for our own use (development of database software), in which this code was applied. For years we have been purchasing Fair Trade coffee, recycled paper and 100% organic produce for the fruit provided for employees’ breaks. In addition, the IT products used are sourced from an electronics company that is a leader in the field of fair working conditions. In accordance with the Management Handbook, the (internal) list of criteria that relate to the ecological and social aspects of the sustainable acquisition of products is applied. Unit of Target Indicator measure2014 2013 2012 2014 ment Reviewed suppliers/service partners Number 1 --0 45 Exclusion of suppliers Number 0 --0 1 Assessment The supplier management system was applied extensively in 2014, in connection with the handover of the post of head of management systems. Important key suppliers were assessed and evaluated in accordance with the specifications. The suppliers who have not responded have yet to be followed up. Measures • Continue the many years’ collaboration with known, established partners • Monitor/update the supplier list • Review suppliers who are relevant but have never responded to the request for selfdeclarations • Examine whether project partners abroad are included in the assessment (of the social and environmental aspects) 2014 13 Innovation Current status and indicators In 2014 there were seven innovation projects that were continued throughout the year. Four of these were completed with the desired successful outcome. One project was postponed, and two are still ongoing. The sharp increase in hours spent on development projects is due to the database development project. Unit of Target Indicator measure2014 2013 2012 2014 ment Innovation projects handled (as at end  Number 7 4 4 4 of the year) Working hours spent on innovation Hrs 770.5 --274.3 49.3 projects In addition to those designated as development projects, there are further projects associated with development activities, but these are not reviewed in accordance with the development process. The review of development processes is not harmonised and takes place on different quality levels. Assessment There is a large number of innovation projects, and it is pleasing to see the process being used. However, the development control system is below the optimum and should be improved/harmonised. Measures • Revision of the innovation process Development control as a standard agenda item at the company management meeting • Adaptation of the development control tool to make the development control system better structured and more comprehensive • Introduction of an “offset procedure” to give a higher value to hours spent on development Management system Current status and indicators Neosys AG has an integrated management system. The company's quality management has been ISO 9001-certified since 1994. The management system is expedient and is regularly developed further. The compliance audit for 2014 by the certification authority was carried out with no weaknesses found. 14 Sustainability report Neosys AG Due to the departure of the management systems manager, this function had to be passed once again into new hands. The introduction of the new manager took up resources, but offers the opportunity to examine and optimise the processes with a fresh pair of eyes. The reporting was carried out in the form of a sustainability report (in line with the GRI G3 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative, which remain valid), a procedure that has proved to be successful. Concerning the revision of these guidelines and the version G4 that has now come into force, we have already carried out a stakeholder analysis in connection with the 2014 strategy meeting and in future will use this in our decisions relating to market activities. Our in-house legal compliance department is monitored using the same tool that we supply to our customers. The investigation in the spring of 2014 showed no instances of noncompliance. There are also no proceedings open against Neosys AG. Assessment The integrated management system has proven itself for the running of the company. It is generally well-accepted and is run efficiently. Combining the management system and the sustainability report also opens up numerous synergies for obtaining information and disseminating it to stakeholders internally (including the management itself) and externally. In previous years the Neosys AG reporting was found to be good by several independent observers. Measures • Continuation of the existing instruments and further ongoing investigation of potential improvements to the IMS. • Regular holding of training courses on administrative and content aspects of project management. • A staged revision of the GRI report in line with Version 4.0 of the GRI standard. 2014 15 People and society Corporate structure and governance Current status and indicators At the end of the reporting period the Board of Directors at Neosys AG consisted of four people, of whom two were major shareholders and two were external parties. As an SME not listed on the stock exchange, it is our policy for the members of the Board of Directors to firstly be the major shareholders responsible and secondly selected external individuals who can support Neosys with their network of contacts. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is also the majority shareholder and the CEO. This constellation results from the management buyout in 2006 and is intended to help stabilise the company. It is reviewed at regular intervals. The company management consists of the heads of the four Business Units (one is also the CEO) and the Director of Finance and Administration. From a geographical perspective, the company is currently run from three offices in Switzerland, as well as via a number of freelancers in various regions of the world. The current strategy includes an appendix on the geographical orientation of the company’s activities. Neosys AG fundamentally believes it makes sense to provide its services globally. It does not, however, have a proactive strategy for expansion, but responds to opportunities for cooperation. 16 Sustainability report Neosys AG The market meeting has an essential role as an important committee to discuss the company’s management and organisation. It regulates the issues relating to product design, marketing and the corporate image. It comprises all employees with project manager status (excluding freelancers). The strategy committee reviews the corporate strategy on an annual basis. It has a new composition every year, which is decided by the Board of Directors, and in which at least the Board of Directors and the company management are represented. This flexibility makes it possible to adapt the participants to the current situation and to the form of the strategic meeting according to the specific situation. Assessment The governance structure has proved itself to date, in that it has led to the continuous development of the company and its performance. Measures No measures are planned in the area of corporate structure. Stakeholders Current status and indicators As a company we associate closely in our activities and services with numerous individuals and groups internally and externally. These include in particular our customers and our employees, as well as many other stakeholders. As part of our strategy development, in 2010 we undertook an initial and general identification of our stakeholders; as a result of this initial assessment we see our important stakeholders as: • Customers, i.e. private industry, public sector, international organisations • Employees and freelancers • Suppliers, i.e. suppliers in the value chain, service providers to Neosys (banks, insurance companies, ...) • Collaboration partners • Media • External market influencers • Local community (neighbours, associations, municipality, canton) • Market partners (“competitors”) • Nature and ecosystems (i.e. the representatives of interested parties and their spokespersons) This list gives us an initial rough overview of the number and variety of our stakeholders. The GRI G4 guidelines, which will apply from 2016 as an international standard for sustainability reporting, require that the ecological and social criteria on which an organisation should report are jointly developed with the stakeholders. In 2014 the management therefore carried out a detailed analysis of our stakeholders. For both Neosys 2014 17 overall and our individual Business Units, this showed a very complex pattern of stakeholders with varying interests in our activities and varying degrees of influence on them1. At the start of 2014 we held a workshop with our employees, a particularly important stakeholder group, to discuss the essential aspects of the reporting system. We will also seek to establish dialogue with our less well-known stakeholder groups, and use this as a basis for determining the instruments we can use in future for the optimum exchange of information and ideas with our relevant stakeholders. Assessment The analysis of the stakeholders was an essential first stage in ensuring that our reporting conforms with the revised GRI G4 standard. However there is still work to do before we bring ourselves completely into line with this standard in 2016. Special care must be taken to ensure that the selected mix of instruments remains appropriate for an SME. Measures • Staged implementation of the GRI report in accordance with Version 4.0 of the GRI. This includes: Making contact with the important known stakeholders and clarifying their requirements Incorporating the requirements thus found into the design of the annual report Where necessary, determining new instruments and means of communication for certain stakeholders Business practices and anticorruption Current status and indicators In accordance with our corporate values we seek to ensure ethical conduct towards all our partners and stakeholders (see “Stakeholders” section). Because it is important to our credibility and identity, many aspects of ethical conduct have been applied implicitly to date. Thus, for example, complaints and criticisms from customers, neighbours, social groups, employees etc. are recorded in a list and pursued by the management system manager. 1 In our stakeholder analysis we followed the method proposed by Johnson & Scholes (2002). 18 Sustainability report Neosys AG Unit of Target Indicator measure2014 2013 2012 2014 ment Employees who were given anti% of people 40  75 57 57 corruption training Cases in which there was any Number 0 --12 0 suspected corruption Complaints from stakeholders with regard to environmental or social Number 0 --0 0 aspects At home, i.e. in Switzerland, we generally assess the risks connected with corruption as low. However, in the case of projects abroad we perceive an increased risk of being confronted with activities that could be described as corruption. In order to be able to counter these, we formulated and adopted an in-house anticorruption policy in 2013, including integration into the provisions of the employment contracts, specifications for the tender phase and order processing. This includes a description of the possible risk situations and the relevant preventive measures and procedures in cases of suspicion. Potential risk situations or cases that could fall under the category of corruption are dealt with as an agenda item in the monthly management meetings and a list compiled. There were no cases of this kind in the 2014 reporting period. The measures of the Management Review 2014 provided for the anticorruption training course of 2011 to be repeated, as many new employees have come to Neosys in the intervening period who have still not received this training. This training course did not take place. The percentage of trained employees has therefore fallen again due to staff fluctuations and the target was not met. Assessment The anticorruption policy introduced in 2013 provides a practical framework with regard to corruption and attempted illegal influence by third parties which may affect us in the course of our activities. The fall in the rate of trained employees is a failure that must be rectified in 2015. Measures • Carry out anticorruption training in 2015 (Transparency International). The aim is still for at least 75% of the workforce to be trained in this • Maintain the list for recording and pursuing situations that involve the risk of corruption 2 See the 2013 report 2014 19 From the Neosys AG service portfolio: FMEA risk analysis of a wind farm in the country where the plant is situated – from a lack of or insufficient infrastructure to Should an investment be made in a specific corrupt planning consent procedures – must wind farm abroad, or not? be taken into account to produce a reliable This question is very interesting in a political ‘risk-adjusted’ business plan.

As at the reporting date these posts are divided between 21 people. There are also non-time-limited cooperation agreements with 8 further people (freelancers). The proportion of female employees is around one-third (33.1%) of the FTE, thus remaining at roughly the same level as the previous years. At the end of the reporting period the management was made up of two women out of five (37.2% of the FTE).

An increase in the workforce is planned. The distribution of employees by age can be seen from the following diagram. The age statistics have also changed substantially compared with the previous year, with the proportion of those over 50 increasing from 29% to 44%. A more precise analysis shows that the average age has not changed substantially, but rather that several employees have recently passed the threshold of 50. 2014 21 In spring we held a poll among the employees to ask whether and under what circumstances male employees could be granted paternity leave. At the same time there was a poll on the possibility of introducing an additional week’s holiday for all employees. Both measures were raised in the annual employee satisfaction survey. The majority voted for an additional week’s holiday and 5 days’ paternity leave, to be compensated for by increasing the working week from the present 40 to 41 hours. This was implemented with retrospective effect from 1 January 2014. During 2014 two employees made use of the new paternity leave arrangements. Occupational health and safety policy: Many Neosys employees are not office workers, often carrying out their activities at customers’ premises in a wide range of working environments: in foundries or power plants, at chemical works, scrap processing plants, building sites, etc. This give rise to health risks, which were assessed by internal Neosys safety officers. The measures required to protect employees from work-related accidents or illnesses were determined, including the need for personal protective equipment. Periodic training courses and exchanges of experience are held to enable employees to prepare themselves properly for site visits and to be aware of the risks at customers’ premises. We have seen a reduction in the overall absence rate compared with the previous year, when the serious illness of one colleague contributed to a very high level. In January 2015 we carried out the annual employee satisfaction survey for the 2014 reporting period. The overall score increased again and is now 7.68, substantially above the target of 7. Assessment Neosys offers all of its employees modern terms and conditions of employment with opportunities for specialist and personal development and growth, a good level of operational freedom and high delegation of responsibility. The motivation of our employees is one of Neosys AG’s most important resources – it is closely connected to employee satisfaction. We therefore measure this satisfaction and continually seek to improve our performance in this respect. The most important instrument in this regard is the evaluation of the suggestions that are made at the time of the annual employee survey. Recent examples of the implementation of suggestions include the redesign/expansion of the office premises in Gerlafingen, and the provision of information to 22 Sustainability report Neosys AG employees about the company’s cost structure and basic calculation principles (in particular relating to salaries). As the possibilities open to the company here are limited, and certain requirements of individual employees vary greatly, it is impossible to have a set of measures that fully satisfy everyone. The salaries of male and female employees are not completely equal, but compared with the average in Switzerland, they only differ moderately. The threshold differences between Category 3 project managers has improved somewhat since the previous year, but the analysis carried out then (on the basis of employees’ length of service) still remains valid. The wage spread is low (< 3), which is typical for a Swiss SME. Measures • Further intensive consideration of the responses from the employee survey. Experience of paternity leave “I was the first Neosys employee to be granted a full week’s paternity leave. The effect of this extended holiday on our family’s eco-balance could not be determined precisely, but I would imagine that the savings made from not having to commute (by rail) were slightly higher than the additional pollution caused by inefficient nappy changes (I use substantially more paper than my wife does). In any case, my wife and my 3 other children really enjoyed Daddy being there for those extra days. And I am delighted to have been able to experience my daughter’s first week as a full-time Dad.” Silvio Borella, Physicist and energy specialist, Neosys project manager Sponsoring, memberships, charity activities Current status and indicators It is part of our philosophy to be active in local sponsoring and to be a member of industry and specialist organisations relevant for our company. 2014 23 Our local sponsoring expenditure in 2014 was slightly below the budget for the year. The largest part – CHF 3,000 this year – is traditionally spent on a Christmas donation to various social institutions in the area around the company headquarters. We make further donations in support of events by local associations and organisations. On the other hand, employee contributions have increased again, and the annual budget has been exceeded. The reason for this is the company’s broad spectrum of activities and the increasing number of associations and organisations. An important new membership (2014) is with InfraWatt. Unit of Target Indicator measure2014 2013 2012 2014 ment Sponsoring, donations CHF 4,400  4,700 3,700 3,700 Member contributions CHF 20,442  17,500 17,322 16,149 In addition to financial contributions, Neosys AG is also active in a number of bodies which contribute to honing society's awareness of sustainability, and correspondingly in events without any reimbursement of expenses (e.g. ISO National Committee, the Interest Group for Ecological Purchasing [IGÖB] Office, Swiss Association of Independent Safety and Security Engineers and Consultants [SSI] etc.). We consider these to be platforms for networking with other specialists, gaining new ideas and raising awareness of our company and its services among a wide range of potential cooperation partners and customers. A number of our employees are active as volunteers for social issues (NGOs, politics, churches, professional associations, etc.). Neosys AG welcomes charitable and political activities by its employees. These are not supported financially or by granting work time off; however, any flexibility in working hours that this requires is granted. Assessment The costs posted are around 10% of EBIT and therefore are deemed sufficient and acceptable for a company of this size. Measures • Sponsoring to continue as provided by the budget 2014 24 Environment Since April 2011 Neosys AG has operated a certified environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001. We have specified and pursued our environmental objectives for 2014 accordingly. Our company’s environmental impact was analysed for the first time in 2010 and has been updated regularly since then. Our legal compliance is also checked regularly. No failures to comply have been found. The main relevance of our activities is on two levels. In terms of our own environmental impact, the emphasis is above all on mobility, followed by the office infrastructure. The second way in which we influence the control of environmental impact is by means of the projects we carry out for our customers. Some of these indirect effects are considerable, but difficult to determine at reasonable expense. However, we ask our customers the right questions and give them active support in increasing their contribution to the environment. Operations-related aspects Current status and indicators Our greenhouse gas balance for 2014 is around 30.0 tonnes of CO2 and has dropped slightly compared with the last evaluation period (31.3 tonnes of CO2). For closer consideration of the balance, the three sources of emissions, “Heating”, “Car travel” and “Air travel” were defined. In the very low-level “Air travel” category, there has been a slight increase in emissions of 0.2 tonnes (12%), due to a slight increase in kilometres travelled by this method because of foreign projects abroad within Europe3. In contrast, in the other two categories there has been a reduction in the quantity of CO2 emissions – a slight reduction in the car travel category of 0.4 tonnes of CO2 (approx. -2%) and 1.1 tonnes (approx. -9%) for heating. The CO2 emissions attributable to Neosys are compensated for by the purchase of certificates from the Fair Recycling Foundation in Zurich. This brings the Neosys AG “attributable” CO2 emissions to zero. 3 The air travel undertaken by Neosys for SQS is neutralised via climate tickets by SQS and not included in this statistic. 2014 25 The consumption of electricity for office operations and for rail travel is not calculated in the greenhouse gas footprint. This is due to the fact that we buy electricity from 100% renewable sources and therefore do not include the amount of approx. 24 g CO2/kWh calculated by the Federal Government for the Swiss electricity grid. The table of indicators below shows the further relevant values in comparison with the two previous years. Unit of Target Indicator measure2014 2013 2012 2014 ment CO2 emissions, actual t CO2 30.0 --31.2 26.6 CO2 emissions, compensated % 100  100 100 0 CO2 emissions per capita t CO2/FTE 1.71 --1.96 1.82 Road kilometres km/FTE 4,929 --5,808 4,981 Modal split rail/car kmB/(kmA+kmB) 0.598  >0.600 0.576 0.591 Air kilometres km/FTE 404 --377 417 Production of waste kg/FTE 52.6 --59.0 60.6 Power consumption kWh/FTE 1,098 --1,2194 2,466 Proportion of green power kWhÖ/kWhtot 1.000  1.000 1.000 0.497 Paper consumption kg/FTE 35.9 --40.0 34.6 Water consumption Litre/FTE 11.1 --15.6 14.7 In the autumn of 2014 we saved a row of chestnut trees from felling through our property management. Against the background of our otherwise limited possibilities this was a small measure in favour of biodiversity. 4 The electricity consumption was duplicated in previous years (see 2013 report). 26 Sustainability report Neosys AG Assessment The overall reduction in CO2 output over the reporting year is pleasing, but is closely connected to our order situation. An increase in orders may require increased travel, often to customers or project sites that are further afield. Therefore it is not always possible or desirable to avoid a potential increase in the actual CO2 emissions – in particular from air travel in the case of increased activity abroad – in future years. We therefore consider it essential to continue to compensate for our CO2 emissions with appropriate projects. We carefully select the projects from which we obtain compensation certificates, and ensure compliance with international standards and the strict validation and verification of each project. 2014 27 Our substantial CO2 reduction objective is to reduce the transport mode split between train and car. With an increase to 59.8% we have almost achieved our target for 2014 of >60%. The actual CO2 output per FTE in the workplace, at 1.71 t/FTE, has decreased by 13% compared with the previous year’s figure of 1.96 t/FTE. We continue to pursue the overall objective of becoming a “1-tonne of CO2” company. We have also recorded a pleasing development in the other reported environmental indicators. The waste generated per FTE decreased by 10.9%, the electricity consumption by 9.9%, the paper consumption by 10.3% and the water consumption by 28.9%. We have therefore achieved our paper consumption target of a reduction of at least 10% compared with 2013. We have also used green electricity for 100% of our electricity consumption. We have nevertheless moved forward with our project to establish our own solar power plant at our headquarters in Gerlafingen. A practicable solution could be in place by the summer of 2015. Measures We have updated our environmental objectives as follows for 2015: • Maintain climate-neutral operation (attributable CO2 emissions = 0) by ensuring as high a proportion as possible of rail travel by offsetting the remaining emissions (e.g. purchasing emissions certificates or climate tickets) • Improve the transport mode split to a rail proportion > 60% • Halt specific paper consumption • Implement our own solar power production by the end of 2015 The corresponding measures consist of promoting rail travel and the electronic office, and continuing with CO2 compensation by means of reputable offset certificates. Product-related aspects Actual status, assessment, measures As a small consultancy company our direct, business-related environmental impact (office administration and business travel) is quite low. Our aim and motivation is, however, to achieve positive environmental effects among our customers by means of the services and advice we provide in the area of sustainability. Services we offer that have a particularly strong leverage effect in this regard are in our view: • Introduction of environmental and energy management systems • Legacy consulting and redevelopment • Environmental technology (waste air, noise, NIR, etc.) and CO2 projects • Waste management • Energy management • Eco-balances However, other services we offer to our customers also have a contributory effect, for example by making structures and processes more efficient and helping companies to 28 Sustainability report Neosys AG become more aware of their environmental impact. We have described some of these services and approaches throughout this report. It is unfortunately not possible to quantify the effects of these offers at reasonable expense with any degree of precision. It often depends on the individual case. Assessment With regard to quality, our impact is all the greater the more and the bigger the mandates we have with highly environmentally relevant clients. This situation is certainly satisfactory today. Our aim to increase this impact further goes hand in hand with our growth activities.

On the one hand it enables us to keep our various partners and stakeholders systematically and transparently informed about our own services and varied activities. On the other hand it also enables us to offer our customers consultancy services in the area of reporting. We therefore also regard our sustainability report as an example of how sustainability reporting can be implemented in an SME. In 2013 the fourth version of the Global Reporting Initiative reporting guidelines (GRI G4) was issued. According to this, companies preparing reports in future should determine the essential criteria to report on with their stakeholders. It should therefore be decided jointly where the greatest levers can be applied to improve sustainability – as the reporting should also increase the awareness of the central themes within the company. Some larger companies have already completed the route to GRI G4 while others are still hesitating. It should, however, be assumed that GRI G4 will be adopted in the coming years by most major companies in Switzerland as the standard for their reporting, as is currently the case with the third version, GRI G3. From the beginning of 2016, reports drafted in accordance with GRI G3 will no longer be deemed to meet the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative – and will also no longer be assessed and categorised by means of a “Report Check”. Whether GRI G4 remains the right way for SMEs remains to be seen. At any rate, GRI G3 still provides clear guidelines on which themes can be included in a report and how this should take place. The additional expense for an SME of establishing a stakeholder management system may also be considered too high. For us at Neosys, GRI G3 currently has a major advantage as it enables us to pass on the information that we generate from our management system directly to our stakeholders. At the same time we are already on the path to GRI G4 and have e.g. undertaken a stakeholder analysis and use it to build up a systematic stakeholder management system. We will gladly pass on the experience hereby gained to our customers, as we are already doing with regard to the link between established management systems and the reporting procedure. It is increasingly clear that sustainability reporting represents a substantial opportunity for SMEs. Within the framework of GRI G4 major companies now have to consider their supply chains in greater depth and find out their suppliers’ attitudes to ecological and social issues. In so doing they will now turn their attention more frequently to SMEs. In this context alone it is certainly a good thing for SMEs to contemplate producing a sustainability report at an early stage, to ensure they are appropriately prepared. Management systems and their reporting components provide a good basis for this.” Dr Jörg Schmidt, Neosys CSR Project Manager The present report covers the period from 1.1.2014 until 31.12.2014. It represents the fifth public sustainability report of Neosys AG and incorporates all departments and areas of activity of Neosys AG. The sustainability report is repeated on an annual basis and with regard to the reporting criteria and the process of drafting the reports, corresponds to application level C of version 3.1 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, which is 32 Sustainability report Neosys AG still valid.
