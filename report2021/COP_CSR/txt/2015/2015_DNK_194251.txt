To maintain and develop this position, we are convinced it is a prerequisite to conduct our business in a responsible manner – “Doing Business the Right Way”. However, we must admit our principles are under intense pressure from competitors NOT doing business the right way. ScanCom’s approach to doing business the right way was recognized in 2014 when we were the recipient of the “CSR Abroad Prize”, an award established by Denmark’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and this provided great encouragement to continue our CSR strategy. Sustainability for materials, products, and operations To create and offer sustainable products, ScanCom controls all materials and products in order to meet all relevant regulations in our markets. For the Stig Maasbøl Group CEO wood used in our products, ScanCom was a pioneer in using FSC certified ScanCom International A/S hardwood, and today we use 100% FSC hardwood with an objective to increase the level of FSC teak year by year. At the same time we continuously optimize our operating activities to reduce consumption of energy and resources, increase recycling, and reduce emissions. Our main operation site in Vietnam is operated under ISO 14001 certificate. Social accountability It is important for ScanCom to assure respect for human and labor rights. Key features of this are: BSCI monitoring of all operations in Vietnam since 2008, SA 8000 certificates for the operations in Brazil (2012) and Indonesia (2001), and having our own Code of Conduct. OHSAS 18001 certification for health and safety management was obtained for the Vietnamese operation in 2014. Being signatory to the UN Global Compact, in addition to BSCI monitoring and certifications, sends a clear signal to all our stakeholders that we are committed to doing business the right way and also supports our activities in terms of meeting the CSR requirements of our global customers. Requirements for contract manufacturers and key suppliers Built into the BSCI CoC, SA 8000, and UN Global Compact are requirements for the improvement of CSR level in the supply chain. ScanCom actively practises this by performing CSR audits at key suppliers and contract manufacturers and requesting them to sign our Code of Conduct, and targets are set for continuous improvement in terms of that policy. UN Global Compact commitment I am very pleased that ScanCom, even under the difficult conditions of recent years, has been able to remain true to its basic CSR values and to make progress, or at least maintain the same high level, in all 10 of the UN Global Compact principles. For the following seasons ScanCom will continue to further develop commitment to the UN Global Compact – “Doing Business the Right Way” will remain part of our DNA. 5 ScanCom International A/S LEGAL STRUCTURE FINANCE FIGURES The finance figures for ScanCom International A/S are presented below: Key figures (DDK million): 2014/15 2013/14 2012/13 2011/12 2010/11 Income Statement: Revenue 880.8 672.2 710.6 752.7 882.3 EBITDA 32.6 21.2 39.7 44.5 62.8 Operating profit 10.3 6.7 16.7 23.3 36.5 Financial income and expenses 5.1 -12.5 -13.7 15.8 -33.0 Profit/loss before tax 15.4 -5.9 3.0 39.1 3.5 Corporation tax -5.2 0.1 -0.4 -8.3 -3.7 Net Profit for the year 10.1 -5.3 2.5 30.8 -0.2 Balance: Total assets 593.3 506.1 431.6 479.3 455.8 Investment in property, plant and equipment 35.0 20.2 12.4 33.2 40.7 Current Assets 427.3 357.9 280.3 305.2 313.8 Equity 152.7 150.3 160.1 166.0 161.9 Current liabilities 432.8 301.3 210.4 244.6 227.3 Employees: Average number of emloyees 3,932 4,415 4,284 4,541 4,725 6 ScanCom International A/S PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND OBJECTIVES For season 14/15 ScanCom selected the performance indicators given below and set related objectives.

CSR ABROAD PRIZE In November 2014 ScanCom received the CSR Abroad Prize, an award established by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as recognition of the ongoing commitment to “Doing Business the Right Way”. The reasons cited for the award were: ScanCom’s co-operation with labor unions; the systematic improvement of CSR activities within the supply chain; the incorporation of CSR into ScanCom’s business strategy; and the longstanding commitment to the use of FSC certified wood. WORKPLACE CONDITION ASSESSMENT During season 14/15, as a result of requests from some customers, SCVN underwent an audit as part of the Intertek Workplace Conditions Assessment (WCA) program. The WCA addresses the areas of Labor, Wages and Hours, Health and Safety, Management Systems, and Environment with respect to widely-held industry standards and best practices. ScanCom received the Intertek “Achievement Award”. SUPPLIER OF THE YEAR In 2014 ScanCom International was nominated “Supplier of the Year” by one of our biggest customers, Bettenwelt. The reasons cited for the nomination were: ScanCom’s ongoing significant improvements in terms of CSR and our commitment to the use of FSC certified wood. HUMAN RIGHTS ScanCom International is committed to influence our employees and business partners to respect the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For several years ScanCom has had its own, annually updated Code of Conduct for employees and business partners. It can be seen in full on our website: http://www.scancom.net BSCI monitoring of contract manufacturers SCVN uses the BSCI monitoring system to ensure that its contract manufacturers, as a minimum, comply with basic human rights and local regulations pertaining to labor conditions. For season 14/15 ScanCom used a total of 21 contract manufacturers, all of which were registered on the BSCI platform. An updated version of the SCI Code of Conduct was introduced in March 2014. It is more focused and stricter in terms of actual operations and compliance with relevant local laws ScanCom increased collaboration with the individual contract manufacturers in order to ensure implementation and upgrade to meet the new BSCI requirements. As usual, ScanCom supported our supply chain to follow up on non-conformance found by 3rd parties or customers in order to, as a minimum, meet the new rating C (Acceptable). The new ratings in the BSCI system are A, B, C, D, E: A and B correspond to the previous rating “Good”. C corresponds to the previous rating “Improvement Needed”. D is equivalent to the previous rating of “Non-Compliant”. E is “Zero Tolerance” where business must stop immediately. 9 ScanCom International A/S CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS SS 12/13 SS 13/14 SS 14/15 Production site registered on BSCI audit platform 25 25 21 Total number of BSCI audits, initial and re-audit 18 17 4 Total number of ScanCom Code of Conduct audits 25 25 21 BSCI COMPLIANCE RATING SS 12/13 SS 13/14 SS 14/15 Good 19/25 19/25 12/21 Improvement needed 6/25 5/25 4/21 Non-compliant 0/25 1/25 0/21 B (Good) 1/21 C (Acceptable) 3/21 D (Non-Compliant) 1/21 Supplier audits ScanCom is continually developing higher CSR levels at our suppliers. By June 2015 all suppliers had signed ScanCom’s Code of Conduct. 100% of new suppliers, where relevant, were subject of an onsite CSR audit conducted by ScanCom and approximately 30% of existing suppliers were re-audited. In general the top level management of suppliers is integral to developments in this area, as the awareness and commitment of suppliers is improved due to the allocation of resources and time in order to make improvements. Child labor and forced labor During the past season, as with those previous, ScanCom maintained regular audits of contract manufacturers together with customer audits and BSCI audits, and again for this season we can report that no cases of child labor or forced labor were recorded. LABOR ScanCom is committed to the support and protection of labor rights including: abolition of child labor, elimination of forced labor, freedom of association, and eradication of any kind of discrimination.

SCVN’s activities are situated in an area with a traditionally very high labor turnover in the furniture industry. ScanCom was affected by this for several years and actively addressed the problem by creating incentives for employees to stay. These have taken the form of an improvement in working conditions and the provision of a range of benefits: supporting the children of employees, providing a transportation allowance, and assistance with house rental. The focus on making it attractive to stay in ScanCom was continued over season 14/15 and seems to have had a positive impact. The employee turnover rate for SCVN was reduced from 75 % in season 13/14 to 57 % in season 14/15, and although this figure may still be considered high, it meets the objective set for this parameter. The employee turnover rate for SCIN decreased from 24% in season 13/14 to 14% in season 14/15. The reduction is a result of less seasonal workers resigning and not completing their contract – probably due to the improved recruitment process that was implemented. SCBR is still experiencing a negative situation in terms of labor turnover after the opening of the new unit in Minas do Leão/RS. The situation is not yet stabilized, but the labor turnover was falling month by month. Of the total SCBR labor turnover for the season 14/15, 80% came from the new unit. ScanCom is working together with the local authorities in the area to educate workers coming from agricultural jobs about what is required in an industrial workplace. 12 ScanCom International A/S Headcount Turnover by Category Age Site Employee category Total Average Turnover 18-25 26-35 36-45 46-55 56-60 leaving headcount % Male Official worker 359 402 77 6 0 844 1,920 44% Seasonal worker 409 256 33 2 0 700 265 264% Staff 5 14 4 1 0 24 83 29% Management 0 25 12 3 0 40 213 19% Total Male 773 697 126 12 0 1,608 2,481 65% SCVN Female Official worker 66 93 19 4 0 182 647 28% Seasonal worker 57 36 11 2 0 106 35 304% Staff 3 17 3 0 0 23 113 20% Management 0 3 1 0 0 4 78 5% Total Female 126 149 34 6 0 315 873 36% Grand Total SCVN 899 846 160 18 1,923 3,354 57% Male Official worker 0 0 0 0 0 0 66 0% Seasonal worker 26 5 0 0 0 31 168 18% Staff 0 1 0 0 0 1 12 8% Management 0 0 0 1 0 1 21 -5% Total male 26 6 0 1 0 33 267 12% SCIN Female Official worker 0 0 0 1 0 1 12 -8% Seasonal worker 8 2 0 0 0 10 30 33% Staff 0 1 0 0 0 1 12 -8% Management 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0% Total Female 8 3 0 1 0 12 60 20% Grand Total SCIN 34 9 0 2 0 45 327 14% Male Official worker Seasonal worker 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0% Staff 25 20 8 5 0 58 82 71% Management 0 0 0 0 1 1 5 20% Total male 25 20 8 5 1 59 87 68% SCBR Female Official worker Seasonal worker 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0% Staff 4 6 2 0 1 13 38 34% Management 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0% Total Female 4 6 2 0 1 13 38 34% Grand Total SCBR 29 26 10 5 2 72 125 58% 13 ScanCom International A/S Overtime Overtime rates have now stabilized for all companies in the group and are all in compliance with local regulation. For SCBR the new unit opening had a particular impact. Wages and benefits In Vietnam the legal minimum wage is frequently adjusted – last time by15 % in January 2015 – but SCVN has always compensated employees at a significantly higher level, applying principles for actual living costs rather than the minimum wage. In season 14/15 SCVN continued this principle and the lowest wage level for SCVN workers was around 26 % higher than the legal minimum. Furthermore, SCVN continued the policy of an extra 2.5 % health and social and unemployment insurance for workers compared to the legal requirement plus extra support for employees with children. SCIN pays contract workers at a rate that is just a few percent above the minimum level in the regulation for this group of employees. However, all permanent employees are paid at a minimum of10% higher level than regulation, depending on position and responsibility. SCBR pays wages based on an agreement with the Union and the wage pattern of the local area. SCBR has attractive benefit policies which are successful in the long-term retention of workers. For the latter period 2014/2015, SCBR salaries are minimum of 28% above the national regulation, which is positive for labor retention. Discrimination ScanCom continuously enforces its policy of not accepting any kind of employment discrimination of the workforce due to gender, age, or origin. 14 ScanCom International A/S Age distribution of employees (Numbers are per end of season) Age Site Season Group Grand Total 18-25 26-35 36-45 46-55 56-65 Management 0 187 103 17 0 307 (HEADCOUNT 2013-2014 Staff 20 150 23 6 2 201 IN JUNE 2014) Worker 780 1,589 568 123 3 3,063 Total Headcount 800 1,926 694 146 5 3,571 SCVN 2014-2015 Management 4 189 97 15 0 305 Staff 41 146 24 6 2 219 (HEADCOUNT Worker 695 1,359 492 110 3 2,659 IN JUNE 2015) Total Headcount 740 1,694 613 131 5 3,183 2013-2014 Management 0 4 22 2 0 28 Staff 0 18 4 1 0 23 (HEADCOUNT Worker 42 76 47 10 0 175 IN JUNE 2014) Total Headcount 42 98 73 13 0 226 SCIN Management 2014-2015 0 3 22 2 0 27 Staff 0 16 7 1 0 24 (HEADCOUNT Worker 57 84 58 11 0 209 IN JUNE 2015) Total Headcount 57 103 87 14 0 261 Management 2013-2014 0 1 2 1 1 5 Staff (HEADCOUNT 7 7 7 1 2 24 Worker 9 16 5 4 0 34 IN JUNE 2014) SCBR Total Headcount 16 23 14 6 3 63 Management 2014-2015 0 1 1 1 2 5 Staff 10 13 4 1 1 29 (HEADCOUNT Worker 32 32 15 17 2 98 IN JUNE 2015) Total Headcount 42 46 20 19 5 132 The low median age of ScanCom’s employees reflects the age distribution in the population of the countries where manufacturing occurs. Furthermore the official retirement ages are relatively low with 55/60, 55/55, 60/65 years for women/men in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brazil respectively. 15 ScanCom International A/S Salary comparison for female and male employees (USD/month).

Differences in the above figures are related to different kinds of jobs. For Brazil the comparison between seasons is heavily impacted by changes in the currency exchange rate, as the Brazilian Real lost 38% against the USD over the season. HEALTH AND SAFETY OHSAS 18001 In the early part of season 14/15 SCVN received the OHSAS 18001 certificate for the occupational health and safety management system, and at the end of the season the first surveillance audit was passed with good results. Related to the OHSAS 18001 SCVN has now fully implemented safeguards on all machines. Another significant area of progress is an improvement in temperature levels at hot workplace areas in SCVN.

Although the objective of a 30% decrease was not met, it was a significant improvement that is probably related to the increased amount of safety training and a general improvement in workplace safety in the preceding years. SCIN increased its focus on a reduction in the amount of sick leave and a considerable improvement of a 16 ScanCom International A/S 19% drop was recorded. In the unit of Telemaco Borba, SCBR did not have any work accidents in the period. For this site there have been 493 days without accidents. In Lion Mines unit, the procedures are in the implementation phase, and improvements are being seen on a daily basis. Increases in sick leave and accidents (none of them serious) are all related to the new unit, but we expect significant improvements over the present period due to the initiation of improvement activities. ENVIRONMENT SCVN’s environment management system according to ISO 14001 was maintained and improved over the period. Materials used, recycling, and waste Data Over the preceding years ScanCom has worked towards an improvement in the collection of reliable data and this has now reached a satisfactory level. However, the changed and improved procedures for data collection have led to difficulties in comparisons with previously reported data in several cases. Resources SCVN SCIN SCBR Resources and recycling SS 13/14 SS 14/15 SS 13/14 SS 14/15 SS 13/14 SS 14/15 Total electrical energy, MWh 19,300 22,681 361 215 3,200 3,840 Water consumption, 1000 m³ 138 149 7.9 6.9 4.20 9.95 Industrial waste, MT 5,985 3,995 0 1.5 20,700 22,300 Waste water, 1000 m³ 121 125 7.9 6.9 0.11 0.22 Sawn timber, 1000 m³ 30.1 24.9 4.42 5.15 75.5 96.5 Aluminum billets, MT 3,280 4,059 0 N/A N/A N/A Plastic resin, MT 2,330 3,040 N/A N/A N/A N/A Recycled saw dust, MT 660 582 0 1.5 7,200 13,440 Recycled aluminum waste, MT 115 273 N/A N/A N/A N/A Recycled Poly Rattan waste, MT 30 83 0 2.4 N/A N/A In general, the reported data now reflect development in our business with increased volumes and opening of new business areas, but specific changes are commented on below. SCVN The decrease in industrial waste is mainly a consequence of replacing the external sourcing of wood pellets for boilers for wood drying with ScanCom’s own wood waste. This leaves less wood waste for external sale. The decrease in volume for sawn timber is due to a 60% increase in efficiency in using the wood and also reflects a decrease in the volume of wood furniture produced. Furthermore, for seasons 13/14 and 14/15 a significant amount of wood used for production – especially for 13/14 came from internal stocks of already dried wood. Therefore, there is no direct correlation to the amounts of wood provided above for the kiln drying of wood. 17 ScanCom International A/S Increases in the use of aluminum and plastic resins are due to increased activity levels – a new plastic injection factory was established in season 14/15. The decrease in the amount of aluminum waste is due to market prices for the waste. If the price offered for the waste by our aluminum supplier is low, the waste is instead sold in the local market and is then not used in future products. However, regardless of the buyer, the waste is recycled. Recycling of polyethylene waste from the Poly Rattan production was significantly increased – we now recycle all waste. SCIN increased focus on electricity consumption during the report period and succeeded in reducing the amount by 40% compared to the previous season – a positive result based on many focused initiatives. Waste volumes (Metric Tons) Waste type SCVN SCIN SCBR Disposal (MT) SS 13/14 SS 14/15 SS 13/14 SS 14/15 SS 13/14 SS 14/15 method Authorized Domestic waste 120 124 11 17 3.4 8.7 contractor 476 458 0 0 0.4 1.4 Authorized Hazardous waste contractor Sold to Recyclable waste 5,383 3,414 2.7 8.5 20,700 22,300 contractors SCVN: Recycled waste sold to contractors is reduced since there is more internal reuse for boilers for wood drying. Domestic and hazardous waste handling is now fully under control and are at the same level as last season. CO2 emissions Since 2012 ScanCom has continuously monitored CO2 generating consumptions with the aim of a stepwise reduction in CO2 emissions. CO2 emissions data Quantity CO2 emission Quantity CO2 emission Site Source SS 13/14 (MT) SS 13/14 SS 14/15 (MT) SS 14/15 Gas 587 MT 1,578 575 MT 1,546 Diesel Oil 154 MT 490 135 MT 430 SCVN Wood 3,828 MT 6,699 4,301 MT 7,527 Electricity 19.3 GWh 6,774 22.6 GWh 7,932 Total CO2, SCVN 15,541 17,435 Electricity 0.361 GWh 292 0.215GWh 174 SCIN Total CO2, SCIN 292 174 Wood 7,200 MT 12,600 13,440 MT 23,520 Electricity 3.20 GWh 314 3.84 GWh 376 SCBR Total CO2, SCBR 12,914 23,896 TOTAL CO2 28,747 41,505 For electricity local conversion factors according to “IEA Energy Statistics 2014” are used. Conversion factors for Gas, Diesel oil, and Wood are from “Greenhouse Gas Protocol”. 18 ScanCom International A/S The total amount of CO2 emissions increased over the period due to the opening of a new business area, which has a greater need for the burning of wood waste in order to dry wood. Added to this was the depletion of SCVN’s existing stock of dried wood, which was exhausted over the period, leading to an increased need for wood drying. If these areas are discounted, the total level of CO2 emissions was reduced although production volume increased. Around 75% of ScanCom’s total CO2 emissions derives from the burning of wood from FSC certified plantations, where all harvested trees are replaced by re-planting. Impact of products on health and environment and use of restricted substances In season 14/15 ScanCom continued to keep its own List of Restricted Substances up to date to always meet relevant legal and customers’ requirements. We experienced a continued increase in customer focus on restricted substances, and our system was in all cases able to provide the requested information for materials used in our products. Legality of wood The European Union Timber Regulation is now increasingly being enforced, and ScanCom experienced this in season 14/15 in terms of customers requesting more documentation about the whole supply chain. Although ScanCom’s Due Diligence System (DDS) was in all cases able to provide the requested documentation for our customers, we experienced a need to try to simplify the documentation process. Besides the FSC certification ScanCom therefore now has our DDS certified with annual renewal by an independent 3rd party approved by the EU as a control organization. The certificate covers all wood used by ScanCom. ANTI-CORRUPTION ScanCom maintains its own Code of Conduct with annual updates. The Code of Conduct is communicated to all employees and all new employees receive training in the content. Furthermore, the Code of Conduct is communicated to all subcontractors, contract manufacturers, and suppliers – and they are requested to sign the code. All subcontractors’ employees working on ScanCom’s premises in season 14/15 have received the training in ScanCom’s Code of Conduct and were monitored on workplace safety. TRAINING ACTIVITIES In season 13/14 ScanCom again continued systematic training of employees to support the understanding and practice of social compliance and good environmental behavior. 19 ScanCom International A/S SCVN Training programs Season 13/14 Season 14/15 No. Course Time of training Time of training (hours) (hours) 1 Management skills 4,608 1,208 2 English communication 2,400 3,960 3 Vietnamese communication for Expats 216 288 4 Labor Safety and Hygiene for Employees 54,492 56,202 5 Awareness training for ISO 14001:2004 768 6 Handling of chemicals and waste 8,700 5,900 7 Code of Conduct for onsite subcontractors 117 117 8 Code of Conduct for ScanCom employees 2,900 2,950 9 Security procedure for employees 2,900 2,950 10 Stamping safety 160 60 11 Electricity, Pressure Equipment, and Forklift Safety 1,112 1,408 12 Firefighting and prevention training 912 1,000 13 Firefighting and prevention drills 3,500 7,000 14 General Safety for new workers 50,752 28,496 15 Safety of machinery, PPE, Environment for new workers 25,376 14,248 Total 141,869 125,746 The above changes in training activities for SCVN reflect changes caused by identified needs as well as “training courses being completed”, fewer new employees, and new focus areas from management but altogether a high training level was maintained.
