In June 2014 we were also awarded the Business Green Leaders Law Firm of the Year Award for the firm’s relationship with pro bono client PURE Leapfrog in developing the community energy sector in the UK.

In the past year, we have also seconded two trainees to pro bono clients: to South West London Law Centres (SWLLC) to assist with housing litigation and to the British Red Cross to assist with internal legal advice. “The core focus of the firm’s pro bono programme in the past year has been Access to Justice, particularly in light of the legal aid and local authority funding cuts in the UK. It’s exciting to see our lawyers develop a secondary skill set (advising on welfare law) so they can actually do something meaningful to help; and a social welfare lawyer has now joined the firm to build upon our ability to offer these services moving forward. We’ve also concentrated on ways to partner with our clients on pro bono initiatives. We are delighted to have partnered with Citi on TrustLaw projects in China, Germany, the UAE, Kenya and London. We also partnered with Mitsubishi Securities to deliver the Lawyers in Schools programme in London, and have undertaken partnering projects with other major clients. We will continue to respond to our clients’ appetite to participate in pro bono partnering projects, both in the UK and internationally.” Richard Dyton, Pro bono Partner Photo: A Kenyan villager using an efficient cookstove (see page 24) Page 4 Page 5 Our communities We believe that we have a responsibility to share our time, experience, skills and ideas to engage positively with and support individuals and organisations in the local communities in which we operate and do business. The Young Talent Programme Our ambitious secondary school programme with Frederick Bremer School in Walthamstow, London continues to develop and to show increased success. Working with the Twist Partnership, the programme is designed to raise students’ aspirations through a series of ongoing, longerterm initiatives that provide access to the legal profession and wider work opportunities. Each year a group of twelve Year 10 students is selected, with input from both the school and the firm, to be part of the programme. The firm is committed to supporting each cohort of students for a seven year period during which they return to the firm every year to participate in a range of activities including work experience; skills sessions; project work; presentations; paid internships; and group mentoring. As at 30 April 2015, a total of 50 young people have been selected for the Young Talent Programme and have successfully completed one week of work experience at the firm, and 24 students have also completed a week’s paid summer internship. Two Year 13 students will receive the Simmons & Simmons bursary in September 2015 to assist them through university. We are proud supporters of the Social Mobility Business Compact and PRIME: this programme continues to complement and exceed our commitments under these initiatives while delivering many benefits both to the young people involved and the members of the firm who support our work in this area. I have found being involved in the Young Talent Programme inspirational. Seeing the students gain confidence and new skills whilst they are here at the firm is brilliant and equally, we benefit from the challenging and insightful questions they ask of the people they interact with. I am excited to see how the programme develops in the future.

The firm continues to be the Associate Sponsor for the Donmar Warehouse. Magna Carta in the 21st century In February 2015, the firm was a sponsor of the Global Law Summit in London, which marked 800 years of Magna Carta and the Rule of Law. Under the banner of “Magna Carta principles and modern world solutions”, our Senior Partner, Colin Passmore led a panel session on “Privacy: What we give away and how our private details are used – and abused”. Examining this topic and the aspects of privacy protected by law, by social convention and as a fundamental human right, Colin was joined by Josie Rourke, the Artistic Director of the Donmar Warehouse (the London theatre of which Simmons & Simmons is Associate Sponsor) and director of the 2014 play, PRIVACY, and Sir Michael Tugendhat, the former High Court Judge who before his retirement was the UK’s senior media judge. In a wide-ranging session that brought three different perspectives to the idea of privacy – considering what it means today within the law and among ourselves as private citizens – each panellist considered the role technology has played in the changing nature of privacy, touching on smartphones, superinjunctions, access to justice, the role of the judiciary, the role of the state, the nature of surveillance and the erosion of legal professional privilege. The session was well attended and well received by the international delegates at the Summit and highlighted a number of the themes that sit at the heart of our CR strategy and within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

We also support the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty against Children (NSPCC) on IP and employmentrelated matters: in particular our IP team conducted a due diligence review, the results of which were used to advise the NSPCC’s Executive Board on potential IP risks and issues involved in potential changes to the NSPCC’s existing services.

This year we purchased VCS certified carbon credits through PURE Leapfrog, to offset 12,559 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent produced by our global network of offices. This represents a 23% increase on last year’s absolute figures, or an 11% increase per employee. This is a source of concern, although it reflects the firm’s growth as it is driven in the main by increased air travel to meet our commitments in Africa and Asia, in particular, and more generally across the business. Simmons & Simmons understands that Carbon Neutrality is just one means by which we can balance our commitments – both to the environment and to growing a successful business. As our need to travel increases, we will need to be innovative and creative in our attempts to ensure we minimise the environmental impacts it causes. 2013/14 12,559 2007/08 2012/13 15,004 10,216 Annual global carbon offsets 2011/12 purchased 2008/09 (tonnes of CO2e) 11,698 13,477 2010/11 11,248 2009/10 13,028 The “+” in Carbon Neutral + As part of an innovative arrangement with PURE Leapfrog, we supported the Wey Valley Solar Schools cooperative this year on a project that installed 29kW of solar panels on the roof of Christ Church School. Over 20 years, it is anticipated that the solar panel array will generate around 589MW of electricity. This equates to around 262 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions saved per annum.

Thought leadership Our lawyers contributed to a publication titled ‘From restriction to protection: Report on ensuring a safe and enabling legal environment for human rights defenders’ issued by the International Service for Human Rights (ISHR). Since its publication in November 2014, the ISHR has advised that outcomes include a civil society initiative to enact a law on human rights defenders in India; and the development of human rights defender legislation in Honduras, with a draft law currently before Congress. In December 2014, as part of the Law Society’s Human Rights Week, the firm made a public presentation entitled ‘Turf War Protecting Community Land Rights’ attended by a range of academics, barristers, NGOs and clients. The presentation focused on the practicalities of advising Photo: Regional visit to Tranquilandia, a peasant farmer community on community land rights, and included discussion in northern Colombia. on challenges such as identifying the beneficiaries of community land rights and settling disputes with multiple Community land rights stakeholder groups.

A team of Simmons & Simmons lawyers advised The Nature Conservancy (TNC) throughout 2014 in respect of land rights issues in the Solomon Islands and specifically the rights of an indigenous community faced by large scale mining operations. We have advised TNC not only on the protections available to the local population under international law but also on potential strategies for engaging with the mining companies and other key stakeholders. Page 28 Microfinance, social impact investment and anti-corruption in developing markets With the firm’s focus on assisting the communities in which we operate, we have ensured that we support microfinance and social impact investment charities in those developing community markets where we choose to work and also seek to support transparency in those markets. Asia The Singapore office assisted pro bono client, VinaCapital Foundation, and its social impact investing fund, Lotus Impact, on the drafting of a loan agreement for a water supplier and the structuring of a microloan mechanism for social impact investment in Cambodia. It also undertook a pro bono project for Untld Indonesia, an organisation supporting early stage social entrepreneurs and social enterprises in Indonesia by helping them with a soft loan programme for social enterprises, and reviewing its agreement with a Korean foundation providing capital for the programmes. Africa Our Paris office has a particular focus on Francophone Africa, for which it also carries out a large amount of commercial work. The Paris office is assisting French NGO, Entrepreneurs du Monde, on setting up a local company in Burkina Faso. The company, which will function as a “social business”, will operate the Nafa Naana project which sells energy efficient cooking and heating equipment to local populations. The Paris office is also advising Revenue Watch on implementation regulations of the Guinean mining code. Global Alliance for Legal Aid (GALA) GALA supports the provision of legal aid for public interest litigation, consumer rights and environmental protection in developing countries. We are working with them on a project relating to a fraudulent scheme in Uganda in which many thousands of poor Ugandans invested, using their savings or loans from microfinance institutions, banks or moneylenders. When the scheme collapsed, it left thousands of victims caught in a vicious cycle of debt and families in disastrous financial positions with terrible results. We travelled to Uganda with GALA in November 2013 and met some of the victims so as to better understand the distress in which these individuals find themselves and with a view to appealing to the microfinance community to help with compensation to those victims as previous attempts by these victims to receive compensation through the courts has been unsuccessful.
