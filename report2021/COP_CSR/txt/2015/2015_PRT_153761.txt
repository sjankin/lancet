Via Mais Verde provides unparalleled comfort to Via Verde users, because it no longer requires lowering of speed when passing by. In 2014 there were no new installations, with normal maintenance continuing on the equipment powered by alternative energies, in this case through the use of solar energy. The main advantages of the Via Mais Verde are: Estimate of energy saved in 2014 (the same as the previous year): 346 GJ • Greater comfort; 4. NWPY Project • There is no need to reduce speed; The Solar Project of the NWPY concession is based on a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Soltura Energy Capital. • Improved road safety; This agreement was established for a period of 20 years and covers the installation, operation and maintenance of solar panels, in 7 sites, with an installed capacity of 62 kW in total. The system has been 100% operational since June 2011. • Reduction of CO2 emissions (by preventing vehicles from stopping and then speeding, there is a 41.8% reduction in CO2 In 2014, it produced a quantity of energy of 98,971 kWh, or rather: 356 GJ emissions).

Procedures Operating Stage The amount of water reused in laboratory tests is recorded in this indicator. With regard to the motorway Operating Stage, the whole network of motorways under concession to Brisa and to Brisal is covered by an animal-vehicle collision monitoring system and all the motorways built or which undergo road widening works after Decree Law no. 69/2000, of 3 May, came into force are covered by General Environmental Monitoring Plans (GEMP) with the fundamental objective of performing a post-assessment of impacts.

These campaigns involve the monitoring: of the quality of eco-systems, of culvert and viaduct recovery projects (namely those considered as recovery sites and possible ecological corridors), of the efficacy of the culverts as passageways for In relation to this Indicator we should also point out the existence of a rented area for the implementation of measures fauna and their use by groups of fauna as a habitat of refuge, and of the evolution of plant communities on the banks of the to compensate impacts, under Brisa’s Protocol with the ICNB (Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Institute) relating water lines crossed by the infrastructure. to the Herdade do Pardieiro. The area involved covers 10,000 m2 in the Castro Verde Special Protection Area with the objective of preserving the habitat of the Lesser Kestrel. For the monitoring of the quality of ecosystems, the monitoring of the quality of surface and underground waters has to be taken into consideration. The monitoring performed on the A2 allowed us to see that there were no significant impacts consistently attributable to the motorway in question. In relation to the quality of surface waters in 2014, no significant impacts originating from the A2 were verified. The pollutants which are directly related with the circulation of motor traffic on the A2 – Copper, Cadmium, Zinc and Hydrocarbons 92 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | BRISA 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | BRISA 2014 93 – are always in very low concentrations that are lower than the legal limits.

This area relates to embankments at the Soure Junction of the A1 North Motorway. During the campaigns held in 2014, the crossings of the culverts and animal passageways were counted by the presence of footprints belonging to the same species (assuming that they belong to the same individual animals) at both entries. Regarding the active restoration and protection measures in the operating stage and in connection with the implementation of the compensation measures associated to the Aljustrel / Castro Verde sub-stretch on the A2, a protocol was signed with the ICNF (the Nature and Forestry Conservation Institute, which when the protocol was signed was called 94 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | BRISA 2014 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | BRISA 2014 95 the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Institute ICNB) with the objective of guaranteeing the implementation of EN15 management measures of the Lesser Kestrel colony (Falco naumanni).

This measure resulted in an intervention area of around 60,000 m2 (6 hectares) during 2014.

These actions lead to projects which are part of the Business & Biodiversity Protocol. The calculation of the emissions generated by fuel consumption take into account the emission factors presented in 2006 by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Based on these factors it is possible to calculate the Within the framework of projects under the Business & Biodiversity Protocol described in previous years, the project “Bioemissions relating to the gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). diversity of the International Tagus” continues to be active until the end of 2017.

On the other hand, employees who have worked the longest at the company may have had more progression opportunities.
