ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014/15 1 MESSAGE OF THE CHAIRMAN PATRICK KRON – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer How would you describe Alstom results in fiscal year 2014/15? It should be noted that these results are presented differently from previous years. Indeed, international accounting standards require that the discontinued energy operations – those corresponding to Thermal Power, Renewable Power and Grid – are separated from continued operations – those of Transport. Alstom delivered a very strong commercial performance in its Transport activity in 2014/15, booking a record level of orders over €10 billion, resulting in a more than €28 billion backlog corresponding to four and a half years of sales. We have set a solid base for growth in emerging markets with contracts in South Africa, Qatar, Australia or Mexico and we have strengthened our positions in our traditional markets. We achieved our 2014/15 targets with sales up 7% on a like-for-like basis while the operating margin improved from 4.7% to 5.2%, benefiting from good project execution and the strict implementation of our performance plan. Following a very negative trend of the free cash flow during the first half, the situation improved in the second half, even if it remains negative for the full fiscal year. Globally, we have achieved the targets we set for this fiscal year. Following these good results in Transport activity, what does the future of Alstom look like? These results underline the strengths of Alstom focused on its Transport activities. Alstom is a world leader. It enjoys a growing market, led by urbanisation and environmental priorities. It benefits from global footprint and it is able to carry out major infrastructure projects, as illustrated by the €4 billion contract signed in South Africa. 2 ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014/15 ﻿ Message of the chairman Alstom achieved its Alstom will be reinforced with the acquisition of General Electric signalling and will benefit from financial strength targets and as a result of the transaction with General Electric, since two thirds of the proceeds will be used to consolidate the project with General Alstom’s balance sheet and make it debt-free. This is why we can confirm with these annual results our Electric medium term guidance: an organic sales growth over 5% per year, a gradual improvement of the operating margin in the 5-7% range and a free cash flow in line with net income. The strategy remains unchanged: is moving yy seize growth opportunities thanks to our innovation and investment policy; ahead yy continue efforts to improve our performance and to reduce our costs in a very competitive market. What is the status of the project with General Electric? Can you give an update on the next steps towards the closing? The project with General Electric is progressing. Key milestones were reached at the end of 2014. Consultation process with work councils was completed, the master agreement and all the related documentation were signed between Alstom and General Electric, the French Foreign Investment authorisation was obtained and, on 19 December 2014, the shareholders approved the transaction by a majority of 99.2%. Competition and regulatory authorisations processes are underway. General Electric and Alstom are actively working to complete the process and achieve a closing in the coming months. After completion of the transaction, we plan to call a Shareholders’ Meeting to vote on the amount of cash proceeds to be distributed to shareholders.

After completion of this operation, the Group will focus on its rail transportation activities. In this context, Thermal Power, Renewable Power and Grid activities were classified as Discontinued Operations. ALSTOM TRANSPORT Alstom Transport is one of the global leaders in rail transport equipment, systems, services and signalling for urban, suburban, regional and main line passenger transportation, as well as for freight transportation. It benefits from a growing market with solid fundamentals, driven by economic growth, growing urbanisation, environmental concerns and public spending. In this context, Transport has been able to develop both a local and global presence that distinguishes it from many of its competitors, while providing it with a real sense of proximity to its clients and greater industrial flexibility. Its products, which constitute one of the most complete and integrated product offerings on the market today, together with its position as a technological leader, place Alstom in a unique position through which it is able to benefit from the worldwide growth of the rail transport market. Lastly, in order to generate profitable growth, Transport focuses on operational excellence and continuous efforts toward improvement.

In Europe, mainline passenger climate change, recycling, recovery, energy efficiency and noise traffic has increased by +1.2% per year between 2007 and 2013 (source: constitute some of the most significant environmental and sustainable Eurostat). Indeed, while the European growth remains behind emerging development concerns currently voiced by populations and politicians. regions’ growth, the tradition of public transport is strong and pushes Based on these criteria, rail transportation offers higher performance operators to renew or renovate their fleets, contributing to the overall levels than other transportation modes, which should have a positive regular growth of the sector. In the future, world passenger traffic should impact on the evolution of the rail transportation market. However, grow by 4.8% per year until 2020 (source: SCI Verkehr). some challenges will have to be faced in these various sectors in order to meet ambitious emission reduction goals within set time frames. In addition, if concerns regarding these matters are significant in mature Public funding and investment plan markets, they are gradually gaining more clout in emerging countries. Despite short-term budgetary constraints, the railway industry remains strategic, with investment plans throughout the world: The White Paper of the European Union advocate for a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. yy Indian Railways has recently announced its plan to invest €120 billion Transportation, which represents approximately 25% of these emissions, over the next five years (2015-2019), with the objective to increase must contribute to this reduction. Among the set goals for transportation daily passenger carrying capacity from 21 million to 30 million, to by 2050, the following should be noted: increase track length by 20%, and to grow annual freight carrying capacity from 1 billion to 1.5 billion tonnes (source: Indian Railways). yy 60% reduction in emissions as compared with 1990 levels; yy By 2020, China will expand its urban rail transportation network yy 30% of road freight (for distances higher than 300 kilometres) must by 6,000 kilometres, with a total investment of approximately become rail freight and/or maritime freight by 2025; €400 billion (source: Global Times). yy over 50% of intercity passenger transportation via rail by 2050; yy By 2025, Brazil intends to invest over €60 billion to expand yy no more standard internal combustion engine cars by 2050. its rail transportation network by 10,000 kilometres (source: On a global scale, the 2012 Rio Conference planned that, over the course Railway Technology). of 10 years, $175 billion would be allocated towards the development yy In Europe, the “Connecting Europe Facility” initiative allocates of urban public transportation.

The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated financial statements. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended 31 March 2015 on: yy the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Alstom; yy the justification of our assessments; yy the specific verification required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. I Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 March 2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Without qualifying our conclusion, we draw your attention to the following matters: yy Note 1.1 “Alstom strategic move”, Note 3 “Comparability”, Note 4 “Assets held for sale and discontinued operations” and Note 27.5 “Liquidity risk management” which set out the accounting treatment and impacts of the Group’s Energy activities planned transaction with General Electric. yy Note 1.2 “Agreement between Alstom and the US Department of Justice” and Note 30.2 “Disputes – Alleged illegal payments”, which set out the consequences of the agreement concluded with the US Department of Justice. II Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: 1. Energy Activities – planned transaction with General Electric Note 2.3.4 to the consolidated financial statements sets out the criteria for classification and accounting treatment of assets held for sale and discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5. We have verified that this accounting policy has been adequately applied and ensured that Note 1.1 “Alstom strategic move”, Note 3 “Comparability” and Note 4 “Assets held for sale and discontinued operations” to the consolidated financial statements give the appropriate information. In addition, Note 27.5 “Liquidity risk management” to the consolidated financial statements sets out the main consequences of the planned transaction, considered highly probable as at March 31, 2015 and of the future anticipated key dates. We have examined the documentation relating to the Group’s liquidity situation, notably cash flow forecasts for the next 12 months, based on the highly probable scenario and more remote ones. We have verified that Note 27.5 to the consolidated financial statements gives the appropriate information. 146 ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014/15 Financial information Consolidated financial statements 2. Construction contracts As described in Notes 2.2, 2.3.6, 2.3.7, 2.3.18, 24 and 30.1 to the consolidated financial statements and related to the recognition of revenue and operating margin, Alstom makes estimates that may have a significant impact, notably when determining the margin at completion on each contract, determined on the basis of the latest information and contract status available. Those estimates are reflected on the balance sheet under “Construction contracts in progress, assets”, “Construction contracts in progress, liabilities” and for contracts completed in “Current provisions”. We have examined the processes applied by Alstom and considered the data and assumptions on which these estimates are based. 3. Goodwill and other long term assets – Continued operations Alstom performed an impairment test on goodwill at year-end and also assessed whether there was any indication of impairment of other long-term assets, in accordance with the approach described in Note 2.3.13 to the consolidated financial statements. We have assessed the impairment test performed and verified that Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements gives the appropriate information. 4. Disputes We have examined the procedures used by Alstom to identify, assess and account for disputes. We have ensured that the status of the disputes and the related uncertainties are adequately described in Note 30.2 to the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements, several matters mentioned in the paragraphs above are based on estimates and assumptions which are uncertain by nature, and for which the final outcome may significantly differ from the initial forward looking data used, in particular given the current economical and financial environment. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion 3 we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III Specific verification As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the financial statements. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended 31 March 2015, on: yy the audit of the accompanying financial statements of Alstom; yy the justification of our assessments; yy the specific verifications and information required by law. These financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. I Opinion on the financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 3 to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company at 31 March 2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to Note 3.2 “Agreement between Alstom and the US Department of Justice” and Note 12.2 “Provisions for fines” to the financial statements which set out the consequences of the agreement concluded with the US Department of Justice. II Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: 1. Energy activities Note 3.1 “The Energy Transaction” to the financial statements describes the planned transaction with General Electric and the related process, and note 14 “Bonds” to the financial statements sets out the main consequences of the planned transaction and of the future anticipated key dates. We have examined the documentation relating to the company’s liquidity situation, notably cash flow forecasts for the next 12 months, based on the highly probable scenario and more remote ones. We have verified that Note 14 to the financial statements gives the appropriate information. 2. Investments Investments are recorded as assets in your company’s balance sheet for a net book value of €8,316 million. Note 2.1 “Description of accounting policies Investments” to the financial statements describes the methods adopted for accounting for these investments as well as the methods used to calculate impairment losses. We have examined the methodology used and assessed the reasonableness of the estimates applied by Alstom to perform the impairment test, as described in Note 8 “Financial assets” to the financial statements. The data and assumptions underlying those estimates, are notably based on the conditions of the planned transaction with General Electric, as disclosed in Note 3.1.1 “Presentation of the General Electric offer” to the financial statements. 3. Disputes We have examined the procedures used by Alstom to identify, assess and account for disputes. We have ensured that the status of the disputes and the related uncertainties are adequately described in the Note 12 “Provisions for risks and charges” and Note “Provisions for risks and charges – Provisions for litigations and disputes” to the financial statements. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements, taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014/15 167 Financial information Statutory Accounts 3 III Specific verifications and information In accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also performed the specific verifications required by French law. We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors, and in the documents addressed to the shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code relating to remuneration and benefits received by corporate officers and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from companies controlling it or controlled by it.

In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Alstom, we hereby report to you on related-party agreements and commitments. It is our responsibility to report to shareholders, based on the information provided to us, on the main terms and conditions of agreements and commitments that have been disclosed to us or that we may have identified as part of our engagement, without commenting on their relevance or substance or identifying any undisclosed agreements or commitments. Under the provisions of Article R.225-31 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), it is the responsibility of the shareholders to determine whether the agreements and commitments are appropriate and should be approved. Where applicable, it is also our responsibility to provide shareholders with the information required by Article R.225-31 of the French Commercial Code in relation to the implementation during the year of agreements and commitments already approved by the Annual General Meeting. We performed the procedures that we deemed necessary in accordance with professional standards applicable in France to such engagements. These procedures consisted in verifying that the information given to us is consistent with the underlying documents. Agreements and commitments to be submitted for the approval of the Annual General Meeting 3 Agreements and commitments authorised after the year-end We were informed of the following agreement, approved after the year-end, which was authorised by the Board of Directors. Commitments falling within the scope of Article L.225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code with Patrick Kron, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom Director concerned: Patrick Kron, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom Nature and purpose: At its meeting of 5 May 2015, the Board of Directors authorised, subject to the condition precedent of the renewal of Patrick Kron’s term of office as Director by the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015, and of the reappointment of his term of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer by the meeting of the Board of Directors to be held after said Annual General Meeting, the renewal of the related-party commitments made to Patrick Kron in relation to benefits following the termination of his term of office, as approved by the Annual General Meeting of 26 June 2012. These commitments, which are identical to those in force prior to 5 May 2015, are as follows: Stock options and performance shares In the event of termination of his term of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, by either the Company or himself, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will only retain the rights to exercise stock options subject to performance conditions, and to the delivery of performance shares, granted before the end of his term of office, and that have vested in full as of the end of his term of office following the fulfilment of the conditions set forth by the plans. Stock options and performance shares that have not vested as of the end of his term of office may not be exercised or delivered. Supplemental retirement schemes The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is entitled to a supplemental retirement scheme based on a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan, which was set up in 2004. With regard to the defined benefit plan, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer benefits from the supplemental collective retirement scheme which covers all persons exercising functions within the Group in France whose base annual remuneration exceeds eight times the French social security ceiling. Under the scheme, entitlements are acquired gradually and represent, per year of seniority in the scheme, a limited percentage of the annual remuneration corresponding to 0.6% of the annual reference remuneration within a range of 8 to 12 times the social security ceiling and to 1.2% of the annual reference remuneration in excess of 12 times the social security ceiling. The annual reference remuneration is equal to the average fixed and variable remuneration received over the course of the past three years prior to retirement. This annual reference remuneration is capped at €2 million. Since 1 January 2008, this cap is subject to an annual revaluation in accordance with the evolution of the reference salary used to determine the AGIRC retirement scheme. As such, given his seniority within the Group and assuming a retirement age of 62, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer could, when he retires, claim a gross retirement pension under the defined benefit scheme equal to approximately 12% of the capped annual reference remuneration. ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014/15 169 Financial information Statutory Accounts 3 The defined contribution plan complements the defined benefit plan. The rights are acquired annually and correspond to 1% of the annual remuneration up to four times the social security ceiling, 4% of the annual remuneration within a range of 4 to 8 times the social security ceiling and 11% of the annual remuneration within a range of 8 to 12 times the social security ceiling. Since 1 July 2014, social contributions are borne by the Company up to 95%. Assuming a retirement age of 62, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer could claim upon retirement a gross retirement pension under the defined contribution scheme equal to approximately 1% of the capped annual reference remuneration, which corresponds to an aggregate gross supplemental retirement pension equal to approximately 13% of the capped annual gross remuneration by combining the pension resulting from the defined benefit scheme and the pension resulting from the defined contribution scheme.

These commitments, the renewal of which was approved by the Annual General Meeting of 26 June 2012, are as follows: Stock options and performance shares In the event of termination of his term of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, by either the Company or himself, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will only retain the rights to exercise stock options subject to performance conditions, and to the delivery of performance shares, granted before the end of his term of office, and that have vested in full as of the end of his term of office following the fulfilment of the conditions set forth by the plans. Stock options and performance shares that have not vested as of the end of his term of office may not be exercised or delivered. Supplemental retirement schemes The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is entitled to a supplemental retirement scheme based on a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan, which was set up in 2004. With regard to the defined benefit plan, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer benefits from the supplemental collective retirement scheme which covers all persons exercising functions within the Group in France whose base annual remuneration exceeds eight times the French social security ceiling. Under the scheme, entitlements are acquired gradually and represent, per year of seniority in the scheme, a limited percentage of the annual remuneration corresponding to 0.6% of the annual reference remuneration within a range of 8 to 12 times the social security ceiling and to 1.2% of the annual reference remuneration in excess of 12 times the social security ceiling. The annual reference remuneration is equal to the average fixed and variable remuneration received over the course of the past three years prior to retirement. This annual reference remuneration is capped at €2 million. Since 1 January 2008, this cap is subject to an annual revaluation in accordance with the evolution of the reference salary used to determine the AGIRC retirement scheme. ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014/15 171 Financial information Statutory Accounts 3 At 31 March 2015, the Company’s obligations under the defined benefit plan amounted to €10,491,000, including €2,031,000 of taxes applicable to supplemental retirement schemes, as increased on 1 January 2013 and on 1 January 2015. The defined contribution plan complements the defined benefit plan. The rights are acquired annually and correspond to 1% of the annual remuneration up to four times the social security ceiling, 4% of the annual remuneration within a range of 4 to 8 times the social security ceiling and 11% of the annual remuneration within a range of 8 to 12 times the social security ceiling. Since 1 July 2014, social contributions are borne by the Company up to 95%. The contributions paid under the defined contribution plan for the year ended 31 March 2015 amounted to €24,109, of which €23,204 was paid by Alstom.

Together with the sections “Management report on consolidated financial statements – fiscal year 2014/15” and “Description of Group activities”, it constitutes the Board of Directors’ report on the Group’s management for fiscal year 2014/15. Internal control and risk management procedures are described in section “Corporate governance – Chairman’s report” (the “Chairman’s report”), which presents in particular the annual risk assessment process (“Group risk mapping”) and the Internal Control Questionnaire (“self-assessment questionnaire”). As mentioned in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015, the Energy activities are reported as “discontinued operations” in Alstom’s consolidated financial statements and they are therefore not included in orders, sales, Income from Operations and are reported under the “Net profit from discontinued operations” line. In accordance with IFRS 5, the net income from the Energy activities (discontinued operations) has been presented on a separate line of the income statement of the comparative periods. The assets held for sale and the related liabilities are presented separately from other assets and liabilities on specific lines on the balance sheet. The net cash flows attributable to the operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operation realized over the fiscal year ended 31 March 2015 are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Regarding In addition, Alstom is increasingly using or combining complex the Transport activities, Alstom is required to address the evolution of technologies that evolve very quickly, or components developed by third customers’ demands for more and more complex tenders with increasing parties that integrate such technologies. This evolution requires the constraints and uncertainties in homologations. Alstom is also required implementation of a design and approval process that is more robust to introduce new, highly sophisticated and technologically complex in order to shorten the development phase, monitor technological products on increasingly short time scales. This necessarily limits the evolution, and comply with product safety requirements. This could time available for testing and increases the risk of product defects and trigger additional costs that are more significant than initially anticipated, their financial consequences. It is sometimes necessary to fine-tune or cause delays in delivery. or modify products during the production cycle or while the client is using them. Because Alstom manufactures some of its products in ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2014/15 177 Risk factors Operating risks 4 At the same time, when it sells its products or enters into maintenance In instances where such difficulties occur, Alstom cannot ensure that contracts, Alstom may be required to accept onerous contractual the total costs that it ultimately incurs will not exceed the amount that penalties, in particular related to performance, availability and delay it has provisioned.

COMPLEX HOMOLOGATION PROCEDURES APPLICABLE TO TRAINS Regarding the Transport activities, the marketing of the Alstom’s products include language that requires Alstom to bear the risks and obligations depends, most notably, on compliance with rail transportation security associated with the homologation process. The materialisation of these standards that differ widely at the global level and are governed by many risks could trigger cost overruns and the payment of significant penalties regulatory authorities. This creates a complex environment, especially in or damages, service interruptions affecting the products, or even the Europe, and disrupts the process of securing the homologation of trains. risk of cancellation of the contract in extreme cases of prolonged delays. However, the situation varies by country and technology. The process for securing the homologation of trains may last longer and be more costly than initially anticipated due to the extent of testing and No guarantee can be made regarding the time frame required for other supporting technical elements required by the authorities. In the obtaining homologations, and any significant problem in this domain past, Alstom has faced difficulties associated with complex homologation could have an adverse impact on the business activities, financial procedures, particularly in Germany.

Such events could have an adverse impact on the business activities, financial position, results or future outlook of Alstom, as well as on its reputation and that of its products. WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The structure and duration of Alstom’s projects may result in the countries, often through the implementation of partnerships, notably disbursement of significant sums before the contract begins to generate for the Transport activities, may also generate the risk that working any cash flow. As a result, Alstom’s ability to negotiate and collect capital needs related to these developments further increase, particularly customer advances and progress payments is therefore an important in the launch phase. Any unexpected discrepancy between the Group’s element of its working capital management.

MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES Employment market competition is fierce when it comes to hiring the will be successful in recruiting, integrating and retaining such employees highly qualified managers and specialists needed to complete the work as needed to accompany its business development, in particular in Alstom requires, particularly in certain emerging countries. The success of Alstom’s development plans depends, in part, on its ability to develop skills, to retain its employees, and to recruit and integrate additional emerging countries.

(3) According to the “New Policies Scenario” (IEA, WEO 2014), the share of fossil fuel based electricity generation is estimated at 55% for 2040. Coal would continue dominating this mix with a share of coal-based electricity generation estimated at 31%. (4) Air pollutants avoidance is estimated through quantifying and comparing the power plant emission rate to the emission rate without operating the equipment (estimated amount of air pollution removal) and to the emission rate of the corresponding electricity grid at the start of equipment commercial operation (estimated amount of air pollution reduction). (5) Four types of air pollutants are considered to be of notorious significance for air quality: Particulate Matter (PM), Sulphur Oxides (SOx), Nitrogen Oxides (NOX), and heavy metals represented by Mercury (Hg). At this stage, the quantification approach is focusing on NOX and SO2 emissions being, according to many studies, the most significant ones in terms of total damage costs.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. For the year ended 31 March 2015 To the Shareholders, In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Alstom, appointed as an independent third party and certified by COFRAC under Nr. 3-1060 (1), we hereby present to you our report on the consolidated environmental, human resources and social information for the year ended 31 March 2015, presented in the management report (hereinafter the “CSR Information”), in accordance with Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Company’s responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the Company’s management report including CSR Information referred to in the Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), in accordance with the “Environment, Health and Safety Reporting Manual” used by the Group’s sites as well as HR standard “Census Rules” and social survey definitions used by the Company, (hereafter the “Criteria”), available on request to the CSR direction of the Company. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) of our profession and the requirements of Article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with the ethical requirements, French professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Our work was carried out by a team of 11 persons between end of November 2014 and mid April 2015 and took around 17 weeks. We were assisted in our work by our specialists in corporate social responsibility. We performed our work in accordance with the French professional standards and with the order dated 13 May 2013 defining the conditions under which the independent third party performs its engagement and with ISAE 3000 (2) concerning our conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information. (1) whose scope is available at www.cofrac.fr.

Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information On the basis of interviews with the individuals in charge of the relevant departments, we reviewed the Company’s sustainable development strategy with respect to the labour and environmental impact of its activities and its social commitments and, where applicable, any initiatives or programmes it has implemented as a result. We compared CSR Information presented in the management report with the list provided for by Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. For any consolidated Information that was not disclosed, we verified that the explanations provided complied with the provisions of Article R. 225-105, Paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code. We verified that CSR Information covers the scope of consolidation, i.e., the Company, its subsidiaries as defined by Article L. 233-1 and the entities it controls as defined by Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the methodological information presented in the methodology section of Chapter 6 of the management report. Based on this work and given the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. 2. Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work We conducted more than one hundred interviews with the persons responsible for preparing CSR Information in the departments responsible for collecting the information and, where appropriate, responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to: yy assess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, and taking into account best practices where appropriate; yy verify the implementation of data-collection, compilation, processing and control process to reach completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of our tests and controls according to the nature and importance of the CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the human resources and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainability strategy and industry best practices. Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important (given in appendix): yy at parent entity level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, action), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with the other information in the management report; yy at the level of a representative sample of sites including the sub-units of Charleroi in Belgium, Canoas in Brazil, Ottawa in Canada, Satee, Wuhan and Beijing in China, Grenoble, Belfort, Reichshoffen, Ornans, La Défense, and Valenciennes in France, Kassel, Salzgitter, and Mannheim in Germany, Padappai, Naini, Hosur, Bangalore, Shahabad, and New Delhi in India, Sesto in Italy, Kuala Lumpur and Tanjung Bin in Malaysia, Wroclaw in Poland, Setubal in Portugal, Birr in Switzerland, Ashby, Manchester, Midlands and Preston in the United Kingdom, Charleroi, Windsor, Richmond and Hornell in the United States, selected by us on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied, and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents 20% of headcount and between 15% and 37% of quantitative environmental data. For the remaining CSR information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the Company. We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part taking into consideration, if any, industry best practices. We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgement, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of non-detecting a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated. Conclusion 6 Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.
