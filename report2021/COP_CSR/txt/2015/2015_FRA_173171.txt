This commitment was reaffirmed in the context of two additional agreements with social partners: the intergenerational agreement of 27 September, 2013, and the alternation and internship agreement of 25 February, 2014. In particular, these agreements provide to include at least 5,000 young apprentices each year within the Group in France, and an additional 1,000 in 2014, for the high-speed broadband plan. Within these agreements, the Group also commits to hosting at least 2,500 interns each year. The plan is to promote the integration of these young people in the fields vital to the Group, by recruiting at least 1,500 of the students via permanent contracts at the end of their training, over the three-year period of 2013 to 2015. With around 6,100 current apprentice contracts as of 31 December, 2014 (training and professionalisation contracts), i.e. 6.1% of the total staff (limit of the Group’s agreement in 12 Corporate Social Responsibility / 2014 review / Orange Trust France), the Group fully meets its objectives. In 2014, approximately 350 former apprentices were recruited on permanent contracts, and about 600 over the last 2 years of the three-year commitment. Furthermore, the Group completed its action promoting the professional integration of young people, by continuing to welcome a large number of interns every year (2,735 in 2014 versus 2,873 in 2013).

COLLECTING, RECONDITIONING, RESELLING AND RECYCLING MOBILE SETS Objectives Deadline Progress Status develop and strengthen the 2014 Eco-citizen collections (free retrieval of mobile sets) eco-citizen collection and used New initiatives have been successfully deployed, in mobile purchasing initiatives, Poland in particular, for collections in primary and including offers on used mobile secondary schools, and in Slovakia in Orange shops, sets in Europe where consumers are encouraged to donate their used mobile sets to support the social actions of NGO partners and win a new mobile set in a lottery. These best practices are being considered in other Orange countries. In France, Orange is an industry leader in eco-citizen collections, continuing its collection operations with Ateliers du Bocage (a social economy player), in shops with consumers, and through local communities and businesses. In addition, Orange continues to support mobile waste collection in Africa with collection and sorting workshops in 5 countries; Burkina Faso, Benin, Madagascar, Niger and Côte d’Ivoire. In 2014, nearly 47 tons of waste were thus collected and sent to France to be upgraded. BuyBacks on mobile sets  Initial buyback offers were implemented in France, where the collection rate has increased by 50% since 2013  In Romania a record collection rate of over 30% 29 Corporate Social Responsibility / 2014 review / Orange Environment was achieved  In Poland two mobile buyback offer pilots have been implemented in several shops  In Spain, after difficulties associated with market developments, a new buyback offer was set up with a new partner in mid-year. This offer multiplied the number of mobile sets collected during the 4th quarter by three, compared to the average of the previous quarters  In Belgium the new my swap marketing offer was launched. This offer guarantees customers a redemption price on their mobile set after 12 or 24 months, and will significantly increase collection rates. In Europe, second-hand mobile sales offers are now available in France, Romania and Poland. assess the feasibility of used 2014 Regulatory constraints, collection and conditioning mobile set offers in AMEA costs, as well as very strong competition from the local second-hand market still render the economic viability of used mobile offers difficult for Orange grow mobile collection rates in 2014 While some markets have witnessed a strong growth our controlled distribution in collection rates, the Group's objective to increase channels by 50% by the end of the collection by 50% was not achieved. In 2014, 1.6 2014 million phones were collected, representing an increase of 7.4% in the collection rate compared to 2013. The difficulties are mainly due to the following reasons:  in Spain, the development of marketing offers with staggered payments on sets makes mobile buyback deals less attractive  in Poland no buyback offers are deployed at a nationwide level  in France, eco-citizen collections have stagnated, especially due to the development of buyback offers and competition by collection players 2014-2016 Through its participation in the Circular Economy contribute through digital Institute, CSR has deepened its knowledge of solutions to the development of approaches put forward by other major companies. new business models (circular Through its participation in Business as unusual at economy, functionality the Kedge Business School, CSR has begun economy, collaborative analysing new business models, including the re-use economy, etc.) economy and the ultimate recycling of mobile sets 30 Corporate Social Responsibility / 2014 review / Orange Environment PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY AND SCARCE RESOURCES Objectives Deadline Progress Status BIODIVERSITY • continue the impact study 2014-2016  The impact study was continued as part of a on biodiversity launched study on the circular economy, which showed in 2013 with a business that the main impact is related to energy sector approach consumption and waste treatment.
