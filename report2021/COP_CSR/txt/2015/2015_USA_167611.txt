Fluor, as the managing partner of the Denver Transit Partners (DTP) Concession, is responsible for the financing, design, construction, testing and commissioning, as well as operations and maintenance of the 36-mile (60-kilometer) electrified Eagle P3 (public-private partnership) Commuter Rail network for the Regional Transportation District (RTD) in Denver, Colorado. In December 2014, new commuter rail cars arrived from Hyundai Rotem’s assembly plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The cars were brought to Denver's Union Station for an open house and ribbon cutting ceremony, where more than 6,500 people toured them and the renovated station. Among the visitors was John Barr, who uses a motorized wheelchair due to cerebral palsy. Three years ago using a mock-up of the car, Barr’s input led to design changes that make it easier for disabled riders to use the commuter rail system. Although Denver's Union Station was not part of the Denver Rail Project, it was renovated and reopened in 2014 and will be the hub for all commuter rail lines in 2016 as part of the Denver Rail Project. The station includes a new hotel, restaurants and shops and also encourages multimodal transportation use with an underground bus concourse and light-rail station, all within a block of one another.

Vice President of HSE, Jeff Ruebesam, participated on Research Team (RT) 301: Construction Safety, which studied lagging and leading indicators surrounding near misses. The team determined that near-miss events and conditions can be reported, analyzed and mitigated through a near-miss reporting program. Near-miss reporting was found to lower the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate, increase communication about and trust in safety measures for construction site personnel and further enable workers to identify hazardous conditions and unsafe worker behavior. Construction companies-specifically construction site personnel-will benefit from this research by learning to identify hazards and reduce workplace risks through near-miss reporting. Further, the RT 301 products usually will not add significantly to a project or company budget. 2014 Sustainability Report 36 Senior Director of HSE & Sustainability, Nancy Kralik, chaired Research Team (RT) 304: Sustainability during Construction.

While each project is a success story, highlighted are six projects with exceptional records in the sustainability arena. These projects are: • 95 Express Lanes • Clean Gasoline Program • Eagle P3 • Program Covington • Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) • USGC Ethylene Project Quest Carbon Capture and Storage Project Alberta, Canada ® 65 95 EXPRESS LANES The 95 Express Lanes project is a public-private partnership to provide approximately 29 miles (46.7 kilometers) of managed express lanes on I-395/95 from Alexandria to Stafford County, Virginia, USA. Fluor’s scope of work included financing, designing and constructing the express lanes that connect with the High Occupancy Toll (HOT) express lanes on the Capital Beltway to create 43 miles (approximately 69 kilometers) of roadway for toll-paying customers, carpools, buses and emergency vehicles. During early development, the project successfully addressed a number of sustainability challenges. Here are some examples. The project required the removal of trees from the median to make way for the express lanes. To reestablish some of the greenery, Fluor and its partner, Transurban, created a community partnership program called 1,000 Trees in 1,000 About the Cover Days. True to the program’s name, members of the project team partnered with local communities, area stakeholders, elected officials and organizations, such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, to plant over 1,000 trees in the affected Table of Contents communities. Chairman & CEO Letter In another initiative, sustainability members of the project team participated in a $1.5 million project to restore Swan’s About the Company Creek in Prince William County, Virginia. The badly eroding creek was labeled the “worst stream in the county” by members of the Prince William County staff. As part of the restoration effort, project team members built more than About the Report 88 structures, which included rock retaining walls, step pools and cross-veins, all designed to improve water quality 2014 Awards & and reestablish animal habitats. More than 7,500 trees and shrubs were planted along the creek bed to promote Certifications slope stabilization. 2014 Progress Report Given its scope and scale, the project benefitted the local economy in many ways. For example, to date, more Community & Social Service than 500 businesses have been involved in the project and more than $215 million has been invested in hiring Employees & disadvantaged, small, women-owned and minority-owned businesses, exceeding the project goal by more than $30 Workplace million. Ethics & Compliance The project’s emphasis on sustainability is in part responsible for the use of alternative abutment treatments designed Governance to increase the life span of several new flyover bridges and reduce their maintenance costs. This innovative approach will increase the life span of the bridges by 25 years, yielding a potential life span of up to 100 years.
