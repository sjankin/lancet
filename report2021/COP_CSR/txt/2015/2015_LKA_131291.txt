'000 Rs. '000 Valuation of consumer biological assets 3,027,856 2,840,391 Cost of timber plant below three years of age, not considered for valuation 22,387 29,857 Growing Crop Nurseries 540 945 3,050,783 2,871,193 27.2 The consumable Biological Assets as at 31st March 2014 of the Group was valued by Mr K.T D Tissera, an independent Chartered Valuation Surveyor as per the Valuation Report dated 06th May 2014 prepared on the physically veriﬁed timber statistics provided by the Group on a tree by tree basis. The timber trees were valued as at 31st March 2014 by the same Chartered valuation Surveyor on a tree by tree basis as per the timber statistics provided by the Group. The value of trees transferred after three years, from cost to fair value have been valued on ﬁeld /block basis by discounting the value of expected timber content of trees at the time of harvest. It is expected that only 60% of the presently available trees will remain on the ﬁeld at the time of ﬁnal harvest. The Group has valued the Consumable Biological Assets consist of trees above 4 years of age, which have been properly establish in the ﬁeld at fair value less estimated point-of-sale-costs. The direct cost attributable to new/re-planting pertaining to trees having three years or less have been added to the Consumable Biological Assets. 27.3 Timber Trees namely Eucalyptus Torariyana, Albezzia, Graveelia, Eucalyptus Grandis, Astonia, Pinus, Toona, Mahogany, Teak, Jack, Turpentine, Nadun, Mango, Pellen, Hora, Lunumidella, Mara etc. available on the plantations have been taken into consideration in this valuation of Timber Trees. 27.4 In valuing the timber plantations, under-mentioned factors have been taken into consideration 1 The present age of trees 2 Maturity age of the tree Maturity of the tree is based on the variety of the species of the tree. 3 Annual marginal increase in timber content 4 Number of years to harvest 5 Timber content of harvestable trees on maturity 6 Timber Plants having below three years of age have not been taken into the valuation 7 The timber content of immature trees at an estimated future harvestable year 8 The current price of species of timber per cubic foot at the relevant year 200 LOLC Annual Report 2013/14 27.5 Trees have been valued as per the current timber prices in the domestic market based on the price list of the State Timber Corporation and prices of timber trees sold by estates and prices of logs and sawn timber in the popular timber traders in Sri Lanka. 27.6 The fair value is determined on the basis of net present value of expected future cash ﬂows using a discount rate of 14.5% per annum. The signiﬁcant assumptions used in the valuation of Consumable Biological Assets are as follows: 1 Future cash ﬂows are determined by references to current timber prices without considering the inﬂationary effect. 2 The ongoing cost of growing trees which are deducted in determining the net cash ﬂows are constant in real terms. 3 Timber trees that have not come upto a harvestable size are valued working out the period that would take for those trees to grow up to a harvestable size. 4 The present value of the trees is worked out based on the projected size and the estimated number of years it would take to reach the size. This is worked out on the basis of an annual marginal increase of timber content which normally ranges from 0.50 to 1.50 cm per year for trees of diameter girth over 10 cm. 5 The value of each matured species of timber is worked out on the price of a cubic foot of timber in the market of the species and the available cubic content of timber in the tree. 6 Due consideration has been given for cost of felling, transport, sawing, cost to sell including obtaining of approval for felling. 27.7 Managed trees include commercial timber plantations cultivated in estates. The cost of immature trees is treated at approximate fair value particularly on the ground of little biological transformation has taken place and impact of the biological transformation on price is not material. When such Plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from immature to mature. 27.8 The fair value of managed trees was ascertained since LKAS 41 is only applicable for managed agricultural activity in terms of the ruling issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. The valuation was carried but by using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods. In ascertaining the fair value of timber a physical veriﬁcation was carried out covering all the estates. 27.9 The valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on net present values, takes into account the long-term exploitation of the timber plantation. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation at fair value of the biological assets due to the volatility of the variables, their carrying value may differ from their realisable value. The Board of Directors retains their view that commodity markets are inherently volatile and that long-term price projections are highly unpredictable. Hence, the sensitivity analysis regarding selling price and discount rate variations as included in this note allows every investor to reasonably challenge the ﬁnancial impact of the assumptions used in LKAS 41 against his own assumptions. 27.10 The biological assets of the Group is cultivated in the leased lands. When measuring the fair value of the biological assets it was assumed that these concessions can and will be renewed at normal circumstances. Timber content expects to be realised in future and is included in the calculation of the fair value that takes into account the age of the timber plants and not the expiration date of the lease. 201 Notes to the Financial Statements 27.11 Sensitivity Analysis for biological assets 27.11.1 Sensitivity variation sales price Values as appearing in the Statement of Financial Position are very sensitive to price changes with regard to the average sales prices applied.

The Group has established environmental policies and procedures aimed at compliance with local environmental and other laws. Management performs regular reviews to identify environmental risks and to ensure that the systems in place are adequate to manage those risks. Supply and demand risk The Group is exposed to risks arising from ﬂuctuations in the price and sales volume of timber. When possible the Group manages this risk by aligning its harvest volume to market supply and demand. Management performs regular industry trend analyses to ensure that the Group’s pricing structure is in line with the market and to ensure that projected harvest volumes are consistent with the expected demand. Climate and other risks The Group’s timber plantations are exposed to the risk of damage from climatic changes, diseases, forest ﬁres and other natural forces. The Group has extensive processes in place aimed at monitoring and mitigating those risks, including regular forest health inspections and industry pest and disease surveys. 202 LOLC Annual Report 2013/14 28 Bearer biological assets Group As at 31 March 2014 2013 Note Rs.

The assets (including plantations assets) taken over by way of estate leases are set out in Notes 24 and 33.2 to the Financial Statements. Further, investment in immature plantations taken over by way of leases is shown in this note. When such plantations become mature, the additional investments need to be incurred since, taken over to bring them to maturity will be moved from immature to mature under this note. A corresponding movement from immature to mature of the investment undertaken by JEDB/SLSPC on the same plantation prior to the lease wills also carried out under this note. The requirement of recognition of bearer biological assets at its fair value less cost to sell under LKAS 41 was superseded by the ruling issued on 02 March 2012, by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Company has elected to measure the bearer biological assets (Tea & Mixed Crop) at cost using LKAS 16 Property Plant & Equipment, due to the impracticability of carrying out proper fair valuation. 28.2 At Fair Value 28.2.1 On Finance Lease Group Rubber Coconut 2013/14 Total 2012/13 Total Rs.

(2012/13 13.04%) as part of the cost of immature plantations. Capitalization of borrowing costs will cease when the plantations are ready for bearing. 206 LOLC Annual Report 2013/14 28.4 Bearer biological assets, namely Rubber and Coconut plantations are recognized at its fair value less cost to sell under LKAS 41 Agriculture. However the Company measures Tea and Other bearer biological Assets at cost using LKAS 16 Property Plant & Equipment in accordance with the new ruling issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka dated 2nd March 2012, due to the impracticability of carrying out proper fair valuation. 28.5 Rubber and Coconut plantations as at 31st March 2014 of the Group was valued by Mr K.T.D. Tissera, an independent Chartered Valuation Surveyor as per the Valuation Report dated 06th May 2014 having separately valued latex/crop and timber components based on the physically veriﬁed statistics on a ﬁeld by ﬁeld basis. 28.6 The valuation has been prepared in respect of each estate separately for the latex/nuts and the timber component of the Rubber/ Coconut plantation. The Rubber and Coconut plants having up to six years of ages as at the reporting date have been taken at cost. 28.7 The valuer has valued the latex/nuts component of Rubber, and Coconut using the forecasted crop, Prices and Cost of production as at 31st March 2014 on the basis of net percent value of expected future cash ﬂows using a discount rate of 13.5% per annum (i.e. 10.5% Risk Free Rate plus 3% Risk Premium). The scrap value, being the timber component of trees is valued by using the available log prices in city centres less point-of-sale-costs on the basis of net percent value of expected future cash ﬂows using a discount rate of 14.5% per annum (i.e. 10.5% Risk Free Rate plus 4% Risk Premium). 28.8 The company has considered a decrease of 1% in the risk premium used to value rubber and coconut as at 31st March 2014 compared to the valuation of rubber and coconut as at 31st March 2013. This change is mainly due to the following factors. a) Rubber and Coconut are sold through a well established auction system where reliable information on current market is reﬂected. However the market prices of timber varies from location to location which is regulated by few institutions and mainly by individuals. b) The costs associated with production of latex and nuts are systematically recorded and easily accessed, but the costs associated with timber harvesting is also varies from location to location depending on the institution or the individual who perform the harvesting operation. c) In valuing the Rubber and Coconut plantations, under-mentioned factors have been taken into consideration. 1 The present age of trees and yields of each separate ﬁeld. 2 Maturity age of the trees. 3 Number of years remaining to harvest. 4 Rubber/Coconut Plants having upto six years of age have not been taken into the valuation. 5 Twelve month (April 2013-March 2014) Net sales Average (NSA) and Cost of Production (COP) of latex and Coconut used to value the latex component of Rubber and Coconut crop, and the current market price of timber as per the available log prices in city centres less point-of-sale-costs to determine the value of timber component. 6 Field level cost to determine the cost of production of latex and Coconut. 7 Annual yield level is estimated and derived based on last year yield. 28.9 The signiﬁcant assumptions used in the valuation of Rubber and Coconut plantations are as follows: 1 Future cash ﬂows of timber component of Rubber and Coconut are determined by references to current timber prices without considering the inﬂationary effect. 2 The ongoing cost of growing trees which are deducted in determining the net cash ﬂows are constant in real terms. 3 Rubber/Coconut Plants have been valued working out the period that would take for those trees to be harvested. 4 Due consideration has been given for cost of felling and transport. 207 Notes to the Financial Statements 29 Subsidiary companies 29.1 Company As at 31 March 2014 2013 No. of Holding % Cost No. of Holding % Cost Subsidiary Shares Rs.

SLFRS 11 also amends LKAS 28 Investments in Associates. The main changes from LKAS 31 to SLFRS 11 There was an option given by ICASL, for jointly controlled entities, between proportionate consolidation and the equity method. The new standard is on the basis that proportionate consolidation is not appropriate in the absence of rights/obligations directly to/for the underlying assets/obligations of the arrangement. Based on the new standard, accounting for joint ventures should be changed from proportionate consolidation which was allowed in LKAS 31 to equity accounting. 218 LOLC Annual Report 2013/14 Current method applied at LOLC Group From the point of acquisition, LOLC accounted for Free Lanka Group using proportionate consolidation as allowed by LKAS 31. Proportionate consolidation allowed to account the proportion of assets, liabilities, income and expense of the joint venture in the investor’s ﬁnancial statements. New treatment As per the SLFRS 11, the method of accounting should be changed to equity method where only the net assets movement of Joint venture are recorded in the investor’s ﬁnancial statements. The change in accounting method will affect the respective line items of the statement of ﬁnancial position and the statement of comprehensive income (proﬁt or loss). In the Statement of ﬁnancial position the respective assets and liabilities of the joint ventures are eliminated from the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and clustered though equity accounted investees where there will be no impact on the net assets of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. In the proﬁt or loss, income and expenses of joint ventures are eliminated from the consolidated and the share of comprehensive income of the joint venture will be accounted as the share of proﬁt of equity accounted investees. The full effect of the change in current method of accounting using proportionate consolidation and future equity method of accounting as follows; Group As at 31 March 2014 Proportionate SLFRS 11 Equity consolidation adjustment Method Statement of Financial Position Rs.' 000 Rs.' 000 Rs.' 000 Assets Cash in hand and favourable bank balances 5,362,900 (189,404) 5,173,496 Trading assets fair value through proﬁt or loss 1,017,080 (131,278) 885,802 Investment securities 16,288,214 (115,268) 16,172,946 Finance lease receivables, hire purchases and operating leases 36,259,242 36,259,242 Advances and other loans 54,285,641 54,285,641 Insurance premium receivables 449,589 449,589 Inventories 2,191,924 (323,298) 1,868,626 Current tax assets 1,122,555 (19,134) 1,103,421 Trade and other current assets 7,231,989 (872,169) 6,359,820 Prepaid lease rentals on leasehold properties 287,654 (236,566) 51,088 Investment properties 7,159,771 (504,281) 6,655,490 Real estate stocks Biological assets; Consumer biological assets 3,050,783 (3,050,783) Bearer biological assets 3,633,649 (3,633,649) Investments in group of companies; Subsidiary companies Joint venture companies 6,402,897 6,402,897 Equity accounted investees Associates 13,472,318 13,472,318 Deferred tax assets 390,619 (77,448) 313,171 Intangible assets 739,386 (16,837) 722,549 Property, plant and equipment 22,599,854 (1,089,491) 21,510,362 Total assets 175,543,168 (3,856,710) 171,686,458 219 Notes to the Financial Statements Group As at 31 March 2014 Proportionate SLFRS 11 Equity consolidation adjustment Method Statement of Financial Position Rs.' 000 Rs.' 000 Rs.' 000 Liabilities and equity Liabilities Bank overdrafts 2,934,398 (115,096) 2,819,302 Trading liabilities fair value through proﬁt or loss 405,434 405,434 Deposits liabilities 49,614,880 49,614,880 Interest bearing borrowings 66,286,716 (737,828) 65,548,888 Insurance provision life 271,792 271,792 Insurance provision general 1,248,685 1,248,685 Current tax payables 1,082,927 (24,202) 1,058,725 Trade and other payables 4,670,380 (1,393,311) 3,277,069 Deferred tax liabilities 2,762,477 (541,641) 2,220,836 Deferred income 259,285 (247,897) 11,388 Retirement beneﬁt obligations 1,151,932 (796,735) 355,197 Total liabilities 130,688,906 (3,856,710) 126,832,196 Equity Stated capital 475,200 475,200 Reserves 5,357,905 5,357,905 Retained earnings 17,069,012 17,069,012 Equity attributable to shareholders of the Company 22,902,117 22,902,117 Non-controlling interests 21,952,145 21,952,145 Total equity 44,854,262 44,854,262 Total liabilities & equity 175,543,168 (3,856,710) 171,686,458 220 LOLC Annual Report 2013/14 Group Year ended 31 March 2014 Proportionate SLFRS 11 Equity consolidation adjustment Method Statement of comprehensive income Rs.' 000 Rs.' 000 Rs.' 000 Gross income 45,007,778 (3,350,494) 41,657,284 Revenue 14,081,434 (3,298,138) 10,783,296 Less: cost of sales (8,245,684) 814,894 (7,430,790) Gross proﬁt 5,835,750 (2,483,244) 3,352,506 Income 27,571,520 (46,675) 27,524,845 Other income/(expenses) 3,354,824 (5,681) 3,349,143 Net ﬁnance costs (16,408,947) 107,206 (16,301,741) Proﬁt before operating expenses 20,353,147 (2,428,394) 17,924,753 Operating expenses Direct expenses excluding ﬁnance costs (2,236,834) (2,236,834) Personnel costs (5,649,326) 2,170,879 (3,478,447) Net impairment loss on ﬁnancial assets (3,490,519) (3,490,519) Depreciation and amortization (972,249) 105,534 (866,715) Other operating expenses (5,560,032) 115,781 (5,444,251) Results from operating activities 2,444,187 (36,200) 2,407,987 Gain on disposal of subsidiaries 79,845 79,845 Share of proﬁts of equity accounted investees 1,497,381 (4,004) 1,493,377 Gains on bargain purchases (negative goodwill) 493,586 493,586 Proﬁt before income tax expense 4,514,999 (40,204) 4,474,795 Income tax expense (1,407,093) 40,204 (1,366,889) Proﬁt for the year 3,107,906 3,107,906 221 Notes to the Financial Statements 31 Equity accounted investees Associates 31.1 Company As at 31 March 2014 2013 No. of Shares Cost No. of Shares Cost Rs.

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reﬂects the signiﬁcance of the inputs used in making the measurements. 1 Level 1: Quoted market price (unadjusted) in an active market for an identical instrument. 2 Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques where all signiﬁcant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data. 3 Level 3: Valuation techniques using signiﬁcant unobservable inputs. This category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a signiﬁcant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where signiﬁcant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reﬂect differences between the instruments. The table below analyses ﬁnancial instruments measured at fair value at the end of the reporting period, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised. 258 LOLC Annual Report 2013/14 Group Note Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total As at 31 March 2014 Rs.

Risk management framework The board of directors of each Company has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of Group's risk management framework for the companies within the group. The Board has established Integrated Risk Management Committees (IRMC) for each ﬁnancial sector company, which are responsible for developing and monitoring ﬁnancial services risk management policies in their speciﬁed areas. All Board committees have both executive and non-executive members and report regularly to the Board of Directors on their activities. The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by Group , to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂect changes in market conditions, products and services offered. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment, in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Audit Committee of each Company is responsible for monitoring compliance with the risk management policies and procedures, and for reviewing the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the each Group of Company. Each ﬁnancial sector Company's audit committee is assisted in these functions by Enterprise Risk Management division (ERM). ERM undertakes both regular and ad-hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to each ﬁnancial sector Company’s Audit Committee. 1 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s loans and advances to customers. The Group exposure to the credit risk is mainly derived from ﬁnancial sector companies as the sector engage primarily in providing ﬁnancing facilities to its customers. The Credit risk is managed by evaluating the credit worthiness and by periodical review on the credit granted. Management of credit risk The Board of Directors of each ﬁnancial sector Company has delegated responsibility for the oversight of credit risk to its Credit Committee. A separate Credit department, reporting to each Credit Committees, is responsible for management of the Financial sector Companies' credit risk, including: 1. Formulating credit policies in consultation with business units, covering collateral requirements, credit assessment, risk grading and reporting, documentary and legal procedures, and compliance with regulatory and statutory requirements. 2. Establishing the authorization structure for the approval and renewal of credit facilities. Authorization limits are allocated to business unit Credit Ofﬁcers. Larger facilities require approval by Group Credit, Head of Group Credit, Credit Committee or the board of directors as appropriate. 265 Notes to the Financial Statements 3. Reviewing and assessing credit risk. Group Credit assesses all credit exposures in excess of designated limits, prior to facilities being committed to customers by the business unit concerned. Renewals and reviews of facilities are subjected to the same review process. 4. Reviewing compliance of business units with agreed exposure limits, including those for selected industries, country risk and product types. Regular reports on the credit quality of local portfolios are provided to Group Credit who may require appropriate corrective action to be taken. 5. Providing advice, guidance and specialist skills to business units to promote best practice throughout the ﬁnancial sector in the management of credit risk. Impaired facilities and loans Individually impaired loans and securities are loans and advances for which each ﬁnancial sector Company determines that there is objective evidence of impairment and it does not expect to collect all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan/investment security agreement(s). Past due but not impaired loans and investment debt securities Past due but not impaired loans and investment debt securities, other than those carried at fair value through proﬁt or loss, are those for which contractual interest or principal payments are past due, but each ﬁnancial sector Company believes that impairment is not appropriate on the basis of the level of security/collateral available and/or the stage of collection of amounts owed to each Company. The following table shows the overdue amounts for the ﬁnancial assets categories. Group Company Neither past due Overdue Neither past due Overdue nor impaired nor impaired Cash in hand and favourable bank balances 5,362,900 94,205 Trading assets fair value through proﬁt or loss 1,017,080 536,325 Investment securities 16,288,214 382,733 Loan portfolio 57,409,933 33,134,950 1,514,731 102,947 Trade and other current assets 5,801,878 2,594,220 Impairment losses related to each of the above asset classes are shown in note 9 to these ﬁnancial statements.

In respect of some of these loans, ﬁnancial sector companies have made concessions that it would not otherwise consider. Once the loan is restructured it remains in this category independent of satisfactory performance after restructuring. Allowances for impairment Each ﬁnancial sector Company establishes an allowance for impairment losses on assets carried at amortized cost that represents its estimate of incurred losses in its loan. The main components of this allowance are a speciﬁc loss component that relates to individually signiﬁcant exposures, and, for assets measured at amortized cost, a collective loan loss allowance established for each ﬁnancial sector Company's homogeneous assets as well as for individually signiﬁcant exposures that were subject to individual assessment for impairment but not found to be individually impaired. Assets carried at fair value through proﬁt or loss are not subject to impairment testing as the measure of fair value reﬂects the credit quality of each asset. Write-off policy Each ﬁnancial sector Company writes off a loan, and any related allowances for impairment losses, when management determines that the loan or security is uncollectible. This determination is made after considering information such as the occurrence of signiﬁcant changes in the borrower’s/issuer’s ﬁnancial position such that the borrower/issuer can no longer pay the obligation, or that proceeds from collateral will not be sufﬁcient to pay back the entire exposure. For smaller balance standardized loans, write-off decisions generally are based on a product-speciﬁc past due status. Each ﬁnancial sector Company holds collateral against loans and advances to customers in the form of mortgage interests over property, other registered securities over assets, and guarantees. Estimates of fair value are based on the value of collateral assessed at the time of borrowing, and generally are not updated except when a loan is individually assessed as impaired. Trade & Other Receivables Each group of Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The main components of this allowance are a speciﬁc loss component that relates to individually signiﬁcant exposures, and a collective loss component established for each group of Company's similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identiﬁed. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics of the portfolio. 267 Notes to the Financial Statements 2 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difﬁculty in meeting obligations associated with its ﬁnancial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another ﬁnancial asset. Management of liquidity risk The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufﬁcient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s entities. For the ﬁnancial sector companies, a Central Treasury manages the liquidity risk for ﬁnancial sector. Central Treasury receives information from other business units regarding the liquidity proﬁle of their ﬁnancial assets and liabilities and details of other projected cash ﬂows arising from projected future business. Central Treasury then maintains a portfolio of short-term liquid assets, largely made up of shortterm liquid investment securities, loans and advances to customers and other inter-group facilities, to ensure that sufﬁcient liquidity is maintained within the ﬁnancial sector as a whole. The liquidity requirements of business units and subsidiaries are met through short-term loans from Central Treasury to cover any short-term ﬂuctuations and longer term funding to address any structural liquidity requirements. When a ﬁnancial sector subsidiary is subject to a liquidity limit imposed by its local regulator, the subsidiary is responsible for managing its overall liquidity within the regulatory limit in co-ordination with central Treasury. The ﬁnancial sector relies on deposits from customers and issued debt securities and borrowings as its primary sources of funding. While the Group’s debt securities have maturities of over one year, deposits from customers generally have shorter maturities and a large proportion of them are repayable on demand. The short-term nature of these deposits increases the ﬁnancial sector’s liquidity risk and the sector actively manages this risk through maintaining competitive pricing and constant monitoring of market trends. Maturity analysis for ﬁnancial liabilities Note 51 to these ﬁnancial statements shows the discounted cash ﬂows on the Company’s non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities on the basis of their earliest possible contractual maturity. To manage the liquidity risk arising from ﬁnancial liabilities, the Group holds liquid assets comprising cash and cash equivalents and investment securities for which there an active and liquid market is available. 268 LOLC Annual Report 2013/14 3 Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of ﬁnancial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. Overall non-trading interest rate risk positions are managed by Financial sector's Central Treasury, which uses investment securities, advances to customers, deposits from customers and derivative instruments to manage the overall position arising from the Group’s market based activities. The management of interest rate risk against interest rate gap limits is supplemented by monitoring the sensitivity of the Company’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities to various standard and non-standard interest rate scenarios. An analysis of the Company’s sensitivity to an increase or decrease in market interest rates, assuming no asymmetrical movement in yield curves and a constant ﬁnancial position, is as follows; Sensitivity of projected net interest income reported equity 1% parallel 1% parallel 1% parallel 1% parallel 1% parallel Group increase decrease increase decrease Rs.
