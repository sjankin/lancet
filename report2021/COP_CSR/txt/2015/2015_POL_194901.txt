Employee turnover rate in the Company for the last closed financial year was on the level of 14%. The ratio is not high in relation to the number of employees. Employee turnover generally results from the type of business activity of the Company, as because of nature of performed contracts some employees work under fixed-period contracts or employment contracts for the period needed to perform certain work. The structure of employment according to education, age and gender as at 31 December 2014 is shown in the charts below.

ELEKTROBUDOWA SA 30 November 2015 18 Global Compact – Report Preventive Medicine Health is a value of the utmost importance for every individual. Aware of it, the company has been providing an above-standard medical care for its employees for many years. The care is provided on the highest level.

Every year the Company provides voluntary preventive vaccination against flue. Such actions help reduce the rate of absenteeism due to sickness. ELEKTROBUDOWA SA provides health campaigns and supervises their proceeding, but no one is forced to take part in them. However, the health campaigns always receive good response from the employees. Implementation of extra medical care and health protection programme, despite incurred costs, is an added value for the Company, as it translates directly into reduction of costs of health-related staff fluctuation. It is not without significance that medical care can be provided also for the employees’ families. Supporting Employees’ Leisure-Time Interests Positive relations among employees contribute to their increased productivity. ELEKTROBUDOWA SA is aware that everyone has some interests and tries to face up to the fact by encouraging the employees to pursue their hobbies, to develop their interests or participate in the cultural environment, which translates directly into growth of satisfaction from performing work.

The “record breakers” use the cards up to the maximum; there are months when they frequent the facilities every day.

The trips combine sightseeing with entertainment. ELEKTROBUDOWA SA works from many locations all over Poland, so those trips provide an excellent opportunity for integration which pays off with better cooperation and building more efficient teams. Another important event is an annual picnic for the employees and their families. This year the event had an exceptionally festive character, as the occasion was exceptional: the 40th anniversary of the factory in Konin. It was also an opportunity to hand in gifts to the employees who celebrated their 25 years and 40 years of service for ELEKTROBUDOWA SA. The youngest participants can play different games; the older may listen to concerts by famous Polish artists. What enjoyed enormous popularity this year was the cooking workshop conducted by Teo Vafidis, a charismatic Greek who passionately promotes Greek cuisine. Those who are not so much fond of cooking could watch the enduro motorcycle stunt show. The picnics are very popular, as every time they attract up to 2000 participants. Every year the company organises Christmas meetings for employees. They usually have a form of common outings to a symphony concert or theatrical performance preceded by a reception. The employees can also have Christmas meetings within their organisational units, for which they are supported from the social benefit fund. ELEKTROBUDOWA SA does not neglect the youngest participants of its life and organises for them a Children’s Day party and Santa Claus party. To meet the children’s wishes (whose expectations are often hard to meet) we make every effort to make each event unforgettable.

Motivation Periodic personnel appraisal is an important element of personnel productivity and motivation management policy implemented by ELEKTROBUDOWA SA. In the years 2010-2014 the periodic review covered the managing staff. The periodic appraisal process is based on accounting for measurable business objectives established a year earlier in the form of score cards and on the evaluation of key competencies. The process is used for defining the areas of development and establishing business and development targets for the next year. Average monthly pay in 2014 was on the level of 4838 PLN and was by about 10.9 per cent lower than in 2013. Decrease of the average monthly pay is principally contributed to reduction employment at foreign contracts, where the Company maintains the level of guaranteed pay applicable according to the local collective agreements. The Company consequently implements an incentive programme targeted at increasing profit margins and financial result and extends the non-pay incentive methods in order to support the process of retaining and recruiting employees and to increase the level of motivation and efficiency of work.

Principle 7 Precautionary approach to environmental challenges. ELEKTROBUDOWA SA takes necessary actions to prevent and mitigate of adverse environmental impact. We have identified the areas of our activity and implemented relevant procedures for mitigating the adverse influence on the natural environment. Systemic solutions, based on the certified management system, implemented in our company guarantee our aware and responsible approach to the natural environment. Actions that are taken, which could even in the least degree interfere with the environment, correspond in all respects with national and European regulations, meet legal requirements and often exceed the regulatory minimum. Before commencing execution of a new project we identify environmental aspects and their impact on the environment. Also, each time the management system is reviewed or an internal audit carried out we investigate whether our actions conform to the mandatory legal requirements and our internal procedures of the environmental management system. Therefore the whole project realization process is thoroughly planned, and such plans include the methods of mitigation of environmental impacts. ELEKTROBUDOWA SA has a direct and indirect impact on the environment caused by manufacturing process and provision of building services. In its business activity our company adheres to environmental protection requirements. We are in a constant ELEKTROBUDOWA SA 30 November 2015 32 Global Compact – Report dialogue on the quality and environmental issues with users of our products and other publics involved with our company. During execution of big contracts which impact on the environment and biodiversity of areas where they are performed is big, we conduct a cyclical dialogue with the interested stakeholders. For the meetings concerning building models of public debate referring to our business activities the representatives of the following groups are invited: ▪ societies, foundations, associations dealing with environmental protection and broadly understood ecology, ▪ non-governmental organizations, ▪ municipal authorities, ▪ colleges and universities, ▪ inhabitants of areas where our projects are carried out, ▪ media. Discussing environmental aspects in those meetings with respect to the relevant investments ensure mitigation of hazardous impact on the environment. Owing to public debates we have developed standards of work which are implemented with greatest care, and concern to avoid incidental destruction of habitats. Public debates have also an educational role and allow getting the publics involved in common decision-taking during performance of our projects. Basing on the results of a survey we have identified those areas of our business activity which have an environmental impact. The main sources of impact on the environment include: 1. Surface coating process in the powder paint shop. 2. Welding processes. 3. Fuel burning in the electric installations. 4. Fuel burning in vehicle engines. 5. Painting and drying processes in liquid coating shop. 6. Wastes produced in manufacturing process and in executing services. 7. Diffuse gas and dust emissions to the atmosphere in painting and welding processes during performance of services. 8. Works which have impact on biodiversity. ELEKTROBUDOWA SA attaches great importance to aspects connected with protection of the natural environment during the process of manufacturing of equipment. The negative environmental impact is small on every stage of use of our goods, from delivery and installation until the end of their useful lives. Our company is determined to implement ELEKTROBUDOWA SA 30 November 2015 33 Global Compact – Report environment-friendly solutions during the process of development and manufacture of our products. Negative influence of transport of our products on the environment is mitigated, owing to effective delivery planning. To the best of our knowledge, in manufacture of our goods we do not use any raw materials which have significant impact on the environment. Materials used to manufacture enclosures of our switchgear panels are reusable. After decommissioning of switchgear panels, specialist firms are able to disassembly the product into components. All materials are recyclable. The company systematically implements new technologies and procedures to increase cleanliness of production and invests in quality improvement of products to ensure the least possible impact on the environment. In our production facilities we apply the best available technological processes enabling to maintain cleanliness of production, which ensure systematic increase of emissions, lower consumption of raw materials, energy and water and also effluent treatment or breakdown prevention. Every year an Environmental Management Programme is prepared in the company. The programmes are annually reviewed and the level of reaching the targets is assessed. The main aspect which has an adverse impact on local biosphere concerns the waste produced at the sites and which come from maintenance and dismantling works. Their quantities are strongly correlated with a number and size of contracts and their stage of completion. In its operations ELEKTROBUDOWA SA ensures that the works associated with waste removal are performed with greatest care, and the waste categorized as hazardous is correctly managed. Therefore it does not pose a risk for people or the local biosphere. Environmental requirements that our personnel has to fulfil, are also imposed on our subcontractors and suppliers. Principle 8 Undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. The period since the previous Report was published was the time of increased efforts to implement the assumptions made with the purpose of building the environmental awareness in our employees. We provide regular training in environmental protection issues for our employees, promote healthy lifestyle, organize trips to areas where we can admire ELEKTROBUDOWA SA 30 November 2015 34 Global Compact – Report our natural heritage, provide educational materials teaching how the environment can be cared for in our everyday lives. In May this year the company organised “A day without rubbish” again. The event was co-organised by a recycling company. It had a purpose of building ecological awareness among employees and their families. During the “Day without rubbish” we were promoting actions concerning selective collection of wastes. One of its attractions was a competition for children: drawing pictures relating to promotion of good practices of waste segregation. The company also invited its employees with their children to the theatre for a play raising environmental issues. “Give waste a second chance” – a motto of “Day without rubbish” ELEKTROBUDOWA SA 30 November 2015 35 Global Compact – Report Employees could see and become convinced that recycling is not just a caprice of environmentalists but a means for substantial savings of electricity, natural resources, reduction of pollution and reduction of waste on a rubbish dump. The campaign was addressed to the employees and their families. Children received colourful gadgets referring to environmental topics. The purpose of this event was to raise the employees’ awareness of their impact on the environment. Principle 9 Development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies In consideration for natural environment we have implemented the environmental protection system according to PN-EN ISO 14001:2005, what compels our organization to constant improvement in conducting activities connected with the protection of environment. ELEKTROBUDOWA SA 30 November 2015 36 Global Compact – Report We have also been rewarded for our commitment to environmental protection issues: [RESPONSIBLE ENTREPRENEUR CERTIFICATE] Our company takes the following into account in planning its projects:  Use of substances with low hazard potential.  Effective use of energy.  Efficient consumption of water and media, materials and fuels.  Application of waste-free or low-waste technologies and the possibility of waste recovery.  Type, range and volume of emissions.  Using comparable processes and methods which were successfully used on an industrial scale.  Progress in science and technology.  Environmental impact of our subcontractors and business partners.  Impact on biodiversity of nature. ELEKTROBUDOWA SA 30 November 2015 37 Global Compact – Report Basing on the identified sources of pollution produced in effect of our business activities, we have taken appropriate steps to eliminate or mitigate our negative impact on the environment. Powder paints which are used in our coating shops are ecological products which do not include volatile substances that would be released in the process of coating (according to their producers). Gas emissions to air in the process of manual or automatic welding in the Tychy factory have been minimized owing to installation of modern filtering and ventilation devices. Their filtration efficiency is as high as 99.5% which is unique in this type of manufacture processes and is a negligible emission. The manufacturing room is heated by gas-powered ceramic radiant heaters. Infrared radiant energy emitted by heaters is converted into heat when it strikes objects in the area. In a natural way it warms the floor, machines and personnel in the heated area, while it does not warm any objects in the upper part of the building. Therefore only the surface, not the cubage of the building is warmed. In October 2015 we implemented a photovoltaic installation in our production plant in Tychy, what will undoubtedly improve our environmental impact. Gas and dust emissions by consumption of energy carriers are monitored on a current basis: total natural gas, heat in water, electricity total carriers incl. fuels total petrol and diesel oil Consumption of energy carriers in ELEKTROBUDOWA SA in 2003-2014 Total consumption / vehicle fuels / gas + central heating + electricity 90 000 85 000 80 000 75 000 70 000 65 000 60 000 55 000 50 000 Energy 45 000 /GJ/ 40 000 35 000 30 000 25 000 20 000 15 000 10 000 5 000 0 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Suma gaz ziemny, CO, en. elektr. 62196,72 60829,28 54706,48 47996, 48 54661,5852 55520,9734 42383,5078 50341, 6876 38957,0992 44113,277 54766,922 55565,35 Suma nośników z paliwami 74679, 915 73636,15 67797,411 62704,892 70666,1342 74035,2544 61981,8748 72258, 0176 60221,3822 70654,961 82522, 17 82432,018 Suma benzyna i olej napędowy 10953, 145 11250,96 11871,201 12975,792 14853,779 16807,521 18137,277 19795,81 19829,053 22684,234 26388,978 25616,768 ELEKTROBUDOWA SA 30 November 2015 38 Global Compact – Report Principle 10 Working against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery The employees of ELEKTROBUDOWA SA observe the legal regulations which are in force in the country where the Company operates.
