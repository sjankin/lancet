Second, we believe in the power of food to connect people in all corners of the world. And finally, we believe that what we do every day matters — that we have a fundamental responsibility to safeguard the planet’s natural resources, help our communities thrive, provide a supportive workplace for our employees, and deliver solid returns for our shareholders.
