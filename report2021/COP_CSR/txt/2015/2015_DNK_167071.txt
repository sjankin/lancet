Even small villages are supplied with modern radio, TV, broadband internet and GSM mobile phone and data services. TELE-POST employs approximately 475 staff. Our head office is located in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, and we have local units in every town in Greenland. Page 2 of 17 HUMAN RIGHTS Global Compact principles 1-2 1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and 2. make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. TELE-POST'S APPROACH TELE-POST finds that it is a basic human right that all citizens have the possibility to communicate across national and international borders. We acknowledge our role in this respect and endeavour to run a stable business investing to the benefit of both customers, employees and our community. These investments often entail high costs, but are nevertheless necessary if we want to provide good communication solutions to the citizens in any part of Greenland. That is why TELE-POST cooperates closely with the Government of Greenland (Naalakkersuisut) in creating framework conditions that will ensure continued investments and fair product prices in peripheral regions without sufficient commercial foundation for a sound ICT development. FOCUS AREAS  TRAINING TELE-POST finds that it is important to establish relevant apprenticeships and traineeships. This benefits both our business in the form of qualified labour, and it is instrumental in raising the educational level throughout Greenland. So as part of our education and training policy, TELE-POST already now has one of the highest numbers of trainees and apprentices in Greenland.  ACTIONS We are proud of being able to offer training within domains ranging from data technician to sales assistant in partnership with our national training bodies and educational institutions. In 2015, TELE-POST has around 36 trainees affiliated to the business; this makes up 6.9% of our staff. Our aim is to have trainees and apprentices pass to permanent employment following the completion of their traineeships or apprenticeships to the widest possible extent. TELE-POST has good experience with adult traineeships and apprenticeships which give unskilled staff the opportunity to complete relevant vocational training as part of their employment with us. In 2015,TELE-POST will intensify its focus on particularly technical courses, and we plan to establish a mentor scheme for the purpose of supporting our trainees throughout their training. Page 3 of 17 TELE-POST wants to support young people with an affiliation to Greenland in taking long or medium-long further education which is professionally relevant to our business. Later in their career, this talent group may form a highly attractive recruitment base for specialist and executive jobs in TELE-POST. In 2015, we expect to contract for apprenticeships and traineeships with relevant training bodies and set up performance goals. TELE-POST will moreover consider establishing a mentor scheme for the purpose of supporting the trainees throughout their training. Current initiatives Future initiatives  Apprenticeships and traineeships  Apprenticeships and traineeships with training  Supplementary training bodies and educational institutions  DIGITAL WELFARE TELE-POST recognizes its social responsibility for consolidating citizens' access to the Internet. As part of our strategy we aim at giving min. 80% of citizens access to the Internet in their homes by the end of the strategy period in 2018. This strategy also includes our aim:  to create sufficient Internet capacity for e-learning and Internet access for pupils and students at all educational institutions and training bodies;  to contribute to enabling the health services utilize digitalized solutions in connection with surgery hours, diagnosing and treatments and  assume an active role in securing ways and means for digitalized citizens' services anywhere in Greenland.  ACTIONS In order to support developments in Greenland and meet the rising demand for Internet access, TELE-POST is continuously enhancing its infrastructure. By way of example, we are currently working to extend the marine cable which means that high-capacity Internet will reach two thirds of the population in Greenland instead of now one third. When launching such huge projects, we also endeavour to ensure good business ethics throughout the supplier chain. TELE-POST contributes to a number of initiatives primarily aimed at securing access to important communication and information for all citizens. Citizens may for instance contact their doctor via the telephone, and TELE-POST has entered into a special agreement with the educational institutions of Greenland which means that they can offer their pupils and students extended Internet capacity. Furthermore, TELE-POST keeps certain commercially unattractive Internet products going as they ensure basic Internet access for customers with small financial means. Page 4 of 17 Previous projects Future projects  Attat  Extension of the marine cable to Aasiaat  NUIKI  New high-speed chain to Ilulissat  Extension of the radio chain to Upernavik  IT SECURITY It is important that our customers feel comfortable with how we handle their personal data. So via our updated IT security policy, TELE-POST provides for protection of customers' data, privacy and personal information, and transparency is ensured in relation to how we achieve this security.  ACTIONS TELE-POST works with IT security at three levels: 1) Our latest initiative is updated guidelines for the handling of personal data. As part of this initiative, we will establish an IT security course meant to ensure that all employees ordinarily handling personal data will have the necessary tools to ensure confidentiality. 2) TELE-POST contributes to protecting children and young people against potentially harmful usage on the Internet. That is the reason why we have worked out good advice to both children, youths and parents as well as guidelines on how to protect one's wireless Internet against unauthorized access. In future we will work on definite security packages that enable the restriction of children's usage of certain Internet websites. 3) Furthermore, we want to ensure control and overview. So we have provided our customers with the ability to track their telephone and data usage and put up usage restrictions, as required, so they do not risk too high bills. Current initiatives Future initiatives  IT security policy  IT security course  Guidance on protecting one's wireless network  Security packages  Guidelines for handling personal data  LOCAL INVOLVEMENT TELE-POST is one of Greenland's biggest and most important businesses. Organising, participating in or sponsoring activities which can have a clear and permanently positive impact on the local community, nationally or in regard to Greenland's reputation is also a natural part of our social responsibility.  ACTIONS That is the reason why TELE-POST supports several charities, such as nationwide collections and other services where our core qualifications and competences are useful. The most recent large-scale initiative is our involvement in Arctic Page 5 of 17 Winter Games 2016 in Nuuk where we are one of the principal sponsors. For this purpose we are setting out a volunteer policy aimed at ensuring guidelines for the company's volunteer efforts. TELE-POST also organises the DHL TELE-POST inter-company relay race in Nuuk to the benefit of all businesses and their employees in our community. This day gives employees the a chance to combine exercise with inter-company social interaction. In 2014, 800 runners distributed on 160 teams took part, and in 2015 this number had increased to over 1,000 runners distributed on 216 teams. So this event is the biggest popular event in Greenland today focussing on exercise and health. In continuation of this, TELE-POST wants to fan out the relay concept to other towns in Greenland, and in 2015, a small-scale, yet highly successful event, was held in Aasiaat. TELE-POST also supports local community activities, such as the culture night where many employees contribute to giving the locals some interesting cultural experiences. Current initiatives Future initiatives  Arctic Winter Games  Volunteer policy  Nationwide collections  DHL TELE-POST relay race  Local community initiatives  PURCHASES AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT We are aware that our accountability does not only encompass TELE-POST but also our suppliers and sub-contractors. In future we will endeavour to make sure that our suppliers measure up to our CSR policy in terms of ethical, social and environmental aspects. As a result of this TELE-POST will evolve a Code of Conduct specifying demands of our suppliers' responsibility. OBJECTIVES 2015-2016 Training and education  Trainees should make up minimum 7.5% of our workforce Digital welfare  The marine cable is to be extended to Aasiaat operative in November 2016  New high-speed chain to Ilulissat operative in November 2016  Extension of the radio chain to Upernavik  Be a party to one digital welfare project IT security  Establish an in-house IT security course for relevant employees  Security packages Local involvement  One community developing project to be implemented  Work out volunteer policy Page 6 of 17 EMPLOYEE RIGHTS TELE-POST EMPLOYEE FACTS Number of employees:  485 Percentage by gender:  Men 62%  Women 38% Nationalities  11 Average period of  10 years service: Average age:  50 years Percentage of  6.9% trainees: TELE-POST'S APPROACH To most businesses in Greenland it comes natural to view themselves as part of the surrounding community and shoulder responsibility to their employees. This also applies to TELE-POST. Our approach thus involves both the domains in which TELE-POST by law or by virtue of our role are expected to take responsibility as well as domains where we want to shoulder further responsibilities proactively. Thanks to having just below 500 employees TELE-POST is an internationally oriented workplace. Currently we have 11 different nationalities and a big demand for highly specialized labour. As a community Greenland is still facing big challenges in terms of raising our skill base. This means that we cannot in all instances recruit local specialists and managers. As one of Greenland's biggest and most important businesses we nevertheless want to reflect the composition of Greenland's population. We are therefore focussing on local anchoring for the purpose of being able to employ local labour to a greater extent at all levels of our organisation. Furthermore, we are also aware that women are under-represented in our company, both at staff and executive level and particularly in top management. As a result of this, TELE-POST wants to increase the share of women in management, including women with top manager potentials. FOCUS AREAS  DIVERSITY TELE-POST works with diversity through a formulated and approved diversity policy. This policy is revised annually and has resulted in a number of specific and measurable initiatives. By working strategically with these initiatives, we ensure that our employees' qualifications and competences are varied and put to use. In compliance with our general strategy, this is intended to contribute to creating the most attractive workplace in Greenland. Page 7 of 17 TELE-POST wants to promote a more equal distribution of men and women, including strengthening the recruitment of women for executive posts. For this reason we want to strengthen the company's in-house and locally anchored recruitment base to give us a diversified recruitment process on the way to executive posts.  ACTIONS To ensure that employees' qualifications and competences are used optimally we have established goal-oriented talent programmes. Both in 2013 and 2014 did we start up talent teams, and also in the coming years do we expect to complete one talent team of 8-12 persons every year. As from 2016 we will analyse earlier partners' further career tracks after participating in the talent programme. On an individual basis, new and coming executives will have the opportunity to participate in a mentor programme and thus have individual sparring from a more experienced executive. In order to promote diversity within management, a network for TELE-POST's women executives and management trainees was launched in 2015 for the purpose of encouraging women with management talents to pursue a management career in TELE-POST. To ensure diversity within the supplier chain we work to streamline our purchasing process. In the course of 2015, we will conclude our purchasing policy which is to ensure that TELE-POST uses the optimum suppliers and focusses as broadly as possible on locally anchored suppliers. Current initiatives Future initiatives  Talent programmes  Assessment of career tracks  Mentor programmes  Women's networks  Diversified recruitment process  Diversified selection of suppliers  EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT TELE-POST works with two general objectives. One is about TELE-POST as a workplace, the other about employee motivation and ability to create good results. By working with these objectives we make sure that we retain skilful and competent employees who are continuously developing and make TELE-POST one of the best workplaces in Greenland.  ACTIONS Since 2014, TELE-POST has run a competence development programme which all employees go through. Generally, everyone taking part expressed great satisfaction with the benefits they have gained from these courses, and customer satisfaction with the service level and employees' qualifications and competences are at a high level. Moreover we tightly focus on the development of in-house talents among our employees as we believe that this contributes to building a good working environment alongside creating results for the individual. So job rotation is open for any employees wanting to have this opportunity. Page 8 of 17 In order to ensure a dialogue about the past year's performance and challenges, TELE-POST works with a PLUS concept (planning and development interviews) which focus on the individual employee's job satisfaction and development opportunities in the organisation. We work with the idea of making this tool web-based as it may benefit both managers and employees to collect and keep this information. As we are a high-tech company we need to attract strong skills from all parts of the world. Our employees' qualifications and competences and insight into the trends within the telecommunications industry must be kept upto-date all the time. So in 2015-2016 we expect to establish at least two exchange contracts with other telecom operators. The interest in these agreements will be measured both internally in TELE-POST and among the staff of other telecom operators. Current initiatives Future initiatives  Sassarit  Web-based PLUS concept  PLUS concept  Exchange agreements  Job rotation opportunities  WORKING ENVIRONMENT TELE-POST wants to ensure a sound working environment for our employees. This also applies to our supplier chain where we disapprove of any unethical business procedures, such as forced labour and child labour. It is our employees that make up our business. For that reason it is our ambition to ensure our employees good and responsible working conditions. And for that reason we have over time worked proactively to enhance the health-at-work conditions. TELE-POST focuses on three elements to ensure a good working environment: health, safety and job satisfaction.  ACTIONS HEALTH Every third year we work out workplace assessments to ensure that working conditions are lawful in terms of ergonomics, but we want to make an extra effort. This means that we have launched some initiatives in recent years to make it easier to be healthy and fit. Besides joining fitness events, such as volleyball, football, spinning, yoga and skiing days, our staff association has for instance also established exercise rooms in several towns, discount schemes at fitness centres, and a slimming club where our employees are offered professional guidance to loose the extra kilos and change their dietary habits. Moreover, we offer quit smoking courses twice a year. Current initiatives Future initiatives  Workplace assessments  We expect to carry on with all ongoing  Wholesome canteen scheme initiatives, and relevant new activities will  Exercise rooms be established in a dialogue between  Quit smoking courses employees and management.  Fitness events Page 9 of 17  SAFETY In 2014, TELE-POST experienced five minor work-related injuries. Considering the size and practise of our business, we are indeed proud to have only five minor injuries. We are working towards creating a safe and secure working environment for our employees. By way of example: we have established a working environment organisation consisting of a safety committee and a number of safety teams that join efforts in watching safety and health features to prevent problems from arising. Some of our employees work high up in masts and pylons, so it is crucial that all these people feel safe and know how to rescue an injured person from a mast, if need be. These employees will consequently have to take a specific rescue course, and their certificates have to be renewed regularly. Current initiatives Future initiatives  Workplace assessment  We expect to carry on with all ongoing  Safety committee initiatives, and relevant new activities will be  Safety teams established in a dialogue between  Rescue course for employees working in employees and management. masts/pylons.  JOB SATISFACTION TELE-POST performs an annual employee satisfaction poll. The company’s score is benchmarked against comparative industries in Denmark and scores from companies in other business sectors in Greenland. In 2014 TELE-POST averaged a score of 79 (scale 0-100), which was 12-14 points higher than comparative industry averages in Denmark, and 4 points higher than the average amongst participating Greenlandic companies. We are proud and value that our employees generally have a high degree of job satisfaction. The poll gives rise to general initiatives to promote job satisfaction as well as specific initiatives at departmental level. The company encourages employees to take part in the poll, and each year we record response rates around 90%. In 2014 it was 88%. We place importance on both employee satisfaction polls and workplace assessments as this gives us increased insight into both the mental and physical working environments. TELE-POST's staff policy is meant to ensure that conditions in the workplace comply with our values: Zeal, accountability, pride, innovative thinking and marketing spirit. We have a manual to prevent and effectively handle workplace bullying and stress coaching is available to employees experiencing symptoms of stress. We want our employees to feel safe, both now and in future. For that reason TELE-POST offers all employees a health insurance which is valid both for work and private purposes; and as from 2015 everyone will be covered by the compulsory pension scheme. Page 10 of 17 TELE-POST respects employees' right to organize and have collective bargaining in that we recognize trade unions and formal works committees between management and employees. In relevant domains TELE-POST follows the public agreements and other agreements between Naalakkersuisut and our employees' respective trade organisations Current Future  Employee satisfaction poll  Implementation of compulsory pension scheme  Workplace assessment  Collective bargaining agreements  Works committees  Stress coaching  Pension scheme & health insurance  Staff manual OBJECTIVES 2015-2016 Diversity  Completion of ongoing talent team courses  Analysis of the career track of earlier talent teams  Three ongoing mentor courses by the end of 2016  More women in management  Analysis of women with executive posts against a background of women's networks Employee development  The Sassarit courses must be measurable through increased customer satisfaction  Establishment of minimum two exchange contracts with other telecom operators  PLUS concept to be web-based Working environment  Response rate in employee satisfaction poll over 90% Page 11 of 17 CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT Global Compact principles 7-9 7. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; 8. undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and 9. encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. TELE-POST'S APPROACH The Greenland ice sheet covers 81% of the surface of Greenland, and the population of 56,000 spreads out along the stretch of several thousand kilometres of coast. This presents us with huge challenges as to ensuring the general infrastructure which is fundamental for a coherent modern community. Supply routes are primarily by air or ship which means an immense usage of fuel. Add to this that the cold and variable climate also affects the emission of greenhouse gasses as the dark and long winters mean a great demand for heating and lighting. As our business is to ensure mail, information technology and communication, the harsh environmental conditions also affect our operations. The costs of operating in the Arctic regions often involve costly technology with an adverse impact on the environment. So it is a deliberate choice on TELE-POST's part when we prioritize our responsibility for securing supplies to our community in preference to the goal of saving on energy. Bearing this in mind we naturally endeavour to exercise accountability and sustainability in our approach to the climate and the environment, and we intend to focus more on this aspect in future. FOCUS AREAS  RECYCLING/RE-USE & CLEAN-UP TELE-POST wants to promote the recycling and re-use of materials as this will reduce the unnecessary usage of depletable resources and the emission of climate gasses. For this reason we recycle or re-use whenever possible. Where parts and components cannot be recycled or re-used we take care to clean up in a responsible way every time.  ACTIONS Parts which can be recycled or reused are taken to the nearest town or centre and stored in one of the depots assigned by the local authority. By way of example: in the most recent upgrading of the radio chain we tailored the project so it was possible to reuse all the antennas and satellite dishes. Page 12 of 17 When reuse is not possible, we clean up the site. However, in earlier times this was not general practice; so in 2013 we started cleaning up on all our sites. So far this process has been completed on all sites between Nuuk and Sisimiut, and these efforts will be continued in 2015 and the coming years. When we work at the different sites all combustible, non-polluting waste materials are incinerated on site whenever this is considered to be the least damaging to the environment. Alternatively, we would have to lift out by helicopter in many wild locations thus using fossil fuels which is deemed to result in even higher contamination of the environment. Waste which contains non-degradable materials is removed and destroyed safely or placed in a controlled landfill. TELE-POST has clear procedures for the management of waste; and our suppliers are subject to our waste management guidelines. Current initiatives Future initiatives  Re-use of antennas and satellite dishes.  Continuation of clean-up  Clean-up procedures  Establish procedures so cleaning/recycling/reuse is part of planning in all site development projects.  ENERGY REDUCTIONS TELE-POST is conscious of the challenges to the climate and the environment. We want to protect the environment proactively by reducing any of our operations that adversely affect the environment. We also want to affect the environment of our community indirectly by providing the right solutions in terms of technology. It is also in our own interest to minimize the usage of power at our radio chain sites as the production of power in these locations is both a climate threat and very expensive. Energy usage over the entire lifetime of the equipment is thus assigned a very high priority, when we select our technology.  ACTIONS For many years, TELE-POST has produced energy from sustainable energy sources. We particularly apply photovoltaics which automatically power up when the charging of the cells exceeds consumption. This means a reduced draw on diesel and kerosene powered generators. Photovoltaic energy accounts for about 25% of our aggregate energy consumption in wild sites where the climatic load from producing power from fossil sources is highest. Up through the years we have made many attempts and gained much experience with wind energy and today we have one proper functioning vertical-axis wind turbine in East Greenland. Unfortunately, it is difficult to put this renewable energy to sufficient use due to the harsh climatic conditions; but this does not mean that we have ceased our attempts. Page 13 of 17 Current initiatives Future initiatives  Solar cell plants.  Establishment and maintenance of solar cell  1 wind turbine plants to a relevant extent at all sites where fossil energy is otherwise used.  TRANSPORT OPERATIONS TELE-POST also affects the environment by transporting products and people. For this reason we are continuously on the look out for solutions to minimize this type of environmental impact. One of the domains where our core competences within communication technology make a difference is particularly in regard to minimizing travelling; not only for TELE-POST's employees but also for those of other businesses, for instance by establishing suitable telecom solutions, including video-conferencing facilities. Beyond that, we make a point of purchasing with the minimum impact on the climate by streamlining on freight and encouraging our suppliers to sustainable development and cleaner technology.  ACTIONS Due to the long distances within Greenland there is a high demand for faster and more environmentally friendly alternatives to flying. TELE-POST provides video and tele-conference solutions which is available to everyone for longdistance meetings and the like. Just as we make an effort to reduce employee travelling, we attempt to make purchases that will minimize our carbon footprint from transporting the purchased products. This means that we always make sure that containers are packed optimally. Current initiatives Future initiatives  Video and tele conferencing solutions.  No specific future initiatives have been  Minimizing on freight. identified in this domain.  LOCAL ENVIRONMENT TELE-POST wants to contribute to a cleaner environment. That is why we encourage our employees to play an active role when we take part in local environmental projects.  ACTIONS For this reason we have taken part in Saligaatsoq since 2011. This is a joint, annual environmental project uniting businesses and organisations for the purpose of building positive awareness of the importance of protecting our environment. With every year, Saligaatsoq grows bigger, and we make an effort to have more and more of our local departments contributed to launching initiatives in their local communities. Page 14 of 17 Current initiatives Future initiatives  Saligaatsoq.  Contribution towards establishing local environmental projects in several towns. OBJECTIVES 2015 2016 Recycling/Re-use & clean-up  The management and recycling/reuse aspects will have been elucidated in all site development projects by the end of 2016. Energy reductions  TELE-POST has set up specific objectives within this domain. Transport  TELE-POST has set up specific objectives within this domain. Local environment  Participation in several local environment projects Page 15 of 17 ANTI-CORRUPTION Global Compact principle 10 10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. TELE-POST'S APPROACH Corruption is defined as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. This concept can be seen as a collective term denoting various negative acts which adversely affect both our community, the business and its reputation. For businesses anti-corruption activities is a matter of how to handle and avoid getting into situations where corruption may play a part. TELE-POST is high-ranking in our community. With this rank follows responsibility. In our purchases we will therefore proactively and continuously form contracts with local and global suppliers. We will ensure free and transparent competition in compliance with good business ethics. In this way we can avoid questionable cases and business deals formed on an illegal basis. FOCUS AREAS  INCREASED TRANSPARENCY TELE-POST does not accept unethical business practices. This also applies to partnerships with our suppliers.  ACTIONS TELE-POST finds that all purchases and buying behaviour must comply with good business practice. In our future purchasing policy and anti-corruption policy, if applicable, we will consequently lay down guidelines for how to handle gifts. The purpose of this is to ensure that no employees are directly or indirectly in doubt of TELE-POST's approach to good business ethics. Another way of making sure that no employee is in doubt about the identity of unethical business practice is to start anti-corruption training for those with supplier contacts and other employees in exposed positions. In order to ensure orderly conditions, TELE-POST has set up a centralized purchasing function which is to ensure that decisions regarding purchases and the selection of suppliers is done through several decision makers. TELE-POST has acceded to the Transparency International Greenland principles. By doing so we support this work with increased transparency in our community, including trade and industry. By doing so our business naturally pays attention to fighting corruption. However, in future we want to have a more strategic and structured approach to anti-corruption. A legislative process has been started in Greenland for the purpose of making it legal for businesses to establish whistle-blower systems. Once the legal framework has been set Page 16 of 17 up, it will also make sense for TELE-POST to implement a system which makes it safe for employees to report any unacceptable conditions. Current initiatives Future initiatives  Accession to the Transparency International  Whistle-blower system once it is lawfully Greenland principles. possible.  Gift and anti-corruption policies.  Training in duties and rights. OBJECTIVES 2015-2016 Increased transparency  Implementation of gift and anti-corruption policies before the end of 2016.  Anti-corruption training of employees. Page 17 of 17
