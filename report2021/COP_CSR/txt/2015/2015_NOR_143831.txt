The Group has no fixed-income securities classified as available for sale. Total pre-tax currency positions 26 669 14 111 Seen overall, the interest rate risk is limited for the Group since a high proportion is invested in long-term bonds (securities classified as held Total currency positions after tax 19 468 10 301 to maturity or loans and receivables) and lending with fixed interest rate at amortized cost. For securities with the characteristics described, change in the market interest rate is not therefore reflected in the income statement. Interest rate guarantee, which is the guaranteed return life companies with defined benefit schemes are obliged to give their customers, is sensitive to changes in market interest rate. The ability to fulfil this obligation is weakened gradually as the general interest rate level falls, since a substantial part of the return rests on the current incomes the life companies receive from debt instruments and lending. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway also has authority to change this base interest rate for new contracts, which releases the company of a small burden in the event of lasting low interest rate levels. 108 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 4 NOT ES TO T H E ACCOU N TS K L P GROU P 109 Note 12 Currency risk, continued Note 13 Credit risk 31.12.2013 Financial position Translation Net position in 31.12.2014 Public Tototal statement items excl.

The Group may thus apply for cover for unpaid demands in this industry from the security arrangement if the demand falls within the security arrangement’ s regulations. 112 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 4 NOT ES TO T H E ACCOU N TS K L P GROU P 113 Note 15 Mortgage loans and other lending Local State and local Private Employees, Total Total NOK millions 2014 2013 government authority owned organizations pensioners 31.12.2014 31.12.2013 Individual write-downs on loans at amortized cost NOK millions administration enterprises ¹ and enterprises ² and similar Number of loans 8 11 Akershus 2 185 342 221 2 209 4 958 5 033 Aust-Agder 585 4 15 160 763 461 Total principal before write-downs 5.03 1.67 Buskerud 4 444 2 599 301 704 8 049 6 576 Write-downs 1.26 1.45 Finnmark 1 386 205 1 166 1 758 1 591 Total principal after write-downs 3.58 0.22 Hedmark 2 493 54 88 440 3 075 2 784 Individual write-downs Hordaland 1 923 677 462 1 017 4 079 2 274 Møre og Romsdal 3 033 695 322 558 4 609 4 314 Write-down on individual loans 01.01. 1.46 1.23 Nordland 2 379 289 151 440 3 259 3 228 Known losses for the period where individual write-down has been carried out previously -0.84 -0.02 Nord-Trøndelag 1 008 18 31 140 1 197 1 103 Write-down on individual loans for the period 1.14 0.29 Oppland 1 370 142 30 293 1 835 1 741 Reversal of write-down on individual loans for the period -0.50 -0.03 Oslo 0 508 353 1 885 2 746 2 697 Write-down on individual loans 1.26 1.46 Rogaland 3 204 175 25 1 016 4 421 4 053 Sogn og Fjordane 1 926 74 72 160 2 233 2 282 Sør-Trøndelag 4 683 151 817 642 6 293 4 554 Overdue, not written down Telemark 644 105 559 229 1 537 1 537 2014 2013 NOK millions Remaining debt Remaining debt Troms 1 831 98 182 468 2 578 2 621 Vest-Agder 690 92 16 220 1 018 966 Overdue Vestfold 2 233 251 61 796 3 341 3 291 30-90 days 37 86 Østfold 1 877 206 49 1 088 3 220 2 899 over 90 days 51 30 Svalbard and Jan Mayen 58 26 0 0 84 6 Total overdue loans 87 116 International 0 0 5 209 0 5 209 844 Not allocated 0 0 0 0 59 3 The numbers are absolute figures, the amounts are given in NOK million.

Thus the financial position statement has contained a liability item that should have been reclassified. This was corrected during the fourth quarter. The effect on comprehensive income in total is nil (increased income from property ascribed to the insurance customers), whereas in the financial position statement it has been reclassified from a liability to life insurance technical reserves. 114 A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 4 NOT ES TO T H E ACCOU N TS K L P GROU P 115 Note 17 Investments in associated companies and joint ventures Note 18 Subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities NOK millions OE on AcquiProfit/ 2014 Loan amount Loan amount Book value Office and Holding first sition Book value Additions/ Value loss Equity Book value NOK millions currency NOK 31.12.2014 Due date business address % acquisition cost 31.12.13 disposals adjustment share¹ transaction 31.12.14 Borrowings ¹ Norfinance AS Støperigata 2 October 1997 JPY 9 500 554 599 Perpetual 0250 OSLO 20 % 92.3 102.5 0.0 102.5 10.4 0.0 0.0 112.9 April 2006 EUR 300 2 372 2 825 Perpetual Norsk Pensjon AS ¹ Hansteens gate 2 Total subordinated loan capital 2 926 3 423 0253 Oslo 25 % 20.0 5.0 4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 Fylkeshuset, Molde AS ² Fylkeshuset, Julsundvn. 9, April 2004 JPY 15 000 984 1 253 Perpetual 6400 Molde 48 % 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Total hybrid Tier 1 securities 984 1 253 KLP Norfund Investments AS, Støperigata 2 0250 OSLO 50 % 0.1 101.7 31.3 70.4 26.5 0.0 2.8 131.0 Total subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities 3 911 4 676 Total shares in associated companies 209.3 35.4 172.9 37.0 0.0 2.8 248.0 All shares have equal voting proportions. 2013 Loan amount Loan amount Book value NOK millions currency NOK 31.12.2013 Due date Financial information on associated companies Borrowings ¹ NOK millions Assets Liabilities Income Profit/loss October 1997 JPY 9 500 554 552 Perpetual April 2006 EUR 300 2 372 2 599 Perpetual 2014 Total subordinated loan capital 2 926 3 151 Norfinance AS 569.2 59.9 5.6 6.8 Norsk Pensjon AS 17.3 0.9 9.0 0.1 April 2004 JPY 15 000 984 919 Perpetual Fylkeshuset, Molde AS 166.1 164.0 23.9 2.0 Total hybrid Tier 1 securities 984 919 KLP Norfund Investments AS 218.4 8.2 0.0 -1.9 Total subordinated loan capital and hybrid Tier 1 securities 3 911 4 070 2013 Norsk Pensjon AS 17.1 0.7 10.3 0.3 JPY 9 500: The interest on the loan is fixed at 4.0 per cent p.a.

Hybrid Tier 1 securities in foreign currency with fixed interest The hybrid Tier 1 securities loan is hedged against changes in interest rates and exchange rates through purchase of a combined interest rate and currency swap (CIRCUS). The hedging is brought to account in accordance with the rules on fair value hedging. In practice the hedging involves a swap of currency terms (JPY 15 billion against NOK 0.984 billion) and interest terms (fixed interest at 5.07 per cent against NIBOR +2.6475 per cent) on the borrowing and the combined interest and currency swap respectively. The hedge effectiveness is measured by looking at the change in fair value of the hedged object and the hedging instrument. The hedge effectiveness is valued retrospectively each month and is then considered effective if the change in fair value between hedged object and hedging instrument lies within the bracket 80 per cent to 125 per cent. Lending with fixed interest The hedging of lending is done with an interest rate swap in which the Group pays variable and receives fixed. The hedging is brought to book in accordance with the rules on fair value hedging and the purpose of this hedging is to hedge the interest-rate risk on the lending. The hedged object and the hedging instrument are struck on the same terms and conditions. The hedge effectiveness is measured by comparing accumulated value change on the hedging instrument to accumulated value change on the hedged object. The hedge effectiveness is assessed retrospectively each month and is then considered effective if the change in fair value between hedging object and hedging instrument lies within the bracket 80 per cent to 125 per cent. Covered bonds (CB) with fixed interest The hedging instrument is an interest rate swap where the Group pays variable interest and receives fixed interest. The hedgig is brought to book in accordance with the rules on fair value hedging and the purpose of this hedging is to hedge the interest-rate risk on the borrowing. The hedged object and the hedging instrument are struck on the same terms and conditions. Principal, interest, duration and interst dates are identical. The hedging effectiveness is measured by comparing accumulated value change on the hedging instrument to accumulated value change on the hedged object. The hedging effect is valued retrospectively each month and is then considered effective if the change in fair value between hedging object and hedging instruments lies within the bracket 80 per cent to 125 per cent. General Fair value hedging means that the hedged value development of the hedged object is recognized through profit or loss. Correspondingly the value change on the hedging instrument is recognized in profit/loss.

The management is responsible for the selection of the information, collection of data and presentation of the Non-financial Accounts. Tasks and Responsibility of the Auditor Based on our work, our task is to issue an independent statement on the Non-financial Accounts. We have performed our controls and issue our statement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information. Within the scope of this standard, we have planned and carried out procedures to obtain limited assurance that the Nonfinancial Accounts are free of material misstatement, and that the Non-financial Accounts are prepared in accordance with the criteria. Our work includes the following activities:  Interviews with representatives responsible for the different areas in the Non-financial Accounts and evaluation of processes  Assessment of routines and internal control related to reporting of Non-financial Accounts  Collection and review of documentation supporting the data presented in the Non-financial Accounts  Evaluation of completeness and accuracy of the reported figures We consider that our work provides an appropriate basis to conclude with a limited level of assurance on the Non-financial Accounts. Conclusion Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention giving us reason to believe that the information in the Non-financial Accounts includes material misstatements, nor that the Nonfinancial Accounts does not comply with the criteria.

public sector 2 27 rate and currency swap (CIRCUS). The hedging is recognized in accordance with the rules on fair value hedging. This means that the Group life 17 9 hedging is carried out by an external party, that a formal earmarking and documentation of the hedge relationship is entered into, as well Number of contracts is that it is expected to be very effective and that this is continuously reviewed, as well as that the recognition decided is carried out as Group pension public sector 15 24 described below. In practice the hedging involves a swap of currency terms (JPY 15 billion JPY against NOK 0.984 billion) and interest Group life 80 107 terms (fixed interest at 5.07 per cent against NIBOR +2.6475 per cent) on the borrowing and the combined interest and currency swap respectively. The hedge effectiveness is measured by looking at the change in fair value of the hedged object and the hedging instrument. The hedge effectiveness equals 100 per cent. The hedge effectiveness is valued retrospectively each month and is then considered effective if the change in fair value between hedged object and hedging instrument lies within the bracket 80 per cent to 125 per cent. Fair value hedging means that the hedged value development of the hedged object is recognized through profit or loss. Correspondingly the value change on the hedging instrument is recognized through profit or loss.The aim of the hedging arrangement above is to hedge the hedged object with a hedging instrument in which the hedging instrument’s terms give negative correlation in relation to the hedged object: this significantly reduces or eliminates the effect on income. If the hedging ratio is 100 per cent the net effect on income of the hedged object and the hedging instrument will be 0. KLP uses hedging widely but the majority of instances are ordinary financial hedging. The above item is the only one in which hedge accounting is used. The aim of financial hedging is the same, i.e. to reduce or eliminate the effect on income the hedged part of the hedge relationship represents. Since the value change on the hedged object and the hedging instrument is approximately 100 per cent negatively correlated to the hybrid Tier 1 securities, the profit/loss effect will be approximately nil.
