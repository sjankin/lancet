Strategy and analysis 1.1 Two events that occurred in the life of the UBI Banca Group in 2014 are of particular STATEMENT OF THE significance to us. In September the UBI Banca share was admitted to the FTSE4Good Global CHAIRMEN and FTSE4Good Europe indexes, one of the most important families of ethical indexes at global level, and in November we received the “Italian Bank of the year” prize awarded by the Financial Times Group periodical The Banker (the first international acknowledgement received by our Group). These are two events to be seen together, because they are two sides of the same coin. They are recognition of the Group’s great efforts to manage its business in a sustainable and socially responsible manner by integrating its economic and financial strategies and goals with consideration of risks and opportunities of a social and environmental nature. While The Banker places the accent on the results achieved in shoring up the balance sheet, lowering the risk profile, controlling costs and innovating products (all of which are fully confirmed in the sequence of consolidated financial statements), the FTSE assessments focus on the way in which the results were achieved and on the conditions, and the governance conditions above all, which make it possible to project them in the medium to long-term (subject to disclosure in the Social Report). The reduction in operating expenses (achieved for the sixth consecutive year in the presence of substantial investments, mainly to develop business) and the sound capital ratios acquire even more significance in light of social responsibility indicators: for example the increase in the already high level of customer satisfaction (94% of customers satisfied in the last annual survey); investments in the training, development and care of human resources (fundamental in the search for excellence in the quality of products and services); the huge efforts made for the economic and social development of our local communities (ranging from anti-crisis initiatives to the depth of our commercial relationships with nonprofit organisations, the success of social bonds, financial education activities, large donations to social welfare causes). While normalised profit itself recorded strong growth compared with last year, it assumes even greater value if it is seen in the context of the economic value created, a broader measure of the Group’s ability to generate wealth not only for shareholders but also for all the other stakeholders. Room for improvement certainly exists, especially in environmental aspects of operations, both to further reduce the direct impacts and by adding to the criteria employed in processes to assess the credit ratings of businesses, investments and procurement (including aspects of the supply chain). If we now shift our gaze from the Group to the sector as a whole, we see two important events for Banks that occurred in 2014 and at the beginning of this year. The first event was the start-up, on 4th November, of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, following a complex and in-depth exercise to assess the balance sheets of banks (the “Comprehensive Assessment”) on figures as at the 31st December 2013, which consisted of an 1 Social Report 2014 Strategy and analysis “Asset Quality Review” (AQR) and a stress test to analyse the resilience of balance sheets under conditions of particularly adverse scenarios. Our Group arrived at this appointment well prepared. In fact the results of the Comprehensive Assessment, announced on 26th of October 2014, highlighted the soundness of the Group’s capital strength at all stages of the exercise, with capital significantly in excess of the minimum thresholds required, which confirmed the quality of the valuation and operational processes in use. The second event was the reform of the legislation on “popular” co-operative banks, which makes it compulsory for those, like us, which have total assets on their balance sheets of greater than €8 billion, to transform into joint stock companies. The transformation into a joint stock company is a step which could impact the ownership structure of the Bank and could require a revision of some governance mechanisms and the search for new balances between the expectations of different stakeholders. The UBI Banca Group has also arrived at this step under the best conditions. Not only is it solid and efficient, but it has strong traditions in terms of values and links, with well established relationships with stakeholders and a management style consistent with its well-defined role as a driving force for the social and economic development of local communities. These conditions commit us to considering today’s results, achieved in such difficult times, as a stepping stone towards new goals. We must see this change as an opportunity to be grasped, to strengthen the integrated governance of social responsibility and planning rooted in a desire to “Fare Banca Per Bene” (bank fairly and bank well), along the lines of a corporate culture and operational and management criteria based on the commitment, which is also a moral commitment, of those who work to develop the Bank. To be increasingly more sustainable and socially responsible is not an imposition, but a choice consistent with the principles of our Code of Ethics and with the principles of the UN Global compact, which we have signed and which we are committed to promoting within our sphere of responsibility. It is an energy that runs through our plans, ideas and vision of a corporate governance which is strongly inclusive and oriented towards business success which will last over the years. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board The Chairman of the Management Board Andrea Moltrasio Franco Polotti 2 Social Report 2014 Strategy and analysis 1.2 UBI Banca’s Code of Ethics identifies the significant stakeholders of the Group, which are those KEY IMPACTS, RISKS “groups and individuals who are holders of specific interests on which UBI’s activities have effects AND OPPORTUNITIES and/or which contribute in various ways to UBI’s activity and its very existence.” Important issues and the relative risks and opportunities within the different areas of sustainability are considered for each category of stakeholder, account of which is taken in formulating policies and setting operating objectives. In the particularly difficult current economic environment, characterised by uncertainty which includes an expectation slow growth and a continued scenario of low interest rates far into the future, it is essential to give priority to financial and operating figures with a particular focus on levels of liquidity and capital and controlling costs. In relation to this commitment, the lines of action identified with regard to the sustainability of the 2011-2013/15 Business Plan, summarised in the table below, have been confirmed. They relate in particular to the prevention of reputational risk, which is particularly in evidence in the financial sector, and to grasping opportunities arising from the emergence of new concerns and demands of a social and environmental nature . These lines of action are currently subject to revision as part of a materiality analysis conducted by management to implement the transition to the new GRI-G4 guidelines. The evolving context and the performance of operations relating to social responsibility and sustainability strategies and objectives are monitored over time as part of the following: strategic planning processes; consultation and dialogue activities (e.g. customer satisfaction surveys); analysis of agency ratings and analysts and CSR investors’ opinions; and also monitoring of indicators calculated as part of the CSR reporting process in the Social Report.

Its market is divided into two major groups: SERVICES • the retail group, which comprises 97.7% of customers, consisting of individuals (“mass market” and “affluent market” segments on the basis of the financial wealth owned, up to €100 thousand and €500 thousand respectively) and all the small economic operators with turnover of up to €300 thousand (“small business” and “small economic operator” segments) and small to medium-size enterprises with turnover of less than €15 million (SME segment); • the private-corporate banking group, which includes individual customers with financial wealth greater than €500 thousand and businesses with turnover over €15 million. The “retail market” also includes Church and non-Church related non profit organisations (commonly referred to as the “third sector”), which has a dedicated commercial unit at the Parent, that operates under the brand name UBI Community. The commercial offering is designed to focus increasingly on customer demands, through the segmentation and specialisation of the service model and a focus on local specifics, with a broad range of banking, insurance, credit and savings products and services. In this context, the product range was updated and added to yet again in 2014 for all market segments with new products and services distinguished by their usefulness, flexibility and digital innovation, features which were underlined in commercial advertising publicity messages. [ Reports and Accounts 2014 p. 44-49, 54-59] 2.3 The UBI Banca Group is a multi-functional, federal and integrated group in which: OPERATIONAL • the functions of governance, control and co-ordination are centralised at the Parent, STRUCTURE which, through the subsidiary consortium company UBI Sistemi e Servizi, also manages IT activities and other support functions, while it manages all staff training activities through UBI Academy; • the local banks – termed Network Banks – fill the role of the distribution network, with their own brands each covering a specific local area. They are operationally independent, each with their own Board of Directors on which members representing local communities and economies predominate.

CONTENT The contents of the document – principally of a non-accounting nature – are therefore defined through a process of identifying the relevant subjects and issues which is based on both the recommendations of the GRI model and indications that have arisen in the course of dialogue with stakeholders and an analysis of articles in the press. In view of the coming adoption of the new G4 version of the GRI guidelines, an in-depth review of stakeholder priorities and relevant issues is in progress to define a “materiality matrix” as the new basis for formulating sustainability strategies and objectives.

UBI Banca has adopted a system in which governance 4.2 functions are divided between a Supervisory Board and a Management Board. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN Supervisory Board 4.3 INDEPENDENT While observing the principle of collegial responsibility in the performance of its duties, the AND/OR NONSupervisory Board has created specific internal committees with policy setting, advisory and factEXECUTIVE BOARD finding functions: an Appointments Committee, a Remuneration Committee, an Internal Control MEMBERS Committee, an Accounts Committee and a Related and Connected Parties Committee. All Supervisory Board Members are independent in accordance with article 148, paragraph 3 of the LA13 Consolidated Finance Act and twenty of their number are also independent in terms of the requirements of the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies. The Supervisory Board met 21 times in 2014 and the average length of the meetings was five hours with average attendance of 97%.

COMPENSATION AND PERFORMANCE The variable component of remuneration is mainly based on performance measurement (by incentive schemes), on both an annual and long-term basis in order to involve and orient staff towards medium to long-term strategies, by recognising the value of individual and team contributions. Measurement of performance is based primarily on operating and financial indicators consisting of capital and liquidity ratios (defined under the “Risk appetite framework of the UBI Banca Group” policy and the “Policy to Manage Financial Risks of the UBI Banca Group”) and risk-adjusted indicators of profitability. Specific additional objectives, both quantitative and qualitative, are identified in accordance with the activities carried out by each role. ESG indicators are not currently used except with regard to customer satisfaction.

Periodically each manager with key management roles in the Group is assessed by means of individual interviews conducted by a leading specialised firm (Egon Zehnder International) and receives feedback which forms part of individual career development plans designed to strengthen the quality of UBI Banca’s management. The firm provides an analysis of the strengths, areas for improvement and all round perception of each manager as well as a summary assessment of general potential and also specific potential for the selection of the best candidates for succession to the position of General Manager and/or Chief Executive Officer. The results of the “Senior Leadership Succession” process are discussed and validated by the Chairman of the Appointments Committee, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Senior Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board jointly with the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Management Board. In cases of early or unexpected substitution of the General Manager and/or Chief Executive Officer, these results represent a point of reference for decisions relating to new appointments and for the assessment of potential candidates. The Appointments Committee also evaluates the adequacy of succession plans while the boards are functioning for the senior positions on the Management Board and Senior Management, and the professional profiles and requirements of those currently holding office and any candidates there may be to succeed them. UBI Banca has also had a structured “Management Appraisal” process in place since 2009, designed to enhance the development of Group managers and to enable the selection of successors in the short and medium term for the key positions and/or for managers who report directly to the Chief Executive Officer and the General Manager. The “management appraisal” process is also conducted by Egon Zehnder International with methods, output and procedures similar to those described above for the “senior leadership succession” process. The results of the “management appraisal” process are validated by the Chief Executive Officer and by the General Manager and they are discussed with the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and with the Chairman and Senior Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

Therefore, EVALUATING THE because functional and effective assessment of the functioning of the boards and committees and HIGHEST of their size and composition can be carried out after an appropriate period of activity, a selfGOVERNANCE assessment process was commenced for both bodies in December 2013 for the years 2013, 2014 BODY’S OWN and 2015 – with indication of the action to be taken and the relative time periods – and a “peer PERFORMANCE review” system and process was formulated and put in place for 2014 and 2015. Reports and The Supervisory Board carried out a self assessment of the size, composition and functioning of the Accounts 2014 board itself and its internal committees with support from the firm Egon Zehnder. The selfp. 25**-28** assessment was carried out by means of an analysis carried out at meetings, on the basis of the results of a self-assessment questionnaire filled in by each board member, followed by individual interviews carried out by the consultant. The following were examined: • the quantitative and qualitative composition of the Board and its Committees, including 26 Social Report 2014 Governance, commitments and stakeholder engagement representation on it in terms of age and gender, the professional skills of board members in relation to the size of the Group and its activities, the level of diversity among the Board members in terms of professional, managerial and business experience; • the effectiveness of the functioning and the quality of board and internal committee meetings; • the quality and promptness of reporting and presentations and the effectiveness and efficiency of decision-making processes within the Board; • the clarity, agreement and satisfaction with regard to policies, performance and risk objectives and the results achieved; • relations with the Management Board and Senior Management. On conclusion of the self-assessment conducted, it was found that, taken as a whole, the proceedings of Board and Committee meetings, in terms of organisation, analysis of the issues, attendance at meetings and discussion, are key elements for the appropriate performance of the functions assigned to the Supervisory Board and its internal Committees. As at the start of its mandate in 2013, the Management Board carried out another self-assessment process relating to its size, composition and functioning in 2014, with the assistance of the consultant engaged. The self-assessment of the Management Board was specifically addressed and th discussed in the board meeting of 24 March 2014, in which it examined the results of a specific self-assessment questionnaire filled in by each board member, followed by individual interviews carried out by the consultant. The self-assessment questionnaire was carried out on the basis of assessment profiles similar to those used by the Supervisory Board. Together with useful ideas that came up which will further improve activities, it was found that the Board has a level of diversity in terms of professional managerial and business experience and that, taken as a whole, the proceedings of meetings, in terms of organisation, analysis of the issues and the participation of board members at meetings and in discussions, are key factors for the efficient and effective performance of the functions assigned to the Management Board.

Engagement activities are structured with consideration given to the intensity of the relationship and the breadth and urgency of the interests held by different stakeholders, in addition to the procedures laid down by specific legislation and regulations (e.g. Shareholders' Meetings, negotiations with trade unions) and established practice (e.g. investor relations).

Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector UBI Banca contributes to the sustainable development of the local communities in which it operates, with attention paid to the social and environmental repercussions of its activities. It achieves this through its credit and commercial policies, which consider the demands of all customer segments (socially vulnerable consumers and small to medium-sized enterprises in particular), through business innovation to satisfy new needs and development opportunities (e.g. services for nonprofit organisations in the community) and through specific policies to control and reduce social and environmental impacts (e.g. the Bank’s environmental policy and its armaments policy). All business policies and management approaches to the various economic, social and environmental issues that involve the financial sector are based on the principles and commitments to stakeholders defined in the Group’s Code of Ethics. Management approach FS1 UBI Banca has pursued an armaments Policy since 2007, which was updated in 2013. The revision ENVIRONMENTAL maintains the overall framework unchanged and refined exclusion criteria and procedures for the AND SOCIAL POLICIES assessment of countries for the authorisation of banking and financial transactions to support APPLIED TO BUSINESS additional international arms trading transactions carried out by Group customers. LINES The policy bans business relations with companies involved in the production, development, storage, marketing and/or sales of arms of mass destruction and other “controversial” weapons (e.g. mines) and it involves an authorisation regime, for transactions involving international trade in arms, based on the country of destination. It applies to all the Group’s activities – with the exception of asset management, where the investment decisions are made with reference to market benchmarks and therefore are not based on screening on specific issues – and it involves periodic assessment of the foreign countries to which arms are destined or from which they come, except for those belonging to the European Union to NATO and the OECD. The assessment of countries is carried out on the basis of criteria which consider not only international embargoes on arms, but also involvement in armed conflicts and/or the threat to security, peace and international security, violations of human rights perpetrated or tolerated by government authorities and the level of human development. The number and value of the transactions involving international trade in armaments carried out in 2014 was extremely negligible compared with Group volumes of business and they are disclosed by country and type of counterparty and weapon in the Report on the implementation of the policy on armaments for the year ended 31.12.2014 which is published in the social responsibility section of 1 the Group’s corporate website. A summary of transactions carried out in 2014 at Group level is as follows: • 103 transactions for the receipt of €22.8 million (down by 18.5% on 2013, after a reduction of 84.4% in 2013 on 2012) for arms exports in accordance with Law No. 185/1990 (98.0% and 50.8% of the exports to OECD and NATO countries respectively, the most to Australia); • 79 transactions for the receipt of €3.9 million (down by 57.0% on 2013 after an increase of 15.2% in 2013 over 2012) for exports of light arms and one transaction for €3,525 not carried out because not compliant with the policy (92.2% and 88.9% of the exports to OECD and NATO countries respectively, the most to the United States of America); No transactions have been performed as exceptions to the criteria of the policy since it was adopted. [ Policy for the management of transactions with counterparties operating in the arms and 1 The new legislation which came into force in 2013 repealed the law concerning requests by banks for authorisation to assist transactions involving international trade in armaments, which therefore no longer appear in the reporting, which leaves only a report of the transactions carried out. 31 Social Report 2014 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector weapons materials sector] No official policies are pursued with regard to other economic sectors with potential risk from a social and environmental point, or which are in any case considered critical by rating agencies and investors who adopt ethical criteria. Nevertheless, great attention is paid throughout the entire Group to avoid involvement in transactions which may present reputational risks, in compliance with general principles and rules of conduct in the management of relationships with customers contained in the Code of Ethics and the related Code of Conduct. 2 More specifically, with regard to business in the gaming and betting sector , the Credit Area of UBI Banca has invited the credit departments of the network banks to limit this business to a totally marginal level and to employ extremely rigorous conduct in assessing loan applications: parties operating in this sector must not only meet appropriate credit rating criteria, but must also be already known to and approved of by the Bank and satisfy criteria of absolute integrity, seriousness and reliability. 2014 2013 2012 CO N TR O VER SIAL SECTO RS LE NDI NG PE RC E NT AG E O F L EN DIN G PE RC E NT AG E O F L EN GIN G PE RC E NT AG E O F (mi li ons of E uro) T O T AL LO ANS ( milio n s of Eu ro ) T O T AL LO ANS ( milion s o f Eu ro ) T O T AL LO ANS Arms and weapons system 30.0 0.05% 34.5 0.06% 32.0 0.05% Tobacco 45.4 0.08% 48.4 0.08% 49.4 0.08% Alcohol 17.8 0.03% 27.0 0.04% 20.3 0.03% Furs 5.0 0.01% 5.5 0.01% 5.6 0.01% Gambling 12.0 0.02% 20.9 0.03% 18.6 0.03% Nuclear 0.00% TO TAL 1 1 0 .2 0 .1 9 % 1 3 6 .3 0 .2 2 % 1 2 5 .9 0 .2 0 % The 2012 data on the arms, tobacco and fur sectors have been adjusted as a result of a more accurate identification of the counterparties and industry codes (ATECO).

In consideration of the importance acquired by the third sector in meeting the needs of communities, especially for the delivery of welfare services to the disadvantaged, in 2012 UBI Banca created UBI Community, the new service model for nonprofit organisations (both Church and non-Church affiliated) to support the development of their activities. Relationships with nonprofit organisations are strategic both because of the positive returns in terms of reputation and links with local markets and because of commercial development in consideration of the substantial growth seen in the sector over the last two decades and which is likely to continue in future. Historically the Group holds a share of deposits from and loans to nonprofit organisations that is 5 higher than for the sector nationally . At the end of the year deposits totalled €1.7 billion (59.8% in Lombardy) with a market share of 7.2% (compared with a total sector market share of 3.4% for deposits) and €0.8 billion of loans (66.1% in Lombardy) with a market share of 8.5% (compared with a total sector market share of 4.6% for total loans).

Deposits are comprised of current accounts, deposits and certificates of deposit. 36 Social Report 2014 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector The Group’s commitment to the issuance of UBI Community social bonds continued during the year as part of a strategy to support the third sector (17 bonds issued in 2014 for a total €178 million which made it possible to make donations of €890 thousand). The smaller number of social bonds issued by Group banks is attributable mainly to the generalised fall in interest rates which made the subscription of bonds as instruments for investment less attractive to customers. The adoption of SROI (social return on investment) to structure UBI Banca’s social bonds is planned for 2015 in order to measure the social impact of the projects supported. On the one hand this will enable greater accountability to customers who subscribe bonds and to Group stakeholders more generally and on the other hand it will direct action to support initiatives that have a greater impact on change. [ Reports and Accounts 2014 p.49] With technical assistance from the Italian Association for the promotion of a co-operation and nonprofit culture (AICCON), UBI Banca continued its activity with the Observatory on finance and the third sector, established in 2011 by UBI Banca, to process and disseminate data annually on the financial requirements of the third sector. The latest edition of the observatory’s publication reported the results of a survey on a sample of non-banking foundations to investigate their financial needs and to analyse trends for social entrepreneurship compared with the first survey carried out in 2011. FS8 Alongside its commitment to reduce its direct impacts on the environment, the Group actively PRODUCTS AND supports and promotes virtuous behaviour by households and businesses by offering financing SERVICES WITH products dedicated to specific types of investment as follows: SPECIFIC • housing refurbishment and energy upgrades, with the benefit of tax incentives ENVIRONMENTAL (Creditopplà Home Refurbishment); BENEFIT • domestic photovoltaic panels, also with specific insurance cover (Forza Sole – sun strength); • industrial plant for the production of energy from renewable sources such as, solar power, wind power and biogas/biomass cogeneration plants. [ Reports and Accounts 2014 p.45,59] A strong slowdown occurred in investments in renewable energy in 2014 due to important changes in tax rules and incentives which made it less attractive, with a significant impact on financing transactions. The Bank maintained a large position in project finance business, with the finance of new projects, only partly in the renewable energy field, and supported refurbishment and rationalisation processes in progress in the sector. The three largest operations during the year financed the following projects: • Enel Green Power at Finale Emilia for a biomass power plant, a low environmental impact initiative assisted by supplies of biomass from the area immediately surrounding the plant (“no food” biomass cultivated within a radius of 50 km – “local supply” – resulting from the conversion of areas originally used for sugar beet crops); • TEA SpA for the redevelopment of the former Alfa Romeo industrial area at Varese with the construction of a large shopping centre, with a consequent substantial impact on employment; • Labo Gest srl to improve technical services at the Bologna Ospedale Maggiore Hospital with a consequent significant social impact. 37 Social Report 2014 Social and environmental aspects of the financial sector PR O JECT F IN AN CE ACTIVITIES 2014 2013 2012 F in an cin g g ran ted d u rin g th e year Numbers of contracts 16 16 20 of which for renewable energy 6 6 17 Amount authorised (€ milion) 349 400 332 of which for renewable energy 134 41 132 Amount disbursed (€ milion) 315 416 207 of which for renewable energy 103 36 122 F in an cin g o u tstan d in g at th e en d o f th e year Numbers of contracts 156 136 137 of which for renewable energy 120 112 111 Amount authorised (€ milion) 2,506 2,248 1,869 of which for renewable energy 1,330 1,263 1,094 Amount disbursed (€ milion) 1,928 1,744 1,489 of which for renewable energy 1,140 1,112 1,065 2014 2013 2012 PRO JECT F IN AN CE O PERATIO N S IN NO.

The adoption of the “IT Ordinance” by public administrations, designed to optimise operational relationships between authorities and treasury departments and make them more efficient has a positive impact from an environmental viewpoint, due to savings on paper that it can generate. In 2014 UBI Banca implemented a procedure affecting 628 customer relationships, either existing or about to be opened (+35% compared with 2013), which made it possible to transfer approximately 52% of the documents to automated processing procedures.

The Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi manages the purchasing cycle for Group companies in compliance with the provisions of the Group Spending Regulations. Regulations These regulations, which apply to all Group companies, govern the roles and responsibilities of those involved in managing budgets and incurring expenses with the separation of roles between those requesting supplies and authorising payments, those that sign contracts and handle negotiations with suppliers and those keeping the accounts and paying the invoices. In February 2015 staff responsible for purchasing (buyers) received a training course on “green procurement” [ FS4]. 42 Social Report 2014 Economic performance Selection of suppliers Suppliers are selected with care on the basis of cost, service quality and technical, commercial and financial reliability. The Code of Ethics states that where requirements are the same, preference is given to those suppliers who demonstrate the implementation implement of good practices of responsibility and/or possession of social or environmental certifications. Formal implementation of this policy in the internal regulations that govern purchasing management constitutes an improvement objective which wass also considered co in the training initiative mentioned above. To ensure the independence of suppliers, we seek to avoid the establishment of exclusive business relationships, or those characterised by excessive financial dependence on the Group (the total amount paid pa to each Group supplier must not exceed 25% of the supplier’s total turnover). Contractual conditions and terms of payment Contractual conditions and terms of payment are constantly updated to comply with the legislation in force and with market conditions conditions on the basis of periodical monitoring. Supplies which are not regular or for small amounts, and considered not strategic and which do not carry a high operational risk are regulated by the general conditions of a standard contract, while specific contracts tracts are drawn up for recurring, strategic supplies, which carry high operational risk or which are for large amounts. In 2014 the Group adhered to the “Italian “Italian Responsible Payments Code” Code” organised by Assolombarda (Lombard employers’ association). Companies Companies which adhere to the code are committed to compliance with terms and conditions contractually agreed for the payment of suppliers and, more generally, to spread a culture of efficient, prompt and rapid payment practices. At present Group suppliers have hav signed contracts which involve payment terms ranging from a minimum of on-receipt-of-invoice on up to a maximum of 120 days from the date of invoice (a very marginal proportion accounting for 0.17% of the total). The average supplier payment time in 2014 was approximately 39 days. All suppliers are required to fully comply with legislation and regulations to protect the rights of workers, which in particular means observation of national trade union agreements for the sector to which they belong and of pension, accident prevention and and insurance legislation along with specific legislation on health and safety. Additionally, when an order is placed or a contract is signed, all suppliers are required to comply with the principles of the Group’s Code of Ethics. Standard contract clauses provide for the power of UBI Sistemi e Servizi to verify or have verified by its agents – at any time and using the inspection procedures considered most appropriate – that the supply of goods or the provision of services is carried out and that this complies comp with the applicable legislation and regulations. They also provide for a commitment by the supplier to facilitate the exercise of these verification powers, by providing UBI Sistemi e Servizi with all the information required, including the documentation, documentation, written communications and/or documents needed to carry out appropriate controls. Supply chain chain The Group operates almost exclusively in Italy and 98.9% of purchases are from local suppliers, defined as suppliers supplie resident in Italy. Where possible and d appropriate, depending on the type of products or services, use is made of suppliers who operate in the vicinity of our single operating premises. Suppliers who provide goods and services to the Group on a regular basis or occasional suppliers who supply goods and services for amounts greater than €30,000 are registered on a list of approved suppliers managed by the Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi. The approved list contains preferred suppliers for each type of good and service, listed on the t basis of quality (50% weighting), competitiveness (25% weighting) and financial and capital soundness (25%) and we periodically assess them with the involvement of the offices requesting the supplies (budget managers), the Purchasing Department and an outsideoutside database. Suppliers of utility services (local water companies, gas companies), landlords of rented properties and institutional suppliers (e.g. Italian Banking Association and Consob Italian securities market authority) are excluded from managementment on the list of approved suppliers. 43 Social Report 2014 Economic performance Suppliers and purchases by amounts Purchases by type of good or invoiced service IT systems 100% 89.9% 4.7% 90% 6.0% Property management 80% 76.1% 5.9% 70% Other expenses 60% 33.6% 50% Professional services 11.9% 40% 30% Security 20% 10.2% 13.7% 7.5% Miscellaneous 10% 2.6% services 13.2% 0% Advertising Up to 50.000 euro From 50.000 to Over 250.001 euro 24.7% 250.000 euro No. suppliers Purchases At the end of 2014 suppliers on the list numbered 818 (+55 compared with 2013 as a result of 103 new suppliers and 48 removed from the list). Management of the supplier list and the vendor rating is supported by dedicated software that interfaces with the SAP accounting system. A vendor evaluation system is available to buyers in the Purchasing Department on the Corporate Intranet, which gives information on supplier ratings, classes of goods supported, figures on invoicing over the last three years, the amount of the orders in progress and an indicator of the dependence of the supplier on the Group. EC7 Personnel search and selection activity in 2014 regarded above all commercial roles for recruitment HIRING FROM LOCAL in the network banks, in order to implement generation turnover projects contained in Group PERSONNEL business plans. The approach followed therefore led mainly to the assessment of candidates who are resident in the local areas of the different banks concerned, in order to exploit their knowledge of the local community. The same orientation was also followed for the recruitment of young specialists and professionals by means of search and selection activity which benefited from constant co-operation with local schools, training institutes and universities. Six new senior managers were recruited in 2014, all in Lombardy where the headquarters and policy-setting and supervision activities of the Group are concentrated.

With the sponsorships, Group banks associate their brands with organisations and initiatives linked to the local communities in which they operate. Sponsorships or professional sports clubs are only included in the report if they are directed to activities to promote to the moral education of young people through sport. As concerns the selection of initiatives, the decisions are taken at local level by individual banks and foundations with the support of UBI Banca for the more far reaching initiatives, based not on rigid and predetermined policies and guidelines, but on assessments – based on criteria of consistency, efficiency and effectiveness – of the initiatives and projects found in the community. At UBI Banca, the allocation of budgets to the various sectors of intervention is made on the basis of an “Annual intervention plan” approved by the Supervisory Board on the basis of proposals formulated by the Chairman, subject to consultation with the Senior Deputy Chairman. The proposals and projects are drawn up in consultation also with the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and taking account of their recommendations. The foundations, which have been formed over the years to promote social and cultural development in their local communities, are totally independent in their decision-making, although this must be in compliance with the areas of intervention defined in their respective constitutions, and they are not subject to powers of management, co-ordination and control by UBI Banca. At the beginning of 2015, the Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria Onlus Foundation was formed, promoted by the bank of the same name, to pursue aims of social solidarity and with institutional objects of health and social welfare assistance and the protection, promotion and enhancement of things of artistic and historical interest in the Region of Lombardy and in the provinces of Milan and Pavia in particular. In 2014 the Group made total donations for Total Group donations for social 2 initiatives social initiatives of €11.0 million (-12.0% (thousands of euro) compared with 2013), of which: 6,000 4.882 • €3.3 million drawn from articles of 5,000 4.087 association-related reserves available 4,000 to management bodies for social 3,000 2.027 purposes (the “Board’s Fund”) of UBI 2,000 Banca and the network banks, net of 1,000 sums paid to Group Foundations (€808 0 Gifts Investments in the Commercial thousand); community initiatives for the community • €4.2 million as operating expenses of UBI Banca, the network banks and other Group companies, including charitable donations resulting from the placement of UBI Community Social Bonds [( FS7]; • €3.5 million by the Foundations.

All the issuances were fully subscribed, Public utility infrastructures normally before the end of the subscription University and research period, allowing €3.1 million to be donated to important social projects in the community. 545,000 € 61.2% In addition to welfare contributions there are also those made to local authorities for their social and institutional activities as part of treasury and collection services which totalled €3.3 million and contributions to Pro Solidar, a national fund in the credit sector for solidarity and charitable initiatives consisting of a bilateral entity managed by the Italian Banking Association and the national secretariats of the banking trade unions. ProSolidar is the first body in the world formed by a national trade union agreement and it is funded on an equal basis by workers and companies. Each employee may contribute a sum of €6 per year deducted directly from salary, against which the company pays in an equal amount. This gave a total of €193 thousand in 2014. Employees are also involved in the Enjoy Special Edition project, a current account card specially for them, with customised graphics and the possibility to support social and charitable activities through the donation of the POS commissions by the issuer Group banks. In 2014 the commissions on payment transactions made during the year using POS terminals were donated to the La Strada, La Bottega di Geppo charity project, voted first of five projects proposed in a survey of employees on the Group intranet UBILife. UBI Banca helps support major organisations and important national initiatives, or which in any event cover several areas, both independently and in co-operation with other Group banks. UBI Banca also takes action each year in the field of school and university education with a series of scholarship grants: a scholarship grant was awarded in 2014, in co-operation with the Human Foundation, to a young nonprofit entrepreneur to take part on a MHUSE course – “Master Human for Social Entrepreneurship”, organised by the Catholic University of Milan/Altis; two scholarship grants were funded for a Master course in “New Horizons in Co-operation and International Law” organised by FOCSIV (Federation of International Voluntary Bodies ) and the Pontifical Lateran University; a scholarship grant for a student in the fourth year of senior high school to study abroad with the Intercultura onlus Foundation. Mention must also be made in this respect of support for the “Experiential Workshops” project of the LIUC-Libero Istituto Universitario Carlo Cattaneo University which aims to integrate the knowledge offered by courses of study with high-level practical expertise, to make its graduate students more competitive on the labour market abroad. Important co-operation continued on cultural initiatives: with the Brescia and Bergamo International Pianoforte Festival for the fiftieth edition of the annual festival of the same name, entitled “Rachmaninov and Russia” (a special project which involved the new Festival Philharmonic 46 Social Report 2014 Economic performance Orchestra, with the introduction of very talented young musicians); with the Einaudi Study Centre for the preparation and presentation of the XIX Annual Report on the Global Economy and Italy coordinated by Professor Mario Deaglio and presented in the Group’s network banks with the objective of offering an initiative of national and international importance and at the same time of “localising” relationships, thanks to the involvement of local businesses; with the Cardinale Federico Borromeo Foundation to support the Venerable Ambrosian Library, for the promotion and diffusion of culture and art through educational, academic and research activities. Initiatives included the public exhibition of the Atlantic Code by Leonardo Da Vinci in Milan at the Ambrosian Library and in the Santa Maria delle Grazie Church. UBI Banca also took action to support the initiative “Intorno al Duomo”, with which the Archdiocese of Milan organised an exhibition in Duomo Square of the historical and most venerable cross of St Charles Borromeo containing the sacred nail of the cross of Christ, conserved at the summit of the apse of the cathedral, and also the organisation of appointments for the canonisation of the Blessed Popes John Paul II and John XXIII by the Diocese of Rome. In the field of scientific research, the Bank supported the Ricerca dell'Ospedale Maggiore Research Foundation of Bergamo – of which UBI Banca is one of the founding members – to promote and finance scientific research of particular interest to society. Action cutting across many areas is taken by UBI Sistemi e Servizi – the Group’s service consortium company – which again in 2014 donated retired equipment, which nevertheless still functions well, to 45 organisations and associations (12 associations involved in assistance and charity work, 12 organisations involved in social, recreational and sports activities, 4 cultural associations, 5 municipalities, one police unit and 11 schools) for an estimated total value of €18 thousand. Two initiatives were implemented with the direct involvement of employees. These consisted of a pilot initiative, “Donate one day”, which saw 337 staff employed in Group banks and companies in the Milan and province of Milan area carrying out voluntary work in eleven nonprofit organisations. The project was designed to encourage and organise the active participation of employees to support voluntary activities and socially deserving projects organised by nonprofit organisation, thereby strengthening local ties with various initiatives in the community, in the role of a Bank which is particularly attentive to the issues of solidarity and social cohesion. Much effort was also made for the organisation of “Solidarity Christmas Dinners” for people suffering hardship provided in co-operation with the Exodus Foundation, the network banks and the Internal Communication Function. The initiative took place simultaneously in seven different towns and cities in which the network banks have their headquarters and involved over 150 employees who served dinners, distributed gifts consisting of packages of prime necessities and entertained over one thousand th guests in need. Important support was also given for the organisation of the 13 edition of the Concert at the Scala of Milan Theatre, a fundraising evening for research and assistance organised by the Italian League for the Fight Against Tumours (LILT). In 2014 the Bank diversified the range of activities that it supports focusing on operations with a broader and more widespread appeal, without, however, neglecting the more “niche” initiatives and those of more specialist cultural and scientific interest. The calendar was peppered with artistic and cultural events. The ancient and modern and the local and global blended together in the project ART UP, designed to publicise the artistic heritage of the Bank by putting a work of art from its private collection on display to the public each month at the Bergamo headquarters. The first work displayed, produced by Afghan women on the basis of an idea by the great contemporary artist Alighiero Boetti then left Bergamo to be displayed in the exhibition “ON THE ROAD / EN EL CAMINO” in Galicia. The “Artist in Residence Km Rosso” is a new project organised by the Bergamo Accademia Carrara di Belle Arti and Km Rosso, which gives seven young artists the opportunity to create their own works at seven scientific research and technology centres and to display them at Bergamo Science. At the same time relationships are now firmly established with the Noesis Association for the annual series of events on philosophy with important figures on the national cultural scene and with the Bergamo Science Association 47 Social Report 2014 Economic performance which organises a fascinating series of events on scientific matters. High quality food and wine is also an important part of Italian culture. The Bank took part in the first edition of two new important initiatives: “High-quality”, the title of a stand of Italian excellence in food and wine at Vaprio d’Adda (Bergamo), and Food Film Fest, a Cinema review produced in Bergamo on the subject of food. Taking a wider look at the broader subject of the environment, mention must be made of: the Festival of the Environment in Bergamo, three days of exhibitions and conventions on the green economy; the Energy Week, in co-operation with the Artisans Association; and the “Masters of the landscape” event, which transformed Piazza Vecchia of Bergamo Alta into a true and genuine botanical garden at the hands of famous architects with international conventions and gala evenings. Attention to social issues was again continued: with contributions to the Don Mazzi Exodus Onlus Foundation for the publication of the Tremenda school diary distributed free to senior high schools; with the charity competition “Basta una parola per … Fare Banca Per Bene” (All you need is a word ... to do banking well and fairly), held on the occasion of the visit to the exhibition of nativity scenes held in the Chiostro di Santa Marta at the Bank; with support for the Friends of Paediatrics Association and the social welfare co-operatives, Il Segno, Il Battello and In Cammino; with participation in the City of Bergamo initiatives, Young People’s Card, Family and Senior Card, to offer economic advantages to young people, large families on low incomes and the elderly resident in the city. The Bank believes in the education of young people as the engine that drives personal and collective growth and in this context it contributes to the activities of organisations such as: the Pro Universitate Bergomensi Association, which works for the University of Bergamo to become a place of integration between academic knowledge and know-how in the local economy; the Committee for the Technical Industrial Institutes P. Paleocapa and G. Natta of Bergamo, to construct laboratories and infrastructures for teaching; the Foundation for Financial Education and Saving for financial education meetings in schools and “Economic Citizenship Days” which involved 5,000 pupils in schools at all levels. New areas were inaugurated in the former Torre della Galleria Santa Marta district, where TAG#in the city created an active and vital co-working space with a shared working environment based on the “talent Garden” model for the development of innovative business ideas. In the sports field, commitments continued to initiatives involving young people and events that are very popular in the community such as the Bergamo international tennis tournaments, the Binda Trophy of Cittiglia (a female cycling World Cup trial) and the under 23 world championship rowing races on Lake Varese (one of the most important events in the world for this sport). Two first editions were introduced: the first edition of the Clubino Trophy in co-operation with the Provincial Cycling Federation, reserved for the very youngest category and the first National Meeting of the Azzurri Athletes of Italy, in co-operation with the Italian National Olympic Committee, which brought together over 600 athletes or former athletes in every sport who had competed for their country . The Bank supported five social projects with its social bonds in 2014: SOS Villaggio dei bambini Morosolo to take in children with problematic family relationships; Solidarietà Società Cooperativa Sociale for the creation of a medical treatment room and a gymnasium for motory and rehabilitation activity for disadvantaged persons; the Umberto Veronesi Foundation research project “Understand the genetics of the hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children”; Unione Invalidi Civili Bergamaschi to support the project “Relief home for the disabled” at Pizzzino, Bergamo. In addition to direct support for important nonprofit organisation initiatives in the local community, the Bank also finances the endowments of the Banca San Paolo di Brescia Foundation and the Credito Agrario Bresciano Foundation Giovanni Folonari Cultural Institute, established to pursue the original ideals of the banks of the same name from which they emerged. Following on from decisions made in past years, yet again in 2014 the fields of greatest intervention 48 Social Report 2014 Economic performance were culture, social, recreational and sports activities and the development of the local economy. The following contributions are worthy of mention in the field of culture: to the Brescia Teatro Grande Foundation of Brescia for its theatre season; to the Brescia Foundation for studies in economics and law; and for the publication of the book “Intorno alle mura, Brescia medievale” (an art edition for the 2014 Strenna di Natale Christmas gift ). In the field of sport we mention the sponsorships of the historical re-enactment of the Mille Miglia motor race, Brescia Rugby and the Brescia Art Marathon. Finally, for development of the local economy the bank supported the activities of Pro Brixia, the “special firm, of the Brescia Chamber of Commerce which promotes and organises initiatives designed to create commercial opportunities for Brescia companies on international markets. With the issue of UBI Community social bonds, the Bank donated scholarship grants to less well-off and more deserving students of the Scuola d'Arti e Mestieri F. Ricchino di Rovato, Brescia and it supported the Bresciana Assistenza Psicodisabili Onlus Foundation project a “Weekend of relief”, the ACTIONAID International Italy Onlus project for food education in schools and the creation of an innovative neuro stimulation centre of the IRCCS Fatebenefratelli for Alzheimer’s patients. Each year the bank supports and promotes numerous prestige initiatives in various fields, with particular attention to the social, ethical and cultural development of the community in which it operates. th Firmly established partnerships include that with Pavia University for two initiatives: the 24 edition of the graduation day, when this bank awarded prizes to the twelve best students of the university, one for each faculty and a research study on the ancient university, which gave rise to the publication of a trilogy of the prestigious publishing programme History of the University of st Pavia from the Middle Ages until the 21 Century. In order to enhance its image as the Group’s main bank in the city of Milan, in the cultural sphere, this bank is an institutional supporter of the Poldi Pezzoli Museum – an institution famous throughout the world and a point of cultural reference in the Lombard metropolis – and it is listed on the “Golden Roll of Honour” of the supporters of the Piccolo Teatro of Milan, with which it manages and organises the Eleonora Duse Theatrical Prize. This event, which has now reached its th 29 edition, is the only award granted each year to a theatre actress for distinction in the theatre season in one or more plays in Italy or abroad. The prize for 2014 was awarded to the actress Sonia Bergamasco. Again in the Lombard capital the Bank sponsored the ATIR (Teatro Ringhiera Milano) theatre season and contributed to the organisation of the Street Art Festival, which saw the presence of numerous street artists, famous throughout the world, who recreated the look of an entire district on the outskirts of the city, while in Pavia it sponsored exhibitions organised by the municipality at the Stables of the Visconti Castle and the City Museums. The numerous sports sponsorships included Canottieri Milano (Milan rowing club), which, founded in 1890, is one of the oldest and most prestigious sports clubs in Milan and Italy. With the issue of UBI Community social bonds, the bank made a substantial contribution to the “Agenzia n. 1 di Pavia, per Ayamè , a Pavia nonprofit organisation, which since 1991 has adopted a permanent “situation of hardship in world”. The contribution received was used for a project to modernise the buildings of the Hôpital Général d'Ayamé in Ivory Coast. Banca Regionale Europea’s communication strategy is to reinforce the positioning of the Bank through its cultural and sports sponsorships which again in 2014 saw it play a primary role, with account taken for the difficult economic situation, in providing support to numerous local events. In the sports field, having concluded the sponsorship cycle for the Bre Banca Lannutti Cuneo volleyball team, which is no longer competing in the national championship for the new 2014-2015 49 Social Report 2014 Economic performance season, the Bank still wishes to play an active part on the Cuneo sports scene, the area in which it has its roots and where volleyball is a well-established tradition. And in fact it gave its support to youth teams in order to continue to encourage the values of this sport among young people such as commitment and team spirit, thereby keeping alive the positive image built over the previous 20 years of sports sponsorship at the highest level nationally. Action taken to support the activities of the Federazione Nazionale Sport Invernali Paralimpici (FISIP – Paralympic National Federation of Winter Sport) was of important social significance as was the agreement signed with the Cuneo public administration for the naming of the PalaBreBanca Stadium, which allows the local authority to allocate resources to the development of local sport. In the cultural sphere, in Turin the Bank confirmed its support to the Regio Theatre for the opera season, to the Lingotto Music Association for the concert season and to the Circolo dei lettori, an important point of reference and not just for the City, with which it organised interesting initiatives for the financial education of young people and families, assisted by the Foundation for Financial Education and Saving. Similar activities were also carried out in Genoa and at Cuneo, where the Bank made a contribution to financial educational events in schools such as the “Develop your business idea” competition. Co-operation with the City of Turin and the Foundation for Culture at the time of the Christmas holidays was particularly significant with the installation of a Christmas tree with lights 18 metres high set right in the centre of the city in Piazza Castello and a series of events (financial education for children, Christmas carols performed by the Little Hope Choir of the Archdiocese of Turin, readings of Christmas stories, the collection of gifts and used toys for poorer children in cooperation with the Diocesan Caritas) held by the “Father Christmas’ little chest” specially set up near the Christmas tree. In Liguria, where in 2012 the bank acquired Banco di San Giorgio which was merged into it, while the brand name was maintained, the Bank kept alive partnerships in the community mainly with local sports teams. Sponsorships continued again in 2014 with events which included the Pallone Elastico Cup of Italy (type of handball) organised by the Italian Pallapugno Federation (a sport that is very popular in southern Piedmont and Western Liguria) and the Ravano tournament for pupils of primary schools organised by U.C. Sampdoria. Support was also given to the Cus Genoa Rugby Club. Again in 2014, the Bank organised and supported various initiatives of great visibility and importance to its local community with preference given, in terms of the quality and size of the support, to the fields of culture and sport. It therefore kept alive a series of relationships with important organisations, which are constantly committed to the development of local communities, with the Bank as a point of reference with whom they have shared ideas, plans and objectives for many years. In the sports field, the Bank supported the following: the Ankon Consortium, which combines five clubs that practice different sports and which after over 10 years of activity continues to be one of the most interesting organisations on the Ancona sports scene; Aurora Basket of Jesi (for which the Bank has been the main sponsor for over 16 years); Fulgor Libertas Basket di Forlì; Sportiva Volley Lube Association and the GS Lube Volleyball – Treia (MC); the Pesaro Five Amateur Sports Association (five aside football) of Pesaro and the Rowing and Sailing Club of Naples (Three Gulfs Regatta); the Gabriele Cardinaletti Foundation of Jesi (eighth edition of the National “L’Amico Atletico” Prize (athletics’ friend) to promote ethics in support; the Società Sportiva Dilettantistica Jesina Calcio (Jesi amateur football club) as the main sponsor of the Juniores team and the Stamura Ancona for the “City of Ancona Half Marathon”. The historic relationship with the Jesi Fencing Club is special. This sports Association has made Jesi a town that has won more medals than many other towns and cities in the world in the history of the Olympics (22 medals of which 14 gold). To celebrate its prestigious nomination as “2014 European City of Sport”, the Town of Jesi organised a series of events and appointments of an 50 Social Report 2014 Economic performance educational and training nature involving all sports, to which the bank contributed. In the field of culture the most significant contributions regarded the following: the Pergolesi Spontini di Jesi Foundation for the Pergolesi Theatre prose season for which the bank is traditionally the main sponsor; the Teatro delle Muse Foundation of Ancona for various initiatives including the lyrical season; the Musicultura Association of Macerata for the musical and literary events which began at Recanati in 1990 and which have become a point of reference for young talent on the national scene; the Amici della Musica “Guido Michelli” Association of Ancona for concert activities; the Pio Monte della Misericordia of Naples, for the project “Sette Opere per la Misericordia” (an exhibition of seven works by contemporary artists on the theme of mercy) and four scholarship grants for pupils at the Accademia di Belle Arti; the Marches Music Association “Armonie della sera” for the pianoforte concert in the Grotte di Frasassi caves; the Vallesina Prize Association for the seventh edition of the prize which is awarded every two years for professional excellence to people from Vallesina. The following partnerships stand out in the world of education and universities: with the University of Camerino (various initiatives and projects including co-financing of scholarship grants for a research doctorate on innovation – the Eureka project); with the ISTAO (two scholarship grants in memory of Comm. Luigi Bacci for young graduates aspiring to a business or management career in companies, banks, consulting firms or trade associations); and with the Marches Polytechnic University (the “World Campus” project to support and disseminate technological innovation and training for university students through job experience abroad). Finally, as part of a commitment to local development and promotion, the Bank is present in the Festival and Exhibition for traditional products typical of the Marches (a wine and food initiative with a strong impact on local development, organised in co-operation with the town of Fermo), while Solidarity initiatives again included support for fundraising for the “Light Project” (funds for a hospital in Congo to care for children who have lost the use of their sight) and for the Associazione Onlus I.O.M. – Istituto Oncologico Marchigiano Jesi e Vallesina (institute to assist cancer patients). Intense participation by Banca Carime continued in 2014 in the cultural, social and university education fields and to enhance and develop the southern Italian economy. In the musical sphere the Bank continued its partnership with Barese Chamber Music with free tickets to the more disadvantaged groups in society: the differently able, students from the prestigious Bari Music Conservatory and children from outer city areas accompanied on educational programmes. The partnership with the Magna Grecia Orchestra Association of Taranto also continued which valorises the best performers of classical and contemporary music locally with a programme of concerts in Apulia and Basilicata. In the field of cultural and local development, the display of works of art from the Banca Carime private collection continued for the fourth year at the Cosenza National Gallery in Palazzo Arnone, in co-operation with the Superintendence for Historical, Artistic and Ethno-Anthropological Heritage of Calabria and with the Regional Department for Cultural and Landscape Heritage of Calabria. Activities for the enhancement and economic development of Southern Italy included the convention “Welcome to the South – Open Day for young talent”, held in co-operation with the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research and the Central Offices for the Co-ordination of Start-ups. At this event innovative firms and young talents discussed issues with established business leaders who operate in southern Italy and represent examples of excellence in the realisation of business objects and ideas. To complete this initiative, Banca Carime will make available its own financial and relationship resources in order to support the translation of the best ideas into new businesses. The project “Your idea of business” is also aimed at young talents, organised in co-operation with the Cosenza Confederation of Industry and designed to bring worthy new ideas to the attention of the world of business, to be developed with the creation of a business plan. 51 Social Report 2014 Economic performance Alongside its participation in financial education initiatives organised by the Italian Banking Association (formerly by the PattiChiari Consortium), Banca Carime continued its commitment to teaching economic and financial subjects in senior high schools in the provinces of Brindisi and Taranto (seven schools, for a total of approximately 450 pupils) with the competition “Develop your business idea”, based on the creation of a business plan to start up a socially useful enterprise in the community and with the initiative “NewspaperGame” organised in co-operation with the national daily, the Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, a competition for primary and secondary schools in Apulia and Basilicata designed to stimulate young people to think and write on economic subjects. Finally, in the social welfare sphere, mention should be made of support for the Sant’Egidio Community of Bari for its soup kitchen. As in past years the Bank continued its support for development in the local communities in which it operates, with preference given to initiatives for the needy and to support local culture. Particularly important initiatives include participation in the Valle Camonica Community Fund, managed by the Comunità Bresciana Foundation for the support by means of a specific competition of initiatives for the social and cultural growth of the valley, action taken to help small mountain parishes committed to the conservation of historical and religious properties and the organisation of initiatives for young people. However, small contributions made to schools are no less important, especially to local infants and primary schools, together with support for research projects developed by Brescia University (“Analysis of the Brescia and Lombard economy forecasts, interpretation and solution of business in crisis”) and the Catholic University of Milan (“Educate to citizenship”). The bank’s commitment in the editorial field saw the publication of the book “Pievi e parrocchie in Valle Camonica”, in which the proceedings of the study meeting organised in co-operation with the Camunitas Foundation of Breno are published. FONDAZIONE UNIONE DI BANCHE ITALIANE PER VARESE ONLUS This Foundation was formed in 2004 on the initiative of Banche Popolare Unite, now Unione di Banche Italiane, and it pursues objectives of social solidarity through the support of social and health and welfare initiatives and the protection, promotion and enhancement of culture and historical and artistic heritage in the Region of Lombardy and in the Province of Varese in particular. Action undertaken in the social welfare field involved following: Varese Basketball to support Handicap Sport Varese; the Ospedale di Circolo Hospital and the Macchi Foundation of Varese for the purchase of advanced diagnostic equipment; the Prison Assistant Volunteers Association of Busto Arsizio, for the project “Listen, support and accompany”; the “La Casa“ Institute of Varese for the purchase of ultrasound equipment; and the Busto Arsizio Hospital to finance a nurse training scheme. Significant contributions were also made to the following: the Parish Church of St Peter and Paul at Daverio to restore the wooden altar and to the Parish Church of Casciago to renovate the Baptistery; the Emma Macchi Zonda Foundation of Varese for the consolidation of the Grotta della Madonna del Deserto; the archaeological Studies Centre of Varese, for the publication of the book “Sibrium”; the Parish of Sant’Antonio di Padova alla Brunella for funding the Magis Foundation of Milan “Solidarity emporium” for the organisation of a training course on missiology; the Astronomical Observatory Foundation of Tradate for financing the “Sirius Project”; and the Sant’Agostino Foundation of Varese for the project “Officina@studio for computer studies”. FONDAZIONE BANCA POPOLARE DI BERGAMO ONLUS Formed in Bergamo in 1991 by the former Banca Popolare di Bergamo–Credito Varesino, the Foundation promotes and enhances historical and artistic heritage, health and welfare, charitable 52 Social Report 2014 Economic performance activities and the conservation of the environment and nature in the Lombard region. The most significant action undertaken in 2014 in the cultural sphere included support for the following: the international activity of the Carlo Cattaneo di Castellanza university; the Bergamo Science Association, for the annual organisation of the scientific educational event of the same name; and the Pope John XXIII Foundation for a study of the “Good Pope”. Support was given to the following for the conservation, promotion and enhancement of artistic and historical heritage: to the Diocese of Bergamo for the restoration of various buildings; to the Dominican Fathers of the Convent of Bergamo for the restoration of the St Bartholomew Church. Donations in the health and welfare field as follows: to the Committee for the Beato Giovanni XXIII Hospital of Bergamo, to complete the new church within the hospital; to the Bergamo section of the ANA – Associazione Nazionale Alpini Onlus Foundation for operational activities and to monitor landslide and flooding phenomena; to the Bergamo Provincial Delegation of the Italian National Olympic Committee for the purchase of 120 semi-automatic outdoor defibrillators for distribution to amateur sports clubs; to the Casa Amica Foundation of Bergamo for social housing initiatives. In the area of the protection and enhancement of the environment, the foundation confirmed its support in 2014 for the Ethical Environmental Centre of Bergamo. FONDAZIONE BANCA SAN PAOLO DI BRESCIA Founded in 1998 by the bank of the same name, its objective is to perpetuate its original ideals and Catholic inspiration. It operates principally in Lombardy and preferably in the province of Brescia, to support social, civic and church initiatives with special attention given to education, welfare and art, and it also works with other similar organisations. The Foundation gives great importance to culture and supported the following activities in the Brescia area: the Brescia Section of the Catholic University of Milan; the Art and Spirituality Association; the Opera per l’Educazione Cristiana of Concesio; the Pope Paul VI Cesare Airici Institute; the Santa Maria della Pace Primary and Secondary School; the Giuseppe Tovini Foundation and the Civiltà Bresciana Foundation. For its social initiatives the Foundation worked with the Brescia Diocesan Caritas for the “Madre Eugenia Menni” soup kitchen and the Brescia VOL.CA – Volontariato Carcere Association to support prison inmates, former prison inmates and their families. The Foundation also supports various Church-related organisations, by refunding interest paid on loans granted by the Banco di Brescia on the basis of special agreements entered into for the restoration and conservation of artistic heritage and of properties belonging to the parishes and dioceses of Brescia. FONDAZIONE CAB ISTITUTO DI CULTURA GIOVANNI FOLONARI The Foundation was formed in 1983 in order to “promote, encourage research into, enhance the value of, analyse and divulge actions and aspects that concern culture, education, instruction, social welfare and scientific research”. In 2014, it organised a convention jointly with the Prefecture and Diocesan Museum of Brescia entitled “Manifestations of the sacred and the copper age” dedicated to the memory of Angelo Rampinelli Rota, who conceived of and organised the exhibition “The Age of copper” in 2013, and of which this was a natural follow-up. It also organised concerts for the inauguration of the restored G. Tonoli organ of 1887 with the Parish of the Cathedral. Two initiatives took place in the publishing field: the publication of the Brescia and Province Green Guide in the Chinese language in co-operation with the Italian Touring club, promoted successfully by businesses in Brescia who have commercial relationships with China, in view, amongst other things, of the influx of tourists resulting from Expo 2015; the publication of the “Annals of the History of Brescia” in co-operation with Brescia University’s series of books designed to follow on 53 Social Report 2014 Economic performance from the Brescia tradition of study and research that began 50 years ago with the publication of the History of Brescia (1963-1964). On the invitation of the Prefecture of Brescia, the Foundation participated in the “Great War” Committee formed by the Prefecture itself to promote and support initiatives to commemorate the centenary of the First World War and on the centenary of the birth of the Brescia artist Arturo Cavellini it supported the project “Give us back Cavellini”, a Facebook page created by the Archivio Cavellini Onlus on the life and work the artist (the critic, Vittorio Sgarbi, also supported the project and was a guest in Brescia at the press conference to announce the creation). As occurs each year, the foundation was a partner in the Brescia and Bergamo International Pianoforte Festival at which it awarded the Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli prize to the Russian maestro Yuri Temirkanov and it also continued its support, although to a reduced extent, for the initiatives of the following associations with which it has long-standing connections: the FAI, the Amici dei Musei Association (friends of museums association), the Artisti Bresciani Association, the Ugo da Como Foundation and the Mus-e Brescia Onlus. FONDAZIONE BANCA POPOLARE DI VIGEVANO Founded in 1991 by the bank of the same name which was merged into Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, it has continued over the years to support local initiatives of a humanitarian, social, cultural and charitable nature. In 2014 it supported action in the health and welfare field for the Heart Centre which works to prevent cardiovascular disease and for the Life Association Onlus, which works to prevent tumours. In the field of culture it contributed to the publication of works by the well-known Vigevano painter Cesare Giardini and the restoration of the chapel in the Parish Church of San Cristoforo in San Pietro Martire, where the patron saint of the town Blessed Matthew Carrieri lies. EC9 Given its nature and its distribution network in the community, the UBI Banca Group generates SIGNIFICANT significant indirect impacts on the economy, that are not yet quantifiable due to the difficulty in INDIRECT ECONOMIC finding adequate operational instruments and metrics. IMPACTS The main impacts locally regard the following: • the competitiveness of the economy, as a result of support to small and medium-sized enterprises to promote growth and technological innovation and to overcome the crisis [ FS7]; • the development of depressed economic areas, through geographical choices for the location of branches and the allocation of economic resources [ 2.5, FS13];; • the development of the green economy and the reduction of environmental costs through support for investments for energy savings and the development and use of renewable energies [ FS8] ; • the reduction of risks and the maximisation of the social benefits of development through attention to issues such as financial inclusion and education [ FS7, FS14, FS16], growth of a civil economy (the third sector) [ FS7], protection of health and safety at the workplace [ LA6-LA9], non-discrimination and equal opportunities [ LA13, LA14, HR4]. On a national scale UBI Banca generates positive impacts on the reduction of the social costs of economic imbalances, illegal conduct and threats to peace and security by contributing to the efficiency and stability of the financial system (e.g. through proper risk management, compliance with regulations and best commercial practices in relationships with customers and competitors) and it observes the law and co-operates with institutions in the performance of all activities where risks may arise (e.g. matters concerning competition and market abuse, money-laundering, terrorism, privacy and consumer protection) [ SO2-SO4]. 54 Social Report 2014 Economic performance EN. Environmental performance In compliance with the principles of the Global Compact subscribed to, UBI Banca pursues a preventative and proactive approach to environmental issues, as part of its social responsibility with regard to society and the local communities in which it operates. To achieve this, in 2008 it set an Environmental Policy designed to both progressively and gradually reduce direct environmental impacts in terms of consumption (principally energy, paper and toner), harmful emissions (principally CO2) and the production and disposal of waste and the implementation of initiatives to promote virtuous conduct by the various stakeholders. Raw materials EN1 The main raw materials used are paper and toner for printers. MATERIALS USED 1 RAW MATERIAL CO N SUMPTIO N 2014 2013 2012 Paper (Kg) 2,244,779 2,167,367 2,324,453 of which: current paper for printing 1,537,465 1,353,380 1,554,766 communication and prints to customers 194,565 245,347 257,586 forms 185,800 174,100 129,081 brochures 143,100 183,097 201,398 corporate reports 16,785 26,250 9,473 envelopes 167,064 185,193 113,149 other publications 59,000 of which certified: FSC 71% 76% 73% ECF 86% 100% 100% Ecolabel 71% 79% 76% per employee (Kg) 121.9 119.7 130.2 Toner (Kg) 38,175 39,862 39,038 per employee (Kg) 2.1 2.2 2.2 1 The data are estimated on the basis of actual spending. The Group is continuing with its commitment to increase the use of paper certified as having a low environmental impact, both because it originates from responsibly managed forests and because of the manufacturing processes employed and to reduce paper and toner consumption by optimising printing activity, but above all by “paperless” document processing. In this respect the activity undertaken in 2013 with digital signatures was further extended following an incremental approach with a consequent increase in the volume of documents stored in digital form. The growth of the service ”My accounts”, which was further enhanced in 2014, now allows all users of the internet banking service (Qui UBI and Qui UBI Affari) to receive most of the documentation which the bank normally sends by ordinary mail in electronic format free of charge. Over 963 thousand customers have been registered for the service (an increase of 23.5% compared with 2013) with approximately 1.3 million accounts signed up. Notwithstanding the action taken to reduce consumption, a slight increase was recorded compared to 2013 due to the following: • huge numbers of customers signing contracts for the use of digital signatures, the benefits of which will only become visible from 2015 onwards; • a slowdown in the acquisition of supplies towards the end of 2013 following the introduction of different procedures for managing budgets. As a consequence stocks were depleted and needed to be built up again by increasing supplies at the beginning of 2014; • the perimeter on which supplies are measured was widened to include UBI Leasing and UBI Factor A further increase in the documents available online is planned in 2015 with the extension of the 55 Social Report 2014 Environmental performance use of digital signatures to all products that can be purchased online on the remote selling platform, the extension of this service to include QUI UBI Imprese internet banking and the extension of the possibility to receive correspondence in electronic format to also include those customers not registered for internet banking services. EN2 To date the Group has introduced no specific guidelines for the purchase of products produced RECYCLED RAW using recycled materials. However, this possibility has been considered in the instructions given to MATERIALS buyers in training courses on the sustainability of purchases delivered in February 2015 and it will be included in the next revision of internal regulations on procurement processes. Energy EN3 The optimisation of energy supplies and consumption is a priority and it is overseen by the Group DIRECT ENERGY Energy Manager who is responsible for managing energy supply contracts (electricity, methane, CONSUMPTION BY gasoil, etc.) and for initiating action for the rational and efficient use of energy sources.

The Group has adopted its own design system for the construction ENERGY SAVED DUE and refurbishment of offices and branches, which is constantly brought into line with technological TO CONSERVATION advances available on the market. The system involves an energy section with three lines of action: AND EFFICIENCY • high energy efficiency lighting, with a system that guarantees constant levels of lighting IMPROVEMENTS and reductions in consumption partly through the possibility of the partial use of individual lamps; • machinery and plant, with high efficiency energy equipment such as refrigeration units with heat pumps fitted with inverters, high-performance condensing boilers with low harmful gas emissions; • structure, with greater use of insulation and film on windows to control architecture and structure sunlight. This reflects up to 70% of the incoming heat, helping to reduce the need for air conditioning. In 2014 windows were replaced in four branches with profiles and glass compliant with the architectural and structural design system for buildings. In ten buildings heat generators were replaced with new high performance plants, new high performance heat or refrigeration pumps were installed in 56 buildings and six air treatment units at the Jesi headquarters were fitted with inverters. Replacement of the generators and heat pumps led to an expected reduction in CO2e emissions of 59 tons per year and a reduction in spending on electricity and fuel of €33 thousand per year. Fourteen new remote control systems have also been installed in heating and air conditioning systems bringing the number of systems for which on and off times and required ambient temperature are monitored via intranet both in winter and summer up to 328. With regard to the use of less polluting energy sources, the design stage of a long-term programme was completed during the year for the installation of photovoltaic panels at the Banca Carime headquarters in Bari and a long-term methane conversion project was completed at one of the most energy devouring premises located in Milan from the viewpoint of gasoil consumption. This conversion which involved the replacement of the heat generators with others with higher performance, will result in a reduction in CO2e emissions estimated at 267 tons per year and savings on electricity and fuel of almost €253 thousand per year. The first action to increase energy efficiency has been completed on the basis of the results of energy audits carried out in 2013, with work done on air conditioning systems in the data processing centre and the electrical stations at the UBI Sistemi e Servizi premises in Brescia with a benefit measured in the last four months of the year of 25 tons per year of reduced CO2e emissions and savings of €16 thousand on electricity. Energy audits were commissioned on another three large buildings in 2014 located in Bergamo and Milan, considered amongst the largest devourers of energy in the Group. In order to reduce consumption by computer equipment, 2,400 desktops, 2,923 monitors and 76 notebooks were purchased that were Energy Star, Epeat Gold or FCC certified, as part of the periodic renewal of the PC fleet. A power capping policy was pursued in data centres (midrange systems) on new hardware installations and the number of printers was reduced from 6,135 to 4,991, with the renewal of the remaining models with higher performance versions from an energy consumption viewpoint.

In 2014, Km used for the calculation of emissions of trains and planes are respectively 85.3% and 85.5% of the total provided by the travel agency and refer to the routes for which it was possible to determine the specific mileage. Emissions accounted for trains, planes and personal cars in 2012 and 2013 were recalculated based on new emission coefficients reported in the indicator 3.11. EN18 The Group has a number of large business centres (the headquarters of the Parent, the network INITIATIVES TO banks and the product companies) on which problems of sustainable mobility and initiatives to REDUCE GREENHOUSE solve them are concentrated. These matters are supervised by the Group Mobility Manager in the GAS EMISSIONS AND Human Resources Area. THE REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED In order to encourage more sustainable to-and-from work mobility, for some years now protected parking areas have been provided for bicycles in some of the main headquarters of the Group and a EN5 e EN7 coach shuttle service runs between Bergamo, Varese, Brescia and Milan (and actually within the city for the latter). In 2014 the service was used on average by 400 employees per day, thereby preventing emissions of well over 1,081 tons of CO2 compared to the use of car travel.

EN19 The only source of ozone-depleting substances involved in the activity carried out consists of air EMISSIONS OF conditioning systems. OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES Air conditioning systems installed in new buildings and refurbished buildings use ecological refrigerant fluid with a lower environmental impact and consequently at present new air conditioning systems contain the non-polluting R410 refrigerant gas and increasingly fewer old systems remain which still use R22 gas, as well non-polluting R407 and R134 gases. There were a total of 56 plants still functioning with this gas which were replaced in 2014 with others’ functioning with R410 gas. With regard to the R22 gas, in 2014 the maintenance firms used 1,344 kg (of which 68 kg of regenerated gas) of this to top up the levels in systems that had been repaired due to leaks.

Labour practices and decent work Personnel represent an asset with values, capabilities and competencies, the recognition and enhancement of which constitute essential conditions for achieving UBI Banca’s mission. The principles endorsed by the ILO (International Labour Organisation) conventions are applied throughout the Group. The local and national standards which Group companies and banks must observe are based on those principles. The polices and processes for personnel management comply with these principles and those of the Global Compact and they employ the values of fairness, consistency, meritocracy and uniformity to translate Group objectives into personal, team and corporate results. Employment LA1 The requirement to take action on the cost of labour by optimising staff numbers, in connection PROFILE OF THE with the impact of the negative performance of the economy in general on volumes of business, PERSONNEL and the desire to do this in a socially sustainable manner, led UBI Banca to sign agreements with LA13 trade union organisations to provide early retirement incentives on a voluntary basis with a related generation turnover programme and to introduce layoffs, reductions in working hours and parttime working.

In general, priority is given in allowing parttime work contracts to applicants with good grounds and in particular to those justified by the need to care for children, whether biological or fostered (below maximum junior school age) or by serious family reasons and/or because of the health of the applicant, a spouse, first degree relatives and person’s under the legal guardianship of the applicant. Where possible, if compatible with the operating requirements of the company, employment solutions are sought within the organisational unit to which the person belongs or one close to it. Weekly and daily working hours and the number of hours worked on part-time contracts are agreed between the company, the organisational unit in question and the employee, in the context of the provisions of the agreements mentioned, with maximum flexibility with regard to the employee’s requirements, and in a manner compatible with service requirements. The duration of part-time contracts is generally for a maximum of four years, which may be extended, although permanent part-time employment contracts may also be considered. Female workers on fixed-term part-time contracts who take leave from work for pregnancy, maternity and postnatal convalescence, may in any case request a further part-time contract of four years at the end of that period of leave. 64 Social Report 2014 Labour practices and decent work Geographical distribution of Employees by area of employement employees 15.6% (workplace) Governance 13.5% 14.3% 100% 4.1% 90% 75.2% 75.3% 75.3% Business and finance 4.2% 80% 4.1% 70% 6.9% 60% Other 5.2% 50% 5.8% 40% 8.7% 30% Organisation 12.8% 13.4% 14.6% 14.2% 11.2% 20% 10.4% 9.3% 9.7% 10% 0.9% 0.7% 0.8% 64.7% 0% Distribution network 64.4% 64.5% North Center South and Abroad Islands 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% Women Men Total Women Men Total Geographical mobility, considered as working in a different province to that in which a person is resident, affects 20% of employees. Where possible and compatible with organisational and service requirements, Group companies make efforts to meet requests to work close to home, especially with regard to employees classified as belonging to “professional areas” and to employees who have been working for at least two years in organisational units at distances of over 20 km from their homes. Moving personnel closer to their homes may result in new or different duties from those performed in their original organisational units. New trade union agreements have added a new flexibility tool known as “smart working”, which involves carrying out some work in the offices of Group companies located in the towns in which those staff affected by geographical mobility are resident. LA2 Activity to find and select personnel is carried out by the Human Resources Area of UBI Banca for TURNOVER the whole Group. The selection process is based on criteria of transparency and independent LA5 judgement and it involves aptitude and behavioural tests (which may also be taken remotely), interviews and individual and Group exercises. In 2014 the procedure was revised with the introduction of tests to assess the educational, professional and human experiences of the candidates, CV requirements were refined on the basis of the growing complexity of professional roles required in the Group and the attractiveness of the Group as an “employer of choice” was enhanced. Candidates are acquired through the “Work” section of the corporate website and the search for specialist and professional profiles was improved by using social networks and Linkedin in particular. In 2014 22 thousand new CVs were acquired and selection activity involved approximately 900 candidates, with a focus on new university graduates and professionals and middle management roles with experience in various specialist areas. The quality of the candidates is also connected with the events in which UBI Banca participates in the main schools and universities located in the areas in which the Group operates (company presentations, career days, career counselling days and recruiting). Co-operation with training institutes in 2014 led to 89 internships (for school leavers, university undergraduates and new graduates) providing young people with the chance to train in units at the Parent or in the network banks. A further 16 trainee position appointments were made at representative offices in China, Brazil, India and Russia. 2014 2013 2012 APPO IN TMEN TS TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN On temporary contracts 255 148 315 181 141 79 of which from: personnel leasing 0 0 0 0 2 0 apprentices 4 1 42 22 0 0 internship 0 0 0 0 1 0 Permanent 48 14 39 18 61 21 of which from: personnel leasing 0 0 0 0 1 0 internship 0 0 0 0 0 0 TO TAL 303 162 354 199 202 100 65 Social Report 2014 Labour practices and decent work CO N VER SIO N F R O M TEMPO R AR Y 2014 2013 2012 CO N TR ACTS TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN From apprentices 0 0 8 0 9 5 Other 90 46 63 31 15 3 TO TAL 90 46 71 31 24 8 2014 2013 2012 STAF F L EAVIN G TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN Business Plan reductions 203 35 742 213 119 46 of which: “solidarity fund” 187 28 677 192 2 2 incentivised redundancies 16 7 65 21 117 34 Voluntary resignations 111 28 93 23 112 30 End of contract 143 90 157 105 143 89 Retirement 12 4 5 1 9 3 Dismissal 16 2 18 3 32 4 Other 24 6 25 11 41 6 TO TAL 509 165 1 ,0 4 0 356 456 168 2014 2013 2012 RA TE N EW EMPL O Y EE HIR ES R ATE A ND TUR N O V ER N EW 2 N EW 2 N EW 2 TURN O VER TURN O VER TURN O VER EMPL O Y EE EMPL O Y EE EMPL O Y EE By p o sitio n Senior managers 1.7% 4.2% 0.0% 17.3% 0.2% 4.9% Middle managers 0.1% 2.5% 0.0% 6.5% 0.3% 1.9% Other personnel 2.8% 3.0% 3.3% 4.7% 1.6% 2.6% By g en d er Men 1.2% 3.0% 1.3% 6.0% 0.8% 2.4% Women 2.4% 2.4% 2.9% 5.2% 1.4% 2.4% By ag e Under 30 31.9% 16.2% 33.4% 14.3% 12.3% 10.0% 30 to 50 0.7% 1.2% 0.6% 1.1% 0.6% 1.4% 50 to 60 0.2% 2.3% 0.2% 8.8% 0.2% 2.0% over 60 0.1% 17.5% 0.2% 57.4% 0.2% 16.1% By g eo g rap h ical area North 1.9% 3.2% 2.0% 5.2% 0.9% 2.0% Central 1.1% 1.5% 2.2% 5.9% 1.5% 3.9% South and Islands 0.5% 1.2% 0.9% 7.9% 0.9% 2.6% Abroad 6.2% 6.9% 6.8% 9.5% 7.7% 12.6% TO TAL 1 .7 % 2 .8 % 1 .9 % 5 .7 % 1 .1 % 2 .4 % 1 Ratio appointments by category on total employees by category at the end of the year 2 Ratio staff leaving by category on total employees by category at the end of the year.

Favourable terms and conditions are granted on charges and commissions for banking services along with loans at special rates for the purchase of homes and automatic credit on easy terms in line with the best market conditions. Since 2002 the families of employees both in service and retired, with disabled children who are not self-sufficient, have been able to count on the support of the Clematis Onlus, an association created on the initiative of a group of employees supported financially by the Group The association has signed an insurance agreement to provide the disabled children with an annual supplementary, revaluable, income of €12,000 payable on the death of both parents. The agreement has been signed by 68 families – of which 34 retired employees – for 73 disabled children. The Association also pays grants toward the costs of “rehabilitation training” for the parents and their disabled children and for the purchase of facilities not reimbursed by public or private sector institutions. LA15 LA1 Under Italian law a period of parental leave is compulsory for women employees, normally during RETURN TO WORK the two weeks prior to the presumed date of childbirth and three months after childbirth and leave AND RETENTION from work is optional for both parents (separately), in the first eight years of a child’s life normally RATES AFTER for a maximum period of six months for each of them and a maximum of 10 months cumulatively PARENTAL LEAVE for both requests.

Labour/Management relations There are eight trade union organisations in the Group to which 83% of employees belong. There is no restriction on the freedom of association and membership of trade unions. All trade union organisations operate freely without restrictions and the Group makes adequate operational means available to them to conduct trade union activities. Relations with trade union organisations are based on the search for agreement, as far as possible, on solutions to the issues which are discussed from time to time, through transparent, concrete and continuous dialogue even beyond the minimum required by institutional procedures. Work on trade union relations was intense in 2014 with 99 trade union meetings held for a total of 742 hours, both to carry out negotiations in relation to the 2011-2013/15 business plan and to sign 68 Social Report 2014 Labour practices and decent work other agreements at Group and single company level. During the year trade union representatives took 30,804 days of trade union leave and 8,580 hours of absence occurred for strikes for reasons relating to the economic and political affairs of the country, while no strikes occurred for company or sector disputes. [ Reports and Accounts 2014 p. 38-39, 73-74] LA4 All employees of Group companies registered in Italy (accounting for 99.4% of all Group EMPLOYEES COVERED employees) are covered by national labour agreements. BY COLLECTIVE [ Reports and Accounts 2014 p. 73-74, 105**-107**] BARGAINING AGREEMENTS LA5 Important organisational changes were implemented in full compliance with the procedures set out MINIMUM NOTICE in the Banking National Labour Contract which sets a minimum period of 45 days for negotiations PERIODS REGARDING with trade union organisations. Great attention was paid with the reorganisation measures, which OPERATIONAL met important requirements to improve and rationalise the organisation, to minimise repercussions CHANGES for workers with regard to retraining, geographical mobility and reconciliation of work with family time. The change of role and retraining processes were managed with priority given to enhancing human and professional resources, pursued also by proposing special training programmes. Intragroup mobility is managed, insofar as it is possible, as an opportunity for the occupational growth and enhancement of individuals, by assigning employees with new duties consistent with their qualifications, experience, potential and aptitudes. Organisational changes were made in 2014 including action planned under the 2011-2013/15 Business Plan, with trade union negotiations which led to agreements being signed at Group and single company level . [ Reports and Accounts 2014 p. 73-74]. Occupational health and safety Occupational health and safety matters are regulated in great detail by Legislative Decree No. 81/2008, the provisions of which are applied in all Group companies. A specific function was created at the Parent, on the staff of the Chief Operating Officer, which has the duty of overseeing implementation of legislation on the matter throughout the Group and to officially fill the role of the Prevention and Protection Service for those Group companies for which a specific service provision contract is in place. The function is constantly supported by a leading consulting company. [ Reports and Accounts 2014 p. 202-204] L A6 In accordance with article 35 of Legislative Decree No. 81/2008, annual meetings are held in all WORKFORCE companies, attended by company representatives (the employer and its representatives), the REPRESENTED IN manager and the staff of the Prevention and Protection Service, the Corporate Physician and FORMAL JOINT workers safety representatives, where appointed. Additional meetings are held, sometimes MANAGEMENTseparately, between the Prevention and Protection Service and each of the parties mentioned WORKERS HEALTH above, to study specific issues in detail. The Manager of the Prevention and Protection Service is AND SAFETY also periodically convened by the 231 (administrative liability) Supervisory Bodies and/or by the COMMITTEES Boards of Statutory Auditors of the various Group companies (Supervisory Board for the Parent) and takes part, as Group representative, in the proceedings of the “health and safety working group” formed as part of the Trade Union and Labour Department of the Italian Banking Association. LA7 Accident figures in 2014 – according to INAIL (National accident insurance institute) statistics – INJURY, DISEASES confirmed what had been recorded in previous years with regard to the low levels of hazard in AND ABSENTEEISM work environments and processes in the banking sector. In fact the banking sector was positioned in the lowest class in terms of absolute severity, the frequency and seriousness of accidents, with the majority of total injuries occurring while travelling. The phenomenon of accidents travelling to 69 Social Report 2014 Labour practices and decent work and from work which account for over 70% of the total accidents in which employees are involved is connected with the geographical distribution of the branch networks and the consequent need for workers to have their own means of transport, because public transport networks are not sufficiently widespread and integrated. The Group is perfectly in line with the sector and pursues special policies designed to reduce road accident risks at the source, by giving preference to the use of public transport for work activities and by making collective transport facilities available, where restructuring processes result in significant travelling requirements for personnel [ LA3, EN17, EN18] . For potential sources of accident risk ordinarily present at the workplace, such as those connected with the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of properties and the relative wiring and services, work to educate personnel is continuous. It is performed by staff at UBI Sistemi e Servizi, which manages relations directly with the suppliers who perform the work. In cases of accidents attributable to failings or omissions by maintenance firms, the failings observed have been officially contested and the firms reminded of the safety obligations agreed to in contracts. In order to constantly monitor accidents that occur at the workplace, a precise reporting process is in place carried out by the administrative units responsible for maintaining contacts with INAIl for the Prevention and Protection Unit. The latter analyses accidents on the basis of events that caused them in order to identify possible causes attributable to failure to implement maintenance and faulty maintenance or design of workplaces with the objective of taking appropriate technical action to mitigate risks.

Risk situations are also recognised and managed, as part of the Prevention and Protection Service, that are connected with excess stress due to work organisation. Primary prevention in this area takes place through the use of human resource management policies and by setting behavioural standards based on the principles contained in the Code of Ethics. Psychological assistance is available by going through the Corporate Physician, who co-operates with human resources staff for the management of individual cases of stress. It is not possible to measure the number of days of absence resulting from work-related stress because in order to ensure employees’ right to privacy, the medical certificates do not state the type of illness, but only the prognosis. Consequently, in order to acquire information on which to base possible improvement action, a project was launched in 2014 to acquire data on the subjective perception of staff on organisational well-being and work-related stress.

The Group training catalogue contains programmes differentiated by type of risk, for staff at headquarters and those in branches and by type of responsibility (senior management, safety officers and workers) with both classroom and self-training courses. In order to increase personnel awareness of the importance of behaviour consistent with respect for their own health and those of others – also in implementation of the principles and contents of the Code of Ethics – a section exists on the Group intranet UBILife dedicated to health and safety. The following can be easily found on it: references to laws and Group regulations; news on safety organisation in the Group (e.g. emergency plans and exit routes to follow in different premises illustrated by actual photographs); material used in classroom training initiatives; and also useful advice and information on correct life-styles to remain in good physical and mental condition. 1 2014 TR AIN ING O N HEAL TH AND SAF ETY 2 TS SESSIO N S HO UR S Video terminal workers 335 1 326 Emergency personnel 442 35 3,578 of which : fire prevention 221 19 1,103 first aid 221 16 2,475 New recruits 1 Safety figures 254 11 968 Robbery risk 508 37 3,780 Other (updates) 2,316 89 8,328 TO TAL 3 ,8 5 5 173 1 6 ,9 7 9 1 Training for senior managers, safety officers, company trade union representatives, etc. 2 Data of FAD courses are calculated as 1 session. 72 Social Report 2014 Labour practices and decent work In order to transform the regulations mentioned on work-related stress risk assessment into an opportunity to increase our knowledge of staff and achieve an optimal level of organisational wellbeing, the Occupational Psychology Department of Padua University was commissioned to conduct training activity and education on the subjects of organisational well-being and positive management. Prevention All operational units are subject to periodic compliance inspections on the basis of a multi-year programme. Specific on-site inspections are carried out on the basis of reports received from workers’ safety representatives, trade union organisations and personnel from the operational units themselves or on the request of departments in the Group. Problems connected with the provision of new premises or the refurbishment of existing premises involve prior examination of documents by the Prevention and Protection Function, which, on completion of the works and the entry into service of the premises, programmes on-site compliance inspections. These may generate a series of “recommendations” to the functions normally responsible for the removal of the risk (Safety Officer, Real Estate, IT), which are entered into the IT system to manage the state of progress of the action taken to solve the problems.

This occurred both as part of regional monitoring of determined economical sectors from year to year and as a result of more generic requests to produce technical documentation.

AGREEMENTS WITH TRADE UNIONS 73 Social Report 2014 Labour practices and decent work Training and internal communication All training activities are managed by UBI Academy [ 2.3], the Group’s corporate university formed as a consortium, whose mission is the study, planning, consultancy and the provision of services for the training and the professional and managerial development of staff to support the achievement of business results. In order to assist in the achievement of these goals, UBI Academy has entered into partnerships with national and local institutional knowledge centres (universities and business schools), consistent with the Group’s social responsibility policies. The measurement of requirements and the formulation of training programmes is performed on a periodic basis using a variety of complementary tools: annual meetings with the Human Resources Departments of Group banks and companies, focus groups on specific career families, indications from the Group Commercial Plan and training needs detected from the skills survey, in which all Group employees are involved. Appropriately structured and integrated with other systems for the development of human resources, training proposals are designed to be effective tools for organising, developing and enhancing technical and professional know-how, managerial experiences and skills and the ethical and cultural conduct of Group personnel and for encouraging the development of a unified corporate identity. The instructors involved in training activity consist of both colleagues from Group banks and companies [ Reports and Accounts 2014 p. 74-75] and also outside professionals. The in-house instructor corps is responsible not only for imparting knowledge but also for facilitating the sharing of experiences, positive examples and distinguished conduct in order to diffuse a common language, values and corporate culture and a sense of belonging to the Group. All activities involve compilation of a satisfaction questionnaire and – mainly for technical and occupational courses – a learning questionnaire must be compiled, which assesses acquisition of the training contents and therefore the effectiveness of the course. Technical teaching material on banking, commercial and financial subjects is subject to a compliance opinion by the Compliance Area of the Parent. Group companies contribute to joint inter-professional funds for FONDIR continuous professional development (a fund for senior management training in the services sector) continuous professional development and to the F.B.A. (a banking and insurance fund for training employees working in the banking and insurance sectors Fondo Banche Assicurazioni). In compliance with the contents and parameters contained in FBA notices, the training programmes submitted were agreed with the trade union organisations of the individual banks and companies involved, while the trade unions signed an agreement at Group level for the FONDIR notices. Training activity is accompanied and integrated by intense internal communication, organised and managed by a specific unit in the Human Resources Area of the Parent. The purpose of internal communications is to provide clear and up-to-date information designed to improve the everyday activities of employees and at the same time to spread and share the Group’s values and culture. [Reports and Accounts 2014 p. 76-77] LA10 Over 81,000 training days were delivered in 2014 in line with the objectives set, with an average of TRAINING PER YEAR approximately five training days per employee (unchanged compared with 2013).

Professional growth for young talents involved 14 training days on theoretical and behavioural subjects and the introduction of coaching and mentoring initiatives to support the intense programme of job rotation to which they are subject. An investment was made during the year in a new IT tool to provide operational support to various personnel management activities and at the same time to integrate them and create synergies and a wage bracket model was consolidated together with references to external wages for use in the selection, management and mobility of employees.

Human rights UBI Banca is committed to supporting and promoting, within its sphere of influence, the universal principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights consistent with the Group Code of Ethics which provide for the following: • policies and procedures to manage personnel in compliance with Italian law and with the main international standards; • credit and commercial policies attentive to the needs of the socially vulnerable, with particular attention paid to the issue of financial inclusion and the prevention of over indebtedness and the risks connected with involvement in particular economic sectors and in the arms sector above all; • ethical standards in contracts with suppliers; • support for social organisations that work for the promotion and protection of individuals through action in the fields of health, welfare and humanitarian assistance. [ LA, FS1, FS2, FS7, EC8] Investment and procurement practices HR1 The UBI Banca Group operates almost exclusively in Italy, where the laws ensure a high standard of INVESTMENT respect for and protection of human rights.

UNDERGONE HUMAN RIGHTS SCREENING As concerns the supply chain [ EC6], 98.9% of the Group’s suppliers are located in Italy and in any case all suppliers are required to fully comply with legislation on workers’ rights and also with HR2 ethical principles consistent with those contained in the Code of Ethics when orders are granted or SUPPLIERS AND contracts are signed. OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE HUMAN RIGHTS SCREENING HR3 In consideration of the activity carried out and its geographical location, no specific training EMPLOYEE TRAINING activities are carried out on the subject of human rights, but it is dealt with in training activities and IN HUMAN RIGHTS internal communication performed to implement the Code of Ethics [ FS4]. Non-discrimination NonHR4 The Group Code of Ethics expressly provides for respect for the principle of equality and nonINCIDENTS OF discrimination and therefore conduct is not admissible which might cause harm to the integrity and DISCRIMINATION AND dignity of persons, nor is discrimination based on preferences or arbitrary exclusion (i.e. not linked ACTIONS TAKEN to the importance of the contribution that a relationship with a party may offer or the interest that the party may represent for the achievement of the Group’s mission). Again in 2014, as in previous years, no reports of violation of the Code of Ethics were received for cases of discrimination against personnel or other stakeholders. Because the principle of nondiscrimination is considered particularly important in employment relations, UBI Banca has adopted 79 Social Report 2014 Human rights specific guidelines for disciplinary procedures which: • set out formal investigation, decision-making and judgement processes which subsidiaries must follow for the more serious cases of contestations and disciplinary provisions for reprimands; • provide unequivocal recommendations to the body which must decide sanctions in relation to the type of provision and the position of the employee subject to sanction; • define information which companies must report periodically to the Parent for full visibility of disciplinary procedures taken by the Group. All the Group companies inform the Parent of the start of disciplinary procedures and the Parent monitors all procedures providing advice where requested and also assistance in drafting the contestation, examining the justifications and proposing the sanctions if applicable to be imposed to the companies. In 2014 a total of 86 disciplinary measures were adopted due mainly to operational irregularities and negligence of various kinds (70), to undue appropriation/diversion of funds administered (10) to irregularities in the disbursement and management of loans (5) and irregularities in the management of investments (1).

Companies are also required to inform the Parent of all litigation the nature of which could be of importance for the entire Group and the Parent provides advice whenever requested by companies, with support in investigating the case, attendance at meetings with outside advisors to formulate strategies and represent companies at hearings before judges.

COMMUNITIES SO10 PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES. Corruption Together with the subject of corruption, this section is useful for addressing the subject of the fight against money-laundering and finance for terrorism for which UBI Banca guarantees full cooperation with the competent authorities. Oversight of these issues, inclusive of the compliance function, is performed centrally in the Group by a special organisational unit, the Anti-Money Laundering and Claims Area, which reports to the Chief Risk Officer. This centralisation, which was already in operation for the network banks, was extended in 2014 to include UBI Leasing, UBI Factor and Prestitalia. The operational model is based on the following: • an effective IT system to manage customer risk profiles and to monitor transactions (according to the amount limits set by the relative legislation); • clear, exhaustive and easy-to-use internal regulations, systematically aligned with legislative regulations and the procedural innovations adopted; • procedural regulations which govern the acquisition and storage of documents to identify customers and record their financial profiles and to perform accounting and all other operations required – in full compliance with civil law regulations and anti moneylaundering legislation – and also accurate oversight and monitoring of data acquisition and storage. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the controls adopted, information (lists) is acquired from reliable and independent sources on terrorists and persons politically exposed and daily controls are carried out on the proper update of archives following updates of the lists in question. Special IT procedures have been developed or acquired from major software houses to support adequate verification of customers and complete and accurate recording of transactions and accounts in the “Single IT Archive” with reporting of suspect transactions . All transactions are subject to monitoring according to the amount limits set by the relative legislation by dedicated software applications in order to identify activities potentially connected with money-laundering or other illegal activities and the movements are subsequently subject to assessment by line and control functions. Investments continued in 2014 to develop support software for the creation of a new monitoring console for the enhancement of the Anti Money-Laundering Portal and for the development of dedicated indicators. Training activity also continued – as part of the 2013-2015 three-year programme – to further increase awareness among staff and develop a culture on the subject and to train them on the new regulations. A budget was allocated for 2015 for the ongoing improvement of anti money-laundering and anti-fraud systems and controls. [ 2.5, LA10, FS7] 83 Social Report 2014 Society SO2 By signing the Global Compact, the Group has committed itself to fighting all types of corruption BUSINESS UNITS within the sphere of its responsibilities. This crime is also contemplated in Italy as a “predicate ANALYSED FOR offence” falling within the sphere of Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 on the administrative liability CORRUPTION RISKS of businesses in implementation of which UBI Banca has adopted a model of organisation, management and control (Model 231/2001), which provides for rules and procedures designed to prevent the crimes covered by the decree from being committed, the creation of a Supervisory Body and reporting and penalty systems. The Internal Control Committee of the bank was identified to play the role of the Supervisory Body, formed in accordance with 49 of the Articles of Association as an internal committee of the Supervisory Board, in order to ensure the proper functioning and constant update of the model. In 2014 initiatives were commenced to verify proper implementation, within the overall internal regulations of the bank, of the oversight protocols to prevent crimes covered by Model 231/2001 from being committed. The protocols were updated with regard, amongst other things, to preventing corruption, in relation to amendments to the law and new crimes introduced by Law No. 190/2012 (the “Anti-Corruption Law”). The new crime pursuant to ’Art. 319 – quater of the Italian Criminal Code (improper incitement to give or promise profit) and the new crime of corruption between individuals (Art. 2635 of the Italian Civil Code) are of particular importance among these. In implementation of compliance processes for compliance with the new provisions of Law No. 186 of 15/12/2014 on the subject of “self laundering”, which has similarities in common with the crime of corruption, in 2015 the protocols and the overall 231/01 Model will be reviewed and examined for adequacy with respect to control of the new crime. All activities and organisational units are subject to verification connected with implementation of the 231/01 Model adopted by the Bank, while the Supervisory Body reports to the governing bodies on its adoption and effective implementation, the supervision of its functioning and oversight of its update. UBI Banca, as the Parent of the Group, informs subsidiaries of the policies it has set in relation to the prevention of crimes pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 and recommends general criteria which subsidiaries may follow. Each subsidiary adopts and periodically updates its own Organisational, Management and Control Model consistent with that of UBI Banca with support from the Parent’s compliance function for those companies that have granted a specific mandate for this. The Internal Audit Function carries out auditing activity on UBI Banca, on subsidiaries who have delegated internal audit function activities to the Parent and more generally, as part of the management and control duties of the Parent, on all Group companies. In compliance with international professional standards, the Internal Audit function also carries out on-site inspections of the operation and the appropriateness of the internal control and risk management system by means of an annual plan of activities submitted to the management and supervisory bodies of the above-mentioned subsidiaries and cumulatively to the management and supervisory bodies of the Parent. In compliance with the policies set and with the relative regulations, the Internal Audit Function also audits the completeness, adequacy, functioning and reliability of the other components of the control systems, the risk management process and other processes, with regard also to the ability to identify errors and irregularities. More specifically, in consideration of the need to support the Supervisory Board in the performance of its duties under legislation and regulations, and also to assist the Management Board, the Internal Audit Function, in relation to their importance, identified organisational units and processes affected by the impact of regulations concerning risk management (business, operational and compliance risk) and it also gave advisory support to project activities that impacted the internal control system and it verified through specific analyses of the system, the reliability of IT systems employed in the accounting records systems. In this respect the function carried out inspections of the organisational units of the Parent and its subsidiaries in relation to compliance by the relative staff, with external and corporate regulations including the Code of Ethics, to which the 231/2001 Model makes reference, and the related Code of Conduct for group personnel. 84 Social Report 2014 Society SO3 All employees are trained in anti-corruption policies and procedures as part of their training to EMPLOYEES TRAINED implement the project to revise the anti money-laundering model. ON ANTICORRUPTION In 2014 12,855 hours of specific training was carried out both in the classroom and through the ePOLICIES AND learning platform, for 3,067 employees. Anti-corruption policies and procedures were then also PROCEDURES. addressed as part of training on the principles derived from Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, which involved 9,845 employees for a total of approximately 44,500 hours. The training procedures LA10 differed according to the level of responsibility. SO4 No cases of corruption regarding Group personnel occurred either in 2014 or in prior years. ACTIONS TAKEN IN Extending the breadth of the reporting, no cases of corruption were even recorded in 2014 for RESPONSE TO suppliers with whom contracts have been signed. INCIDENTS OF CORRUPTION Public policies SO5 The Group contributes to the development of public policies and to the development of regulations PUBLIC POLICY specific to the banking sector through its active and constructive participation in the initiatives of DEVELOPMENT AND trade associations (e.g. Italian Banking Association, National Association of “Popular Banks”, Italian LOBBYING ACTIVITY Private Banking Association, Associazione fra le Società italiane per Azioni – association of joint stock companies) and other associations active in specific areas (e.g. Italian Anti Money-Laundering Association). These express the position of the sector on issues of interest, both on the request of the authorities (e.g. the Bank of Italy) and political decision-makers (e.g. Parliamentary Commissions) and by taking own initiatives. UBI Banca is a member of the Italian Advisory Board of the G8 “Social Investment Task Force” on social investment. Its purpose is to promote the development of a finance model able to generate profit and social and environmental value together. In 2014 the Italian Advisory Board published the report “The Finance which includes: social impact investments for a new economy”. No lobbying activities are conducted outside these areas.

Product responsibility Product responsibility in the financial services sector mainly regards observance of customer interests in commercial and marketing practices, the development of products and services capable of generating high social benefits for local communities and support for economic activities which create value for the community. Respect for the interests of customers is assessed from the viewpoint of the following: security (in terms of both business continuity and physical security in branches); labelling of products and services (in the sense of providing customers with transparent information); marketing communications (above all in terms of the proposals being appropriate to customer needs and profiles and the appropriateness of the commercial contact), respect for privacy (from the viewpoint both of protecting IT systems from data loss or unauthorised access to data and respect for customer consent for processing personal data for commercial and marketing purposes) and, more generally, compliance with legislation and regulations – including voluntary codes of conduct – which govern the sale and use of products and services. In Italy, all these aspects are governed by specific laws and sector regulations, which the Group applies through its own internal regulations. They are communicated to all personnel by means of a dedicated intranet and are the subject of specific refresher courses. Implementation of these regulations occurs through the following organisational and technical controls: • as regards organizational guards, the Chief Business Officer is responsible for operating activities and first level controls and the Chief Risk Officer, the Compliance Function and the Chief Audit Officer are responsible for second level controls; • the technical controls consist of dedicated support platforms for commercial activities (e.g. identification of customers to which determined products and services should be offered on the basis of an analysis of their particular life cycle and behavioural profile and therefore of their possible financial needs to be satisfied) and protection tools on IT systems. FS15 The Group has a specific process in place for the development of new products and services and for POLICIES FOR THE the modification of those already marketed. This process is designed to help achieve objectives of FAIR DESIGN AND compliance, technological innovation and competitiveness. SALE OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND In terms of quality, the process is designed to ensure that products and services are consistent with SERVICES the relative customer characteristics and needs and with reducing the time taken to respond to market demands (time-to-market) and it requires the involvement of different organisational units some of which at the Parent must always be involved: Communication and Marketing, Legal Affairs and Litigation, Risk Management, Administration and Tax, Compliance. More specifically, it is the duty of the Compliance Function to ensure that products and services placed on the market comply with regulations at all times, by preventing any misalignments with external and internal regulations, the most important of which is the Group’s Code of Ethics. The characteristics (e.g. age, occupation, investment plans) and needs of customers (e.g. financial, protection) are surveyed both through special consultation and interview procedures (e.g. focus groups with customers and potential customers and with commercial distribution network staff) or systematic procedures (e.g. the customer satisfaction survey project or complaints management [ PR5]) and through the analysis of competitor’s products and services. Active participation in observatories and working groups (e.g. through the Italian Banking Association) or research centre initiatives are also the source of valuable information, for example in relation to the possibilities offered by new technologies. The UBI Banca Group is constantly committed to innovating its product range, levering on rapidly evolving digital technology, to offer products and services that give a better customer experience in terms of ease-of-use and transparency. Those same guidelines also apply to communication, which follows evolving digital technology to provide customer contact channels that are clearer, faster and more interactive. 86 Social Report 2014 Product responsibility In order to ensure more focused and effective support for innovation, in 2014 the UBI Banca Group launched an important project entitled “Digital Innovation” which is also continuing in 2015. [ Reports and Accounts 2014 p. 54-55] Competitiveness is based on a pricing policy oriented towards transparency and fairness to customers and it involves analysis and constant monitoring of the relationships between the risk taken (if present), the return, the costs incurred and the market context. This is all done with account taken of the objective of providing financial support to local communities and businesses. FS16 Teaching proficient economic and financial expertise helps to create citizens who are INITIATIVES TO knowledgeable in their choice of banking financial products and services and also the growth of ENHANCE FINANCIAL democracy, legality and the competitiveness of local businesses and of the Bank itself. UBI Banca LITERACY understands that it can play a very important role in this and therefore it maintains and develops constant co-operation with knowledge centres (schools, universities, business schools, training institutes), which also allows it to cultivate and attract new talents. Activities in schools Again in the academic year 2013-2014 Group banks continued with their commitment to teaching on economics and financial subjects in schools in co-operation with the Financial education Foundation (the new organisation created by the Italian Banking Association to promote financial education and savings, previously carried out by the PattiChiari Consortium). The Group’s contribution – which represents a significant share of the total activity carried out by banks adhering to the initiative – is focused on three educational programmes that are now well established and which, which have been updated and enhanced, partly as a result of the support from academics and communication experts as follows: for primary school children, to stimulate initial thinking about the value of money and the need to manage it responsibly, for themselves and for the community, with a view to knowledgeable citizenship; to introduce secondary school pupils to economic and financial subjects and to stimulate them to reflect on the principal functions of finance, by illustrating their impact on people’s everyday lives; to teach economics and financial subjects, by introducing upper secondary school children to the social, professional and economic reality that surrounds them. At the end of the course, taught in the classroom, the project involves a “Develop your business idea” competition, with the preparation of a business plan for the start-up of a socially useful enterprise in the local community. Group banks made their own contribution to additional financial education projects for pupils: “Economic Citizenship” (over 2,500 pupils involved in the country as a whole) and “Develop your business idea”, the last stage of an educational programme for senior high school pupils which involves the preparation of a business plan for a business idea. In 2014 the first and the second prizes of the “Develop your business idea” competition were awarded to schools supported by Banca Popolare di Bergamo and Banca Carime. Banca Regionale Europea organised the second edition of a literary competition for pupils in the first year of secondary schools in Liguria who, after participating in a junior financial education programme and after receiving further ideas on knowledgeable use of money, were invited to write 87 Social Report 2014 Product responsibility stories on the subject. The best stories were read out during an event organised in Genoa and the best three won the recognition of being published in full in an important daily national newspaper. Important activities were also carried out by Banca di Valle Camonica with the organisation of educational events on the subjects of financial markets and how they function, usury, payment cards and innovative payment systems (around 300 pupils were involved). The Parent, UBI Banca, also helped to spread a culture of economics by co-operating with schools on work-school alternation projects. During the academic year and during the summer, students in the third and fourth grades of high schools received classroom education and on-the-job training.

Active arrangements exist with the MIP-Milan Polytechnic, with the Bergamo University School of Management, with the Turin University Management Department and with the Einaudi Studies Centre. Co-operation with the Marches Polytechnic University was continued on the “World Campus” project to facilitate the international training of students through internships at the Group’s units abroad, while Bergamo University developed the project UBI Global transaction with which job experience periods were increased by the creation of training courses for students on three-year courses. The range of extracurricular internships offered for students on specialist degree courses was also increased. For its own young people with potential for growth, the Group has introduced (through UBI Academy) first and second level University Masters courses lasting 18 months focused on subjects related to the operations of banks and during the year it organised an employer branding programme to maintain and improve its positioning as a “top ideal employer” for young university graduates. Organisation of events Each year the Parent and the network banks organise training and educational events on topical economic subjects, which represent important opportunities in terms of visibility and involvement, as well as providing a service to customers and to society in general. The most important event in this sense is the annual series of meetings for the presentation of the “Report on the Global Economy and Italy” published by the Einaudi Centre. The presentation of the XIX edition entitled “A desperate need to grow” attracted over 2,500 participants in 17 towns and cities. As part of support for the internationalisation of Italian small to medium-sized enterprises, the Group not only participated in conventions and conferences through its representatives who spoke at them, but it also organised and/or sponsored various events as follows: • the “UBIWORLD Open Day” held in Bergamo at Km Rosso and Turin, for all firms who show an interest in foreign markets. The businesses that took part had the opportunity to 88 Social Report 2014 Product responsibility learn of the UBI GO TO WORLD project and to meet Group specialists assisted by outside professionals from all over the world and the managers of UBI Banca’ representative offices abroad; • the Cathay Pacific Business Award, an important and prestigious acknowledgement for Italian companies that have excelled in business activities in South East Asia, demonstrating know-how, dynamism, innovation and creativity. UBI Banca took part as the exclusive banking sponsor in partnership with Cathay Pacific Airways; • the convention “Destination Italy, Fostering Outbound Investments into Italy”, designed to present M&A opportunities to attract investment into Italy, with the involvement of Chinese and Asian firms and funds and with local and Chinese speakers of the highest standing. Subsequently the Italian ambassador in China requested support from UBI Banca to organise a similar event in Peking; • the conference, EXPORTour United Arab Emirates The development basis for our business”, organised by Promos in co-operation with Banca Popolare di Bergamo for those interested in the commercial potential of this country and in business and co-operation opportunities offered by Lombard companies; • Global Transaction, a three-day event organised for foreign correspondents from banks in selected countries (Algeria, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Russia), designed with the objective of increasing integration in terms of corporate customer service and increasing volumes of incoming business for the Group.

TO SUCH Operational continuity is guaranteed by a special plan, which involves both a series of technical PROCEDURES and organisational measures designed to ensure that the most critical processes will be operational even in emergency situations and also a series of periodic disaster recovery controls and tests. With regard to physical safety and security, activities continued to upgrade systems in branches and in particular for emergency exits and medical emergency alarm systems equipment in accordance with Legislative Decree No. 81/08. A new more technologically advanced medical emergency alarm system has been designed, equipped with software which monitors functionality constantly, which will be installed gradually from the first half of 2015. With regard to the risk of robbery in particular, security and control processes were improved, according to standards set by specific Group policy, by testing and upgrading security performance where necessary, by installing new technologically advanced systems (e.g. “Virtual Guard” remote video surveillance systems) and by monitoring the work of personnel responsible for inspecting alarms.

Information is provided in observance of the privacy consent given by customers, who may at any time request either via email or directly to staff for commercial communications to cease. Actual correspondence of activities to the commitments assumed is monitored and assessed through customer satisfaction surveys [ PR5]. PR4 Some proceedings were closed in 2014 by some Group banks and companies which had concerned INCIDENTS OF NONnon-compliance with regard to transparency and integrity in customer relationships.

In 2014 over 110 thousand individual and business customers were interviewed together with 12 thousand customers of other banks to construct a benchmark comparison. The level of satisfaction is measured through the Customer satisfaction index UBIndex, a summary index which measures the 62 60 60 60 quality perceived by UBI Banca customers 60 58 58 57 57 58 (calculated monthly by bank, market, segment, 56 55 56 56 55 local management area and branch) and that is 54 one of the determining criteria for the Group 52 50 50 staff incentive scheme.. 48 46 The level of customer satisfaction increased 44 again in 2014 in all markets. Over 60% of Retail Market Corporate Market Private Banking Market customers interviewed felt that the Group was Benchmark 2014 2014 2013 2012 able to establish a good relationship with customers, while one point requiring attention is the adequacy of the range of products and services, for which one third of the interviewees expressed a positive judgement.

Satisfaction of individual and small business customers with UBI Banca’s financing and investing activities was also high. It was lower on other aspects such as support for the creation of new businesses (e.g. financing for the start of a new business, support for the development of business abilities). Finally, approximately two thirds of customers considered it important that the Group reports on social responsibility and those that consulted the reports expressed positive judgements on them. A survey of UBI Community social bonds [ FS7] found a genuine market interest in the supply of socially responsible investment instruments: • 74% of subscribers had never made an investment with social aims before; • the chance to support a high social value initiative was a determining factor in the decision to purchase by 80% of subscribers; • 95% of investors would subscribe a social bond again. A survey on awareness of the UBI Banca brand was repeated again in 2014, which found that it was known by almost 70% of interviewees (up 10 percentage points compared with the 2013 survey) and that 58% of interviewees have a positive propensity to choose UBI Banca for opening a new account. In addition to the structured “Consultation Project” surveys, particular attention is given to the complaints management process in order to improve customer relationships. Better handling of this is provided by a new direct and preferential channel between the distribution network and the central units responsible for solving problems reported by customers. Staffing at branches or belonging to private-corporate banking units are therefore put in a position to contact customers again and solve problems very rapidly. Complaints The analysis and management of complaints are activities that play a key role in the Group’s customer care system and represent an essential process in that system for the progressive improvement of customer satisfaction. The complaints management system involves the following: • parent units are responsible for policy-setting and co-ordination functions in order to guarantee greater standardisation of procedures, partly through setting official guidelines on important issues, but while respecting the independence of the network banks and product companies; • a proactive role is played by the managers of operating units who are given the task of directly investigating the underlying reasons for the complaints; • information on the whole process of the management of a complaint is tracked and made available (case tracking) using centralised software. A variety of channels are available to customers for making complaints. In addition to local branches and other traditional channels (post and fax) there are also email and the websites of the network banks and the Parent and the telephone customer service. All the available channels are advertised on information pamphlets pinned up in branches and dedicated sections of the Group’s websites.
