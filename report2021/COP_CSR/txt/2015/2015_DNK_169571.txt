We were able to expand on our promise to assist humanitarian missions worldwide by supplying various UN organisations with a wide range of trucks for different purposes. We are particularly proud of our ability to support the World Food Programme in South Sudan with IVECO trucks within just 2 weeks of Purchase Order. This past year our dedicated team at Kandahar Airfield also supported the international forces with deconstruction and remediation of camps upon their withdrawal from Afghanistan. It is important to us that proper remediation is conducted upon withdrawal of international forces and/or humanitarian missions in order to reduce lasting negative impacts and to restore the local environment and habitat. We intend to further expand our services within this area and expect much of it in the years to come. We are constantly looking for opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint. To this end, we are optimising our operations and developing environmental friendly products in close cooperation with our business partners. In 2015, we wish to further improve our work with the UN Global Compact’s (UNGC) ten principles and also the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Overall, our goal is to provide something better for more people using the right resources.

Copenhagen Group has been an active subscriber to the UNGC since 2009. In 2014, we made progress on most of the UNGC’s ten principles, further implementing these principles in our business activities: Human Rights Treating all people with respect and honouring national and international laws and regulations for the protection of human rights remain our top priorities and guiding principles in all our business relations. By supporting national election commissions worldwide with our electoral products, we aim to promote democracy through free and fair elections. Supporting Free and Fair Elections We also continue to support the Orchid Project to end female genital cutting by providing funding, office and meeting space for the Danish branch of the organisation. Equal opportunities for all employees irrespective of gender or ethnicity continue to be a focus area of ours. We hire, remunerate and promote employees on the basis of skills, competences and performance – not according to gender, religion or race. Labour Following our certification according to OHSAS 18001 on Occupational Health and Safety in 2013, we continue to focus on employee health, safety and well-being. We aim to take good care of our employees no matter the geographical location. We would rather forego profit than risking the lives and well-being of our employees. It is of paramount importance to us that all our employees feel safe and secure both during and outside working hours. Hence, in Kuwait, we installed a new security system to control and monitor the access to our offices to further enhance the safety and security of our employees. We offer employees flexible working hours to accommodate and respect employees’ family life. By changing our IT set-up in 2014, we have made it easy and convenient for employees to work remotely thereby further enhancing flexibility in work. Training Local Companies in Health, Safety and Environment We also continuously aim to improve our working environment, both physically and psychologically. To this end, we chose to adopt a smoke-free policy in our Middle East offices although not required by national law. Externally, we have supported local companies and institutions in Greenland to develop and implement guidelines and processes for occupational health, safety and environmental issues. Protecting the fragile environment in the Arctic and its inhabitants is important to us. 5 COPENHAGEN GROUP UNGC COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2014 Environment We care deeply for the environment and always strive to reduce the environmental impact of our operations to the greatest extent possible. Dogsledding, Sisimiut, Greenland By optimising our own operations and working closely with our partners we aim to ship the vast majority of our goods by sea to reduce our carbon footprint. By removing desk dustbins from the office and instead sorting our garbage in big containers, we have been able to not only increase the recycling of paper but also reduce the amount of paper consumed following our heightened focus on this subject. We now also undertake remediation of camps sites to help restore the local environment and habitat following withdrawal of international forces from conflict countries and regions. Help Restore the Local Environment Anti-Corruption We continue to practice our “Open Book” policy with both business partners and customers. We act with integrity and are accountable to stakeholders for our actions and relationships.
