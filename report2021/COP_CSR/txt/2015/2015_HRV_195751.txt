Corporate socially responsible operation is a common business practice of the modern society, which greatly affects the evaluation of the business performance of each company. As each individual should strive to live in harmony with the nature, so every company must endeavor to operate in harmony with the environment. Therefore, in contemporary management of companies it is extremely important to constantly work on developing and implementing a strategy of corporate socially responsible operations, and to inform its stakeholders on it. A report that you are currently reading is intended for all stakeholders in the ADP Group for a more detailed reference on the activities and results of the ADP Group in 2013 and 2014 in terms of the business sustainability. In order to further develop the socially responsible operations of our company and continue this positive trend, we have launched a series of our own activities, and also joined some socially beneficial actions. We have continued to act proactively in the form of educating our employees and making them more aware of the issues of respecting the human rights, a healthy personal development and socially affirmative action. We have supported and actively participated in the project aimed at sensitizing the business community on the need to employ the disabled persons. In this project, the AD Plastik has allowed students with disabilities to perform their work practices in the company with the possibility of their subsequent employment. In 2014, the middle and senior management in the AD Plastik underwent training on the “Anti-Bribery and Corruption Measures’ within which a desirable mode of behavior in problematic situations was shown in practical examples. Although our market is imposing new business challenges on us daily, requiring that should be prepared to respond to them, our vision and goals are clear. We want to be a leading manufacturer of plastic car parts on the market of Eastern Europe, which surely can be achieved. With the creativity, innovation, determination and effectiveness that are all important characteristics for achieving our goals, in the contemporary business world it is highly important to adapt to market changes and meet the demands of customers and all our stakeholders. The AD Plastik is a company that has shown for many years of operation now that it can respond to all challenges, which gives us security and motivation for successful implementation of our plans. We are satisfied with the achieved results because they show the positive developments, and it is only the beginning of the realization of our plans and objectives that we have very ambitiously set in the strategy on the development of the ADP Group socially responsible business operations. We are open for all your suggestions, comments and criticisms in order to reach our goals in the field of sustainable business further progress as soon as possible and as easier as possible.

Description of key impacts and opportunities AD Plastik belongs to the prestigious supply chain of some of the world’s largest automobile manufacturers, and its success is also based on the monitoring of global trends and market development along with adherence to high standards of quality and competitiveness. The automotive industry is very resource-intensive at the stage of car production, and operation stage and at the stage of disposal if the vehicles are not being recycled. Car manufacturers and all their suppliers are aware of their responsibilities and the need for constant development and improvement of materials and products to reduce the environmental impact not only during production but also during use and disposal of the final product. In its development program AD Plastik has an ongoing process of research and development in order to improve production. The results of this improvement lead to a reduced consumption of resources and better utilization of energy and materials in order to reduce environmental impact and thus, consequently, improvement of competitiveness of products on the market. The long-term survival of AD Plastik depends on the success of this process, and our success in it is shown by the fact that that we are still one of the most wanted automotive suppliers, as well as the Renault award for socially most responsible supplier that we have recently received. In the strengthening of environmental standards and increasing the criteria that follow the environmental impact of our industry we see an opportunity to point ourselves in the process of continuous investment in reducing the impact in front of our competitors and to achieve even better results. 9 3.0 Organizational Profile The AD Plastik d.d. is the largest Croatian manufacturer of plastic parts for the automotive industry.

Suppliers are required to ensure the delivery of the top quality products and services at the most competitive price and on time. As the ADP is an international company, a supplier selection is performed on a multiple basis. The ADP carries out a survey of its suppliers twice a year. When running an evaluation of a prospective supplier, the following criteria are being checked for: the assessment of the quality systems and the environmental protection, delivery time, flexibility, ordered and delivered quantities, period of performance, quality, number of complaints and resolving complaints. The results of the survey of suppliers on issues of sustainable business operations are shown below. Description 2012 2013 2014 Number of Surveyed Suppliers 102 107 107 Number of suppliers that are certified to ISO 14001 55 59 72 Percentage of suppliers that are certified ISO 14001 53.92% 55.14% 67.29% Table 7. Results of the survey of suppliers on the issues of sustainable business operations According to the responses from a questionnaire conducted on the issues of sustainable business operations of suppliers from 2014, only 4.68% of suppliers who responded to the questionnaire had a rating of less than seven (out of a maximum 15 points). These suppliers were given a written notification of the results of the survey and were asked to take the necessary steps needed to improve the assessment earned in the questionnaire on the sustainable business operations of suppliers. 4.6. customers Relationship Customers of the ADP are the world’s largest car manufacturers and their subcontractors, and in order to become their supplier in the first place it is necessary to meet all their regulatory requirements. The first prerequisite for such business cooperation with the customer is that the product complies with all the applicable legal regulations of the country in which the AD Plastik sells its product. Another prerequisite to be met is complying with all the specific requirements of customers. 30 These requirements include the following: • Definition of the conditions of work and communication with a specific customer in the phase of development and mass production; • Requirements for the product that are specified by the customer, including the requirements for delivery and activities following delivery; • Requirements that the customer did not specify, but which are necessary for the specified use; • Additional requirements set by the company. The processes relating to the identification of customer requirements The processes relating to the identification of the customer requirements and the requirements of other interested parties include the following processes: 1. Pre-Sales Process consisting of: • Adjustments in the requirements for quality and special characteristics related to the product; • Fulfillment of obligations in relation to the product, including legal and normative references; • Fulfilling legal and other binding requirements; • Compliance with the requirements of environmental protection. 2. Sales Process consisting of: • The realization of the planned sale and the delivery on time, in the agreed quality and within the planned costs; 3. Post-Sales Process consisting of: • Collecting feedback on the quality of products and services, and taking preventive and corrective actions to improve the quality of the products and processes; • Collecting feedback related to the environmental protection. Planning product design and product development Planning and management of the product design and development is determined through the following steps: • Phases of design and development; • Checking, verification and validation of each phase of design and development; • Responsibilities and authorities for design and development. 31 Special features associated with the product/process as specified by the customer are an integral part of the quality planning process for the new product/process and the control plan, including: • All the characteristic related to the product/process; • Defined customer requirements regarding the use of symbols (mark for the characteristic of the product/process); • Documentation requirements of the customer and other interested parties relating to the product/process. Verification of the design and development is a process that provides an overview of the compliance of the output data to the input data of the design and development. Verification of the design and development is carried out in accordance with the schedule of the project. Validation of the design and development is the result of a continuous assessment procedure, which proves that the production process is capable of providing the product complied with the requirements of the customer. The purpose of the phases of development of the product/process and other certain steps is to check the compliance of the characteristics of the product/process with the requirements set in specifications. The project is concluded with the customer’s certification that the product meets the requirements, and that the manufacture process is able to secure the required amounts of product in the required quality. The results of controls and tests of the product are recorded in the prescribed documentation for this, and then archived as required, and they serve: • to demonstrate the quality of the product, tracing back to the input materials, process flows to the finished product; • to find the cause and place of the poor quality occurrence, in order to take corrective action; • to improve the process. Records of controls and tests are to be presented to the customer on its request. All products have the quality and features confirmation, and they are safe and health friendly in their use. When it comes to product, constant care is kept about: • the correct and useful labels and the availability of all information necessary for the proper handling and use; • the secure disposal after the end of their period of use in accordance with the legal provisions; • the compliance with all other regulations and standards. 32 Product policy after the end of the product life cycle Most of the ADP products are the products made of plastic. To minimize the environmental impact that a vehicle exercises after the end of its life cycle, together with our customers, we are taking care of improving the recyclability of the plastic parts in vehicles. The ADP Customers have developed the indicators of recycling for their suppliers, and for the ADP as well. These indicators allow the assessment of the life cycle and the integration of the possibilities for recycling from the design phase, negotiations with the customer, measurements of the progress made, and advances in the environmentally friendly design. All the ADP products meet these requirements as set by customers. Care for the health and safety of the end customer Since the ADP products are first installed in vehicles and only then sold to end customers, the ADP as a manufacturer of car parts of the final product must take care of the health and safety of the customer. For this purpose, it must meet the specific requirements required by the car manufacturer. This is particularly evident in the automotive interior products, because these parts of the car must meet the highest requirements of safety and security of passengers in the car. Each product undergoes special tests for the health and safety conducted by the car manufacturers in order to ensure that the car parts are completely safe for the end customer. 33 4.6.1. product Liability The quality of all products is regulated by the customers, the world’s largest car manufacturers. The product management is a concept by which the principle of the protection of human health and environmental protection focus on the product itself and everyone involved in the product life cycle take responsibility for reducing the impact of the product on health and the environment. 2012 2013 2014 Development of the product concept Yes Yes Yes Research and development Yes Yes Yes Certification Yes Yes Yes Manufacture Yes Yes Yes Re-use and recycling Yes Yes Yes Table 8. Product lifecycle phases in which the improvement of their impact on health and safety is assessed (PR1) 34 The ADP Group has not had any cases of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes regarding the impact of products on health and safety during their life cycle (PR2) for the last three years. Also, the ADP Group, in the same period, has not had any cases of non-compliance with the regulations and voluntary codes concerning the product information and labeling. (PR4) 4.7. Community Related Relationship The AD Plastik d.d. of Solin has made a series of activities aimed at its employees and the community. For the purposes of this report, only the most important ones are being referred to here. Voluntary Blood Donation In cooperation with the Red Cross, the first voluntary blood donation was organized in the factory in Solin, which was used to establish a club of voluntary blood donors in the AD Plastik. 31 workers responded to this call for action, and 16 of them donated blood. The fact that for the 10 of them this was the first blood donation which they have ever attended speaks of the success of organizing such action. 35 Trash art project The Museum of the town of Kastel and the AD Plastik organized the work of the sculpture colony in the area of the external storage in Solin, from which the sculptors created two sculptures out of the waste material intended for the public space of the town of Kastel. The scrap or the waste within the company was used, which served the artists as an inspiring creative material. The packaging cardboard, paper of all kinds, films, pieces of plastic, fenders, boxes, canvas, rubber hoses, aluminum, plastic and wire coils, and the use of the factory space were the contributions by the ADP to the implementation of this project by young artists. Since the beginning of 2014, the collaboration of the ADP with the young architects and designers of the town of Sinj has been ongoing, who in their projects at the Academy of Fine Arts, and at children’s workshops, used the waste multi-layered cardboard packaging for the granules from the nozzle facilities of the factory. The project of the mutual learning and development is another in a series of the ADP cooperation projects with the local community. The project aims to make the individual community members or groups familiar with the industrial manufacture and the ADP in general. Dozens of individual and group visits were realized through this project. Recycled materials On the eves of Christmas and the New Year 2014, cooperation with a designer, Ms. Mia Perdic Lukacevic of Split, was agreed upon, who designed 10 women bags labeled “100% made in the ADP”. The bags were made entirely from materials used in the manufacture: textiles, belts, rubber hoses, ribbons, ‘spacers’, boxes, foils, decorative aluminum strips used for the extrusion, and the like. The bags were used as a gift to a few business partners. 36 4.7.1. Help, Donations Paid Towards Various Associations and Natural Persons The ADP Group is working on identifying the specific needs of the local community and aims to develop and build the partnership relations based on mutual understanding and support.

Employment The basis for planning the recruitment of new employees is a business plan in the framework of which the experience), and at it, we prefer the innovative people with a strong desire to succeed in business and to need for people with clearly defined skills, knowledge work fair in teams that are willing to build mutual trust and skills should be specified. Through a recruitment and respect, and be directed towards achieving busiplan, a calendar of employment as a source of recruitness goals. Ensuring the competitive ability of the orment is envisaged. The standard selection procedure ganization in the long run is in the interest of the ADP involves two rounds of interview with the candidates Group; therefore we employ young professionals, and and the psychological testing. The key criterion when at the same time appreciate the people with life and selecting new employees is the excellence and comwork experience. petence for the job post (aptness, knowledge, skills, 38 Table 10.

Also, in early 2015 there was a change in the definition of the type of work, therefore in the next reporting period, a totally different shares are to be expected. However, this typology will not be comparable with the previous data. 40 Figure 19.

The total rate of the employee fluctuation in the ADP Group for 2013 and 2014 (LA2) As part of the corporate socially responsible operations, it is understood to lack a distinction between the employees on permanent and temporary basis (LA3). Accordingly, all the privileges and rights of the employees who work full time are applicable to employees who work temporarily or part-time. In the spirit of respecting the wisdom of life and work experience, should there be a need, we shall engage our seniors to continue to contribute and to transmit their knowledge to younger colleagues. The increased employment of direct employees in 2014 in Croatia was related to the Edison project and it significantly affected the structure of the ADP Group employees through a variety of characteristics. 43 5.2. Management and Employees Relationship The collective agreement is applied to all employees in Croatia, while in Russia is applied in the plant PHR where the majority of workers are employed (about 80%). ADP Kaluga is a newly established company in Russia and the employees of that company are familiar with the rights and obligations of the Rules of Procedure, Regulations and Safety at Work and Regulations on work organization and internal order. Last collective bargaining defining the rights and obligations of employers and workers were carried out in early 2014. Collective agreements covered a total of 85% of the employees of ADP Group and the remaining rights and obligations are governed by different regulations in accordance with legal provisions (LA4). In the AD Plastik d.d. Croatia, there are three active trade unions, and in Russia, at the location of the PHR factory, there is one. There is also a Council of Employees as a representative body of all employees of the AD Plastik. Under the Law on Labour, an obligation of the employer is the quarterly report on changes in the business operations. The Council shall give its opinion on those changes, and it co-decides on all issues relevant to business operations. In addition to quarterly reports, the communication with the Council of Employees is to be performed more frequently, if necessary, (LA5). 5.3. Health and Safety at Work As part of the Department of the Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases and the Teaching Institute for Public Health in the County of Split Dalmatia, Counseling was founded to point out the risk of mass chronic diseases to our citizens, which partly depends on an individual’s heritage, but largely it depends on the way of life. During the months of March and June 2014, the advisory work was performed in the premises of the AD Plastik d.d. in Solin, aimed at preventing chronic diseases. In a survey, 137 employees participated at the location of Solin. The examination included measurement of blood pressure, body weight, height, waist circumference, body mass index determination, the percentage of fat and muscle mass, as well as determining the value of glucose and cholesterol in blood. Each participant was given advice depending on the state of his or her body (LA8). At the same time, also in March 2014, the first voluntary blood donation activity was organized in collaboration with the Red Cross of the town of Solin, which was held at our site in Solin. Preventive health examinations of employees To prevent the occurrence of the cardiovascular diseases and the heart disease and stroke, and in cooperation with the Institute of Public Health, the County of Split-Dalmatia, the ADP has organized and carried out medical examinations involving 248 employed of the Branch Unit in Solin. Based on the results, this kind of examination has been proved as completely justified and it stressed the need to have it organized in other factories as well (LA8). 44 5.4. Training and Education The distribution of the invested time to specific groups of topics varies according to the assessment of needs and priorities. In the parent company, it was more focused on the acquisition of expertise, and in the manufacture facilities both at home and abroad, it was more focused on the manufacture and technological processes. However, what is common to all of them is a concern for the safety and health of the employees. That is why the most topics were represented from that field throughout 2014 (LA10). Protection and safety at work Specific customer requirements Applied technologies Managerial know how Implemented business operation processes Figure 24. Distribution of development topics in the ADP Group in 2014 Number of training hours 2013 2014 Figure 25.

Number of hours of training per employee and category, in the ADP Group in 2013 and 2014 (LA10) Education of employees for the purpose of continuous development of competencies is a key management responsibility, therefore it is very important that those on top positions are fully committed to and involved in the process. In addition to assigning an employee to external training, we promote knowledge sharing within the organization, and for this purpose we have developed an internal training catalog, which contains the systematized educational topics. It was also published on the intranet sites of the Company. With the process of integration into the business, through which each new employee undergoes in order to achieve self-reliance in the work in the shortest possible time, the process of mentoring is also being carried out. It is a process in which an experienced and competent mentors share their knowledge in the field of their expertise, directing the careers of those who are preparing themselves for more demanding and more responsible positions. During 2014, 29 mentoring process were completed, where the level of expertise was raised by approximately 50%, compared to the initial knowledge, and 56 new processes were initiated. In addition to monitoring the progress of the mentored employees, the mentors are also being taken care of, in order to provide a comprehensive insight into the processes of the transmission of knowledge and values, and monitor the quality of the overall process (LA11). 46 Given the large increase in production employees A higher number of training hours / employee in 2013 was a result of increased employment in the territory of the Russian Federation. because of the implementation of the Edison project, a process of assessing the efficiency of the work was launched in December 2014. The objec12% tive of assessing the efficacy is to determine the 10% quality of the integration process and competence 8% 6% of workers. The set goals have been achieved with 4% the assessment, and the process shall continue in 2% other services as well (LA12). 0% 2013 2014 The share of employees who receive feedback on their work and career development; the ADP Group 5.4.1. Time invested in the development of employees in the organization The distribution of the invested time per the specific groups of topics varies according to the type of activity. Thus, in the AD Plastik d.d., the distribution is more focused on the acquisition of expertise, and in the manufacture facilities at home and abroad on the manufacture and technological processes. However, what is common to all of them is a concern for the safety and health of employees.

Assessing the effectiveness of production employees In the past year, in branch units a large number of employees was employed or deployed from the less complex job posts (the implementation of the EDISON project). During December 2014, the process of assessing the efficiency of performance was launched, with the aim of: • determining the quality of the integration of new employees into operations • determining the status of the competence of employees • identifying talents • identifying employees with inadequate performance 49 Number of employed / deployed Months / 2014 Number of employed / deployed Months / 2014 The assessment encompassed direct employees in a broader sense, who have completed the program of the introduction to their work, and who have been trained to work independently. The “direct employees in a broad sense” means the employees involved in the mass serial manufacture whose number fluctuates according to operating plans, and who work in the “manufacture routine” on tasks of rework, quality control, handling goods in the manufacture plant, handling and storage operations, and activities of maintenance of machines/tools. 50 5.4.3. Mentoring The ADP Group launched 56 mentoring processes in 5 locations (Solin, Zagreb, Mladenovac, Kaluga, PHR) and in 3 countries (Croatia, Serbia, and Russia). In collaboration with 27 mentors, 17 training programs were designed in eight business areas (process technology; construction; logistics; manufacture, human resources, quality, sales and technical operations) for 7 technologies (injectionmoulding; thermoforming headliners; thermoforming carpets; foaming; NT; painting; extrusion). During 2014, 29 mentoring process were completed, where the level of expertise was raised by approximately 50% compared to the initial (input) knowledge. The quality of the mentoring process is continuously monitored through quarterly reports of the mentored employees, in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the processes in the transfer of knowledge and values.

Annual testing of employees’ satisfaction and motivational factors Through an internal workshop ‘Working ambiance’, we introduced the management at all levels with the basics of the theory of the motivation and influence of the employees’ satisfaction on the success of the work performance, improvement in performance effects, productivity and efficiency. The annual examination of the working ambiance was conducted, and the analysis of the results showed that our employees were most satisfied with the competence of their immediately superiors and colleagues, which confirms that the company has the quality staff that is capable of dealing with the business challenges the company is facing. Furthermore, in cooperation with the management, the necessary actions to further increase the satisfaction will be taken, taking into account the needs of the employees and the company. 5.5. Diversity and Equal Opportunities Within the management structure of the ADP Group, the most employees aged 30 to 45 are in line management, and 30 to 40 in the middle management, while the top management has the most employees aged 45 to 55. Also, there is a significant share of employees older than 50 years of age, which equals 18% at the level of the group. The share of women in top management (management, administration, executive managers and directors) at the level of the group equals 30% (LA13). 2014. Top 29.730% management 2013. 23.256% 2014.

Educational structure of the ADP employees in 2013 and 2014 By continuous improvement of production processes, introduction of new technologies and responding to the increased needs of the market we open opportunities for new employments. Planning is carried out before the start of the calendar year, a new employments include also the internal employments resulting from employee career development. In the previous period, the arrivals of employees increased, and this is a result of the start in the serial mass manufacture per the Edison project and employment of experts of all profiles and age, which reinforced our team in different areas, with special emphasis put on manufacture units. In addition to the legal obligation of employing the disabled people, for some time now, and with the cooperation of the Centre ‘Mir’, the ADP has provided employment for two people with mental disabilities, who take care of the environment maintenance. At our site in Solin, as part of the “Experience is priceless” Project, a disabled female student is at her student practice internship. After completing the formal induction period, she remained engaged in other 54 job positions, and she is currently writing her graduation thesis in collaboration with the department of construction. Through 2013, there were no students or high school student engaged through any of the relevant services. In 2014, there were 60 students temporarily hired through the student services in the period from September to October. As part of our cooperation with the universities, the ADP is open for the summer practical training that high school students and university students are required to do as part of their educational programs. So, in 2013, there were 9 university students, and in 2014, there were 6 high school students and 7 university students on practice in the different departments of the AD Plastik. The professional practice last for 2 weeks or a month on average. All the AD Plastik experts are often contacted by students and involved in mentoring them in the preparation of their seminar and diploma papers. Throughout the ADP Group, the basic salaries of the employee shall be determined according to the job post, which means that it is the same for all on the given job post, regardless of gender or any other feature of the employee. The salary for a given job post is determined on the base of the corresponding coefficients per the systematization of job posts, with the corresponding contributions to the salary, benefits and incentives being added as well. The additional remuneration of the employees are worth mentioning, which are regulated by the Rulebook on incentives, the Rulebook on remuneration of the proposals for improving and the Rulebook on small incentives for good performance (LA14). 5.6. Healthcare and Safety Promotion Legal provisions stipulate that employers with more than 250 employees and several plants, or plants in several locations outside their seat, must establish a central committee for occupational safety, whose task is to improve safety at work. The AD Plastik founded the Committee for Occupational Health and Safety, which meets at least once every three months. The manufacturing activity in itself carries a certain levels of risk that are more prominent than in other activities. Accordingly, a number of measures are being taken to increase the safety of employees and reduce the risk of injury during the manufacturing process and other aspects of the business operations. All employees are required to undergo special training in order to be fit for safe operation. The table below presents the number of hours of training in occupational health and safety per site. 55 Rates of injuries, occupational diseases, lost days and the number of death cases related to accidents at work 2012 Number of occupational Number of lost days Number of injuries Number of death cases diseases SOLIN 14 0 653 0 ZAGREB 9 0 117 0 MLADENOVAC 2 0 32 0 PHR 0 0 0 0 KALUGA 0 0 0 0 TOTAL 25 0 802 0 2013 SOLIN 5 0 129 0 ZAGREB 5 0 73 0 MLADENOVAC 0 0 0 0 PHR 3 0 61 1 KALUGA 0 0 0 0 TOTAL 13 0 263 1 2014 SOLIN 7 0 303 0 ZAGREB 7 0 245 0 MLADENOVAC 3 0 45 0 PHR 1 0 49 0 KALUGA 1 0 11 0 TOTAL 19 0 653 0 Table 11.

Employees Solidarity Fund The Agreement on help for the severely ill employees has been effective since 2001 in the AD Plastik. On the grounds of this Agreement, a monetary fund was established (on 31 December 2014, the Fund had 328 members), which primarily being funded by employees who voluntarily deposit it on a monthly basis, and in a minimum sum of HRK 10 per employee, during the payment of their salaries. The AD Plastik provides additional resources to the Fund in the amount that cannot be lower than the overall amount of the quarterly payment of employees. The Assets of the Fund are used as financial assistance in cases of the serious illness of employees, their spouses and/or their children until they gain back their working ability to the fullest. Since its establishment, 195 people used the financial assistance from the Fund. Year 2013 2014 Totally Paid by the Solidarity Fund 50,376.14 98,395.15 Table 12. The amount of help paid out to employees in HRK 5.8. Human Rights The ADP Group has adopted a Code of Business Conduct. This Code defines the rules of the business conduct to be applied in our daily relationships within the company and with external parties. The Code should be used as a guideline that will help build the social responsibility of employees of the Group and their empowerment. 57 5.8.1. Non-discrimination According to the Code of the ADP Group, every person who works in the company is to be treated equally with dignity and respect regardless of their race, religion, political belief, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, marital status, disability or any other characteristic which is protected by the national or local laws. For the implementation of this provision, there is a procedure in case of receiving an application for a violation of the Code of the ADP Group. In 2013, according to the above stated procedure, there were 4 reports of violations of the Code received (HR4). All applications received for the violation of the provisions were related to one person. Once all the circumstances of the reported events were examined, it was found that the applications were justified and appropriate measures were taken against the reported employee. In 2014, according to this procedure, there was not received a single report of violation of the Code (HR4). 5.8.2.

The environmental management and the principle of sustainable business operation are the basis of all business decisions of the company, as defined in the Code of Business Conduct of the ADP Group, the part of which relates to the protection of the environment. 6.1. Managing Chemical Substances REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals) is the EU legal framework for chemicals. Regulation (EC) no. 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of European community concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) entered into force on 1 June 2007, and it replaces a number of previous regulations and directives which regulated the area of chemicals in a unique system. REACH requires manufacturers and importers to register chemicals to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and sets out the obligations of manufacturers, importers and downstream users of substances on their own, in preparations and products, which are manufactured or imported to the EU in quantities above one tone, and provides specific information on these substances. The content of the required 60 documentation for registration depends on the quantity of substances being placed on the EU market. Manufacturers and importers are required to provide information about the properties of substances they produce or import, and the data used to evaluate the risks, and to identify and recommend the appropriate risk management measures. Without the information on substances they produce or import, manufacturers and importers may not place them on the market. The AD Plastik has taken all necessary measures, including the analysis of substances under REACH, requiring from all its suppliers, within and outside the European Union, to meet all the requirements set by REACH, and meet the requirements of the Guidelines of the Automotive Industry on REACH (The Automotive Industry Guideline on REACH ). 6.2. Material The AD Plastik has the knowledge, skills and experience in making different products using the following technologies: injection molding, profile extrusion, blow molding, thermoforming, polyurethane technology, plastic components painting.

However, a number of initiatives that have been undertaken in the AD Plastik for more efficient and more rational energy consumption do affect its reduction. The initiatives that have been taken to reduce the energy consumption include: • turning off the lighting and equipment for work after leaving the work premises, • installation of refrigeration plant (heat pickup), • installation of systems for monitoring the peak power and energy consumption, • installation of equipment for the maintenance of the audio and video conferencing, • installation of new energy-efficient manufacture equipment • implementing energy audits of buildings, • replacement of diesel forklifts with the gas forklifts, • retiring old and procuring the new company vehicles with better CO2/km emission factor for the needs of business trips, and their better organization. 67 Initiatives to manufacture energy-efficient products and create energy reduction as a result of these initiatives (EN6) Since the AD Plastik operates in the automotive industry, and, consequently, in a climate of strongly expressed demands for quality, the issues related to environmental protection are a part of the organizational culture. Special attention is given to those issues, from the understandable need to subordinate the relationship to the environment in which we live and work to the requirements for sustainable development. The initiatives for the manufacture of the energy efficient products are related to the development and manufacture of the environmentally friendly and more economical products. In order to reduce CO2 emissions in the environment, one of the primary goals of the automotive industry is to reduce the vehicle weight, or some of its components, without having any loss to functionality. In cooperation with its customers, the ADP participates in the development of these products, and following the confirmation by the customer, manufactures those products in mass serial production. Also, depending on the type and category of the vehicle, a trend of making products from recycled plastic is followed. The amount of the reduced consumption of energy as a result of these initiatives was not monitored. 68 6.4. Water Water consumption by source (EN8) The AD Plastik is being supplied with water from the public water supply system, and partially from its own wells, for which there is a concession. For the purposes of the technological processes, the water in the closed recirculation systems is used for cooling the machines/tools and in the process of paints and varnishes applications as water curtain and to humidify the air. The reduction in water consumption in 2014 was the result of many years of employee training on the rational use of water and the quick response in case of failure on the water supply pipeline system.
