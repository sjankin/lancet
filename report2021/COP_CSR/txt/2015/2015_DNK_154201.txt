We were at a table with people from SOS Børnebyerne, and they really hoped that enough money was raised for them to realise their project to fight exploitation of children in Cambodia. These people are genuinely enthusiastic about it, spending all their time and a lot of their money. It is incredibly exiting being in the company of such dedicated people , says Sivan.

Justitia was founded by Jacob Mchangama, who created offices with a well-reputed firm such as Kromann Reumert. the independent legal think tank focusing on civil rights and We were offered other offices, but in my view this was the basic rules of law after six years in the conservative-liberal perfect match indicating that we are serious. think tank, CEPOS. About the think tank, he says: Justitia has its own entrance and address, and there is no If you look at Denmark and compare it to many other overlap between Kromann Reumert's and Justitia's facilities, operations or otherwise. countries, we live in a good and free country. But there is still a development of drop by drop weakening of due process of law and rights for both citizens and businesses. I do not think we should take it for granted that we live in a free democracy. Those principles are historically relatively new and therefore they should be guarded. And it is our role to try and do that , Jacob Mchangama notes. At Kroman Reumert, we are happy to support the new think tank. We are very pleased to be able to help this good initiative to start up. Justitia has already proven that they contribute positively to a healthy debate about human rights and due process of law, and we support that , says managing partner Arne Møllin Ottosen who continues. It is important to us to fulfil our obligations under the UN Global Compact to support the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. We already do this through several of our pro-bono partnerships, so when Justitia approached us we saw it as an obvious opportunity to further expand our activities in this area. We considered how to best support Justitia and decided to offer them offices with us. And the help is most welcome, says Jacob Mchangama. It is a giant boost for us, partly that we do not have to spend money on rent, and partly that we are able to share PAGE 17 NEW SYSTEM FOR WE DEMAND CERWHISTLEBLOWER TAIN STANDARDS SCHEMES OF OUR SUPPLIERS We have developed software for a reporting To the greatest extent possible, we seek to cooperate with system and advised a large number of suppliers that have adopted an ambitious CSR policy and/or financial businesses, which, as from 1 meet the UN Global Compact principles or similar principles.
