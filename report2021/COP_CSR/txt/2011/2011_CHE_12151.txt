I also want to continue our commitment to social dialogue, particularly with international trade union organizations. As we endeavor to move towards more effective sustainable development, we must agree to measure and verify our progress, and do so publicly. I am delighted that Lafarge was among the top ten in the global ranking by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) of companies with the best approach to greenhouse gas reporting. The list of awards received by our business units in over fifteen countries, as well as the projects submitted by our employees recognized during our worldwide IdeaFactory competition, are a sure sign that all Lafarge employees have taken on the challenges of sustainable development. It is in this spirit of progress, innovation and collective effort that we continue our journey towards a more environmentally and sustainable world on behalf of our stakeholders. 2011 will mark an important new milestone for the Group as we define our new ambitions for the year 2020.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are produced by this system for the current and reference years, to measure progress against the Group Sustainability Ambitions and other targets. methodology Reporting standards The rules for computing the KPIs are consistent with the GRI G3 reporting standard. All elements for calculating KPIs are documented in a glossary specific to the cement, gypsum or aggregate and concrete businesses. Compliance with GRI G3 is documented online at http://sustainabilityreport.lafarge.com . Health and safety data is collected separately taking into account our internal guidelines and external best practice. The Group’s Social Policies Department conducts a separate survey on social data. The indicator on local stakeholder relationship management training is reported and controlled. Training on the Group methodology is organized around plant managers (in Cement and Gypsum) and area/ regional managers in Aggregates & Concrete. Our 2008 and 2009 reports were awarded an A+ rating against the GRI G3 guidelines; this is a standard we intend to maintain. Perimeter for consolidation The reporting covers all business units and their industrial production sites under the Group’s management control throughout the world. When a new site is acquired by Lafarge, procedures and definitions for sustainability data are not necessarily in line with Lafarge standards.
