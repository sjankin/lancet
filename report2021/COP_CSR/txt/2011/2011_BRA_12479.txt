USIMINAS 2 | 3 Contents 2010 Usiminas Annual Report Message from the Board of Directors The year 2010 brought about challenges never before experienced by the Brazilian steel industry. The new global economic order and the position of Brazil in this environment created a scenario of solid growth and fierce competition, which required an intense adaptation of the strategies of all players. Usiminas responded accordingly to the challenges presented by the market. It is worth pointing out that Brazil is in a unique situation. The privileged position of foreign exchange reserves, which provides stability and a comparative advantage over other economies, enabled the country to become a part of the group of countries selected for investments, which has contributed to economic growth, as well as to the appreciation of our currency. The currency appreciation and slow growth in the developed countries have triggered a striking phenomenon of steel imports into the country, which resulted in a significant change in market conditions. The domestic industry was also affected by the sharp increase in the cost of most raw materials for the production of steel. As a natural reaction to protect its share, it reduced its margins. A pronounced increase in inventory followed across the entire steel production chain. This scenario found Usiminas in the process of resuming its production. It must be acknowledged that this was a period of great internal effort to readjust the operations, which had the support and understanding of our clients. This was only possible thanks to the ties developed through years of closeness and trust in the quality of the products and services rendered.

The strategic first half of the year and the new reality in prices should reduce the share of imported steel and increase local option was, therefore, to intensify the program of investments in the existing plants, which should result production. Brazil has established itself as a prominent country in the global steel industry, where efficiency in increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the Company. These conditions are indispensable for prevails throughout the chain, which reinforces the focus of Usiminas on the enhancement of productivity. facing the new challenges. We are certain that the investments made in recent years in increasing the quality of products to meet specific market segments, such as exploration of the pre-salt region, will also lead to results for the Company. We also identified the opportunity to harness the full potential for energy generation from our own plants, as well as to achieve greater efficiency in consumption. These practices are fully aligned with our goal of The ability to adapt to the business environment reveals Usiminas’s preparedness to achieve its strategic promoting sustainable development. For Usiminas, sustainability is also an attribute of competitiveness vision, which is to be a steel group with global reach that is innovative, sustainable and among the most and value creation as it ensures that the Company is forward-thinking. profitable groups in the sector.

If on one hand the Brazilian economy showed remarkable resilience after the crisis, with growth of annual GDP of 7.5%, on the other the steel industry and various other industrial chains did not fully benefit from this market recovery. The main reasons for this paradox were not just the traditional economic problems such as high taxes, logistical bottlenecks, lack of investment in infrastructure and the high cost of inputs. The overvaluation of the Real created the necessary conditions for the country to register in 2010 record numbers in direct and indirect import of steel, which totaled, respectively, 5.9 million tons (154% higher than in 2009), and 4.2 million tons (an increase of 59%). However, even with this scenario, Usiminas’s financial, operational and commercial indicators recovered when compared to 2009. Strategic steps were taken in 2010 to make the Company even more competitive, creating value for its shareholders, clients, investors, partners, employees and society in general. Our four business lines Mining, Steelmaking, Steel Transformation and Capital Goods capitalized on synergies, from upstream to downstream, encompassing the entire steel production chain, with focus on products and services with high added value. Investments totaled R$ 3.2 billion in 2010, a Company record. Executive Board (from left to right): Seated: Wilson Nélio Brumer, Ronald Seckelmann, Sergio Leite de Andrade.

New Hot Dip Galvanizing Line Unigal Usiminas Ipatinga/MG 34 | 35 Corporate governance 2010 Usiminas Annual Report Strategic Management The year 2010 was marked by an upturn in the global economy, driven by the level of activity in emerging countries. After the most critical period of turbulence in the global economy, Brazil, Russia, India and China (the so-called BRICs), dictated the pace of the recovery, though low growth in Europe and the United States still persists. The economic performance of the four emerging countries was differentiated in the international scenario. In Brazil, increasing investment, employment, credit supply and demand enabled the GDP to grow by approximately 7.5% in 2010. The steel industry experienced unusual developments in 2010. The Brazilian steel market grew at record levels, aided by the good performance registered in nearly all sectors of the economy. However, this growth, combined with the high exchange rate, stimulated imports, affecting the growth of industry as a whole, and in particular the steel industry. According to figures released by Instituto Aço Brasil IABr (Brazilian Steel Institute), imports of flat steel reached a volume of nearly 3 million tons in 2010. This total was well above the historical average, and an advance of around 160% compared to the volume imported in 2009. This fierce competition, which feds deindustrialization, and the significant growth in costs of raw materials, inputs and labor, which could not be fully transferred to the prices of steel products, affected the profitability of the plants, and thus Usiminas.

However, a 48-year track record and the annual results of economic, social and environmental performance by the Usiminas Group, presented in this report, confirm its commitment to continue advancing in the adoption of increasingly sustainable practices. COMMITMENTS In recent years, Usiminas published commitments defined according to the action plans of all its areas and departments. From the formalization of Corporate Sustainability Guidelines, the Company intends to move towards integrated sustainability management in its four business lines. At this point, it will be possible to make commitments that create sustainable value for all Usiminas employees and stakeholders. This evolution will be available on the Company’s website, which will also allow a more dynamic follow-up on the objectives defined and outcomes achieved.

The method provides excellent low temperature tensile strength and excellent idea is to use approximately 1.3 million tons of results in welding operations. isolated waste to fill the entire area. Steels processed by the CLC technology are extensively used around the world, particularly in ship building, offshore and line pipes, construction and pressure vessels and industrial machinery. CLC steels are distinct because they have refined grain and low-carbon content, alloying elements and equivalent carbon. Additionally, they ensure optimum metallurgical control during the phases of steel refining, casting, rolling and accelerated cooling. 48 | 49 Investment and Perspectives 2010 Usiminas Annual Report (continued) Exclusive technology – Specialty Steel The projections are also favorable for projects To meet this demand for products with higher added value, through the partnership with Nippon related to the 2014 World Cup and the Olympic In this construction technology, Steel, the Company also began to develop its products using the Continuous on Line Control Process technology, an investment which, in 2010 alone, reached R$ 539 million.

The department focuses on initiatives in research and development, knowledge and innovation management and technology transfer. With the restructuring, the processes previously spread throughout various sectors of the Company have been unified. One of the first measures was to develop indicators to accurately measure the investment and the revenue of Usiminas in innovation, through numbers such as the ideas captured that effectively became projects and the number of employees directly involved in research and innovation processes. In recent years, Usiminas’s investments in research and innovation have grown and should triple by 2011, increasing from R$ 25 million, allocated in 2008, to R$ 75 million. Innovation has always been part of Usiminas’s strategy, and is expressed in the vision of the Company. But in addition to historically maintaining investments in research and development, the biggest challenge is disseminating knowledge to the workforce internally. The Comunidades de Práticas project (Communities of Practices) represents one of the most important initiatives carried out by Usiminas’s Knowledge Management Department, since it systematizes the transmission of information between employees of the Company. Competitive Intelligence and Benchmarking cells are also part of the Department.
