We managed to climb out of the hole we found ourselves in and The Company is impatiently awaiting delivery of its first B747-8 which enjoyed a nice ride in 2010. Of course we hit some bumps also Boeing promised for mid-year. These fuel-efficient aircraft will help the – after all, we operate in the airline industry which always reserves Company to better digest rising fuel prices but will not be necessarily surprises, usually of the unpleasant kind.

However, the refleeting its share of chaos following the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud in April of the Company with new, state-of-the-art technology is essential and severe weather conditions in December.

A process has been initiated to find such partner(s). Company for some years. It is in this context that our former CEO Ulrich OGIERMANN stepped aside from his position in November I wish to thank the Cargolux staff for the remarkable turnaround and to fully focus on his personal defense. On behalf of the Board, I wish express my profound gratitude to our customers and financiers. to thank him for his stewardship of the Company since he became CEO in April 2003. Luxembourg, March 17, 2011 I am pleased that Frank REIMEN, former First Government Advisor in charge of the general coordination of the Department of Transport, has now taken the reins as President and CEO. During his tenure as director of the Cargolux Board, the Company has benefited greatly from his extensive experience and in-depth industry knowledge, particularly during the 2009 crisis year. His vision and leadership skills will help the Company to further improve its competitiveness. Being involved in anti-trust cases is nasty and costly business and we wanted to ensure that this would never happen again. To this effect, the Board of Directors undertook some decisive actions. First, the Executive Committee was strengthened with Henning ZUR HAUSEN joining the Company as Senior VP Legal and Compliance. Second, the Compliance and Internal Audit functions were reinforced with additional resources and intensive training. Third, with the help of outside consultants, the Company formulated a detailed compliance strategy and program which is being rolled out since the 3rd quarter last year. The Company is now striving to position itself as a Marc Hoffmann champion in compliance and thereby gaining a competitive edge. Chairman of the Board 7 CEO’s Letter It is no exaggeration to claim that the year 2010 gave us some reason Clearly, 2011 is set to be a more testing year. According to IATA, for celebration. First, it marked the 40th anniversary of a company overall air cargo volume is expected to grow by 6.1%. However, founded by visionary pioneers in 1970 and widely regarded as a yields are likely to remain under pressure from over-capacity building leading all-cargo carrier in today’s industry. Second, supported by up in some parts of the world, most notably in China. The threat of the vigorous rebound in the air cargo market which saw volumes rise a prolonged surge in oil prices – biting into the fragile profitability worldwide by 20.6%, Cargolux staged a strong recovery as it shifted of our highly cyclical business – looms on the horizon and must be out of the rescue mode adopted in late 2009. offset by higher productivity and enhanced competitiveness. Adequate network and fleet planning in 2011 remains a balancing act. The Company’s stakeholders were able to breathe a deep sigh of Again, we will draw on our key strengths – flexibility, service excellence relief as the Company turned a prior year loss of US$ 153.3 million and innovation – to tackle these challenges successfully. into a net profit of US$ 59.8 million. We are in the middle of taking stock of the Cargolux strategy in Overall, the Company saw a 10.1% increase in production, order to define a clear vision for sustainable and profitable growth underpinned by strong growth in Asia, the Americas, Europe and going forward. We are conducting an in-depth review of the different the Middle East. Capacity improved by a more subdued 3.7% during components of our business model to refine our position on several the period under review, owing to a delay in the delivery of the fronts: network, fleet planning and size, target markets and potential higher payload Boeing 747-8F and the lack of capacity caused by alliances with strategic partners.

The impact could not be Board of Directors during the second quarter of 2011. entirely offset by dryand wet-lease arrangements. The daily average utilization of the Cargolux fleet increased to 15:46 block hours, I will conclude by extending my warm gratitude to our shareholders, a 8.2% advance over 2009, while load factors strengthened by our Board of Directors and to the great team of Cargolux employees 4.3 percentage points to 73.3%. We carried 683,380 tonnes of who fought hard for the Company’s survival during the recent cargo, 8.9% more than in the crisis year 2009. past. I am confident that the Cargolux spirit will prevail for a long time to come. In 2010, the Company achieved its number one goal: not merely surviving, but emerging stronger from the crisis that rocked the global economy in 2009. Still, we did not lose sight of our commitment in Luxembourg, March 17, 2011 terms of corporate responsibility and managed to consolidate the pre-crisis course of action. Although we operate one of the most environmentally sound freighter fleets in the industry, the gradual introduction from the summer of this year of the new generation Boeing 747-8F will improve our ecological footprint substantially on three counts: fuel burn, CO2 emissions and noise disturbances. In the wake of the anti-trust proceedings engaged against the Company, the Board of Directors re-emphasized the critical importance of compliance and endorsed a comprehensive Compliance Strategy in May 2010. Kicked off last year, the program is gaining momentum with the launch in early 2011 of Compliance for Business (C4B), a comprehensive initiative supported by Company-wide training, awareness raising and communication efforts aimed at making compliance an integral part of the corporate Frank Reimen culture of Cargolux while giving the Company a competitive edge.

In a settlement reached with plaintiffs in the US class actions, the Company agreed to pay US$ 35.1 million. The US class settlement has been preliminarily approved by the court. The Company’s remaining exposure with respect to anti-trust cases relates to proceedings in South Africa and Switzerland (where the Company is cooperating with the authorities), class actions in Canada (where the Company’s business activity during the alleged cartel years was minimal) and possible damages claims brought in relation to business outside of the US, the extent of which cannot be reliably estimated at this stage. Considering the foregoing, the Company decided to limit provisions for its remaining anti-trust exposure to a possible fine which may be imposed by the Swiss anti-trust authorities. 19 Management’s Report of Activities Overall Business Overview The impact of the economic crisis of 2009 lasted well into 2010, Network nevertheless, at Cargolux, we characterize 2010 as the year of the comeback. The supply and demand ratio of airfreight was favorable We were able to quickly react to the diverse speed of the economic and in marked contrast to 2009; in 2010, demand increased recovery among the various world regions and started new sharply but available capacity was slower to pick up. Trans-Pacific services on the routes Hong Kong – Chicago – New York and Hong Kong – Los Angeles. We also added flights to Japan IATA estimates that international air freight volumes in 2010 were and Taiwan while ending services to Panama, Santiago de Chile, some 20.6 % higher than in 2009. Auckland and Melbourne. Hanoi and Riyadh became new on-line stations in 2010. At Cargolux, we could benefit from this situation and increase yields, achieve higher aircraft utilization and reach record load factors. We increased our fleet size by adding one aircraft in April. Fleet 2010 can also be seen as the year of the operational crises, first, After the sale of two 747-400Fs to UPS in late 2009, we started the when the Icelandic ash cloud grounded part of our fleet for three year operating 14 aircraft. A 15th, dry-leased B747-400BCF unit to four days in April and, second, when severe winter weather in was added in April, while a 747-200SF was wet-leased to cover December resulted in delays and traffic disruptions. charter and high season demand. In October, another Cargolux 747-400F was delivered to Silkway Airlines in a sales deal that During the ash cloud crisis, part of the European airspace remained had previously been arranged. Because of the delivery delay of the closed for some time, but Cargolux was able to keep most of its 747-8F, we opted to wet-lease a 747-400SF to make up for the lost fleet operational outside of Europe, such as on Trans-Pacific routes. capacity. In conclusion, we ended the year utilizing 15 747-400Fs We had a contingency plan in place and established a temporary and 1 747-200SF. base in Barcelona from where we could operate to existing network points and truck freight to other European points, including Luxembourg. This helped in keeping our European services operational. 747-8F We experienced a very strong comeback of the market after the crisis because of freight backlogs across the entire global supply chain system. Continued delivery delays of our 747-8F have caused a number of problems, because we had to honor previously arranged sales Disruptions caused by the winter weather, that affected Europe and contracts for part of our 747-400F fleet. We were able to soften North America during most of December, were harder to solve the impact by stretching some deliveries and through wet-leasing as because we could not truck our freight as easily as during the ash mentioned earlier. cloud crisis, since road traffic across Europe was as much affected as air traffic. However, during both crises, Cargolux could rely on its We hope to receive our first 747-8Fs in the summer of 2011 and proven strengths: flexibility and the ability to come to quick decisions, plan to deploy them on our Asian routes as soon as possible. coupled with a strong team spirit.

Freight tonne kilometers went up that Cargolux’ production lagged the growth in global FTKs and 10.1%, from 4.8 billion in 2009 to roughly 5.3 billion in 2010, that our capacity was constrained compared to pre-recession levels. while available tonne kilometers reached 7.2 billion, a rise of 3.7%. We carried 683,380 tonnes of cargo, 8.9% more than during the previous year. 20 Area by Area Area 2 – Europe, Middle East and Central Asia Asian markets turned out to be especially strong and the area was a On 1 August 2010, Area 2 regrouped the markets in Europe, leader in the 2010 recovery, even though China showed signs of a the Middle East and Central Asia. Consequently, a new Area 4, slow-down during the final months of the year. As Asia was leading Africa, was created. With the new setup, Area 2 achieved a total the way, other markets began to move, notably the United States, production of 283,685 tonnes, representing 42% of the overall with Europe and Africa following behind. Cargolux production in 2010.

We now operate five round-the-world/Trans-Pacific flights every week. The industry-wide dip in yields in 2009 presented a big challenge even during 2010. In Area 2, we achieved an increase in yield/kg With a total of 127,438 tonnes, Cargolux Area 1 contributed compared to 2009, but have yet to return to 2008 levels. significantly to the network. It represents a rise of 11.5% versus 2009. Markets were strong throughout the year, in particular in In August, we terminated services to Chile, Panama, Melbourne the aftermath of the airspace closure in Europe due to volcanic and Auckland. We saw a slightly negative development in terms of ash in April. Revenue in Area 1 reached US$ 279.5 million, tonnage in the Middle East compared to 2009, but still remained an improvement of almost 22%. above 2008 levels. This was mainly caused by the reduced capacity allocations to and from this region. The market itself remained healthy, Cargolux has a long history in North America and, today, is very but faced strong competition.

In July, we added two additional frequencies after the success of the initial flights and could thereby strengthen our market presence. Driven by market demand, we launched a weekly service from Hong Kong to Los Angeles in August, complementing our US West Coast service. Tonne-Kilometers flown In millions In view of strong competition to Mainland China with signs of over-capacity, Area 3 decided to opt for a stable Shanghai service and suspended the previously operated two frequencies on Fridays. 5,411 5,537 5,284 Xiamen remained well supported by local producers and Beijing kept its niche status for off-size cargo, as well as shipments to destinations 4,800 in South America, Africa, the Middle East and a highly competitive Central European market. Throughout the year, Area 3 operated 1,781 flights, including 91 charters, and carried a total of 205,398 tonnes, including fifth freedom traffic. This translated into more than US$ 761 million in revenue. 2010 was a successful year for Cargolux in Asia, especially compared to previous years. Because the business is very competitive by nature, we are constantly exploring new opportunities to enhance our network coverage. 2010 2009 2008 2007 22 Charter Outlook 2011 Charter business in 2010 was exceptionally strong, certainly boosted Following the turmoil of the previous two years, we expect a more by the backlogs created after the two operational crises in spring and stable year with a relatively balanced supply-demand ratio, possibly winter. We operated a total of 104 ad-hoc charters to and from all with some overcapacity during the first half of the year, in particular 5 continents and 51 high-season charters from the Far East. in China. We see reasonably healthy markets, albeit with strong regional differences, therefore, a flexible management of our network Charters operated include medical equipment charters, F1, will remain important. A key challenge and main focus for 2011 will Moto GP and GT1 charters, peak season charters, garments be our fleet planning and how to manage the continued delay of the and telecommunication equipment charters and charters for the 747-8F delivery through wet and dry leases. automotive industry. Charters have always been an important part of our business and we ensured that the high demand did not affect our regular operation by utilizing a wet-leased B747-200SF. Cargolux Italia The Company has dry-leased one of its aircraft to Cargolux Italia S.p.A., an Italian subsidiary that was established in Milan in 2009. Cargolux continues to support Cargolux Italia S.p.A. as its General Cargo Sales Agent. Since its beginning, Cargolux Italia has secured a strategic portfolio of traffic rights, allowing the Italian company a quick and flexible response to market requirements. At the beginning of 2010, Cargolux Italia operated three weekly round services between Milan Malpensa and Hong Kong. A new service to Johannesburg, Lusaka and Nairobi was initiated at the end of February, but the route failed to sustain a profitable operation Total tonnes carried In metric tonnes despite the positive commercial reaction it received and was therefore discontinued in the summer. In July, Osaka was added to the network. A second service was launched in November, utilizing fifth freedom 683,380 703,601 702,765 rights between Osaka and Hong Kong, similar to the first Osaka service. 627, 813 Cargolux Italia flew 5,714 block hours and moved 63,701 tonnes of freight in 2010. Gross turnover reached US$ 105 million. At the end of the year, the company served seven international gateways. Combined with some sixty destinations via the Cargolux hub in Luxembourg, this makes the group one of the strongest air freight players in Italy. Cargolux Italia is positive about future prospects and expects to add new destinations in areas with significant growth and more frequencies to its existing services. 2010 2009 2008 2007 23 Management’s Report of Activities Maintenance and Engineering Reliability Bits and Bites Cargolux’ Maintenance and Engineering (M&E) Division is Cargolux is a major user of the TRAX maintenance software and we responsible for the technical status of the Cargolux freighter fleet, continually work with the TRAX developers to further enhance their to guarantee a safe, on-time network. In addition to its work on product. In 2010, we implemented the resource management tool Cargolux aircraft, the M&E division also provides maintenance and of TRAX into our system. engineering support to other airlines. In spite of a very challenging operation in 2010, the M&E division managed to achieve a schedule reliability of the Cargolux fleet of 98.83%. Boeing 747-8F The operation in the new maintenance center, which went into Due to the delays in the delivery of the Boeing 747-8F, operation in May 2009, has been successful from day one. The hangar preparations for the introduction were continued at a reduced level. offers two fully equipped maintenance bays that can accommodate Mechanics, that have already been trained on the new aircraft the largest wide body aircraft. The work space itself is designed for type, will have to go through a refresher training once the aircraft maximum efficiency of the workforce. Bringing all shops under one roof arrives. Additionally, we expect to add a significant number of new has also contributed to improved productivity and efficiency. mechanics to our staff and entry-into-service preparations will be a major topic for our Maintenance and Engineering division in 2011. Heavy Maintenance In 2010, M&E performed one D-check and five C-checks on the Cargolux fleet. While all C-Checks were performed in-house by Cargolux’ own staff, the D-Check was executed by Singapore Airlines’ Engineering Company. Also, in 2010, the M&E division further optimized the Company’s B747 maintenance program, resulting in increased inspection intervals for A and D-checks. The number of employees at Maintenance did not change throughout the year. At the end of 2010, the Cargolux M&E division employed a staff of 366. During 2010, we achieved 442,000 production hours, split between line, hangar and back shops. The hours produced were distributed between support for the Cargolux fleet (roughly 86%) and support to customer aircraft (roughly 14%). For the Customer As the world airlines were gradually recovering from the economic and financial crisis of 2008/2009, the maintenance activities for customers increased accordingly. The M&E division attracted new clients and extended the scope of services provided. We performed 51 A-Checks on the customer fleets of Corsair, Air Bridge Cargo, Atlas Air, Air Atlanta, World Airways and Bluebird Cargo and began to perform C-Checks on customer aircraft in December 2010. In 2010, the maintenance revenue reached US$ 9,3 million. 24 Management’s Report of Activities Flight Operations Flight Operations Dash Eight Simulation At the beginning of 2010, Cargolux operated 14 747-400 In parallel to the delays of the Boeing 747-8F, delivery of the new freighters in addition to one leased-in 747-400BCF. One of our simulator has also been pushed back. Manufactured by CAE in aircraft, LX-MCV, left the fleet in October and was replaced with Canada, the simulator shell is completed and awaits shipment to another wet-leased unit. Fleet utilization and loadfactors were good. Luxembourg after a four-week test in March 2011. However, the However, due to operational crises such as the eruption of volcano required software is not entirely complete; CAE’s developers await Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland and the subsequent closure of European air Boeing’s test data that will only be available after the actual flight space, as well as severe winter disruptions in December, and, last tests of the aircraft are completed. While the simulator hardware will but not least, the delay of the 747-8 delivery, network punctuality be delivered to Luxembourg in April 2011, the final software update was down. The daily aircraft utilization reached 15:46 hours against will be available for installation by November. Current planning 14:34 hours in 2009. Block hours for Cargolux’ fleet amounted to foresees to start operating the 747-8F simulator by Christmas 2011. 83,524. All figures take into account data of the aircraft operating for Cargolux and Cargolux Italia. For the pilots’ difference training, we rely on a flat-panel trainer that is already in use at our crew training facility. All 747-8 training is performed Cargolux went through the economic crisis without lay-offs amongst in-house. As foreseen in our contracts with Boeing, six Cargolux instructors its crews and hired 21 new pilots in 2010. These also included will be trained by Boeing personnel in Luxembourg, prior to the delivery replacements for a number of retired pilots. of the aircraft. Cargolux employed 405 pilots at the end of 2010 versus 393 at the end of the previous year. Managing Crises As mentioned, Cargolux Flight Operations was mostly affected by the Simulator Training crises of the Icelandic ashcloud and the winter conditions in December. Between 220 and 240 pilots are constantly travelling within the Utilization of the Company’s 747-400F simulator was high, standing Cargolux network and could not immediately return to Luxembourg in at 69% throughout 2010, a significant step up from the 64% in both cases. To keep the fleet operational, rosters had to be changed 2009. During the year, it was necessary to shut down the simulator and duties shifted. With full support from our crews, the network could for six weeks because of modifications that included a new visual almost instantly be rebuilt and resulted in only four aircraft being blocked system and the addition of an instructor’s position with new software. during the ashcloud shut-down of European air space. The remaining These modifications make the 747-400F simulator compatible with 70% of our fleet could operate its full schedule. Cargolux’ new 747-8F simulator and allow the use of one database for both units. Roughly 53% of the utilization covered Cargolux’ own training needs, while 15% was sold to customer airlines. Daily aircraft utilization Per Boeing 747-400 Freighter With the sale of one aircraft to Silkway Airlines of Azerbaijan, Cargolux fulfilled its contractual obligations and type-trained 16 Silkway 15:46 pilots. With authorization from the Luxembourg Civil Aviation 15:30 15:41 14:34 Authority, DAC, Silkway pilots can also complete their line training on Cargolux aircraft and regular Cargolux flights. This program required a major investment of resources and time from Cargolux’ Flight Operations division and is available for future Silkway pilot trainings if required. Since Silkway began flying the aircraft on its own routes in November, Cargolux supported the operation with the allocation of a Cargolux instructor on Silkway’s flights. This support continues into 2011. 2010 2009 2008 2007 25 Corporate Social Responsibility 26 Following a particularly difficult year in 2009, dominated by the crisis that plagued international trade and, as a result, long-range air cargo activities, Cargolux focused in 2010 on regaining economic strength and resuming normal operations. Nevertheless, the Company also sought to maintain its momentum in the field of corporate social responsibility and reinforce activities in this field. Cargolux maintained in particular its commitment to operate with the best possible fuel efficiency. Because long-range air cargo transport is an inherently fuel intensive activity, the atmospheric emissions from the Company’s aircraft represent by far the biggest environmental impact of the Company. At the same time, Cargolux has a strong financial incentive to ensure that its fuel consumption remains as low as possible. Energy conservation and the fight against global warming is therefore the field that receives the Company’s highest attention in terms of environmental protection and long-term plans are in place to achieve a steady reduction of our emissions. As signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, Cargolux also seeks to align its actions and policies ever more closely to the UNGC 10 principles. The Company sought to build on the efforts initiated in 2009, in particular by expanding its ISO 14001 certification process to new areas of competence and by developing its activities in the field of corporate compliance. The Company also sought to maintain and develop its contacts with its stakeholder groups, be they commercial contacts and partners (freight forwarders, handling agents, trucking companies, maintenance and IT suppliers) or the neighboring communities at airports where we operate, local non-governmental organizations as well as schools and universities. Cargolux still faced challenges which prevented the Company from reaching some of its objectives in terms of corporate social responsibility. In particular, additional production delays at Boeing’s factory resulted in a further postponement of the delivery of the new, quieter and more fuel efficient 747-8F. As a result, the Company could not realize part of its planned efficiency gains in terms of fuel conservation and atmospheric emissions. Nevertheless, the Company has managed to strengthen its course of actions both in the environmental and social fields and looks forward to further progress in 2011 and the years to come. 27 The Environment 28 29 The Environment As Cargolux is an airline offering worldwide cargo transport, the vast Energy and Atmospheric Emissions majority of its energy consumption is attributable to its flight operations. A study undertaken in 2007 showed that our flight operations were Following a difficult year in 2009, Cargolux has managed to responsible for over 98% of the CO2 emitted by the Company. substantially improve its fuel efficiency in 2010. An analysis of the All other activities, including road feeder services, staff business fuel burn of each flight made during the year shows that our aircraft travel, office heating and employee commuting represented less than burned on average 164 grams of fuel to transport one tonne 2% of total emissions. In the years since this study was completed of cargo over one km, which corresponds to CO2 emissions of the business model has remained largely stable. As a result this ratio 517 grams per tonne-km. This result represents an improvement can still be considered as valid. of 3.6% over 2009 (fuel consumption reached 170g per tkm, CO2 emissions 537g per tkm in 2009)1. This development represents Consequently, the Company’s efforts focus primarily on controlling a significant achievement, given in particular that Cargolux has the fuel consumption of its flight operations as much as possible and operated a similar fleet of 747-400F aircraft and that this aircraft developing new operational techniques that allow us to reduce it type was used for the vast majority of flights during both years. even further. In order to be able to express a ratio between energy consumption and our core activity, the transport of goods by air, Several factors may be highlighted as having contributed to this result. this figure is expressed in grams of fuel burnt for each tonne of goods Cargolux has made efforts and undertaken projects which have transported over 1 km. The amount of CO2 emitted through flight actively helped to achieve this improvement. However, it should be operations is directly proportional to this fuel consumption and is noted that, from year to year, Cargolux’ aircraft are also subjected therefore expressed in the same way (grams CO2 emitted per tonne-km). to external factors, such as weather and wind conditions, which may also affect the overall fuel performance of the Company’s fleet. Cargolux is also attentive to the other types of environmental impact of its activities. In particular, the Company is conscious of the noise During 2010, Cargolux has also managed to substantially improve produced by its aircraft and takes action to reduce, as much as its average load factor, with a ratio of 73.3% compared to 69 % in possible, disturbances to communities living around the airports 20092. As more freight was transported on average on each of our where it operates, especially at its hub in Luxembourg. flights, the ratio between the aircraft’s own weight and that of the cargo was changed to the benefit of the latter. This development also Cargolux is gradually expanding its monitoring capabilities, helps to explain the improvement in the fleet’s fuel efficiency in 2010. regarding for instance the consumption of energy and use of water and other resources at its headquarters in Luxembourg. At the same time, the Company maintains and develops a comprehensive waste management program at its headquarters. Total CO2 Emissions (Flight Operations) 2010 20091 CO2 emissions 2.673 2.503 million tonnes million tonnes CO2 emissions per tkm 517 g/tkm 537 g/tkm Fuel burn per tkm 164 g/tkm 170 g/tkm 1 CO2 emissions per tonne-km for 2009 are restated compared to the figure published in our 2009 annual report due to the fact that the number of tonne-km used as basis for this calculation now does not take into account traffic resulting from certain commercial agreements. 2 Load factor is based on tonne-kilometers including traffic resulting from certain commercial agreements. 30 A. Control and Efficiency APU Usage Large jet airliners such as Cargolux’ 747-400 aircraft are equipped Throughout its existence, Cargolux has tested and developed with an onboard generator which provides electric power while techniques and adapted its flight planning as well as its operating the aircraft is on the ground and pneumatic air to start the aircraft’s procedures in order to conserve fuel as much as possible. main engines. Although necessary for the operation of the aircraft, The following is a description of the main measures which have positively the auxiliary power unit (APU) has a fairly high fuel consumption, impacted on the fuel efficiency of the Company’s operations in 2010. especially compared to diesel-powered ground power generators or electricity supply from the airport grid. In an effort to limit kerosene Network Optimization and Flexibility consumption, a network-wide campaign was launched in 2007 Cargolux operates with a high level of flexibility in order to achieve to seek to reduce reliance on the APU when the aircraft is on the the best possible balance between the revenues generated by ground, and favor ground power supply when it is available. servicing our customers and – at the same time the optimization of our costs. In this, the cost of fuel (and therefore carbon emissions) This effort led to a substantially reduced average running time of plays the most important role. Routings are constantly modified in line the auxiliary power unit per aircraft cycle during 2008. Although with changes in these business economics and, as a consequence, it increased in 2009, owing to a less optimized aircraft utilization waste of fuel and excess carbon emissions can be avoided. rate during the economic slowdown, this figure came down again in 2010, almost reaching 2008 levels. This demonstrates that the FANS Operation procedures established appear effective in the long run as they have In 2010, Cargolux completed a program to equip all aircraft in its led to long-lasting efficiency gains in this field. own fleet with the Iridium onboard satellite communications system. Since 2007, Cargolux has spearheaded the introduction into Compressed Air civil aviation of this technology, which offers a less costly and less The new Cargolux hangar is in operation since May 2009 and has equipment-intensive alternative to the incumbent Inmarsat satellite introduced a number of improvements in modern technologies into communications system used in aviation. Iridium offers the additional the Cargolux maintenance activities. One of them is the use of a high advantage of a global coverage, including over the polar regions. output compressed air system that produces the pneumatic pressure that is normally obtained from the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit to Consequently, in June 2010, Cargolux aircraft could operate on move flight controls such as flaps and elevators, as well as to start Future Air Navigation System (FANS) routes and thereby achieve the aircraft’s main engines. significant savings in flying time. These routes are more direct than routes where traffic is controlled via conventional VHF radio This system offers the combined advantages of not only reducing communication, but they typically overfly remote areas where no ambient noise pollution, but also enabling an estimated reduction ground-based radio communication is available, such as desert in fuel consumption of over 120 tonnes annually, as the APU is no regions or over oceans. Instead, the aircraft crew communicates longer required for maintenance operations in the hangar. over data link, via the satellite communications system. It is estimated that, thanks to this system, about 300 hours of APU use The most important FANS route on the Cargolux network is located have been saved, which would have been required for over 600 over the Gobi desert between Almaty and Hong Kong. In 2010 this engine as well as flap and elevator tests performed during routine route was used on four to six flights per week. The fuel savings are maintenance checks over the year. substantial as flight time is reduced by 30 to 35 minutes on each flight. The fuel savings that could be achieved are estimated at 700 tonnes for the year, or over 2,200 tonnes of CO2. While the main benefit of this technology is currently derived from Cargolux’ flights across China, the Company will extend FANS flights through its worldwide network, wherever air routes can support this system and offer a shorter alternative routing. 31 Flight Control Rigging Ongoing programs As part of the Company’s maintenance program a regular check is performed to ensure the proper rigging of flight controls on its aircraft. Fleet Renewal This procedure helps to ensure that moving parts on the wings such Cargolux’ ambitious fleet renewal program suffered additional delays as flaps are flush with the wing when not deployed. In turn, it helps to during the testing phase of the new Boeing 747-8F. The first three of improve the aerodynamics of the aircraft and, consequently, reduces 13 firmly ordered aircraft are now scheduled to be delivered in the the fuel consumption throughout the Cargolux fleet. second half of 2011. Under the program, all flight controls are rigged every time they are This new-generation 747 aircraft will offer the single most important replaced. Full control rigging also occurs during regular maintenance improvement in fuel efficiency for our operations. Thanks to its new checks and whenever pilots report irregularities. An indication system engines and new aerodynamic design, this aircraft is expected to on the aircraft indicates if controls are not properly rigged. Cargolux achieve 17% fuel savings per tonne-km compared to our current crew members are thus able to report possible discrepancies, which aircraft, the 747-400F. Newly developed noise-reduction technology ensures that these are addressed within short timeframes. also makes the 747-8F remarkably quieter, with an estimated 30% smaller take-off noise footprint at 85 dB, compared to its predecessor. Deep Core Engine Washing This established maintenance program has proven to effectively reduce The 747-8F will thus allow Cargolux to offer one of the most fuel consumption on Cargolux’ General Electric engines and to improve environment-conscious air cargo services worldwide. Its flights will the speed margins on its Rolls Royce powerplants. The fuel burn generate substantially lower CO2 emissions, as well as markedly lower reduction of 0.25% on GE engines achieved in the previous year has noise disturbances to the communities of the airports where we operate. been maintained and is confirmed by maintenance data. The resulting savings in fuel consumption is estimated at over 430 tonnes during the The delivery delays have considerably slowed down energy course of 2010, an equivalent of over 1,300 tonnes of CO2. efficiency improvements that had been projected for 2010 and therefore also resulted in a correspondingly higher fuel Deep core washing is also undertaken on the Company’s Rolls consumption than planned. However, once started, the regular Royce engines. For this engine type, tests have shown only a deliveries of the new aircraft type are expected to lead to regular marginal reduction in fuel burn. However, the operation leads to an efficiency improvements over coming years. The new 747-8F will improvement in speed margins, in other words, the different parts of gradually replace our current fleet of 747-400F. the engine rotate more closely to their optimum speed. This in turn prolongs the service life of the engine. Alternative Fuels In 2008 Cargolux became one of the founding members of a cross-industry initiative that aims at promoting research and bringing onto the market a bio-derived, environmentally sustainable type of jet aviation fuel. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel User’s Group (SAFUG) brings together airlines and other stakeholders that share a common interest in developing a long-term, renewable source of aviation fuel that does not compete with agricultural food production, does not pose a threat to fragile eco-systems and has a positive socio-economic impact. 32 Many scientific, regulatory and organizational challenges remain Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to be overcome before sustainable aviation bio-fuel becomes available in large quantities and at an acceptable price range. 2010 was a crucial year for all airlines operating into and out of However, remarkable progress has already been achieved the European Union, including Cargolux. In preparation towards by specialist industrial partners participating in this initiative. the entry of the aviation sector into the EU-ETS scheme in 2012, The technology for producing plant-based jet fuel which equals or all airlines operating into the EU were required to monitor both their exceeds the chemical requirements of fossil-based fuel is now ready. overall activity in terms of tonne-km and / or passenger-km, according Several feedstocks have been identified for the production of the to the methodology prescribed by the EU, as well as their CO2 fuel, even though methods for large-scale production of these crops emissions, over the whole year 2010. and industrial-scale processing systems still need to mature in order to ensure adequate supply streams at global level. Under the EU-Emissions Trading Scheme, CO2 production of all airlines operating in the EU will be capped at a ratio based on their production SAFUG’s current efforts center on securing an adequate definition (tonne-km and / or passenger-km) in 2010 and on an average of historical of sustainability criteria and working towards the certification of the CO2 emissions of the aviation sector during the years 2004-2006. bio-fuel, as well as addressing policy issues in order to ensure that Starting 2012 all concerned airlines will receive a defined percentage the development of sustainable aviation bio-fuel is promoted rather of CO2 allocations free of charge, while excess emissions produced than hampered by regulation. Overcoming these challenges will help above this amount will need to be compensated through credits create a framework allowing a steady resolution of the technical purchased on the CO2 markets, or by other means. challenges facing the introduction of the fuel onto the market and the commercial introduction of the fuel itself. This system aims to act as an incentive for airlines to control and limit future CO2 emissions, for instance through the introduction of more E-Freight energy-efficient fleets or other energy-saving operational procedures. Cargolux continues to prepare for the introduction of a full e-freight system. This IATA initiative will simplify the air freight industry and During 2009, in accordance with the requirements of the EU directive eliminate the paperwork that has to travel with each shipment. published in 2008, Cargolux undertook the exercise of establishing It will save an estimated 8,000 tonnes of paper annually, once adequate monitoring procedures and introducing IT-based tools it is adopted industry-wide. In achieving this, the industry faces a to allow a rigorous monitoring of CO2 emissions and tonne-km multitude of challenges because paperwork and documentation production data. These will serve to monitor flights entering or coming from several sources and following a number of different leaving the EU as well as intra-EU operations for the purposes of procedures, have to be collected and processed for electronic use. the EU-ETS, but also to monitor Cargolux’ overall flight operations. The fact that both the monitoring system and Cargolux’ corresponding The efforts made in 2010 towards the implementation of e-freight procedures will be subject to external verification will help ascertain centered on the development by the freight forwarder community the robustness of the data reported in the future. Starting in 2010, of IT systems that will make it possible to replace current paper all CO2 data reported by Cargolux are derived from this system. documents (required in particular for customs clearing) into their electronic equivalents, and process this information in an integrated way, together with airines and customs authorities. 33 B. Non Flight Activities Road Feeder Services 2010 was a year of consolidation for the trucking companies that Energy and Water Consumption regularly provide road feeder services to Cargolux in Europe. During the Because it is a long-range cargo airline, the largest portion of economic crisis of 2009, as demand slowed down, many of Cargolux’ Cargolux’ energy consumption, by a wide margin, is related to suppliers scaled down their fleets by retiring mainly older vehicles. its flight operations. However, while much smaller in relative At the same time a small number of new, Euro 5 standard trucks terms, the energy consumed by the Company to run its office and was introduced. maintenance facilities and to power its ground equipment is by no means insignificant. In 2010, as business recovered, the number of trucks operating for Cargolux was increased by over 100 units. While most of these In this respect also Cargolux seeks to achieve a high degree of were new acquisitions, the trucking companies continued using energy efficiency. This is exemplified by the construction and entry or even reintroduced a few older vehicles in order to cope with into service of the Company’s new maintenance facility in May the sudden surge in demand. Nevertheless, the combined fleet of 2009, where every effort was made to ensure an optimal level of trucks operated for Cargolux in Europe is steadily becoming more energy conservation, including in particular the avoidance of heat environmentally efficient: over 60% of trucks operated belong to the loss through the hangar doors in winter. Euro 5 category, corresponding to the highest standard currently applicable in the European Union. For example, the facility is partly heated in winter and cooled in summer by hot water produced by a gas-powered co-generation This trend is likely to continue over coming years as several trucking plant located on its premises. This hot water is a by-product of companies have significant fleet development plans. For example, the plant’s production of electricity, which is fed into the national Transports Welter, one of our subcontractors in Europe, foresees to electricity grid. This represents a highly efficient means of energy replace or increase its dedicated air freight fleet by up to 70 new production and in addition may allow a portion of the CO2 emissions trucks by the end of 2012. of the plant to be offset. This co-generation plant is complemented by a regular gas heater to heat the building. The economic crisis did not lead to an accelerated retirement of less environmentally-efficient fleets, as the economic gains that may be Following the entry into service of its new maintenance facility, achieved through reduced fuel consumption are usually not sufficient Cargolux is better able to monitor both water and energy consumption to justify, on their own, the purchase of new equipment. related to its activities. This monitoring has started in 2010 and will allow the Company to identify possibilities in coming years. Rather, with air cargo trucking being a premium product on the road transport market, the reliability and overall efficiency of newer vehicles also play a part in the decision to operate a younger fleet. Consequently the road feeder service fleets operated for Cargolux (and other airlines) tend to be more efficient than fleets used for other European Trucking Fleet trucking services by these suppliers. The majority of trucks currently 3rd-Party Fleet Operating for Cargolux in Europe put into service comply with or supersede the Euro 5 emissions standard. In order to achieve this standard, many of these vehicles are equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction catalyst which 2010 2009 2008 2007 substantially reduces emissions of NOx (by up to 90%) through a 0 0 18 40 treatment of exhaust gases with a reductant chemical.

This development is important as management program that, today, covers the Company’s facilities a large percentage of the freight transported by Cargolux transits and offices in Luxembourg, the maintenance hangar and offices, through Luxembourg and is handled at the Luxair Cargo Center. as well as rented offices at other locations. All Luxembourg-based offices are covered by a waste-sorting and recycling system. Also, about 70% of all the freight handled by Luxair Cargo is transported by Cargolux. Much of the waste handled by Luxair In recognition of its continued efforts in this field, Cargolux obtained therefore originates from Cargolux’ aircraft pallets in the form of the renewal of its environmental label “Superdreckskëscht fir Betriber”. wrapping material, wood used for spreading the weight of dense ‘Superdreckskëscht’ is a program run by Luxembourg’s Ministry for pieces of cargo over wider surfaces and spent pallet nets and straps. Sustainable Development and Infrastructure. The label is awarded to Luxembourg companies that demonstrate exemplary waste Luxair Cargo was awarded the “Superdreckskëscht fir Betriber” label for management practices, including waste avoidance measures, safe its Ground Handling activities and Ground Equipment Shop in 2009 and environmentally-friendly waste storage, selective collection and and extended its certification to other parts of the Company during 2010. a transparent waste recycling and disposal system. This certificate is subject to annual renewals following audits that verify the Company’s During the course of the year, Luxair began the certification process adherence to these principles. for the entire Cargo Center, including the parts of the building rented by third parties. This is a welcome development for Cargolux, In spite of an increase in the Company’s overall activity, Cargolux as our Ground Operations are housed in rented offices at the Luxair has produced smaller quantities of waste in all significant categories Cargo Center. This process will lead to a convergence in waste compared to 2009 (with the exception of an increase of the relatively small management practices between Cargolux and one of its major “others” category with comprises mainly end-of-life tires and polystyrene). stakeholders in Luxembourg. The main reason for the overall reduction in waste production was that, in 2009, Cargolux moved its maintenance and engineering activity to a new state-of-the-art facility.

Its Boeing 747-400 freighters are recognized as being substantially less noisy than other, older aircraft that many airlines still operate today. In 2010, Cargolux began preparations for the certification of its Over the past years Cargolux studied a number of operating Maintenance Division. Evaluation of processes and documentation procedures aimed at further reducing community noise with its existing for training and implementation of ISO 14001 are ongoing. fleet of aircraft. This process is a major undertaking, notably due to the number of processes to analyze and due to the fact that it will require the In particular, a study was undertaken between 2005 and 2008 training of around 300 people. This certification process is currently by the Henri Tudor Research Institute with the active collaboration estimated to be completed in 2012. of Cargolux and Boeing. This study was funded mainly by the Luxembourg government. By building a mathematical model specific Cargolux started its environmental certification process with its flight for Luxembourg’s operating condition and Boeing 747-400 aircraft, operations, in other words its core activity. Compared with the other the objective of the study was to simulate aircraft noise patterns to activities of the Company, its flight operations is the field that has by optimize a number of flight-relevant parameters, such as take-off and far the greatest impact on the environment and where the greatest approach procedures, in order to ultimately reduce the noise impact benefits are to be gained from an environmental management system. of Cargolux flight operations at and around Luxembourg airport. It also sought to determine at what time of the day aircraft movements caused the highest amount of nuisance to the largest number of people and to suggest new approach, take-off and scheduling procedures that would minimize the amount of community noise. Introducing the 747-8F with its advanced engine technology and new wing design will lead to a substantial reduction in noise levels for Cargolux’ operations, in particular around Luxembourg airport. As a result of an important research effort carried out by Boeing and engine manufacturer General Electric, the 85 dB noise footprint at take-off will be reduced by an estimated 30%, which will represent a measurable improvement for the surrounding communities. However, repeated delays in the delivery of the new aircraft type have kept noise emissions in 2010 on a higher level than planned and hoped for. The delivery of the Boeing 747-8F is now foreseen for mid-2011, with 3 aircraft planned for delivery, followed by 3 additional aircraft in 2012. 36 37 The Social Dimension 38 39 The Social Dimension Compliance Our Employees Over the past years and in particular following the anti-trust Following the crisis year of 2009, the Company concentrated on proceedings initiated by authorities in a number of countries against consolidating its strength throughout 2010 and, correspondingly, most of the large freight airlines worldwide, Cargolux has put strong adopted a cautious approach as far as human resources emphasis on its compliance program.

This training program is very important for Cargolux, as it ensures that the persons who are in contact with the airline’s aircraft follow all Company procedures while handling cargo on its behalf. It is also important for the employees of our GHAs and GSAs working at airports around the globe, in particular in developing economies, as they thereby gain skills that will constitute a personal advantage throughout their careers, including when working for other airlines. 41 Risk Assessment Program Our Relationship with the Community With Cargolux’ new maintenance facility now fully operational, Participation in education 2010 offered the opportunity to resume and develop the Company’s Risk Assessment Program. With growing fleets and constant advances in aircraft technology, airlines are in constant need of qualified experts that can While such a program is mandatory, the high number of processes maintain their aircraft and ensure a safe and profitable operation. inherent to the functioning of an airline such as Cargolux has required Realizing this already in 1979, Cargolux and Luxair initiated a a particularly important effort on the part of the Company to build up training system in cooperation with the Lycée Technique Privé and carry out its Risk Assessment Program, involving all concerned Emilé Metz, a Luxembourg-based technical high school, to ensure staff members. that their future staff needs are effectively covered.

Close to 280 positions are currently recorded in this system. 42 Support for Non-Governmental Organizations The Arts and Culture The support of the arts and culture is equally important to Cargolux. Flying for Help In 2010, we helped a number of institutions and individuals and Cargolux’ strength is the transportation of shipments over long carried art shipments for MUDAM, the Luxembourg Museum of distances. Putting this to good use, Cargolux offers its support to Modern Art, the “Casino Luxembourg” modern art institution as well non-governmental organizations to reduce the costs of relief and as the Mito Arts Foundation, close to Tokyo, Japan. aid shipments. Whenever space is available and the intended destination is within reach of Cargolux’ network, we carry these Other beneficiaries included Luxembourg artists who participated goods free-of-charge, often with the cooperation of our partners, in events and exhibitions organized by the Luxembourg-American for instance when trucking is required from/to a Cargolux gateway.

(“Cargolux”) to provide limited assurance on the chapter “Corporate Social Responsibility” (including the sub-chapters ‘The environment’, ‘The Social Dimension’ and the ‘Reporting process and GRI’) of the Annual Report 2010 of Cargolux (further referred to as the “Sustainability Report”) for the year ended December 31, 2010 as set out on pages 26 to 46. Management’s responsibility for the Sustainability Report Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (G3) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as described on pages 44 to 46 and the information and assertions contained within it, for determining Cargolux’s objectives in respect of sustainable development performance and reporting, including the identification of stakeholders and material issues; and for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which the reported performance information is derived. Responsibility of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement and to express a conclusion based on the work performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. This standard requires that we comply with applicable ethical requirements, including independence requirements, and that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Sustainability Report is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement on a sustainability report consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the sustainability report and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. These procedures included: • Inquiries of management to gain an understanding of Cargolux processes for determining the material issues for Cargolux key stakeholder groups. • Interviews with senior management and relevant staff at group level and selected business unit level concerning sustainability strategy and policies for material issues, and the implementation of these across the business. • Interviews with relevant staff at corporate and business unit level responsible for providing the information in the Sustainability Report. • Comparing the information presented in the Sustainability Report to corresponding information in the relevant underlying sources to determine whether all the relevant information contained in such underlying sources has been included in the Sustainability Report. • Reading the other information presented in the Annual Report 2010 of Cargolux to determine whether it is in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability performance of Cargolux. The extent of evidence gathering procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement is less than that for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore a lower level of assurance is provided. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report of Cargolux for the year ended December 31, 2010 is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (G3) of the Global Reporting Initiative as described on pages 44 to 46 of the Sustainability Report.

Generally, the Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only making deposits with, investing in securities issued by and buying protection The Group’s credit risk exposure is mitigated by a credit risk from counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A+ insurance against delinquent customer payments purchased from a from Standard & Poor’s and A1 from Moody’s.

The Group distinguishes Area IV 2,414 2,644 between countries considered as low risk and countries of higher risk depending on their geographical and political situation and monitors 200,816 176,575 customers on either list separately. Cargolux is a member of the IATA clearing systems CASS The Credit Committee has established a credit policy under which (Cargo Accounts Settlement Systems) and ICH (IATA Clearing House) each new customer not paying through CASS (Cargo Accounts commonly used by forwarders and airlines, respectively, to settle Settlement Systems) is analyzed individually for creditworthiness payments. In 2010, 67.6 % of receivables were cleared through before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and CASS and ICH (62.7 % in 2009). As of December 31, 2010, 97% conditions are offered.

The five largest customers of the Group represent 45 percent (2009: 45 percent) of the net cargo sales. More than 65 percent (2009: 73 percent) of the Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for over four years, and losses have occurred infrequently. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or legal entity, whether they are stand alone entities or part of a larger group, geographic location, aging profile, maturity and credit history. 62 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements As at December 31, 2010 Fuel hedges The Group uses derivative instruments, mainly options, to manage its fuel price risk. Most of the protection is provided through call options. To reduce the premiums paid for call options the Group sometimes combines the purchase of call options with the sale of put options, which creates a potential for the Group to pay out monies when prices are below the put strike price. Regular Risk Management Committee reviews ensure a solid balancing between such downside exposures and sustained protection against high fuel prices. During the second half of 2010, however, hedges provided positive cash flows so that for 2010 expenses in the order of the Group’s premium budget arose. Additionally, the Group benefited from fuel prices below business plan levels while enjoying protection against high prices, thus fulfilling its main fuel risk management objectives. As at December 31, 2010, a quantity of 164,503 metric tonnes was hedged for first half of 2011. For second half of 2011, the coverage amounted to 130,728 metric tonnes. Following the Company’s gradual approach to building the hedge portfolio, 2012 coverage stood at 49,669 metric tonnes only. In line with the Governance framework of Policy and Procedures the Group has created a portfolio providing sustained upside protection but no material downside exposure above US$/tonne 472 jet equivalent. Supplementing this conservative approach by active management provides the Group with the means to adapt the portfolio to fuel price dynamics and reduce risks. As at December 31, 2010, the fair value of fuel derivatives was as follows: In thousands of U.S. Dollar 2010 2009 Derivative assets 21,427 10,720 Derivative liabilities (11,357) (48,171) Balance at January 1 10,070 (37,451) Net change in fair value recognized in equity 30,703 Non-qualifying hedges recognized in profit and loss – prior year (10,070) 6,748 Non-qualifying hedges recognized in profit and loss – current year 17,631 10,070 Derivative assets 19,270 21,427 Derivative liabilities (1,639) (11,357) Balance at December 31 17,631 10,070 No new hedges have been considered for hedge accounting under IAS 39 in 2010 and 2009. 63 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements As at December 31, 2010 (c) Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group. Generally the Group does not incur non-dollar denominated indebtedness to finance its assets stated in US$ in order to eliminate any related volatility in profit or loss.
