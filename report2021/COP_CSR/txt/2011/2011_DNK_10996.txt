Together with the independent experts’ assessment, this convinced us that the mine is working actively to comply with all national and international standards,” says Louise Münter, Head of Media & Stakeholder Relations. She continues: “It also convinced us that it is beneficial to support suppliers in the long-term development and improvement of health and safety and environmental conditions via specific requirements for improvements, in particular in the coal mining industry, which is tackling many historical challenges, particularly in relation to environmental conditions and working conditions. We found areas that need improvement and we continue to work on this in partnership with our supplier.” In 2011, DONG Energy will conduct a follow-up audit in Columbia to ensure that the mine fulfils its corporate responsibility and complies with DONG Energy’s ethical rules. 22 Management’s review Dong energy annual report 2010 Overview of corporate responsibility statement Responsibility Action/ Status at GRI policy implementation Target 31.12.2010 reference Responsibility The safe way Preventing injuries No fatal accidents Unsatisfactory for emplo– or no way Three fatalities among yees and local suppliers in 2010 communities LTIF of 5.2 in 2011 LTIF of 4.6 LA7 Principles 1-6 of the The employees’ Employee survey Image and leadership are Job satisfaction UN Global perception of focus areas in 2011-2012.

In October 2010, the first production from the plant was delivered to Statoil and it now forms part of fuel sold at Danish petrol stations. Unlike the first-generation product, secondgeneration bioethanol does not use biomass that could otherwise be used for food products. This avoids competition for crops and pressure on food prices.

In Denmark, the dialogue with heat customers about increased use of biomass at central power stations will continue, along with the start-up of operation at the demonstration plant for gasification of biomass at the Asnæs power station. Dong energy annual report 2010 Management’s review 41 Energy markets The Energy Markets business area is responsible for optimising and managing the risk exposure of DONG Energy’s entire energy portfolio. Pooling responsibility for these activities enables DONG Energy to achieve synergies for the benefit of both our customers and the Group. Optimisation and risk management are effected by trading in energy with energy producers and wholesalers and via the European energy hubs and exchanges within the framework of the Group’s policies. 42 Management’s review Dong energy annual report 2010 LNG Terminal From the end of 2011, DONG Energy will be able to import gas via a Dutch liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal.

Business combinations In connection with business combinations, the Group makes judgements of the contracts concluded in order to determine whether the acquiree should be classified as a subsidiary, a jointly controlled asset, a jointly controlled entity or an associate. Such judgements are made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis based on purchase contracts concluded, shareholders’ agreements and similar agreements, which determine the extent to which control of the acquiree has been transferred. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the purchase method is used, and identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are valued at fair value in connection with the acquisition. The fair value of individual assets is determined based on publicly available market prices to the extent that an efficient market exists for the asset in question. No business combinations were effected in 2010. Transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with the group of owners.

At 31 December 2010, the carrying amount of gas written down. purchase rights was calculated at DKK 875 million (2009: DKK 948 million), CO2 emissions allowances amounted to DKK 182 million (2009: DKK 410 million) and the carrying amount of the connection right was DKK 292 million (2009: DKK 348 million). In 2010, there were indications of impairment of rights relating to CO2 emissions allowances, and impairment testing was therefore performed. It is estimated that the recoverable amount of rights to CO2 emissions allowances in the Netherlands is lower than the carrying amount. This has resulted in the recognition of a DKK 93 million impairment loss, which reflects a change in the Group’s estimate relating to the allocation of CO2 emissions allowances in the Netherlands. The right is recognised under the Generation segment. There were no indications of impairment of other rights in 2010. Consequently, other rights were not tested for impairment. In 2009, a DKK 37 million impairment loss was recognised in respect of discontinued projects. Completed development projects Completed development projects relate primarily to IT software and the development of technical solutions, including for the electricity grid. The carrying amount of completed development projects was DKK 357 million at 31 December 2010 (2009: DKK 245 million). There were no indications of impairment of completed development projects. Consequently, completed development projects were not tested for impairment. 98 Consolidated FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DONG energy annual report 2010 15 | Property, plant and equipment Property, Fixtures and plant and Land fittings, tools equipment and Production Exploration and under DKK million buildings assets assets equipment construction Total Cost at 1 January 2010 3,482 74,257 2,997 473 13,043 94,252 Foreign exchange adjustments 2 1,426 49 433 1,910 Additions 20 2,840 386 12 13,046 16,304 Disposals (27) (744) (100) (13) (196) (1,080) Transfer to assets classified as held for sale (4) (1,046) (1) (1) (1,052) Transfers 6 9,516 (2,357) 11 (7,176) 0 Reclassifications 28 12 40 Cost at 31 December 2010 3,507 86,249 975 482 19,161 110,374 Depreciation and impairment losses at 1 January 2010 (469) (23,430) (206) (17) (24,122) Foreign exchange adjustments (324) (1) (325) Depreciation on disposals 11 171 13 195 Depreciation charge (141) (5,111) (84) (5,336) Impairment charge (23) (294) (317) Transfer to assets classified as held for sale 2 241 1 244 Reclassifications (28) (28) Depreciation and impairment losses at 31 December 2010 (648) (28,747) 0 (277) (17) (29,689) Carrying amount at 31 December 2010 2,859 57,502 975 205 19,144 80,685 DONG energy annual report 2010 Consolidated FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 99 notes to the balance sheet 15 | Property, plant and equipment Property, Fixtures and plant and fittings, tools equipment Land and Production Exploration and under DKK million buildings assets assets equipment construction Total Cost at 1 January 2009 3,292 60,054 2,784 373 7,620 74,123 Foreign exchange adjustments 4 2,535 75 3 181 2,798 Addition on acquisition of enterprises 1,160 4 1,801 2,965 Additions 37 2,144 699 110 13,540 16,530 Disposals on disposal of enterprises (1,484) (11) (78) (1,573) Disposals (28) (460) (14) (40) (5) (547) Transfers 177 10,308 (547) 34 (10,016) (44) Cost at 31 December 2009 3,482 74,257 2,997 473 13,043 94,252 Depreciation and impairment losses at 1 January 2009 (343) (19,408) (157) (220) (20,128) Foreign exchange adjustments (1) (566) 1 (2) (568) Disposals on disposal of enterprises 1,037 10 1,047 Depreciation on disposals 319 21 340 Depreciation charge (125) (3,866) (81) (4,072) Impairment charge (726) (15) (741) Transfers (220) 220 0 Depreciation and impairment losses at 31 December 2009 (469) (23,430) 0 (206) (17) (24,122) Carrying amount at 31 December 2009 3,013 50,827 2,997 267 13,026 70,130 Depreciation and impairment losses can be broken down as follows: DKK million 2010 2009 Production costs 5,577 4,687 Sales and marketing 12 16 Management and administration 64 110 Depreciation and impairment losses 5,653 4,813 Impairment testing whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating DONG Energy tests property, plant and equipment for impairunit exceeds its recoverable amount. ment if there is any indication of impairment.
