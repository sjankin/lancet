Communication on Progress 2011 General Period covered by our Communication on Progress (COP) From: 1. January 2010 to 31. December 2010 Statement of continued support by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) “Acting in a socially responsible way is very important to Ekornes. This is true of all parts of our value chain, from our relations with subcontractors in the local communities in which we manufacture, to all parts of the world in which we are engaged in sales activities. To ensure our efforts in the field of corporate social responsibility are well anchored and properly structured, Ekornes has been associated with the UN’s Global Compact scheme since 2009. This framework is relevant for the way Ekornes addresses human rights, labour rights and environmental issues, and the fight against corruption. Ekornes will continue to support this framework and set itself ever higher goals in this area.” Extraction from “Message from the CEO” in Ekornes Annual Report 2010 (pp. 18-19) EKORNES ASA Industriveien 1, N-6222 IKORNNES www.ekornes.com Tel.: +47 70 25 52 00 Fax: +47 70 25 53 00 Org. no: NO 964 976 430 Human Rights Principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses (For more information on the principles, click here) Assessment, Policy and Goals Description of the relevance of human rights for the company (i.e. human rights risk‐assessment). Description of policies, public commitments and company goals on Human Rights. According to the Group’s policy, Ekornes shall act as a responsible enterprise and operate within all relevant laws, regulations and to strict ethical standards. Ekornes clearly states, both internally and externally, that the company endeavor to comply with the UN’s Global Compact’s ten principles. This policy is presented in the “Objectives and Values for the Ekornes Group”, which is available for all stakeholders. All Ekornes’ production facilities are located in Norway, but the company’s operations rely on suppliers of raw material and distributors all over the world. This means that the company has to face different cultures and legislations for business operations in different regions, which can be challenging. Towards internal and external business partners, Ekornes makes clear that the company expects and requires compliance with local legislations and the UN Global Compact’s ten principles. Increased purchasing activities in far east markets may have increased the risk associated with suppliers that do not follow the principles on Human Rights. External audits of supplier’s Human Rights performance in this part of the world is today difficult to perform. To increase the company’s competence on this field, Ekornes will during 2011 consider a membership in the organization “Ethical Trading Initiative Norway”. A membership will give Ekornes access to valuable tools and guidance, as well as a network to work with regarding monitoring and improving the respect of Human Rights with our suppliers and dealers. Implementation Description of concrete actions to implement Human Rights policies, reduce Human Rights risks and respond to Human Rights violations. Ekornes continuously focus on Human Rights policies through leadership training programs, new employee training, language courses, annual distribution of information in the personnel handbook and requirements to suppliers. All suppliers to Ekornes have to confirm compliance to the UN Global Compact’s ten principles through signing the “Suppliers declarations on Social and Environmental Performance” (Attachment #1). Measurement of outcomes Description of how the company monitors and evaluates performance. Ekornes has no specific measurements of outcomes with regards to Human Rights Principles in the reporting period. Ekornes experiences that the suppliers have an increasing understanding of why Ekornes needs to ensure suppliers compliance to the UN Global Compact’s ten principles and provide declarations on social and environmental performance. It also seems like the policy of more and more suppliers is already to comply accordingly. For further information about Ekornes’ assessment, policy and goals, implementation and measurement of outcomes with regards to Human Rights, we refer to the following documents: Ekornes – Objectives and Values Ekornes Ethical Standard Ekornes Annual Report 2010 (p. 49 – 53) Attachment: #1: “Suppliers declarations on Social and Environmental Performance” EKORNES ASA Industriveien 1, N-6222 IKORNNES www.ekornes.com Tel.: +47 70 25 52 00 Fax: +47 70 25 53 00 Org. no: NO 964 976 430 Labour Principles Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Assessment, Policy and Goals Description of the relevance of labour rights for the company (i.e. labour rights‐related risks and opportunities). Description of written policies, public commitments and company goals on labour rights. The majority of Ekornes employees lives in Norway where labour rights are strongly regulated by law. There is a long tradition in Ekornes to maintain good dialogue between management and labour unions. Ekornes strongly believe that respecting labour rights is an important factor in the work to reduce sick–leave, and increase effectiveness and profitability. The majority of Ekornes’ employees are organized into various labour unions. The Ekornes management team has over years experienced constructive cooperation with all of the unions through continuous dialogue and regular meetings. Negotiation committees are established to represent the employees in yearly local wage negotiations. Employees are represented in the board of all Ekornes’ production companies and also in the parent company. These representatives hold the same rights as members chosen by the shareholders. The Ekornes personnel handbook includes policies that clearly state the employee rights, responsibilities, compensations and benefits. For external partners, Ekornes requires that they respect the UN Global Compact’s 10 principles. Implementation Description of concrete actions taken by your company to implement labour policies, reduce labour risks and respond to labour violations. Labour policies are available through the personnel handbook. A revised edition of this handbook is distributed to all employees once a year. All new employees must during the first two years in the company participate in new employee training where labour rights is one of the main topics. All employees have a detailed job description and contract which clearly states the employee’s duties and rights. A significant part of the yearly investments (about 100 million NOK) is allocated to activities which improve health and safety of the employees. Ekornes has appointed a HSE coordinator in a permanent position. All suppliers must sign and return the “Suppliers declarations on Social and Environmental Performance” to confirm that they adhere to the labour principles Measurement of outcomes Description of how the company monitors and evaluates performance. One of the indicators which evaluate performance on labour rights is the company’s sickness absence rate. The Group had a sickness absence rate of 6.8 per cent in 2010. This is a decrease of 0.2 percentage points compared with 2009. Approx. 4.6 per cent of the total number of hours worked in the Group were lost due to longterm sickness absence. This is a decrease of 0.1 percentage points. Short-term sickness absence (less than 14 days) came to around 2.1 per cent, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points. The management at each plant is working actively to reduce the level of sickness absence through individual follow-up and other measures. For further information about Ekornes’ assessment, policy and goals, implementation and measurement of outcomes with regards to Labour Principles, we refer to the following documents: Ekornes – Objectives and Values Ekornes Annual Report 2010 (pp. 49 – 53) EKORNES ASA Industriveien 1, N-6222 IKORNNES www.ekornes.com Tel.: +47 70 25 52 00 Fax: +47 70 25 53 00 Org. no: NO 964 976 430 Attachments: #1: “Suppliers declarations on Social and Environmental Performance” Environmental Principles Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Assessment, Policy and Goals Description of the relevance of environmental protection for the company (i.e. environmental risks and opportunities). Description of policies, public commitments and company goals on environmental protection The environmental policy is presented in Ekornes – Objectives and Values and available for all stakeholders. Environmental practice is a part of the Ekornes culture which is built on a strong Scandinavian heritage and tradition to protect the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Ekornes encourage “More with Less” through the whole value chain: Create more value with less use of resources. Ekornes has implemented a lot of green practices at the company’s manufacturing facilities. One of the most important is reduction of the company’s carbon footprint by continuously investing in eco-friendly technology. Ekornes considers that extraction and transportation of raw materials for production of components and transportation of chairs to customers represent the largest impact on the environment. Since Ekornes only has indirect influence on these processes, we take responsibility by continuously improving the efficiency in our processes without an increase in use of raw materials and other resources. One example is that Ekornes develops new products using platform components. Use of platform components gives Ekornes the opportunity to use advanced technology and robots for mass production – which again leads to a rational use of raw materials and a minimization of waste. This gives better profitability both for the environment and the company, and will be the main focus also in the future. Use of platform components gives Ekornes the advantage of good and stable quality by focusing on fewer components. This contributes to the long lifespan of our products. Another example is the wide use of bio-energy and heat pump technology that Ekornes has implemented at its manufacturing facilities over the last twenty years. In 2011 we aim to sort out further potential to increase the use of bio-energy. Risks and opportunities assessment is enclosed in the Carbon Disclosure Report for 2010. Ekornes requires that all suppliers must sign and return the “Suppliers declarations on Social and Environmental Performance” to confirm that they adhere to the UN Global Compacts Environmental principles. Implementation Description of concrete actions to implement environmental policies, reduce environmental risks and respond to environmental incidents Ekornes established an Environmental Steering Group in 2008, reporting directly to CEO. The group consists of people with different backgrounds and from different departments. Product development, marketing, chemistry, purchasing, Health and safety are represented today. The Environmental Steering Group co-ordinates the input from the whole organization on a daily basis, and all employees are welcome to ask questions and suggest improvements. Newsletters, information about changes in regulations and questions from consumers are collected to keep up to date on potential upcoming changes. In short, the Environmental Steering Group works to bridge the gaps between the different markets and departments, and function as a central hub for environmental issues EKORNES ASA Industriveien 1, N-6222 IKORNNES www.ekornes.com Tel.: +47 70 25 52 00 Fax: +47 70 25 53 00 Org. no: NO 964 976 430 and expertise. The group presents an annual report to the top management team, which gives useful information for the company-wide risk management process. In 2010 the Steering Group appointed a Green Ambassador at each sales office, who reports environmental issues directly to the group. Eventually hazardous chemicals are continuously monitored and evaluated by the internal Ekornes Chemical Committee. In 2010 Ekornes established a regular green feature in “Ekornes Inside”, internal newsletter distributed to all employees and families, to build green awareness and competencies to internal resources. The environmental strategy is presented in the Ekornes – Objectives and Values which is translated into both Norwegian and English and distributed to all employees. This document is also available for all stakeholders. “Objectives and Values for the Ekornes Group” has been developed with involvement from the whole organization, and is central in new employee training and leadership development programs. Our business and investment strategies include focus on shared value projects, representing both social, environmental and financial profitability. Specific progress during the reporting period: Business decision: Production unit for Ekornes Stressless Sofas to be established in US during 2011. Aspect of improved environmental performance: Ekornes Stressless Sofas cannot be shipped part assembled, are bulky and give a non-efficient transport volume. Shipping components for assembly locally will reduce the carbon footprint for the sofas. Business decisions: Water based painting facility for the wooden base of Stressless recliners (opened May 2011). Aspect of improved environmental performance: Reduction of needed energy, use of chemicals and use of water. Improved health performance at workplace and reduced harmful evaporation to humans and environment. Business decision: Introduction of Comfort Zones™ in the seat and back of the Stressless chairs and sofas. Aspect of improved environmental performance: Increased comfort, quality and lifespan of the products with less use of raw materials. Ekornes also raises awareness among suppliers by requiring that all suppliers must respect our Ethical and Environmental standard. All suppliers must confirm compliance according to the UN Global Compact’s ten principles through signing “Suppliers declarations on Social and Environmental Performance”. Measurement of outcomes Description of how the company monitors and evaluates environmental performance Ekornes reported according to Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for this reporting period. This was the first time Ekornes reported to CDP and it is expected that this framework will become a useful tool for measuring and managing the company’s carbon emissions. To document the products’ impact on the environment, Ekornes has developed environmental product declarations (EPD) for the entire Stressless collection in the reporting period. EPDs assess the products environmental impact from a life cycle perspective, from extraction of raw materials to final disposal. Using this information in product development will make Ekornes able to put effort where it counts and develop even greener products. The ambition is to have third party verification of the EPDs according to ISO 14025 during 2011/ 2012. Ekornes reports development of HSE in the Annual Report, including emissions, waste handling, energy use and health and security issues. For further information about Ekornes’ assessment, policy and goals, implementation and measurement of outcomes with regards to Environment Principles, we refer to the following documents: EKORNES ASA Industriveien 1, N-6222 IKORNNES www.ekornes.com Tel.: +47 70 25 52 00 Fax: +47 70 25 53 00 Org. no: NO 964 976 430 Ekornes – Objectives and Values Ekornes Annual Report 2010 (pp. 49 – 53) Attachments: #1: “Suppliers declarations on Social and Environmental Performance” #2: Ekornes Carbon Disclosure Report for 2010 Anti‐Corruption Principles Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Assessment, Policy and Goals Description of the relevance of anti‐corruption for the company (i.e. anti‐corruption risk‐assessment). Description of policies, public commitments and company goals on anti‐corruption. Ekornes has zero-tolerance for corruption, bribery and extortion. This policy is clearly stated in Ekornes Ethical Standard and made known to all employees and business partners. Ekornes’ main operations (manufacturing, head office, purchasing) are all located in Norway. The transparency in daily operations and the Norwegian business culture both contribute to a relatively low exposure to risk of corruption. However, Ekornes does business through sales channels in parts of the world where corruption and bribery are a larger part of the business traditions. The top management team has continuous focus on risk of corruption. Implementation Description of concrete actions to implement anti‐corruption policies, reduce anti‐corruption risks and respond to incidents. The Ekornes Ethical Standard is provided to all employees all over the world and available in the personnel handbook for the Scandinavian employees. The Ekornes Ethical Standard contain an overview of ethical rules related to corruption. Other documents like “Ekornes Objectives and Values”, company regulations, employment contracts and job descriptions also contain ethical rules. A duty of confidentiality contained in the company regulations, employment contracts or job descriptions does not prevent employees from informing about breaches of regulations, legislation or rules laid down by the authorities. This also applies to internal guidelines, provisions or issues that might harm Ekornes’ reputation or other parties’ trust in Ekornes. The top management team is responsible for anti-corruption. Measurement of outcomes Description of how the company monitors and evaluates anti‐corruption performance. At the time, Ekornes does not perform external audits of anti-corruption. However, all suppliers have already been made aware of the contents of the Ekornes Ethical Standard and also been informed that an attempt to contravene these ethical rules could result in exclusion.
