In terms of recycling, 100% of its waste matter is sorted and reused, and kitchen waste is composted on site. COLLABORATION AND INNOVATION Addressing environmental impacts is obviously neither just an issue for Capgemini nor something we just do in our own company. Many of the issues are global or regional at the very least, and no organization has the knowledge, technology or resources to address them alone. Managing environmental issues and making a real difference to them highlights the dependencies between customers and suppliers and, in turn, the criticality of collaboration between different organizations, and product and process innovation. The Group therefore aims to communicate openly with its people, clients, suppliers and, in some cases, its competitors about the achievements and challenges Capgemini faces in managing its environmental impact. We are also engaging with industry forums and non-governmental organizations to share experiences and insights, and to identify opportunities to enable our collective performance to move ahead.
