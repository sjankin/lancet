Appendices 358 · Annual Report 2010 Letter from the Chairman Three key elements underpin our Strategic plan: cost eﬃciency, ﬁnancial strength and investment geared to sustainable long-term value creation. 4 Dear Shareholders, It is a pleasure for me to address you once again, on the occasion of the publication of this Annual Report for 2010. As you know, 2010 has been a diﬃcult year for all of us, especially regarding the economy. Enagás has not been unaﬀected by this situation. The fall in natural gas consumption in 2009 prompted us to reconsider the level of investment needed in the system for the next few years. In the light of this new investment scenario, Enagás started work on updating its Strategic Plan in July 2010, setting new targets for the period 2010-2014. The Plan covering the years to 2014 is based on three fundamental principles: cost eﬃciency, ﬁnancial strength and implementation of the programmed investments, focusing on the creation of value for our shareholders. Although we anticipate slower growth in investment, we remain conﬁdent that proﬁts will increase. For the years 2010-2014 we have prudently estimated an average annual increase of 7%. Regarding 2010, I am extremely pleased to report that we once again closed the year with results exceeding our targets. Net proﬁt was up by 11.9% against our forecast of 10% at the beginning of the year. This will allow us to propose the distribution of a gross dividend of €0.84 per share for approval at the General Shareholders Meeting, compared with a €0.75 dividend last year, an increase in line with our earStock market performance nings growth. and shareholder structure 2010 also saw us buy third party assets for the ﬁrst time.

Once again I would like to draw attention to Enagás’ ﬁnancial policy during the year.

However, stood at €645Mn. there has been a healthy recovery in conventional demand, which rose by 10%.

In 2011 we shall show the same commitment and continue to work hard to meet our targets, overcome new challenges and create value sustainably. 6 Corporate Responsibility Enagás’ commitment to a Sustainable Management Model which is geared to innovation and improvement has been reﬂected in initiatives such as the appointment of the Independent Leader Director and the creation of an Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committee, which underline management’s commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility. All the Enagás business units have Antonio Llardén been involved in implementing over 60 lines of acChairman tion as part of our Quality, Excellence and Sustainability Master Plan, the results of which are reviewed annually using a variety of internal tools and by external organisations.

Stakeholders were asked to evaluate the importance of aspects related to ﬁnance, the markets, corporate governance, operations, individuals and society, together with the company's performance on these aspects and their own relationship with Enagás. The issues included in this consultation process were identiﬁed internally as part of the Reputational Risk Self-assessment Process (see Risk Management section), taking into account the results of the surveys carried out in 2008 and the assessments of a range of sustainability indices. This consultation, along with the customer satisfaction survey (see Commitment to Customers section), allows Enagás to maximise its eﬀorts with regard to the attention and service it oﬀers its customers and the rest of its stakeholders (investors, shareholders, regulatory bodies, suppliers, society, ﬁnancial entities, insurance entities, etc.). The results enable Enagás to identify the lines of action needed to help improve its management. · Annual Report 2010 Sustainable Management in Enagás Economic value distributed EC1 €MN 2008 2009 2010 Economic Value Generated Net sales 820.7 866.8 966.0 Other revenues 39.5 34.7 34.8 Total EVG 860.2 901.5 1,000.8 Economic Value Distributed Suppliers: Other operating expenses 148.8 137.2 147.3 40 Payments to suppliers 45.5 46.5 48.1 Lease and ownership expenses 36.4 36.1 37.7 Other 66.9 54.6 61.5 Society 113.4 127.7 144.3 Taxes 112.8 126.9 143.0 Investment in social action(*) 0.6 0.8 1.3 Employees: Personnel expenses 69.0 60.7 67.2 Wages, salaries and similar remuneration 61.4 56.0 61.6 Pension contributions and provisions 2.1 2.1 2.2 Other social security expenses 14.2 15.8 16.8 Healthcare insurance 1.4 1.4 1.2 Canteen services/subsidised food 1.5 1.5 1.6 Capital expenditure -11.6 -16.1 -16.2 Capital providers 222.3 240.0 258.7 Dividends paid to shareholders 155.3 178.8 200.1 Net financial result 67.0 61.2 58.6 Total EVD 553.4 565.7 617.5 Economic value retained Reserves 103.6 119.3 133.4 Depreciation and amortisation 203.1 216.6 249.9 Total EVR 306.7 335.9 383.3 Other indicators Investment 776.9 901.6 796.3 (*) This ﬁgure varies from that reported in the Commitment to Society section, which includes investments in social action managed by the Communications Department EVALUATION/REVIEW PLANNING/ IMPLEMENTATION/ MECHANISM PRIORITISATION MONITORING Q Internal and External Audits (ISO 9000) Corrective/ preventive measures Stakeholder consultation mechanisms Quality Action Plan Stakeholder action plan Quality, Self-assessment/ 41 E assessment according to Priority improvement areas Excellence and Sustainability Excellence EFQM model Action Plan Master Plan S Assessment using DJSI/GRI Action Plan by area (economic, social, environmental) Sustainability model Continuous improvement 3.1.3.

Performance assessment Enagás assesses the performance of its employees through two assessment systems: a) Performance assessment: Enagás has introduced a performance review system for senior or middle management staff not covered by collective agreements. These reviews are a key determinant of their career advancement and fixed remuneration. In 2010 a scheme for improving this system was introduced: a map for the competences of all staff not covered by collective agreements was drawn up and a pilot project carried out with staff from all categories (50 individuals), to evaluate the desirability of extending the system to assess the performance of all staff not covered by collective agreements in future years. There is a significant decline in language training as, At 31 December 2010, 51.8% of staff not covered by under the new language policy, which includes collective agreements were included in the system face-to-face and on-line tuition, the Learning Confor assessing performance. tract covers a period from 1 April to 31 March.

This system applies to 100% of the staﬀ excluded from the collective agreement, and is directly reﬂected in their variable earnings (36.3% of the total workforce).

At Enagás all accidents are reported, whether they lead to sick leave or otherwise, are fatal, serious or multiple, as well as other incidents. The corresponding records are completed in all cases and the most significant incidents are investigated LA7 -. In 2010, to extend the scope of the information reIn 2010 the seriousness index rose as a result of the ported regarding accidents, Enagás has asked the greater number of working days lost (471).

Information is thus provided by the sub-contractor with the largest number of employees on the company’s premises, all sub-contractors involved in construction projects, and sub-contractors’ staff at regasification plants (Barcelona, Cartagena and Huelva).

In 2010, Enagás worked closely with ERGEG in formulating the following framework guidelines: • Framework guidelines for mechanisms to assign capacity, the main aim being to optimise the use of interconnection capacity between member states, integrate markets and develop trading by standardising the way in which capacity at interconnection points is made available. 123 • The purpose of the framework guidelines for balance is to develop the functioning of the internal gas market, establishing rules for balance based on market mechanisms.

Enagás is an active member, is made up of all market agents in France, Spain and Portugal and is led by the Spanish National Energy Commission (CNE). Within the SGRI, increasing interconnection capacity between Spain and France is a fundamental priority. The development of an Open Season between Spain and France responds to this need. The Open Season is a coordinated process for assigning capacity, whose main aim is to assess the interest of the market and put the necessary infrastructures in place to meet demand. Open Seasons are necessary in France for decisions on investment and, although this is not the case in Spain, the decision has been taken to standardise regulatory procedures. In 2010 the South Gas Regional Initiative has continued the work started in previous years on developing Open Season regulations to increase capacity between Spain and France. · Annual Report 2010 Our Commitments “Our corporate governance model lays the foundations on which to base the company's management, 124 while ensuring due compliance with applicable law and adopting the best international practices, the ultimate aim of guaranteeing sustainable value creation for our stakeholders and managing any risks that may prevent this” Rafael Piqueras, General Secretary Key indicators 2010 16 60.917% Members of General the Board of Shareholders' Directors Meeting attendance 8 Independent members of the Board of Directors 2 48 Women on Recommendathe Board tions of the Code of Good of Directors Governance followed 4.8.

Procedures for establishing board members’ remuneration and relevant provisions in the bylaws The process for establishing remuneration for Board members is covered in Article 36 of the Company Bylaws, which establishes the following: 156 The position of Director shall be remunerated. The General Meeting shall determine the total maximum remuneration to be paid to Directors, and this shall comprise a cash sum payable on an annual basis or in respect of such period as the General Meeting may determine. When setting remuneration, the General Meeting may resolve that part of such pay remunerate the office of director itself, equally for all directors, and another part be apportioned by the Board on such basis as may be determined at the General Meeting. Directors may receive additional remuneration in the form of company shares, share options or other securities that enable the holder to obtain shares, or through other remuneration systems based on the price of the shares quoted on a public exchange. The application of the said systems shall be presented to the General Meeting for approval, and the Meeting shall determine the value of the shares granted to each Director, the price for the exercise of option rights, the term of duration and all other conditions deemed appropriate. Remuneration established herein shall be compatible with and independent from salaries, wages, indemnifications, pensions or compensations of any type established in general or in particular for those members of the Board of Directors who are linked to the company through a normal labour relationship, special senior manager contract, or a contract for services. Such relationships must be compatible with the position of member of the Board of Directors. Directors shall be entitled to the payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred as a result of attendance at meetings and other tasks directly related to the performance of their duties, such as travel, accommodation, meals and any other which may arise. By virtue of the foregoing, Enagás has established a payment framework for Directors aimed at covering both the responsibilities involved in carrying out their duties, and effective dedication and attendance at sessions, without removing or limiting the powers of the GSM in any way. This body is responsible for determining the maximum amount to be paid to Directors and the form and criteria that must be taken into account in assigning and distributing such payment, to be effected by the Board of Directors, in accordance with guidelines established by the General Meeting. Likewise, article 16 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors stipulates that the Nomination, Remuneration and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee establish payment criteria for Company Directors, within the scope of the Company Bylaws and in accordance with resolutions of the General Meeting, while the Board of Directors is responsible for ﬁnal distribution of the overall sum within the limits established by Bylaws for this purpose. The Board of Directors may, on an annual basis, delegate the powers conferred upon it in respect of the remuneration of Directors to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, subject to the restrictions laid down in the Bylaws. Payments to Directors shall be transparent.

Appointees for Directorships must be persons who, in addition to satisfying the requirements for oﬃce under the law and the Bylaws, have recognised prestige and the professional expertise and experience appropriate to the performance of their duties. Any nomination for a Directorship which the Board lays before the General Meeting and any appointment made by the Board in the exercise of its statutory powers of co-option must be preceded by an appropriate proposal from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Following Good Governance Recommendations, when the Board of Directors departs from the Committee’s recommendations it must explain its reasons, and such rationale must be duly recorded in the minutes. Selection processes must be free of any implied bias against women candidates. The Company shall seek out and include women with the target proﬁle among candidates for Board places. Special mention should be made of the speciﬁc requirements that have been established to ensure the impartiality and independence of Independent Directors appointed to the Board, which are set out in article 9 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors: Independent Directors are deﬁned as those who, appointed based on their personal and professional aptitudes, may perform their duties without being aﬀected by dealings with the Company, its signiﬁcant shareholders or its executives. Under no circumstances may the following be classiﬁed as Independent Directors: a) Persons who have been employed by or served as Executive Directors of Group companies, unless three (3) or ﬁve (5) years, respectively, have elapsed since the termination of that relationship. b) Persons who receive any sum or beneﬁt other than Director’s remuneration from the Company or its Group, unless such beneﬁt is negligible. Dividends and pension supplements received by a Director on account of his/her prior professional or employment relationship shall not be taken into account for purposes of this section provided that such supplements are unconditional and, consequently, the company providing them may not, on a discretionary basis, suspend, modify or revoke any accrual thereof, without incurring a breach of obligations. c) Persons who are, or have been during the past three (3) years, a partner of the external auditor or party respon159 sible for the auditor’s report reviewing the accounts of Enagás, S.A. or any other Group company for that period. d) Persons who are executive directors or senior managers of another company where an Executive Director or Senior manager of Enagás, S.A. is an External Director. e) Persons who maintain, or have maintained in the past year, a signiﬁcant business relationship with Enagás, S.A. or any other Group company, whether on his/her own behalf or as a signiﬁcant shareholder, director or senior manager of any company that maintains or has maintained such relationship. Business relationships shall be deﬁned as relationships whereby the company serves as a provider of goods or services, including those of a ﬁnancial nature, or as an advisor or consultant. f ) Persons who are signiﬁcant shareholders, executive directors or senior managers of any entity that receives, or has received during the past three (3) years, signiﬁcant gifts from Enagás, S.A. or its Group. Patrons or trustees of any foundation that receives donations shall not be included under this section. g) Spouses, partners or relatives up to the second degree of any of the Company’s Executive Directors or senior managers. h) Persons who have not been nominated, whether for appointment or renewal, by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. i) Those who are found, in respect of a signiﬁcant shareholder or one represented on the Board, in any of the circumstances described under a), e), f ) or g). In the event of kinship as described under letter g), this limitation shall apply not only in respect of the shareholder, but also in respect of its proprietary directors at the investee. Proprietary Directors who lose their status as such as a result of the sale of their interest by the shareholder that they represented may only be re-elected as Independent Directors if the shareholder that they represented until that time has sold all of its shares in the Company. Any Director holding an interest in the Company may hold the status of Independent Director provided that he/she meets all of the conditions established under this article and, further, that his/her interest is not signiﬁcant. Re-election: Article 10 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors stipulates that “Directors may hold their post for a period of four (4) years, and may be re-elected. Directors who are co-opted shall hold oﬃce until the date of the ﬁrst subsequent General Meeting. As a general rule, an appropriate rotation of Independent Directors shall be sought. For this reason, when an Independent Director is proposed for re-election, the circumstances making this Director’s continuity in the post advisable must be justiﬁed. Independent Directors shall not remain as such for a period in excess of twelve (12) consecutive years. · Annual Report 2010 Annual Corporate Governance Report for Listed Limited Companies Appraisal: Article 11 of the Regulations of the Board stipulates that the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, responsible for evaluating the quality of work and dedication to their oﬃces of the Directors proposed during the previous term of oﬃce, shall provide information required to assess proposal for re-election of Directors presented by the Board of Directors to the General Meeting. Removal and dismissal: Directors shall leave their post after the ﬁrst General Meeting following the end of their term of appointment and 160 in all other cases in accordance with the law, the Bylaws and these Regulations (article 12.1 of the Regulations of the Board). The Board of Directors shall not propose the removal of Independent Directors before the expiry of their tenure as mandated by the Bylaws, except where just cause is found by the Board, based on a proposal from the Nomination Committee (article 12.3 of the Regulations of the Board). B.1.20 Indicate the cases in which directors must resign. In accordance with Corporate Governance recommendations, article 12 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors stipulates that: Directors must place their oﬃces at the Board of Directors’disposal, and tender their resignation, if the Board deems ﬁt, in the following cases: a) When they are involved in any of the statutory circumstances of incompatibility or prohibition. b) When they are in serious breach of their duties as Directors. c) When they may put the interests of the Company at risk or damage its credibility and reputation. The moment a Director is indicted or tried for any of the oﬀences stated in article 124 of the Companies Act, the Board shall examine the matter and, in view of the particular circumstances and potential harm to the Company's name and reputation, decide whether or not the Director shall be called on to resign. d) When the reason for which they were appointed as Directors no longer holds. e) When Independent Directors cease to meet the conditions established under article 9. f ) When the shareholder represented by a Proprietary Director sells its entire interest. They shall also do so, in the appropriate number, when that shareholder reduces its stake to a level requiring a reduction in the number of its Proprietary Directors. Should the Board of Directors not deem it advisable to have a Director tender his/her resignation in the cases speciﬁed in points d), e) and f ), the latter must be included in the category that, in accordance with these Regulations, is most appropriate based on his/her new circumstances. The Board of Directors shall not propose the removal of Independent Directors before the expiry of their tenure as mandated by the Bylaws, except where just cause is found by the Board, based on a proposal from the Nomination Committee. After a Director resigns from his/her post, he/she may not work for a competitor for a period of two (2) years, unless exempted from this duty or the duration of the duty is shortened by the Board of Directors. B.1.21 Indicate whether the duties of chief executive officer fall upon the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

In addition to the powers and duties attributed to him/her by law and the Bylaws, the Chairman shall exercise the management in practice of the Company's affairs, always in accordance with the decisions and criteria laid down by the General Meeting and the Board of Directors in their respective spheres of authority. However, the Board of Directors’Regulations contain a detailed list of issues which must be presented to the Board; in general terms, the Board retains sole authority on operations valued at over €3 million. Similarly, Enagás, S.A.’s internal regulations on investment and tendering also reserve decision making powers for the Board for sums of over €3 million. Indicate, and if necessary, explain whether rules have been established that enable any of the independent Directors to convene board meetings or include new items on the agenda, to coordinate and voice the concerns of External Directors and oversee the evaluation by the Board of Directors. YES Explanation of rules Article 17 of the Regulations of the Board of Enagás, S.A. stipulates that, if the Chairman of the Board is also the Company's chief executive, the Board may give powers to one of the Independent Directors to demand that a Board meeting be convened or that additional items of business be included on the agenda, to collate and voice the concerns of External Directors, and to direct the Board's assessment of the Chairman's performance. In 2010, the Board of Enagás, S.A. also approved the delegation of powers to the Chairman of the Nomination, Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committee, currently Independent Director Dionisio Martínez Martínez, to call board meetings or include new items on the agenda in order to coordinate and convey the concerns of Directors and to lead the Board’s evaluation of its chairman.

Explanation of reasons and initiatives At the time of writing of this report, two (2) of the Directors on the Board of Enagás, S.A. are women – María Teresa García-Milá Lloveras and Isabel Sánchez García – out of a total sixteen (16) Directors. In 2009 there was only one woman Director. Enagás, S.A., in the awareness that it must continue to encourage and facilitate the presence of women in the event of any vacancy arising on the Board, particularly for Independent Directorships, resolved at the General Meeting 163 of 30 April 2010 to appoint Isabel Sánchez García as an Independent Director. This development was consistent with article 8 of the Regulations of the Board, which prescribes that selection processes must be free of any implied bias that might stand in the way of the selection of women Directors. The Company shall seek out and include women with the target profile among candidates for Board places. Indicate in particular whether the Appointments and Remunerations Committee has established procedures to ensure the selection processes are not subject to implicit bias that will make it diﬃcult to select female directors, and make a conscious eﬀort to search for female candidates who have the required proﬁle. YES Indicate the main procedures In the exercise of its functions, and in accordance with the Regulations of the Board of Directors, whenever a vacancy arises, the Nomination, Remuneration and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee analyses the professional profile of potential female candidates and thus endeavours to ensure that the number of female Directors on the Company’s Board is progressively increased. B.1.28 Indicate whether there are any formal processes for granting proxies at board meetings. If so, give brief details.

Upon authorising the ﬁnancial statements for issue, the Board shall attend to any comments or recommendations submitted by the Audit and Compliance Committee in its prior report. If the ﬁnancial statements depart from the 165 prior report issued by the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Board of Directors shall provide an adequate explanation of the reasons for the discrepancy. The Board of Directors shall endeavour to present the ﬁnancial statements in such a way that there are no grounds for qualiﬁcation from the Company's Accounts Auditor. However, if the Board of Directors determines that it must stand by a contrary view, it shall publicly explain the content and extent of the discrepancy. Article 7, paragraph c) of the Audit and Compliance Committee Regulations states that said Committee shall“serve as a channel for communications between the Auditors and the Board of Directors, evaluating the results of each audit and the management team’s responses to its recommendations, and mediating and arbitrating in the event of disagreement between the two concerning the principles and criteria to be applied in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements. Enagás, S.A. has established quarterly reviews of its ﬁnancial statements to detect any possible risks that could aﬀect these and any qualiﬁcations which may arise.

B.1.35 Indicate the mechanisms, if any, established by the company to preserve the independence of the auditors, of financial analysts, of investment banks and of rating agencies. Measures in aid of preserving auditor independence: The Audit and Compliance Committee is the organ created by the Board to carry on relations with the company’s external auditors. The chief purposes of the Audit and Compliance Committee are to evaluate the Company’s accounting veriﬁcation system, ensure the independence of the External Accounts Auditor, review the internal control system, safeguard the transparency of information, and ensure compliance with the Internal Code of Conduct. In addition, it is responsible for proposing the appointment of the External Accounts Auditors to the Board of Directors, for submission to the General Shareholders Meeting, in accordance with applicable regulations, and for advising on payments to external auditors, and liaising with the latter in respect of issues that may jeopardise their independence. Where appropriate, the Audit and Compliance Committee shall invite the external auditors to attend its quarterly meetings in order to: • Obtain information on the quarterly reviews of the ﬁnancial statements. • Analyse any incidents encountered. • Ask the Directors to come up with a plan of action to resolve the incidents encountered. Measures in aid of preserving the independence of ﬁnancial analysts, rating agencies and investment banks: In accordance with the Regulations, the Board of Directors shall adopt and execute all acts and measures required to ensure transparency of the Company with regard to the ﬁnancial markets, uphold the proper formation of prices for the Company's and its subsidiaries' shares, and perform all functions attending the Company's status as a 167 listed company pursuant to current laws and regulations. The Investor Relations Department manages communications with ﬁnancial analysts, investors and rating agencies so as to assure that relations with all parties remain objective, fair and non-discriminatory.

Setting goals for the organization as a precondition of identifying potential scenarios with an impact on the achievement of those goals. 3. Every unit manager or head must systematically identify relevant events. 4. Evaluating risks to enable the company to consider the scope of potential events impacting the company’s achievement of its goals and the probability of such events arising. 5. Responding to risks: The aim is to take decisions – to avoid, mitigate, share or accept a given risk – on the basis 186 of the outcome of an assessment as to whether the particular risk needs to be addressed. 6. Establishing control actions as necessary to ensure that risk responses are implemented properly and on time by department and unit heads. 7. Within the risk management framework, reporting and communicating at all organizational levels to identify, evaluate and respond to risks, and, ultimately, take decisions and achieve the objectives set down at the organization-wide level. 8. Risk management is to be overseen by the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Sustainability Committee, by the individual department/unit “owning” each risk, and by the Internal Audit Unit in the performance of its assigned role. Enagás, S.A. has grouped these risks, separating them in terms of the nature of the risk and bearing in mind the different measurement methods applied, as follows: • Operational risk: This is the possible loss of value or earnings as a result of events caused by inadequacies or failures in processes, human resources, business teams and IT systems, or due to external factors. • Business risk: This is the possible loss of value or earnings due to external factors such as regulation, the economic cycle, competition levels, demand patterns, the structure of the industry, etc. as well as the possible loss of value or earnings arising from taking incorrect decisions regarding business plans and the Company’s future strategies. • Credit or counterparty risk: This is the possible loss of value or earnings as a result of a counterparty’s failure to meet its contractual obligations. • Financial risk: This is the uncertainty concerning a portfolio’s value due to exchange and interest rate ﬂuctuations, etc., as well as the liquidity and solvency of the companies. • Reputational risk: Any action, event or circumstance that may adversely aﬀect stakeholders' perceptions and opinions of the company. The risks have been measured in terms of their impact and probability in quantitative and qualitative terms. Also, the necessary controls and action plans have been established to maintain these risks within the admissible thresholds. In 2010, the heads of the various divisions and business units at Enagás, S.A. managed their risks based on a selfassessment of some of these and by permanently monitoring the control activities and the risks in relation to the Company’s accepted level of risk. Moreover, the Enagás Group continues to cement and reinforce its System of Internal Control of Financial Reporting (Spanish “SCIIF”) with a view to adopting best practices towards the reliability and transparency of the ﬁnancial reporting process.

Degree of compliance with Corporate Governance Recommendations 202 Indicate the degree of the company’s compliance with Corporate Governance recommendations. Should the company not comply with any of them, explain the recommendations, standards, practices or criteria the company applies. 1. The Bylaws of listed companies should not place an upper limit on the votes that can be cast by a single shareholder, or impose other obstacles to the takeover of the company by means of share purchases on the market. See sections: A.9, B.1.22, B.1.23 and E.1, E.2 Explain Act 12/2007 of 2 July, amending the Hydrocarbons Industry Act (Act 34/1998 of 7 October) in accordance with Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas, provides new wording for the 20th Additional Provision of the Hydrocarbons Industry Act, which vests in Enagás, S.A. the capacity of“technical system operator”and sets ceilings on shareholdings in the Company. The wording of the 20th Additional Provision now stands as follows: “20th Additional Provision. Technical System Operator. The company ENAGÁS, Sociedad Anónima, shall assume the functions, rights and obligations of Technical System Operator. (...) No natural person or legal entity may directly or indirectly hold an interest in the company responsible for the technical management of the system representing more than 5% of the share capital, or exercise more than 3% of its voting rights. Such shares may under no circumstances by syndicated. Parties that operate within the gas sector, including those natural persons or legal entities that directly or indirectly own equity holdings in the former of more than 5%, may not exercise voting rights in the System Technical Manager of over 1%. These restrictions will not apply to direct or indirect equity interests Under no circumstances may share capital be syndicated. Likewise, the combined total of direct or indirect holdings owned by parties that operate within the natural gas sector may not exceed 40%. For the purposes of calculating the stake in that shareholding structure, in addition to the shares or other securities held or acquired by entities belonging to its same group, as deﬁned by article 4 of Act 24/1988, dated 28 July, on the Securities Market stakes shall be attributed to one and the same individual or body corporate when they are owned by a) Those parties who act in their own name but on behalf of that individual or body corporate in a concerted fashion or forming a decision-making unit with them. Unless proven otherwise, it shall be deemed that the members of the Board of Directors of a body corporate act on its behalf or in a concerted fashion with it. b) The partners together with whom that individual or body corporate exercises control over a controlled entity under the provisions of article 4 of Act 24/1988, dated 28 July, governing the Securities Market. Nonetheless, both the actual ownership of the shares and other securities and the voting rights held through any certiﬁcate shall be taken into account. Non-compliance with the limitation on a stake in the capital referred to in this article shall be deemed an extremely serious breach in accordance with the terms set out in article 109 of this Act. Responsibility shall lie with the individuals or bodies corporate that end up as owners of the securities or whoever the excess stake in the capital or in the voting rights can be attributed to, pursuant to the provisions of the preceding paragraphs. Whatever the case, 203 the penalty system stipulated herein will apply. The 6th Transitional Provision of Act 12/2007 of 2 July provides that within four months of its coming into force, Enagás, S.A. shall bring its Bylaws into line with the 20th Additional Provision of Act 34/1998 of 7 October. The 2nd Transitional Provision of Act 12/2007 of 2 July further prescribes: Any voting rights attaching to shares and other securities held by persons with an ownership interest in the share capital of ENAGÁS, Sociedad Anónima, in excess of the ceilings set forth in the 20th Additional Provision of the Hydrocarbons Industry Act shall be suspended as from the coming into force of this provision. The National Energy Commission (CNE) shall have the standing to bring legal action to give eﬀect to the restrictions imposed by this provision. In accordance with the aforementioned legal provision, article 6 bis (“Limitation of interest in share capital and of the exercise of voting rights”) of Enagás, S.A.’s Bylaws stipulates the following: No individual or body corporate may hold a direct or indirect stake of more than 5% in the equity capital of the Company, nor exercise voting rights in such company of over 3%. Under no circumstances may such shareholdings be syndicated. Any party operating within the gas sector, including natural persons or bodies corporate that directly or indirectly own equity holdings in the former of more than 5%, may not exercise voting rights over 1%. These restrictions will not apply to direct or indirect interests held by public sector enterprises. Under no circumstances may share capital be syndicated. Likewise, the combined total of direct or indirect holdings owned by parties that operate within the natural gas sector may not exceed 40%. For the purposes of calculating the stake in that shareholding structure, there shall apply the 20th Additional Provision Act 34/1998 of 7 October (the Hydrocarbons Industry Act). It is for this reason that, since there is an express limit imposed by law and by the Bylaws on the exercise of voting rights, Enagás, S.A. is unable to adopt the recommendation that no limits be applied on the number of voting rights that a single shareholder may exercise. 2. When a dominant and a subsidiary company are stock market listed, the two should provide detailed disclosure on: a) The type of activity they engage in, and any business dealings between them, as well as between the subsidiary and other group companies; · Annual Report 2010 Annual Corporate Governance Report for Listed Limited Companies b) The mechanisms in place to resolve possible conﬂicts of interest. See sections: C0.4 and C0.7 Not applicable 3. Even when not expressly required under company law, any decisions involving a fundamental corporate change should be submitted to the General Meeting for approval or ratiﬁcation. In particular: 204 a) The transformation of listed companies into holding companies through the process of subsidiarisation, i.e. reallocating core activities to subsidiaries that were previously carried out by the originating ﬁrm, even though the latter retains full control of the former; b) Any acquisition or disposal of key operating assets that would eﬀectively alter the company's corporate purpose; c) Operations that eﬀectively add up to the company's liquidation Complies 4. Detailed proposals of the resolutions to be adopted at the General Meeting, including the information stated in Recommendation 28, should be made available at the same time as the publication of the Meeting notice. Complies 5. Separate votes should be taken at the General Meeting on materially separate items, so shareholders can express their preferences in each case. This rule shall apply in particular to: a) The appointment or ratiﬁcation of directors, with separate voting on each candidate; b) Amendments to the Bylaws, with votes taken on all articles or group of articles that are materially diﬀerent. See section: E.8 Complies 6. Companies should allow split votes, so ﬁnancial intermediaries acting as nominees on behalf of diﬀerent clients can issue their votes according to instructions. See section: E.4 Complies 7. The Board of Directors should perform its duties with unity of purpose and independent judgement, according all shareholders the same treatment. It should be guided at all times by the company's best interest and, as such, strive to maximise its value over time. It should likewise ensure that the company abides by the laws and regulations in its dealings with stakeholders; fulﬁls its obligations and contracts in good faith; respects the customs and good practices of the sectors and territories where it does business; and upholds any additional social responsibility principles it has subscribed to voluntarily. Complies 8. The board should see the core components of its mission as to approve the company's strategy and authorise the organisational resources to carry it forward, and to ensure that management meets the objectives set while pursuing the company's interests and corporate purpose. As such, the board in full should reserve the right to approve: 205 a) The company's general policies and strategies, and, in particular: i) The strategic or business plans, management targets and annual budgets; ii) Investment and ﬁnancing policy; iii) Design of the structure of the corporate group; iv) Corporate governance policy; v) Corporate social responsibility policy; vi) Remuneration and evaluation of senior oﬃcers; vii) Risk control and management, and the periodic monitoring of internal information and control systems; viii) Dividend policy, as well as the policies and limits applying to treasury stock. See sections: B.1.10, B.1.13, B.1.14 and D.3 b) The following decisions: i) On the proposal of the company's chief executive, the appointment and removal of senior oﬃcers, and their compensation clauses. See section: B.1.14 ii) Directors’ remuneration, and, in the case of executive directors, the additional consideration for their management duties and other contract conditions. See section: B.1.14 iii) The ﬁnancial information that all listed companies must periodically disclose. iv) Investments or operations considered strategic by virtue of their amount or special characteristics, unless their approval corresponds to the General Meeting; v) The creation or acquisition of shares in special purpose vehicles or entities resident in countries or territories considered tax havens, and any other transactions or operations of a comparable nature whose complexity might impair the transparency of the group. c) Transactions which the company conducts with directors, signiﬁcant shareholders, shareholders with board representation or other persons related thereto (“related-party transactions”). However, board authorisation need not be required for related-party transactions that simultaneously meet the following three conditions: 1ª. They are governed by standard form contracts applied on an across-the-board basis to a large number of clients; 2ª. They go through at market prices, generally set by the person supplying the goods or services; 3ª. Their amount is no more than 1% of the company’s annual revenues. It is advisable that related-party transactions should only be approved on the basis of a favourable report from the Audit Committee or some other committee handling the same function; and that the directors involved should neither exercise nor delegate their votes, and should withdraw from the meeting room while the board deliberates and votes. · Annual Report 2010 Annual Corporate Governance Report for Listed Limited Companies Ideally the above powers should not be delegated with the exception of those mentioned in b) and c), which may be delegated to the Executive Committee in urgent cases and later ratiﬁed by the full board. See sections: C.1 and C.6 Complies 9. In the interests of maximum eﬀectiveness and participation, the Board of Directors should ideally comprise no fewer then ﬁve and no more than ﬁfteen members. 206 See section: B.1.1 Explain The recommendation, which would aﬀect the Bylaws, to reduce the number of Directors to between ﬁve (5) and ﬁfteen (15) as recommended in the Uniﬁed Code, instead of between six (6) and seventeen (17) as currently established in article 35 of the Company Bylaws, has not been incorporated because it was deemed that, due to the legal limits placed on share capital, the structure of the Board must be such as to allow for the addition of representatives of potential future shareholders without such addition entailing any reduction in the desired percentage of Independent Directors. 10. External Directors, proprietary and independent, should occupy an ample majority of board places, while the number of executive directors should be the minimum practical bearing in mind the complexity of the corporate group and the ownership interests they control. See sections: A.2, A.3, B.1.3 and B.1.14 Complies 11. In the event that some External Director can be deemed neither proprietary nor independent, the company should disclose this circumstance and the links that person maintains with the company or its senior oﬃcers, or its shareholders: See section: B.1.3 Complies 12. That among External Directors, the relation between proprietary members and independents should match the proportion between the capital represented on the board by proprietary directors and the remainder of the company's capital. This proportional criterion can be relaxed so the weight of proprietary directors is greater than would strictly correspond to the total percentage of capital they represent: 1º In large cap companies where few or no equity stakes attain the legal threshold for signiﬁcant sharehol dings, despite the considerable sums actually invested. 2º In companies with a plurality of shareholders represented on the board but not otherwise related. See sections: B.1.3, A.2 and A.3 Complies 13. The number of independent directors should represent at least one third of all board members. See section: B.1.3 Complies 14. The nature of each director should be explained to the General Meeting of Shareholders, which will make or ratify his or her appointment. Such determination should subsequently be conﬁrmed or reviewed in each year’s Annual Corporate Governance Report, after veriﬁcation by the Nomination Committee. The said Report should also disclose the reasons for the appointment of proprietary directors at the urging of shareholders controlling less than 5% of capital; and explain 207 any rejection of a formal request for a board place from shareholders whose equity stake is equal to or greater than that of others applying successfully for a proprietary directorship. See sections: B.1.3 and B.14 Complies 15. When women directors are few or non existent, the board should state the reasons for this situation and the measures taken to correct it; in particular, the Nomination Committee should take steps to ensure that: a) The process of ﬁlling board vacancies has no implicit bias against women candidates; b) The Company shall expressly seek out and include women with the target proﬁle among candidates for Board places. See sections: B.1.2, B.1.27 and B.2.3 Partially complies At the date of publication of this report, two of a total of sixteen (16) members of the Board of Directors are women, María Teresa García-Milá Lloveras and Isabel Sánchez García. In 2010, therefore, Enagás, S.A. prioritised female representation when vacancies arose on the Board, especially for independent seats. Given the above, in 2010 the Board adopted various initiatives aimed at rectifying the gender imbalance. In particular, the Annual General Meeting of 30 April 2010 resolved to appoint Isabel Sánchez García in accordance with article 8 of the Regulations of the Board, which stipulates that selection procedures must be free of any implied bias that might stand in the way of the selection of women Directors. The Company shall seek out and include women with the target proﬁle among candidates for Board places. 16. The Chairman, as the person responsible for the proper operation of the Board of Directors, should ensure that directors are supplied with suﬃcient information in advance of board meetings, and work to procure a good level of debate and the active involvement of all members, safeguarding their rights to freely express and adopt positions; he or she should organise and coordinate regular evaluations of the board and, where appropriate, the company’s chief executive, along with the chairmen of the relevant board committees. See section: B.1.42 Complies · Annual Report 2010 Annual Corporate Governance Report for Listed Limited Companies 17. If the Chairman of the Board is also the Company's chief executive, powers should be given to one of the Independent Directors to demand that a Board meeting be convened or that additional items of business be included on the agenda, to bring together and voice the concerns of External Directors, and to direct the Board's assessment of the Chairman's performance. See section: B.1.21 Complies 18. The Secretary should take care to ensure that the board's actions: 208 a) Adhere to the spirit and letter of primary enactments and their implementing regulations, including those issued by regulatory agencies; b) Comply with the the Bylaws and the Regulations of the General Meeting, of the Board of Directors and other provisions governing the Company; c) Are informed by those good governance recommendations of the Uniﬁed Code that the company has subscribed to. To ensure the independence, impartiality and professionalism of the Secretary, his/her appointment and removal shall be the subject of a prior report from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and must be approved by the Board in plenary session; and that procedure of appointment and removal must be speciﬁed in the Regulations of the Board. See section: B.1.34 Complies 19. The board should meet with the necessary frequency to properly perform its functions, in accordance with a calendar and agendas set at the beginning of the year, to which each director may propose the addition of other items. See section: B.1.29 Complies 20. Director absences should be kept to the bare minimum and quantiﬁed in the Annual Corporate Governance Report. When directors have no choice but to delegate their vote, they should do so with instructions. See sections: B.1.28 and B.1.30 Partially complies In 2010 the Company endeavoured to restrict director absences to events of strict necessity. There were a total of twenty-four (24) absences, and bearing in mind that 11 board meetings were held, this represents 13% of the total votes during the year and, in all cases but one, the absent directors delegated their vote to the Chairman or another director. The Audit and Compliance Committee met on four (4) occasions, with all committee members being present at each meeting. Finally, the Nominations and Remuneration Committee met on ﬁve (5) occasions, with three (3) committee members being absent, representing 12% of total votes cast over the course of 2010. 21. When directors or the Secretary express concerns about some proposal or, in the case of directors, about the company's performance, and such concerns are not resolved at the meeting, the person expressing them can request that they be recorded in the minute book. Complies 22. The board in full should evaluate the following points on a yearly basis: a) The quality and eﬃciency of the board's operation; 209 b) Starting from a report submitted by the Nomination Committee, how well the Chairman and chief executive have carried out their duties; c) The performance of its committees on the basis of the reports furnished by the same. See section: B.1.19 Complies 23. All directors should be able to exercise their right to receive any additional information they require on matters within the board's competence. Unless the Bylaws or board regulations indicate otherwise, such requests should be addressed to the Chairman or Secretary. See section: B.1.42 Complies 24. All directors should be entitled to call on the company for the advice and guidance they need to carry out their duties. The company should provide suitable channels for the exercise of this right, extending in special circumstances to external as sistance at the company's expense. See section: B.1.41 Complies 25. Companies should organise induction programmes for new directors to acquaint them rapidly with the workings of the company and its corporate governance rules. Directors should also be oﬀered refresher programmes when circumstances so advise. Complies 26. Companies should require their directors to devote suﬃcient time and eﬀort to perform their duties eﬀectively, and, as such: a) Directors should apprise the Nomination Committee of any other professional obligations, in case they might detract from the necessary dedication; b) Companies should lay down rules about the number of directorships their board members can hold. See sections: B.1.8, B.1.9 and B.1.17 Partially complies · Annual Report 2010 Annual Corporate Governance Report for Listed Limited Companies Point a) of article 13 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors ( Duty of diligent administration ) stipulates that board members shall apprise the Nominations Committee of any professional obligations in case they might detract from the necessary dedication. The Company may limit the number of Directorships its Board members can hold if this may also detract from the commitment required. The Enagás, S.A. Regulations of the Board of Directors place no quantitative limit on the number of directorships its board members can hold but expressly incorporates the content of this Recommendation. 27. The proposal for the appointment or renewal of directors which the board submits to the General Meeting, as well as 210 provisional appointments by the method of co-option, should be approved by the board: a) On the proposal of the Nomination Committee, in the case of independent Directors. b) Subject to a report from the Nomination Committee in all other cases. See section: B.1.2 Complies 28. Companies should post the following director particulars on their websites, and keep them permanently updated: a) Professional experience and background; b) Directorships held in other companies, listed or otherwise; c) An indication of the director’s classiﬁcation as executive, proprietary or independent; In the case of proprietary directors, stating the shareholder they represent or have links with. d) The date of their ﬁrst and subsequent appointments as a company director; and e) Shares held in the company and any options on the same. Complies 29. Independent directors should not stay on as such for a continued period of more than 12 years. See section: B.1.2 Complies 30. Proprietary directors should resign when the shareholders they represent dispose of their ownership interest in its entirety. They shall also do so, in the appropriate number, when that shareholder reduces its stake to a level requiring a reduction in the number of its proprietary directors. See sections: A.2, A.3 and B.1.2 Partially complies Article 12.2 f ) of the Regulations of the Board of Directors stipulates that Directors must place their oﬃces at the Board of Directors’disposal, and tender their resignation, if the Board deems this appropriate, when the shareholders they represent dispose of their shareholding in its entirety. They shall also do so, in the appropriate number, when that shareholder reduces its stake to a level requiring a reduction in the number of its Proprietary Directors. If the Board of Directors does not deem it advisable to have a Director tender his/her resignation in the cases speciﬁed in points d), e) and f ) of article 12.2, the Director must be included in the category that, in accordance with these Regulations, is most appropriate based on his/her new circumstances. In compliance with this Recommendation, Luis Javier Navarro Vigil is now included under the category of “Other External Directors” as the shareholder who proposed his appointment as Proprietary Director on 15 November 2006, B.P. España S.A.U., has sold its entire shareholding in the company. However, Mr. Navarro is not considered to be an Independent Director as he maintains or has maintained a signiﬁcant business relationship with the Company. 211 Nonetheless, it was decided to classify Mr Navarro under the category Other External Directors as he did not meet all the conditions required to be classiﬁed as an Independent Director as stipulated by the Uniﬁed Good Governance Code related to Order ECO/3722/2003 of 26 December and CNMV Circular 4/2007 of 27 December. 31. The Board of Directors should not propose the removal of Independent Directors before the expiry of their tenure as mandated by the Bylaws, except where just cause is found by the Board, based on a proposal from the Nomination Committee. In particular, just cause will be presumed when a director is in breach of his or her ﬁduciary duties or comes under one of the disqualifying grounds enumerated in section III. 5 (Deﬁnitions) of this Code. The removal of independents may also be proposed when a takeover bid, merger or similar corporate operation produces changes in the company’s capital structure, in order to meet the proportionality criterion set out in Recommendation 12. See sections: B.1.2, B.1.5 and B.1.26 Cumple 32. Companies should establish rules obliging directors to inform the board of any circumstance that might harm the organisation's name or reputation, tendering their resignation as the case may be, with particular mention of any criminal charges brought against them and the progress of any subsequent trial. The moment a Director is indicted or tried for any of the oﬀences stated in article 124 of the Companies Act, the Board should examine the matter and, in view of the particular circumstances and potential harm to the Company's name and reputation, decide whether or not the Director will be called on to resign. The board should also disclose all such determinations in the Annual Corporate Governance Report. See sections: B.1.43 and B.1.44 Complies 33. All directors should express clear opposition when they feel a proposal submitted for the board's approval might damage the corporate interest. In particular, independents and other directors unaﬀected by the conﬂict of interest should challenge any decision that could go against the interests of shareholders lacking board representation. · Annual Report 2010 Annual Corporate Governance Report for Listed Limited Companies When the board makes material or reiterated decisions about which a director has expressed serious reservations, then he or she must draw the pertinent conclusions. Directors resigning for such causes should set out their reasons in the letter referred to in the next Recommendation. This terms of this Recommendation should also apply to the Secretary of the board, director or otherwise. Complies 34. Directors who give up their place before their tenure expires, through resignation or otherwise, should state their 212 reasons in a letter to be sent to all members of the board. Irrespective of whether such resignation is ﬁled as a signiﬁcant event, the motive for the same must be explained in the Annual Corporate Governance Report. See section: B.1.5 Complies 35. The company's remuneration policy, as approved by its Board of Directors, should specify at least the following points: a) The amount of the ﬁxed components, itemised, where necessary, of board and board committee attendance fees, with an estimate of the ﬁxed annual remuneration they give rise to. b) Variable components, in particular: i) The types of directors they apply to, with an explanation of the relative weight of variable to ﬁxed remuneration items; ii) Performance evaluation criteria used to calculate entitlement to the award of shares or share options or any performance-related remuneration; iii) The main parameters and grounds for any system of annual bonuses or other non cash beneﬁts; and iv) An estimate of the sum total of variable payments arising from the remuneration policy proposed, as a function of degree of compliance with pre-set targets or benchmarks. c) The main characteristics of pension systems (for example, supplementary pensions, life insurance and similar arrangements), with an estimate of their amount or annual equivalent cost. d) The conditions to apply to the contracts of executive directors exercising senior management functions, among them: i) Duration; ii) Notice periods; and iii) Any other clauses covering hiring bonuses, as well as indemnities or “golden parachutes” in the event of early termination of the contractual relation between company and executive director. See section: B.1.15 Complies 36. Remuneration comprising the delivery of shares in the company or other companies in the group, share options or other share-based instruments, payments linked to the company’s performance or membership of pension schemes should be conﬁned to executive directors.

On 17 December 2010, Enagás, S.A. entered into an agreement with REN GASODUTOS, S.A. whereby Enagás, S.A. was to dissociate itself from the Portuguese side of the Joint Project for Natural Gas Supply to Portugal and Spain, in which Enagás, S.A. was then a participant through the companies Gasoduto Braga-Tuy, S.A. and Gasoduto Campo Maior-Leiria-Braga, S.A., after authorization of the transaction by the competition authority. On 24 January 2011, the competition authority adopted a ﬁnal decision not to oppose REN GASODUTOS, S.A.’s acquisition of exclusive control over the companies Gasoduto Braga-Tuy, S.A. and Gasoduto Campo Maior-LeiriaBraga, S.A. Enagás, S.A. is no longer a shareholder of either company and will play no further role in the Joint Project. Clariﬁcation of section D.1: Give a general description of risk policy in the company and/or its group, detailing and evaluating the risks covered by the system, together with evidence that the system is appropriate for the proﬁle of each type of risk. A Working Group on Internal Controls (GTCI) was set up on the suggestion of the CNMV to draw up a set of recommendations on this issue. The GTCI’s work has focused on three main objectives: (i) a review of the Spanish regulatory framework on internal controls for ﬁnancial reporting; (ii) establishing a framework of principles and good practices regarding such controls, including their supervision; and (iii) improving the transparency of information issued by listed companies to markets about their internal control systems. As regards these recommendations, in 2010 the Enagás Group – in line with its philosophy of responsibility and ongoing improvement of its system of internal control of ﬁnancial reporting – began a plan to adapt to the recommendations set down in the relevant report. The plan involves specifying a range of identiﬁers in accordance with the company’s System of Internal Control of Financial Reporting so as suitably to cover the list of 16 indicators proposed by the Working Group on Internal Controls (GTCI) of the CNMV, the Spanish securities market regulator. Clariﬁcation of section F Degree of compliance with Corporate Governance recommendations. Enagás, S.A. continued to honour its commitment to comply with the Uniﬁed Code of Good Governance: 227 • Enagás, S.A. complies with 48 recommendations. • Enagás, S.A. partly complies with 5 recommendations. • Enagás, S.A. explains its response to 2 recommendations. • 3 recommendations are not applicable to Enagás. In 2010, recommendation 15 – set out above – was partly complied with when a second woman Director was appointed to the Board, as an Independent. Enagás, S.A. identiﬁed good corporate governance practices at the international level, and took the following steps in 2010: • Conferring on the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committee (formerly the Appointments and Remuneration Committee) the added duties of setting general corporate social responsibility and corporate governance policy. • Appointing the Chairman of the Nomination, Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committee as Independent Leader Director, with powers to call board meetings or include new items on the agenda in order to coordinate and convey the concerns of Directors and to lead the Board’s evaluation of its Chairman. • The number of women Directors was raised to two (2); both are Independent Directors. This development demonstrates the company’s commitment to increase the presence of women on the Board. • An assessment will be undertaken of the performance of the Board, the Chairman and Board committees. Conﬁdential interviews with individual Directors will accordingly be conducted over the ﬁrst quarter of 2011. The assessment process will also involve individual evaluation of External Directors prior to their being nominated for re-election. • Training activities for Directors were scheduled for 2011, covering issues relating to the regulatory framework of the industry, the company’s practices as to strategic planning, risk management and control, internal control of ﬁnancial reporting and other information systems, and best practices in corporate social responsibility and corporate governance. This training will be provided largely by Management Committee members and company executives. • Electronic voting will be introduced as a new form of shareholder participation at the forthcoming General Meeting. • A shareholder forum was created using a specific platform on www.enagas.es to enable shareholders to make suggestions to the Board regarding resolutions to be discussed and voted on at the 2011 Annual General Meeting. · Annual Report 2010 Annual Corporate Governance Report for Listed Limited Companies Clariﬁcation of section G.2.: Binding deﬁnition of Independent Director: The Nomination, Remuneration and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee and the Board of Directors have studied the situations concerning two (2) Independent Directors and have found that these do not aﬀect their independence. (See Section G.2). You may include in this section any other information, clariﬁcation or observation related to the above sections of this report. Speciﬁcally indicate whether the company is subject to corporate governance legislation from a country other 228 than Spain and, if so, include the compulsory information to be provided when diﬀerent to that required by this report. Binding deﬁnition of independent director: List any independent directors who maintain, or have maintained in the past, a relationship with the company, its signiﬁcant shareholders or managers, when the signiﬁcance or importance thereof would dictate that the directors in question may not be considered independent pursuant to the deﬁnition set forth in section 5 of the Uniﬁed Good Governance Code. YES Name of director Jesús David Álvarez Mezquíriz Type of relationship Contractual Reason Even though Mr. Álvarez is a Director of Eulen, S.A., an entity which maintained a commercial relationship with Enagás, S.A. in 2010, the Nomination, Remuneration and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the abstention of this director in the negotiation and decision-making process of both parties; the rigorous procedures usually followed for contracting works and services, which were not excluded on this occasion and the express intervention of the Committee and the Board, given the related-party nature of this relationship, means that there are not suﬃcient or important enough reasons why this director may not remain Independent. Name of director Miguel Angel Lasheras Merino Type of relationship Contractual Reason Even though he is Chairman of Intermoney Energía, S.A., an entity which maintained an advisory relationship with the Company in 2010, the Nomination, Remuneration and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the amount of fees received by Intermoney for the specialist advice provided is neither significant nor important. Therefore he shall continue to be considered Independent. In addition, the express intervention of the Committee and the Board must be noted, given the related-party nature of this relationship. Date and signature: This annual corporate governance report was approved by the company’s Board of Directors at its meeting held on: 31/01/2011 List whether any directors voted against or abstained from voting on the approval of this report. 229 NO · Annual Report 2010 Annual Corporate Governance Report for Listed Limited Companies Report on the activities of the Enagás Audit and Compliance Committee in 2010 230 Composition of the Committee in 2010 Chairman Martí Parellada Sabata, Independent Director, from 1 January to 31 December. Members BANCAJA (represented by José Luis Olivas Martínez), Proprietary Director, from 1 January to 31 December. Luis Javier Navarro Vigil, External Director, from 1 January to 31 December. Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Estatales (SEPI), Proprietary Director, represented by its Chairman, Enrique Martínez Robles, from 1 January to 31 December. Antonio Téllez de Peralta, Independent Director, from 1 January to 30 April. José Riva Francos, Independent Director from 28 June to 31 December. Secretary Rafael Piqueras Bautista In 2010 the term of oﬃce as a director of Antonio Téllez de Peralta reached its statutory end. The board appointed Independent Director, José Rivas Francos, to replace him. As provided in the Company’s constitutional documents and rules and regulations, the Committee called on a number of persons related to matters under its competence for consultation. Accordingly, Committee meetings were regularly attended by Enagás’ Finance Director, Diego De Reina, and the head of the Internal Audit Unit, José Espejo. External auditors from Deloitte also attended Committee meetings on a number of occasions. Activities of the Committee The Committee met four (4) times in 2010. The following is a summary of the most signiﬁcant areas on which the Audit and Compliance Committee focused in 2010. 1.Committee activities relating to the formulation and approval of the Enagás ﬁnancial statements for 2009 231 As in previous years, the Audit Committee was entrusted with the task of discussing and analysing the ﬁnancial statements prior to their authorisation for issue by the Board of Directors. For this purpose, the members of the Committee met with the Company’s external auditor (Deloitte S.L.) on 1 February 2010 as well as with the Finance Director and the head of Enagás’ Internal Audit Unit. Both the external auditors and the ﬁnancial oﬃcers of the Company oﬀered the Committee their views on the ﬁnancial statements. Diﬀerences in accounting criteria in no case exceeded the materiality threshold above which Deloitte’s opinion on the ﬁnancial statements could be aﬀected. Deloitte informed the Audit Committee that its report would be without reservations or qualiﬁcations. The Audit Committee’s examination of the 2009 ﬁnancial statements resulted in the following conclusions: • That the ﬁnancial statements of Enagás and its consolidated group, as submitted to the Committee, gave a true and fair view of the Company’s equity and results of operations for the year. • That the ﬁnancial statements contained suﬃcient information to be clearly understood, as well as a suﬃcient description of the risks faced by the Company. • That the ﬁnancial statements followed generally accepted accounting principles and regulations, on the same terms applied in previous years. • That the principles of parity of treatment for shareholders and transparency of information reported to the markets had been upheld. The Committee accordingly resolved to recommend that the Board of Directors of Enagás authorise the ﬁnancial statements for issue. At a meeting held on 1 February 2010, the Board of Directors adopted the Committee’s recommendation and authorised the ﬁnancial statements for issue in line with the terms indicated by the Committee. The ﬁnancial statements and directors' report for 2009 were approved at the General Meeting held on 30 April 2010. In addition to the above, and in accordance with standard practice in previous years, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr. Parellada, also took part in the Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting held on 30 April 2010, explaining the most important elements of the ﬁnancial statements to the Company’s shareholders in order to ensure that they had all the information necessary to be able to vote on the ﬁnancial statements that were approved on the proposal of the Board of Directors. 2.Monitoring relationships between Enagás and its signiﬁcant shareholders The Committee continued to supervise relationships between Enagás and its signiﬁcant shareholders, and no incidents worthy of mention occurred. · Annual Report 2010 Annual Corporate Governance Report for Listed Limited Companies 3.Audit and risk control plan for 2010 All meetings of the Audit Committee have included as items of business on the agenda both a general review of progress in the implementation of the audit plan for 2010, and a speciﬁc analysis of the main audit processes underway at that particular time. This area of the Audit Committee’s work is therefore considered to be of particular importance. In 2003, with the assistance of external consultants, the Company carried out an exhaustive review of business and related risks, pinpointing the internal processes that might be aﬀected by each of these risks. Based on the results obtained, those 232 processes that should be given the most urgent attention by the Internal Audit Unit and Audit Committee were identiﬁed. However, the Committee deemed it necessary to review the Company’s Risk Model and, as a result, with appropriate external assistance, the Company's risk services drew up a new model that was approved by the Committee on 30 January 2009. The Audit Plan implemented in the course of 2010 focused on monitoring those processes identiﬁed as priorities in the new risk model. The Internal Audit Unit identiﬁed several non-essential weaknesses in its review of the reports and has issued recommendations it believes will help eliminate or mitigate the impact of the risks associated with certain activities forming part of this process. The Committee also supervised the Company’s project to review the internal ﬁnancial reporting system together with suitable external consultants. This reporting system is intended to guarantee that the ﬁnancial information prepared and published by the Company is complete and accurate. Companies listed on US stock exchanges are required to implement this system under the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and, although such a review of the ﬁnancial reporting system is not compulsory for companies such as Enagás, it is considered to be good practice. The consultants taking part in the review stated that “in general Enagás has an appropriate level of control in its internal ﬁnancial reporting system”. A review of compliance with this system was carried out in 2010. 4.Quarterly accounting reviews Throughout 2010 the Committee continued to review the limited quarterly report issued by the auditors, as in previous years. Specifically, it analysed, in conjunction with Deloitte, the reports issued by the latter for the first, second and third quarters, respectively. Performing these reviews enables the Committee to minimise the impact of any accounts issues arising in the course the year and the members of the Committee and Board of Directors to keep abreast of the opinions of the Company’s external auditors on annual developments in the balance sheet and income statement. The Audit Committee considers that both the quarterly reviews carried out by the external auditor and the Committee’s own analysis of these reports are essential to ensuring strict control over the Company’s accounting while facilitating the issue of an unqualiﬁed year-end report. The Committee also reviews and approves, in line with the good corporate governance recommendations it has adopted, the ﬁnancial information that the Company makes public each quarter. It made a speciﬁc report on the ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁrst half-year which, on its recommendation, were approved by the Board of Directors at its July 2010 meeting. 5.Report on the activities of the Business Principles Supervisory Committee (Ethical Channel) . The Committee was informed of the activities of the Business Principles Supervisory Committee (Ethical Channel) and approved its 2010 report in which no incidences worthy of mention occurred. 6.Activities after the end of the reporting period In the opening months of 2011, the Committee continued with its usual activities, in particular assisting the Board 233 of Directors in drawing up the ﬁnancial statements. As in the previous ﬁnancial year, the Audit and Compliance Committee has issued a prior favourable report on the 2010 ﬁnancial statements which will be submitted to the 2011 General Meeting for adoption. At its meeting on 31 January 2011, the Committee resolved to recommend to the General Meeting the re-appointment of Deloitte, S.L. as auditors of the Company’s ﬁnancial statements. This report was prepared and adopted by the Audit and Compliance Committee at the meeting held on 31 January 2011 and was approved by the Board of Directors at a meeting held on the same day. 6. The Enagás Group’s Internal Control System for Financial Information 6.1. Overview 236 6.2. Compliance with the sixteen ICWG indicators 237 6.3. Internal assessment of the internal financial information control control system 244 · The Enagás group’s Internal Control System Annual Report 2010 for Financial Information 6.1. Overview 236 The Enagás Group continued last year to strengthen and consolidate its Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) system to ensure the implementation of best practices with regard to the reliability and transparency of the ﬁnancial reporting process.. Aware of its responsibility to continually improve its systems, in 2010 Enagás set up a project to comply with the recommendations of the report on “Internal Control over Financial Reporting” prepared by the Internal Control Working Group on the ﬁnancial reporting of listed companies (ICWG) set up by the Spanish stock market regulator (CNMV). Enagás began this project voluntarily in 2010 on the assumption that the recommendations will soon come into force. The report, based on the COSO framework, proposes a set of principles and best practices for ICFR with three aims: • To review the Spanish regulatory framework on internal control for ﬁnancial reporting, comparing it with that of neighbouring countries, and proposing any changes needed to improve it. • To establish a framework of principles and best practices on ICFR, including the process of supervising its operation. • To contribute to improving the transparency of the information issued by listed companies on their ICFR. One of the main achievements of the ICWG is the publication of guidelines on how to prepare a description of a company’s internal controls for ﬁnancial reporting, setting out these principles and best practices under ﬁve headings: • The control environment • Assessing ﬁnancial reporting risks • Control activities • Information and communication • Supervising the operation of the system These pillars are broken down into sixteen key indicators. 6.2. Compliance with the sixteen ICWG indicators Given its particular situation, the Enagás group has decided to implement these standard indicators ahead of time, 237 specifying a range of identiﬁers related to policies, regulations, manuals, procedures and any other document that contains guidelines that may be aﬀected by the indicators. The indicators are described below grouped under their respective control headings, and setting out the corresponding identiﬁers speciﬁed by the company. 6.2.1. The control environment The “control environment component is designed to ensure that information is made available to the markets on the speciﬁc mechanisms set up by companies to guarantee a climate of internal control that enables the generation of complete, reliable and timely information and which prevents irregularities arising while also providing a means of detecting and rectifying any that do arise. The indicators falling under the “control environment” heading are the following: The bodies and functions responsible for the existence and regular updating of a suitable, effective ICFR, its implementation and its monitoring. This indicator is implemented via the following identifiers: DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIER DESCRIPTION RESPONSIBLE • Job analysis and description • Description of duties, responsibilities, academic • Resources and CSR sheets qualifications, competences etc. Department • ICFR Manual • Detailed description of ICFR re: control activities, • Finance Department information systems, associated risks, allocation of responsibilities (including the assessment and supervision of internal controls), etc., establishing a procedure for identifying, managing and updating said internal controls and the regular updating of the associated documentation • Regulations on the organisation and • Sets out the principles of the organisation, opera• Secretary’s Office of duties of the Audit and Compliance tion, aims and duties, and the standards which the Board Committee of the Board of Directors govern the activities of the Audit and Compliance of Enagás, S.A.

Risk assessment in financial reporting The purpose of the “risk assessment” component is to analyse the impact of potential events on the achievement of objectives related to the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting. A range of risks may aﬀect this reliability, including calculation errors or errors in the application of rules, system failures, accounting fraud, lack of knowledge of key information, or incorrect estimates and forecasts. Such assessments are intended to ensure that anti-fraud safeguards are developed. · The Enagás group’s Internal Control System Annual Report 2010 for Financial Information The indicators falling under the “risk assessment” heading are the following: The processes for identifying risks related to ICFR This indicator is implemented via the following identifiers: DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIER DESCRIPTION RESPONSIBLE • ICFR Manual • Detailed above. • Finance Department 240 • Enagás’ Internal Risk Management Pro• Establishes a framework for the general manage• Secretary General cedure ment of risks, identifying said risks and the duties to Internal Audit be performed by the company’s various bodies.

Internal assessment of the internal financial information control system Following an internal evaluation of the ICFR and the implementation of the recommendations for improvement, Enagás considered that, at 31 December 2010, the internal control system for the group’s ﬁnancial information effectively mitigated the risk associated with the generation of ﬁnancial information in terms of its structure and operation.

Group Activity 256 Enagás, S.A., the parent company, is a company incorporated in Spain in accordance with Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law. Its corporate purpose is the import, acquisition and sale of natural gas on the regulated domestic market, and its regasiﬁcation, storage and transport both for the regulated and the liberalised market, the transportation and storage of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, biogas and other energy related ﬂuids, the exploitation of heat, cold and energy associated with its main activities or results thereof and the possibility of participating in activities related to the management of natural gas markets. Its registered oﬃce is at Paseo de los Olmos, no. 19, 28005 Madrid. The company’s Bylaws and other public information about the Group may be consulted on its oﬃcial website, www.enagas.es, and at its registered oﬃce. In addition to the operations it carries out directly, Enagás, S.A. is the head of a group of companies that includes interests in joint ventures engaged in the gas transport business and which, together with Enagás, S.A., comprise the Enagás Group (hereinafter, the Group). Consequently, Enagás, S.A. is required to prepare consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements for the Group in addition to its own annual ﬁnancial statements, which also include information on joint ventures and investments in associates. The consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements of the Group and those of each of the entities comprising the Group for the ﬁnancial year 2010, which have served as the basis for the preparation of these consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements, are pending the approval at their respective Shareholders’Meetings. However, the directors believe these annual ﬁnancial statements will be approved as presented. These consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements are presented in thousands of euros (unless expressly stated otherwise) as this is the functional currency of the principal economic area in which the Enagás Group operates. 2. Basis of presentation of the annual financial statements and consolidation principles 2.1. Accounting principles 257 The consolidated annual financial statements of the Enagás Group for 2010 have been prepared by the directors, at a meeting of the Board of Directors held on 31 January 2011, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (hereinafter, IFRS), as adopted by the European Union, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. These annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the equity and financial position of the Group at 31 December 2010, the results of its operations, and the changes in its equity, cash flows and recognised income and expense during the year then ended. The Enagás Group’s consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements for 2010 have been prepared from the accounting records kept by the parent company and by the other entities comprising the Group. The 2009 consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements included for comparative purposes have also been prepared in accordance with the IFRS adopted by the European Union and applied on a basis consistent with those applied in 2009. The 2008 ﬁnancial statements were approved by the parent company’s shareholders in general meeting on 30 April 2010. The financial year for the companies comprising the Group ends on 31 December. These companies’financial statements as of that date are used for consolidation purposes, except for Gasoduto Braga-Tuy, S.A. and Gasoduto Campo Maior–Leiria-Braga, S.A. which, because of the date on which their annual financial statements are approved and their scant materiality, are consolidated using their 30 November 2010 close. Note 3 includes the most significant accounting principles and measurement bases used in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Group for 2010. 2.2. Responsibility for the information and estimates made The information included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of the Group’s directors. The Group’s 2010 consolidated ﬁnancial statements include estimates made by senior management of the Group and of consolidated entities – subsequently ratiﬁed by their directors – regarding the carrying amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and commitments recognised therein. These estimates related basically to the following: · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements • The useful life of property, plant and equipment and of intangible assets (Notes 3-a and 3-b) • The measurement of assets to determine impairment losses (Note 3-c) • Forecasts for invoices pending issue • Provisions for impairment of replacement parts for property, plant and equipment • Prior years’ accounts pending settlement with the government (Note 11) 258 • Provisions for dismantling/abandonment costs (Note 3.b) Although these estimates were made on the basis of the best information available at 31 December 2010 regarding the facts analysed, it is possible that future events may require these to be changed (upwards or downwards) in coming years. This would be done prospectively in accordance with the provisions of IAS 8, recognising the effects of the changes in accounting estimates in the corresponding consolidated income statement. 2.3 Changes in scope of consolidation During 2010 the following changes in the scope of consolidation of Enagás Group have occurred: • The acquisition of a 25% shareholding in Bahia de Bizkaia Gas, SL (hereafter BBG) from BP Holdings BV (hereafter BP) for a consideration of 25,125 thousand euros became eﬀective. This acquisition represents the incorporation of Enagas, SA to the partnership agreement governing the BBG Board to date, replacing BP. As a result, BBG is now consolidated within the Enagás Group using proportionate consolidation from 1 April 2010. • In November the Group announced the acquisition of a 15% shareholding in BBG from Repsol YPF, S.A. for a consideration of 19,208 thousand euros, eﬀective 1 January 2010. As a result, BBG is now consolidated within the Enagás Group using proportionate consolidation from 1 January 2010. 2.4 Basis of consolidation Enagás, S.A.’s investees included in the scope of consolidation are engaged in the transport and regasiﬁcation of natural gas. The annual financial statements of joint ventures are consolidated using proportionate consolidation, combining the balances and subsequent eliminations in proportion to the Group’s interest in these companies’ share capital. The consolidation is carried out as follows: a) Proportionate consolidation for joint ventures managed in conjunction with GALP Gas Natural, S.A; Gasoducto Al-Andalus, S.A., and Gasoducto de Extremadura, S.A. and in conjunction with REN Gasoductos, S.A; Gasoduto Campo Maior–Leiria– Braga, S.A. and Gasoduto Braga–Tuy, S.A., (the latter two, Portuguese companies) and in conjunction with Infrastructure Arzak and Ente Vasco de la Energía (EVE) for BBG. b) Intra-group transactions: All credits, debits, income, expenses and results from transactions with other Group companies are eliminated on consolidation in proportion to Enagás, S.A.’s interest in the companies’ share capital. c) Consistency: For investee companies which apply diﬀerent accounting principles and measurement bases to those of the Group, adjustments have been made on consolidation, provided that the eﬀect is signiﬁcant, in order to present the consolidated ﬁnancial statements based on consistent measurement bases. d) Translation of ﬁnancial statements denominated in foreign currencies: The individual ﬁnancial statements of all Companies included in the scope of consolidation are presented in euros. Therefore, no foreign currency translation is required. e) Elimination of dividends: Internal dividends are those recognised as revenue for the year by a Group company and which have been paid by another Group company. 259 Dividends received by Group companies in respect of prior years’ distributed proﬁt are eliminated by treating them as reserves of the receiving company and included under “Reserves”. Note 34 includes the most signiﬁcant aspects of the Group’s joint ventures in existence at the end of 2010. 2.5 Comparison of information The information provided on 2009 is presented solely for comparison purposes with the information for 2010. 2.6 Accounting standards and principles a) Standards, principles and changes effective for the current year. The accounting policies adopted for the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December, 2010 are the same as those followed for the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year 2010, except for the adoption, from 1 January 2010, of the following standards, amendments and principles issued by the IASB and IFRIC (International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee) and adopted by the European Union for use in Europe: • Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations and Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and individual ﬁnancial statements The revised IFRS 3 and the amendments to IAS 27 entail very relevant changes in various aspects related to the accounting for business combinations that, generally, place greater emphasis on the use of fair value. Some of the most important changes are the treatment of acquisition costs that will be recognised as expenses instead of the current treatment of considering them a greater cost of the combination; the acquisitions by stages, in which at the time of the takeover the acquirer will remeasure its stake prior to its fair value, or the existence of the option to measure at fair value any acquired minority interests, versus the current single measure of its proportional share of the fair value of net assets acquired. The application of these standards had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results. • Amendment to IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement/items designated as hedged This amendment to IAS 39 aims to clarify two speciﬁc issues regarding hedge accounting: (a) when inﬂation can be a hedged risk and (b) in which cases can purchased options be used as hedges. Regarding inﬂation hedging, the amendment provides that it will only be possible on a contractually identiﬁed portion of the cash ﬂows to hedge. On options only their intrinsic value may be used as a hedging instrument, not their time value. The application of these standards had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements • Amendment to IFRS 2group share-based payments The amendment refers to accounting for share-based payment programmes within a group. The main changes involve the incorporation into IFRS 2 of the contents of IFRIC 8 and IFRIC 11, whereby these principles are repealed as they are incorporated into the main body of the standard. It clariﬁes that an entity receiving services from employees or suppliers must recognise the transaction regardless of whether another entity within the group pays for them and whether payment is made in cash or shares. Given the nature of this change it had no impact on Group accounts. 260 • Improvements to IFRS (issued in May 2008) This document introduces a series of improvements to the IFRS standards currently in force, essentially to eliminate inconsistencies and clarify the wording of some of these rules. The application of these standards had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results. • Improvements to IFRS (issued in May 2009) This document introduces a series of improvements to IFRS standards currently in force, essentially to eliminate inconsistencies and clarify the wording of some of these rules. The application of these standards had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results. • IFRIC 12 Services Concession Agreements Services concessions are arrangements whereby a government or other state entity grants contracts to private sector operators for the provision of public services, such as roads, airports, water supplies and electricity. The control of the assets remains in government hands, but the private operator is responsible for construction as well as management, operation and maintenance of public infrastructure. IFRIC 12 establishes how concession operators should apply existing IFRS when accounting for the rights and obligations entered into in such agreements, which subject to interpretation may lead to the recognition of ﬁnancial, intangible assets or both, as deﬁned in each agreement. The application of these standards had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results. • IFRIC 15 – Agreements for the construction of buildings This interpretation addresses the accounting for revenues and expenses associated with the construction of buildings, helping to clarify when an agreement for the construction of real estate is within IAS 11 on Construction Contracts or in which cases it falls within the scope of IAS 18 on Revenue, and thus, by virtue of the nature of the agreement, when and how revenue should be recognised. The application of these standards had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results. • IFRIC 16 Hedges of net investment in a foreign operation It addresses three main aspects to this principle; one is that the exchange rate risk derived from the functional currency of the foreign operation vis-à-vis the parent company reporting currency may not be considered a hedged risk, only the risk between the functional currencies of both may be considered a hedged risk. It also clariﬁes that the hedging instrument of the net investment may be held by any entity within the group, not necessarily by the parent of the foreign operation and, ﬁnally, discusses how to determine the amounts to be reclassiﬁed from equity to proﬁt when the investment is sold. The application of these standards had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results. • IFRIC 17 Distributions of non-cash assets to shareholders This principle addresses the accounting treatment of the distribution of assets other than cash to shareholders (“dividends in kind”), although it does not deal with distributions of assets within the same group or between 261 entities under common control. The principle establishes the requirement to recognise the fair value of assets to distribute and recognise any diﬀerence between the book value of assets as income. The application of these standards had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results. • IFRIC 18 Transfers of assets from customers This principle addresses the accounting recognition of such arrangements whereby an entity receives an asset from a client for the purpose of using it in turn to give the client access to supplies or provide a service. The principle states that the item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the ﬁnancial statements of the company receiving it, if it meets the deﬁnition of asset from the point of view of that company, at fair value on the date of the transfer and the corresponding income entry should be recognised when appropriate depending on the service speciﬁcally agreed with the customer. The application of these standards had no impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results. b. Standards, principles and changes effective for the current year. At the time of preparation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following are the most important standards and principles that had been published by the IASB but had not yet entered into force, either because their eﬀective date is later than the date of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements or because they have not yet been adopted by the European Union: · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements Approved for their application in the European Union Standards, Amendments Content Mandatory Application and Principles Amendment to IAS 32 Changes the accounting treatment Annual periods beginning Financial instruments: of rights, options and warrants 1 February 2010 Presentation-Classification denominated in a currency other of rights issues than the reporting currency Review of IAS 24Related Party Amends the definition of related party” Annual periods beginning Disclosures and reduces the level of disclosures 1 January 2011 262 Amendment to IFRIC14Entities are permitted to recognise as an asset Annual periods beginning Prepayments of a Minimum some voluntary prepayments for minimum 1 July 2011 Funding Requirement for minimum funding contributions IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Treatment for Extinguishing Financial Annual periods beginning Liabilities with Equity Instruments Liabilities with Equity Instruments 1 July 2010 Not approved in the European Union Rules, Amendments and Content Mandatory Application Principles IFRS 9 Financial instruments Replaces Annual periods beginning Classification and measurement the classification and measurement 1 January 2013 (published in November 2009 requirements of financial and October 2010) assets and liabilities of IAS 39 Improvements to IFRS Amendments to a series Principally mandatory (published in May 2010). of standards for the periods beginning 1 January 2011; some are mandatory for the periods beginning 1 July 2010 Amendment to IFRS 7Financial Enhanced derecognition disclosure Annual periods beginning instruments: disclosures about requirements for transfer transactions 1 July 2011 transfers of financial assets of financial assets (published in October 2010) The directors have assessed the potential impacts of future application of these rules and consider that their entry into force will not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 3. Measurement bases The main measurement bases used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated annual ﬁnancial state263 ments are as follows: a. Intangible assets Intangible assets are valued initially at acquisition price or production cost. Subsequently they are valued at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any. The criteria used to recognise the impairment losses on these assets and, where applicable, the reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior years, are similar to those used for property, plant and equipment (see note 3c). Development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life, as long as the costs are assigned to speciﬁc projects, clearly quantiﬁed, and relate to assets whose technical and commercial feasibility for sale or use have been established. The Group recognises as expenses in the consolidated income statement all research and development costs whose technical and commercial feasibility cannot be established. Research and development costs recognised as expenses in the accompanying consolidated income statement amounted to 1,674 thousand euros in 2010 and 1,152 thousand euros in 2009, and related entirely to research. Service concession arrangements may only be capitalised when the company has acquired the assets for consideration in the case of concessions susceptible to transfer, or for the amount of the expenses incurred in obtaining them directly from the state or relevant public body. If the rights to a concession are lost due to failure to comply with the terms and conditions thereof, its value is fully written oﬀ in order to cancel its carrying amount. These concessions are amortised on the basis of their useful lives. Costs of purchasing and developing basic computer systems are recognised under “Property, plant and equipment” in the consolidated balance sheet. Maintenance costs related to the computer systems are recognised with a charge to the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are incurred. Computer software is measured in the amount paid for ownership or the right to use the computer applications, or production cost if internally developed. They are amortised over a period of four years. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements Intangible assets with a ﬁnite useful life are amortised over that period, which is equivalent to the following amortisation rates: Amortisation rate Useful life Development Costs 5%-50% 20-2 Concessions, patents, licences, brands and similar: Port concessions at the Barcelona plant 1.33%-1.28% 75-78 264 Port concessions at the Huelva plant 7.60% 13 Other concessions at the Bilbao Plant 20.00% 5 Use of the public radioelectric domain 20.00% 5 Software 25% 4 In 2008, the Environment Ministry published the deﬁnitive, free allocation of greenhouse gas emission rights to Enagás, S.A. plants. This allocation is included in the National Allocation Plan for 2008-2012. In 2010, Enagás, S.A. delivered greenhouse gas emission rights equivalent to its emissions in 2009. The Group recognises emission rights as non-amortisable intangible assets in the same way as its other assets; initially at acquisition cost, then making the pertinent write-down where fair value is lower than the aforementioned cost. Rights received free of charge in accordance with the National Allocation Plan for 2008-2012 are deemed to have zero cost as the Group presents the assets net of subsidies (see Note 28). b. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are valued initially at acquisition price or production cost, with the exception of revaluations made by Enagás, S.A. in 1996, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses, in keeping with the criterion set forth in the following note. The costs of remodelling, expansion or upgrades leading to increased productivity, capacity or a lengthening of the useful lives of assets are capitalised as an increase in the cost of the related asset. The net carrying amount of replaced assets is deducted. In contrast, regular upkeep, repairs and maintenance expenses are expensed currently. Capitalised costs include: 1. Finance costs associated with the ﬁnancing of infrastructure projects accrued during the construction period if this is over a year. The average capitalisation rate used to calculate the amount of the borrowing costs to be capitalised was 2.83% in 2010 (3.40% in 2009). 2. Employee beneﬁts expense directly related to work in progress. The Group has a “Functional procedure for allocation of Employee Beneﬁts Expense to Investment Projects” which sets out the hypotheses for making this calculation. This procedure establishes that, to calculate own work capitalised, it is necessary to consider both direct employee beneﬁts expense, i.e., the hours worked and assigned to each project based on cost/hour calculated at the beginning of the year, and indirect costs. The amounts capitalised for these items are recognised in the accompanying 2010 consolidated income statement for 2010 as a decrease in employee beneﬁts expense (see Note 6). 3. Future payments which the Group will have to make in relation to the requirement to dismantle certain items of property, plant and equipment corresponding to the Serrablo and the Yela underground storage facilities at the end of their useful lives. The carrying amounts of these assets include an estimate of the present value at the date of acquisition of the costs to the Group of dismantling, with a credit to “Provisions” (Note 15) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In addition, this provision has been adjusted for discounting in subsequent periods. Subsequent to RD 1061/2007 of 20 July 2007, which grants Enagás the concession to operate the Yela underground natural gas storage facility in compliance with article 25.3 of Law 34/1998 of 7 October, which establishes a provision of 14.7 million euros for dismantling costs, this amount was recorded as an increase in the value of the 265 asset. This provision will be discounted each year to reﬂect the ﬁnancial impact of a long-term account receivable from the National Energy Commission (the Spanish energy regulator, hereinafter the “CNE” for its initials in Spanish), given that, once the dismantling is approved, the company may request payments on account against dismantling costs. The expenses and pertinent discounting for abandoning the Serrablo underground storage facility are reﬂected in the provision allocated to comply with the requirements of “Order of 6 September 1995 regarding the concession, to Enagás, S.A., for the storage of natural gas in Jaca, Aurín, and Suprajaca, located in Serrablo”, which required that a project for abandoning the Serrablo site be presented and approved prior to engaging in storage activities. The costs of remodelling, expansion or upgrades leading to increased productivity, capacity or a lengthening of the useful lives of assets are capitalised as an increase in the cost of the related asset. The net carrying amount of replaced assets is deducted. In contrast, regular upkeep, repairs and maintenance expenses are expensed currently. Properties in the course of construction for production, rental or administrative purposes, or for purposes not yet determined, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes, for qualifying assets, capitalised borrowing costs and employee beneﬁts expense directly related to work in progress in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other items of property, plant and equipment, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. The volume of gas that must remain‘immobilised’in the storage facility to operate natural gas storage facilities (i.e. cushion gas) is recognised as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the useful life speciﬁed by prevailing legislation, or over the lease period if shorter. Both natural gas related to the minimum linepack for system security of the gas pipelines and the minimum LNG stock level of the regasiﬁcation plants (also called the “gas talón”) were considered non-depreciable assets as this gas is not available and thereby immobilised under prevailing regulations. It is measured at the auction price under Order ITC/3993/2006 and the Resolution dated 18 April 2007 (see Note 6). · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, using the following annual rates: Depreciation rate Useful life (years) Buildings 3%-2% 33.33-50 Plant (transport network) 5%-2.50% 20-40 Tanks 5% 20 266 Underground storage facilities 10% 10 Cushion gas 5% 20 Other plant and machinery 12%-5% 8.33-20 Tools and equipment 30% 3.33 Furniture and fixtures 10% 10 Computer equipment 25% 4 Transport equipment 16% 6.25 The Group’s directors consider that the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment does not exceed their recoverable value, calculated based on the discounted future cash ﬂows they generate in accordance with the remuneration envisaged in prevailing legislation. The gain or loss on the disposal or derecognition of an asset is calculated as the diﬀerence between the amount of the sale and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement under“Impairment loss or gain on disposals of non-current assets”. Government grants related to property, plant and equipment are capitalised as a decrease in the cost of the assets and released to the consolidated income statements over the expected useful life of the asset as a decrease in depreciation of the related asset. c. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, or when deemed necessary, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suﬀered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). In the case of identiﬁable assets which do not generate cash inﬂows independently, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, considered to be present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows. The Group uses value in use in nearly all cases to calculate the recoverable value of its property, plant and equipment. To estimate value in use, the Group prepares pre-tax cash ﬂow projections based on the latest budgets approved by the Group’s directors. These budgets include the best available estimates of the revenue and expense of cashgenerating units based on industry forecasts, past experience and future expectations. These projections are prepared for a period of ﬁve years, with estimates of future ﬂows based on reasonable growth rates, which in no case beyond year ﬁve either scale up or exceed prior years’ growth rates. To calculate the present value, the cash ﬂows are discounted at a pre-tax rate that reﬂects the cost of capital of the business and of the geographical area where business is carried out. The discount rate is based on current interest rates and the risk premiums commonly used by analysts covering the business and the geographical region. If the recoverable amount of an asset is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised for the diﬀerence, with a charge to Depreciation and amortisation expense in the consolidated income statement. 267 A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount via a credit in the income statement up to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss be recognised. The Group's property, plant and equipment consists almost entirely of gas transportation, regasification and storage assets, and those assets needed to carry out its regulated gas sales business and technical system management activities. d. Operating leases In operating leases, the ownership of the leased asset and substantially all the risks and rewards incidental thereto remain with the lessor. When consolidated entities act as lessees, lease payments, including any incentives granted by the lessor, are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. e. Financial assets Financial assets are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group becomes one of the parties to the contractual terms of the instrument. Group companies classify ﬁnancial assets into the following categories established by IFRS: • Loans and receivables. These assets are measured at amortised cost, which is basically the cash amount given less repayments of principal plus accrued interest receivable in the case of loans, and the present value of the consideration provided in the case of receivables. • Held-to-maturity investments. These are assets that the Enagás Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. They are also recorded at amortised cost. • Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. These are all other assets not classiﬁed in any of the preceding categories. These investments are presented in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, when this can be determined reliably. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value, net of tax, are recognised directly in“Equity net unrealised gains (losses) reserve” in the consolidated balance sheet until this investment is disposed of, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the revaluation reserve is recognised in the consolidated income statement. If fair value is lower than cost, the diﬀerence is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements Held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables originated by the companies are measured at amortised cost, with accrued interest recognised in the income statement in accordance with the eﬀective interest rate. Cash and cash equivalents This heading in the consolidated balance sheet includes cash on hand, sight deposits and other highly liquid shortterm investments that can readily be realised in cash and that are not subject to risk of a change in value. Trade and other receivables 268 Receivables are initially measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method. The Group records the corresponding impairment provisions for the diﬀerence between the recoverable amount of receivables and their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of receivables is calculated by discounting estimated future cash ﬂows using the eﬀective interest rate at the outset of the transaction. f. Available-for-sale (AFS) non-current assets The Group records as available-for-sale (AFS) non-current assets intangible assets, plant, property and equipment or those assets included under Investments accounted for using the equity method and assets subject to disposal (group of assets that are to be disposed of along with their directly associated liabilities) for which, at the closing date of the consolidated balance sheet, active negotiations have begun for their sale and it is estimated that it will take place within twelve months from that date. These assets are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated sale value less the costs necessary to carry out their sale, and are no longer amortised from the moment they are recognised as such. Available-for-sale non-current assets and liabilities are presented in the Balance Sheet in a single entry called _Available-for-sale non-current assets and Liabilities associated with available-for-sale non-current assets . At 31 December 2010 the shares that the Enagas, S.A. held in Gasoduto Campo Maior-Leiria-Braga, S.A. and Gasoduto Braga-Tuy, S.A. are considered available-for-sale non-current assets (see Note 9). g. Inventories Natural gas inventories In general, natural gas inventories are stated at average cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is an estimate of the sale price established under prevailing legislation. Also, the company assesses the net realisable value of inventories at the balance sheet date and makes the appropriate impairment write-down when they are overstated. When the circumstances that that previously caused inventories to be written down no longer exist or there is clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value because of new economic circumstances, the impairment is reversed. Other inventories Other inventories unrelated to natural gas are stated at the lower of acquisition or production cost and net realisable value. The carrying amount includes the cost of direct materials and, where appropriate, direct labour and manufacturing overheads, including costs incurred in bringing the products to their present location and condition, at the point of sale. In addition, the company assesses the net realisable value of inventories at the balance sheet date and recognises any necessary impairment charges. When the circumstances that that previously caused inventories to be written down no longer exist or there is clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value because of new economic cir269 cumstances, the impairment is reversed. h. Equity and financial liabilities Capital and other equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Financial liabilities are classiﬁed according to the terms and economic substance of the contractual agreement. Group companies classify their main ﬁnancial liabilities as follows: • Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss, mainly ﬁnancial liabilities held for trading: Financial liabilities associated with available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets originating from asset transfers where the assigning entity neither substantially transfers nor retains the risks and beneﬁts of said assets. • Held-to-maturity ﬁnancial liabilities: Held-to-maturity ﬁnancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost as deﬁned above. The liability instruments held by Group companies are: • Bank loans: Interest-bearing loans are carried at the amount received, net of direct issue costs. Finance costs, including premiums payable upon settlement or repayment and direct issue costs, are taken to the consolidated income statement as accrued using the eﬀective interest method and added to the carrying amount of the instrument if not paid during the period in which they accrue. • Financial derivative instruments and hedge accounting: Bank borrowings expose the Group to ﬂuctuations in interest rates. To hedge these risks, the group uses swaps. The Group does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The use of derivatives is governed by the Group’s risk management policies approved by the parent company Enagás, S.A. Further details on the use of derivative instruments are disclosed in Note 18. The Company arranges cash ﬂow and fair value hedges. These hedge arrangements are recognised as follows: a) Fair value hedges: the hedging instrument and the hedged item are both measured at fair value, and any changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated income statement as ﬁnance cost or revenue. b) Cash ﬂow hedges: the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an eﬀective hedge is recognised, net of the corresponding tax eﬀect, in “Equity – Net unrealised gains (losses) reserve – Hedges” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The accumulated gain or loss on the hedging ins· Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements trument is taken to the income statement as the hedged item aﬀects proﬁt or loss. The portion of the gain or loss deemed to be an ineﬀective hedge is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement under ﬁnance revenue or cost, as appropriate. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction takes place. When a forecast hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss. 270 Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in proﬁt or loss. i. Trade and other payables Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at nominal value. j. Classification of payables into current and non-current Payables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are classiﬁed by maturity, i.e., those maturing in 12 months or less are classiﬁed as current, and those maturing in over 12 months as non-current. k. Pension Obligations Enagás makes contributions, in accordance with the approved pension plan adapted to the provisions of the Law on Pension Plans and Funds, to a deﬁned contribution plan called “Enagás Fondo de Pensiones”, whose fund manager is Gestión de Previsión y Pensiones, S.A. and its custodian Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., and which covers the company’s obligations with respect to serving employees. The company recognises certain vested rights for past service and undertakes to make monthly contributions averaging 6.8% of eligible salary. It is a mixed plan covering retirement beneﬁts, disability and death. The contributions made each year by the company in this connection are recognised under “Employee beneﬁts expense” in the consolidated income statements. The amounts not yet contributed at each year-end are recognised at their present value under “Provisions – Provisions for pensions and similar obligations” in the consolidated balance sheet. The company has committed to pay senior management and other top-ranking employees a variable sum as a bonus for fulﬁlling certain requirements during their time with the company, normally an amount based on the remuneration being earned at the moment of retirement. During the Board of Directors meeting on 18 January 2008, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee announced the approval of a medium-term incentive scheme (2008-2010) which will be measured at the end of period on the basis of fulﬁlment of certain targets and which has been paid in the ﬁrst quarter of 2010. l. Termination benefits Under current Spanish regulations, Spanish consolidated companies and some foreign companies are required to pay severance to employees terminated without just cause. There are no labour force reduction plans warranting recognition of a provision in this connection. m. Provisions The Group makes a distinction between: 271 • Provisions: balances payable covering obligations existing at the balance sheet date arising as a result of past events which could give rise to a loss for the companies which is speciﬁc in nature but uncertain as to amount and timing. • Contingent liabilities: possible obligations as a result of past events whose occurrence depends on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more separate future events not within the control of the consolidated entities. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group include all signiﬁcant provisions where it is more likely than not that the obligation will have to be settled. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements, but are disclosed in the notes (see Note 15). Provisions, which are estimated based on the best available information as to the consequences of the events giving rise thereto and which are re-estimated at the balance sheet date, are used to meet the speciﬁc and probable obligations for which they were initially recognised and are reversed, totally or partially, whenever these risks disappear or diminish. At year-end 2010 a number of legal proceedings and claims had been ﬁled against consolidated companies in connection with the ordinary course of their business. The Group’s legal counsel and its directors believe that the resolution of these proceedings and claims will not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the annual ﬁnancial statements of the years in which they are resolved. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements n. Deferred revenue This is mainly advance payments received for natural gas transport rights assigned to Gasoducto Al-Andalus, S.A. and Gasoducto de Extremadura, S.A., which are taken to proﬁt and loss on a straight-line basis until 2020 when the transport contract expires. It also includes the accrual of amounts received for making connections from Enagás, S.A.’s basic network to networks owned by distributors, secondary transporters, gas supply companies and eligible customers. This revenue is taken to proﬁt and loss on the basis of the useful life of the assigned installations. 272 o. Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. It represents the amounts receivable for goods delivered and the services rendered as part of the company’s ordinary course of business, less discounts, VAT, and other sales taxes. Ordinary revenue from the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date, provided the result of the transaction can be estimated reliably. Following the publication of rules which aﬀect Enagás, S.A. in the Oﬃcial State Gazette of 15 February 2002 (applicable as of 19 February 2002), revenue recognition criteria under the new regulations are as follows: On 15 February 2002 three Ministerial Orders were approved by the Ministry of Economy deﬁning the new remuneration system for regulated natural gas activities in Spain, which came into force on 19 February 2002. In addition to specifying remuneration for regulated gas-related activities, these Orders ﬁxed natural gas prices and tolls and royalties for third-party access to gas installations stipulating the total payment receivable in 2002 by all companies carrying out purchase and sale activities for the tariﬀ market, regasiﬁcation, gas storage and transportation, technical management of the system and gas distribution activities, in addition to formulae and criteria for restating and establishing the remuneration of these activities in coming years. Subsequently, on an annual basis, new Orders have been published that have replaced those of previous years. On 28 December 2009 the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce approved Ministerial Order ITC/3520/2009 establishing the tolls and fees for third-party access to gas installations applicable in 2010 as well as the last resort tariff, in addition to updating certain aspects relating to remuneration of regulated gas sector activities. In accordance with this new legislation, the Group is entitled to remuneration for the following activities: • Transporte • Regasiﬁcation, including loading of LNG tank and the transfer of LNG to tankers • Storage • Technical system management • Generation of the minimum operating level for LNG ships and of the minimum linepack for gas pipelines (see Note 3-b) • Own consumption of natural gas • Overall incentive for availability The most relevant revenue related aspects of the regulations covering the activity carried out by the Group are described in Note 4 below. Interest revenue is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the eﬀective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. Dividend revenue from investments is recognised when the shareholder's rights to receive payment have been 273 established. p. Expense recognition Expenses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when there is a decrease in the future economic beneﬁt related to a reduction in an asset or an increase in a liability that can be measured reliably. This means that the recognition of expenses takes place simultaneously with the recognition of the increase in the liability or the reduction of the asset. An expense is recognised immediately when a payment does not generate future economic beneﬁts or when the necessary requirements for it to be recorded as an asset are not met. q. Income tax expense Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement or in equity accounts in the consolidated balance sheet depending on where the gains or losses giving rise to it have been recognised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on diﬀerences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the corresponding tax bases and are calculated using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the assets are realised or the liabilities settled. Changes during the year in deferred tax assets or liabilities which do not arise from business combinations are recognised in the consolidated income statement or directly in equity accounts in the consolidated balance sheet, as appropriate. Deferred tax assets are recognised only when it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which the deductible temporary diﬀerences can be utilised. Deductions arising from economic events in the year are deducted from accrued income tax expense unless there are doubts as to whether they will be realised, in which case they are not recognised until they materialise, or they relate to speciﬁc tax incentives. Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and any changes in deferred tax. Current tax is calculated by applying the tax rate to taxable proﬁt less any deductions. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements r. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing proﬁt or loss attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding the number of parent company shares held as treasury shares by Group companies. Basic earnings per share coincides with diluted earnings per share (Note 14). s. Consolidated flow statement 274 The following terms are used to present the consolidated cash ﬂow statement: Cash ﬂows: inﬂows and outﬂows of cash and cash equivalents, deﬁned as highly liquid, short-term investments with low risk of experiencing signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the value. Operating activities: the entity’s ordinary operating activities and any other activities that cannot be classiﬁed as investing or ﬁnancing activities. Investing activities: the acquisition and disposal of non-current assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents. Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of equity and liabilities that are not operating activities. 4. Regulation of remuneration a. Revenue from regasification, storage and transport 275 In 2008, Royal Decree 326/2008 of 29 February was issued to establish the remuneration payable for natural gas transportation services applicable to facilities in service from 1 January 2008, the ﬁrst time the mechanism for calculating this remuneration was set at the Royal Decree level. Adapting and standardising the remuneration framework was intended to provide stability and eliminate uncertainty, thus paving the way for the major investments anticipated during the new planning period (2008 to 2016). This Royal Decree adapts the transport remuneration system to the model which began to be deﬁned in late 2006, further reinforcing convergence with the compensation system for electricity transmission, and with the remuneration schemes in place for analogous regulated activities in neighbouring European nations. The remuneration calculation formula is similar to those for regasiﬁcation and underground storage. Like those, it is based on net assets, though for transport, investments are updated annually at a rate of 2.5%. Ministerial Order ITC/3802/2008 of 26 December 2008 updated certain aspects of the ﬁnancial regime governing regulated activities within the gas sector for 2009. Additional provision eight of the aforementioned Ministerial Order stipulates amendments to the regulatory framework governing the transit of gas by the Group’s Portuguese subsidiaries“Gasoduto Campo Maior – Leiria-Braga” and “Gasoduto Braga – Tuy”, speciﬁcally in relation to the revenue recognised to cover the costs incurred in providing this transit service to date. Under the Order, this revenue stream is no longer received by the Group, with eﬀect from 1 January 2009. During 2009, the Group continued to honour its contractual obligations under the ship-or-pay contract covering transit of this gas. However, since the publication of the said Order ITC/3802/2008, due to the change in the regulatory environment for Enagás S.A., the Group initiated negotiations with its Portuguese partners in these companies, in order to adjust its contractual obligations with these subsidiaries to the new regulatory environment. The negotiations were concluded on 17 December with the signing of separation agreements (see Note 9), although ﬁnal approval of the transaction is pending a suspension clause by the Competition Regulatory Authority in Portugal. On the other hand, the company ﬁled an administrative appeal against the mentioned Order which is pending before the Supreme Court. Ministerial Order ITC/3520/2009 of 28 December 2009 updated certain aspects of the economic regime governing regulated activities within the gas sector for 2010. In particular, this Order sets out speciﬁc compensation values granted to companies operating in the regulated gas sector in 2010 and unit values applicable to investment and management of transportation, regasiﬁcation and storage facilities. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements The unit values for investment and operating expenses applicable to gas transport installations started up after 1 January 2008 were published for years 2008, 2009 and 2010 and reﬂect the speciﬁc value recommendations proposed by the CNE, the Spanish energy systems regulator. In the case of regasiﬁcation and storage, unit values for investment and management are those applicable in 2010. As in previous years and in keeping with applicable regulations, these Orders stipulate that the cost recognised for transport, regasiﬁcation, and underground storage activities comprises ﬁxed and variable components. 276 a.1. Recognised fixed cost. Recognised fixed cost is calculated on the basis of operating assets and compensates investment and operating costs relating to assets used in the gas system. a.1.1. Remuneration for investment costs comprises: • Value of recognised assets. For installations put into service before 2002, the remuneration is calculated based on the book value of the assets after the revaluation of 1996 (Royal Decree Law 7/1996), less grants received to ﬁnance these assets. An annual restatement rate based on the adjusted average of the consumer price index (CPI) and the industrial price index (IPRI) is applied to the diﬀerence. For new installations brought into service since 2002, the standard value of each investment set by the regulator is used, while those investments that entail expansion are measured at actual cost. Investments in underground storage are also measured at actual cost because there are no standard values. Transport installations brought into service from 2008 are valued at the average of the standard value and actual cost. Regasiﬁcation installations put into service since 2006 are valued at actual cost plus 50% of the diﬀerence between standard value and actual cost, up to the amount of standard value. • Remuneration for depreciation of system assets. The depreciation rate relating to the useful life of the asset is applied to the investment recognised to give the amount of revenue for this item. For transport assets put into service after 1 January 2008, depreciation is updated annually at a rate of 2.5%. • Financial remuneration for the value of the investment. For transport assets put into service before 2008, this ﬁgure is calculated by applying a ﬁnancial return equal to the annual average IRR on 10-year government bonds or a replacement interest rate plus 1.5% to the value of the gross investment value obtained as per the previous paragraph. For transport assets put into service after 1 January 2008, this ﬁgure is calculated by applying a ﬁnancial return equal to the annual average IRR on 10-year government bonds or a replacement interest rate, plus 3.75%, to the value of the net investment value (after depreciation) obtained as per the previous paragraph, updated annually at a rate of 2.5%. For regasification and storage assets, this figure is calculated by applying a financial return equal to the annual average IRR on 10-year government bonds or a replacement interest rate, based on the date that each facility was put into service, plus 3.5%, to the value of the net investment (after depreciation) obtained in the previous paragraph. The resulting remuneration rate for transport assets started up in 2010 was 7.85%. • Remuneration of fully depreciated assets. For transport assets put into service before 2008, 50% of the ﬁnancial remuneration is recognised. For regasiﬁcation, storage, and transport assets put into service from 1 January 2008, 50% of the depreciation and the ﬁnancial remuneration of the last year is recognised. With regard to the 277 latter transport assets, remuneration is also updated annually at a rate of 2.5%. a.1.2. Compensation for operating costs relating to regasiﬁcation and transport assets started up before the end of 2007 is calculated in accordance with the costs authorised in 2000 for gas system installations for gas transport and regasiﬁcation, standardised by physical and technical unit. For transport assets commissioned after 1 January 2008, the standard values applicable are those established in the unit value review proposal put forward by the CNE. These standard values are updated annually based on consumer price index and the industrial price index (IPRI) for capital goods, adjusted by certain eﬃciency factors. . For underground storage, a speciﬁc ﬁxed operating and maintenance cost is deﬁned for each site. a.1.3. Revenue relating to the ﬁxed authorised cost is taken to the consolidated income statement on a straightline basis. In this way, a month-on-month balance is achieved between revenue (remuneration) and expenses (depreciation). a.2. Recognised variable cost for regasification and transfer of LNG to tankers. a.2.1. The recognised variable cost is calculated based on the number of kW/hr actually regasiﬁed and loaded in LNG cisterns in each period and the variable unit regasiﬁcation cost for the period in question. For 2010, this cost was set at 0.000181 euros per kWh regasiﬁed and 0.000217 euros per kWh loaded in cisterns. a.2.2. For loading LNG onto ships from regasiﬁcation plants or the pre-cooling of ships a cost identical to the variable cistern loading cost is recognised. For ship-to-ship transfers the cost is 80% of this value. a.3. Recognised variable cost for injection and extraction in underground storage facilities. The cost is based on the kWh injected and extracted at each of the storage facilities. The variable costs are as follows: • Unit costs at the Serrablo facility: Injection: 0.000601 €/kWh; extraction: 0.000110 €/kWh · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements b. Revenue from technical system management (TSM) Revenue from this activity is calculated on a yearly basis in accordance with the recognised cost for each year and is used to compensate Enagás, S.A.’s for its obligations as Technical System Manager, which include coordinating the development, operation and maintenance the transport network, supervising the security of natural gas supply (storage levels and emergency plans), implementing plans for the future development of gas infrastructures and controlling third-party access to the network. In 2010, the amount earmarked for TSM remuneration, which should be collected by companies that are titlehol278 ders of the regasiﬁcation, transport, storage and gas distribution facilities, as a percentage of invoicing for tolls and fees relating to third-party network access rights, was 0.42%. This amount is deposited by these companies within the deadlines and in the manner established in the settlement procedure in the deposit account kept open by the CNE for these purposes. The above-mentioned percentage of invoicing is calculated based on the ﬁgure obtained by applying maximum tolls and fees to the invoiced amounts, without subtracting possible discounts that could be agreed between the titleholders of the installations and their users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the remuneration recognised for acting as technical system manager in 2010 was 11,206,248 euros. Any surplus or shortfall between this ﬁgure and the amounts received as a result of application of the above calculations will be included by the CNE in the fourteenth settlement of 2010. This revenue is taken to the consolidated income statement monthly on a straight-line basis. c. Settlement of tolls relating to third-party access to gas installations. Invoicing and collection of remuneration for regulated activities subject to settlement (third-party access to the network and technical system management) is carried out in compliance with the settlement procedure established in the Ministerial Order dated 28 October 2002. d. Settlement system. On 1 November 2002, Ministerial Order ECO/2692/2002 (28 October) was published, regulating settlement procedures for remuneration of regulated activities and deﬁning company disclosure requirements. Additional provision number ﬁve of Order ITC/3993/2006 amends section I.5 of appendix II of this settlements order and states that the interest equivalent to applying the average 1-year treasury bill yield during 60 days to the amounts to be paid to each transporter or distributor be added to the settlements. e. Revenue for the minimum operating level and minimum linepack of gas pipelines Article 16 of ITC/3354/2010 Order provides that the minimum level for gas ﬁlling of the pipeline transport and regasiﬁcation plants (gas check) shall be remunerated as a necessary investment for the transport activity, recognising a ﬁnancial retribution. Additionally, Article 17 of this Order provides that the financial retribution for the filling gas purchased for the minimum of transport pipelines and regasification plants purchased each year shall be calculated by applying to cost a remuneration rate equal to the average monthly rate of the 10 year Spanish government bond in the twelve months prior to November last year, plus 350 basis points. The acquisition cost will be the result of applying the auction price to the quantity purchased. For 2010, gas for the minimum operating level and linepack was acquired via a dedicated auction. f. Revenue for gas purchases for internal consumption From 1 July 2007, gas transporters are responsible for acquiring the amount of gas needed for internal consumption at their facilities. This leads to a reduction in the percentages of shrinkage retained from users. 279 Gas acquired by transporters is measured at the auction price, with the payments made treated as reimbursable expenses. g.

This agreement provides for Enagas S.A. to acquire transport capacity from its Portuguese subsidiaries and then transfer that capacity to REN Gasodutos, S.A. with eﬀect 1 January 2010. Such separation is subject to prior authorisation from the Portuguese Competition Authority as per Portuguese Law 18/2003, which acts as a condition precedent. Such condition precedent also aﬀects other aspects of the transaction, such as compensation claims between the Portuguese subsidiaries and Enagas S.A., repayment of shareholder loans, the redemption of the shares and the transfer of the relationship between Enagas, S.A. and Gasoduto Campo Maior-Leiria-Braga, S.A. and Gasoduto Braga-Tuy, S.A. Here follows the breakdown of headings Available-for-sale non-current assets and Available-for-sale liabilities related to non-current assets from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at 31 December 2010: 31.12.2010 31.12.2010 Assets Liabilities and Equity NON-CURRENT ASSETS 14,202 NET EQUITY Intangible assets 14,202 NON CURRENT LIABILITIES 2,036 CURRENT ASSETS 17,134 Financial liabilities 2,036 Other financial assets 9,606 CURRENT LIABILITIES 3,821 Other assets 4,536 Financial liabilities 2,036 Cash and cash equivalents 2,992 Trade creditors and other payables 294 TOTAL GENERAL 31,336 Other liabilities 1,491 TOTAL GENERAL 5,857 10. Inventories It should be noted that at 31 December 2010, Enagás, S.A., as Technical System Manager, had approximately 850 295 GWh of operational gas necessary to ensure operation of the gas system, as stipulated in the ﬁfth additional provision of Order ITC/3863/2007 of 28 December 2007. This gas is not recognised as inventory in the ﬁnancial statements since it belongs to the entire gas system and is not the property of Enagás, S.A. The Group also has 5,328 thousand euros (4,725 thousand euros in 2009) of inventories unrelated to natural gas that include, inter alia, oﬃce materials and consumables. 11. Trade and other receivables and current tax assets The breakdown of “Trade and other receivables” at the consolidated balance sheet date is as follows: 31/12/2010 31/12/2009 Trade receivables 46,520 7,732 Receivable from Group companies 1,286 1,670 Other receivables 297,670 312,687 Income tax receivable 21,007 37,580 Shareholders (owners) desembolsos exigidos Total 366,483 359,669 The 1,286 thousand euro “Receivable from Group companies” balance corresponds to 597 thousand euros receivable from Gasoducto Al-Andalus, S.A. and 689 thousand euros receivable from Gasoducto de Extremadura, S.A. Both balances relate to gas transport services rendered to Galp Gas Natural, S.A. pending collection, which are consolidated using the proportionate method in accordance with the percentage interest of Enagás, S.A. in these companies. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements Under “Other receivables”, the Group includes the unsettled balance relating to remuneration for regulated regasification, transport, and storage activities in 2010 for 205,947 thousand euros, and the outstanding balance on the remuneration for technical system management of 1,497 thousand euros, leaving a total outstanding balance of 206,444 thousand euros at the 2010 year-end. Also during 2010, final settlement has been received by Enagas, SA, recognising a cumulative deviation in that period, amounting to 42,867 thousand euros. Settlement was pending since 2008. “Other receivables” also includes the uncollected amounts from gas suppliers for the freight tax regulated by ar296 ticle 24 of Law 48/2003. This tax is levied on natural gas shipments which agents unload at the regasification plants, including those of which Enagás, S.A. is titleholder at the ports of Barcelona, Cartagena, and Huelva. At 31 December 2010, these uncollected amounts totalled 7,088 thousand euros, of which 5,974 thousand euros are subject to a lawsuit filed by certain suppliers. Specifically, 4,984 thousand euros were past due by over one year at 31 December 2010. Law 48/2003 modifies the duty on goods unloaded at ports under the concession regime. Title I of this law states that if the concessionaire makes the application within a period of six months, 100% of the duties related to unloading may be passed on to the agent that is titleholder of the merchandise even though payment to the port authority is still the responsibility of the taxpayer, in this case Enagás, as concessionaire under the previous regime. Under the previous regime, only 50% of the duty could be passed on to the titleholder of the goods by the titleholder of the concession. The problem with the suppliers arose from the fact that while Law 43/2003 came into effect on 27 February 2004, Title I of the law related to the pass-through of duties became applicable on 1 January 2004 in accordance with the fifth additional provision of Law 48/2003. Enagás, S.A. submitted the application for the change of regime in July 2004, understanding that the six-month period started on 27 February 2004, when the law took effect. However, the suppliers with which the company is in litigation understand that the application from 1 January of Title Iimplies that this period ended on 30 June 2004. Therefore, Enagás, S.A.’s application is past the deadline and therefore, for legal purposes, outside the allotted period. As a result of this situation, Enagás, S.A. has ﬁled administrative claims seeking legal jurisdiction for its actions covering the full uncollected amounts. It should be noted that Enagás, S.A.’s claims have been expressly ratiﬁed by the Huelva Port Authority via ruling issued 3 May 2007, which, in line with the Port Authorities of Cartagena and Barcelona, considers without any reservation that Enagás’ election to avail itself of the new economic tax regime established by Law 48/2003 was not outside the allotted period. In addition, all the rulings handed down by the regional economic and administrative courts have upheld the claims lodged by Enagás, S.A. in response to the suppliers’ refusal to pay the total amounts invoiced for port duties on merchandise and for general services. The Group’s directors recognise the risk that the rest of the suppliers paying the full tax passed on by Enagás, S.A. will seek reimbursement of 50% if the court rules against Enagás, S.A. in the claims in process. The amount paid to 297 Enagás, S.A. by suppliers with which there is no ongoing litigation at 31 December 2010 totalled 39,119 thousand euros, of which 50% (19,559 thousand euros) would be at risk. The above notwithstanding, the Group’s directors consider that based on the information available at that date, the risk of not recovering these amounts is remote, so no provision for this concept has been recorded. However, it will continue to monitor the claims lodged in 2010. “Income tax receivable” at 31 December 2010 basically includes VAT receivable by parent company Enagás, S.A., as accrued recoverable VAT is higher than VAT payable, partly because Enagás, S.A. acts as a tax warehouse. This heading also includes corporate income tax withholdings and payments on account paid by the company (Note 22). Los Administradores consideran que el importe en libros de las cuentas de deudores comerciales y otras cuentas a cobrar se aproxima a su valor razonable. Credit risk The Group’s main ﬁnancial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments, which represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to ﬁnancial assets. The balances include amounts which on the whole are within the stipulated maturity periods and are payable by companies of recognised prestige and solvency. The Group does not have a signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk as it operates in a regulated environment under planned scenarios. However, it takes the impairment provisions deemed necessary to cover bad debt risks. ·Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements 12. Cash and cash equivalents 298 The breakdown of “Cash and cash equivalents” at 31 December 2010 and 2009 is as follows: 31.12.2010 31.12.2009 Cash 18,961 7,623 Cash equivalents 1,068,090 632,901 Total 1,087,051 640,524 As a general rule, bank balances accrue interest at a rate that is similar to the market rate for daily deposits. Current deposits mature within less than three months and earn interest at market rates for this kind of product. There are no signiﬁcant restrictions on the availability of cash and bank balances. 13. Equity 13.1 Issued capital At 31 December 2010 the share capital of the parent company amounted to 358,101 thousand euros, represented by 238,734,260 ordinary bearer shares, all of the same class and series, with a par value of 1.50 euros each and fully paid up. All shares of parent company Enagás, S.A. are listed on the four Spanish stock exchanges and are traded on the electronic trading platform (the continuous market). At 30 December 2010, Enagás, S.A.’s share price closed at 14.915 euros, having reached a high for the year of 16.575 euros per share on 1 April. No company held more than 5% of the company’s issued capital at either year-end 2010 or 2009. The most signiﬁcant shareholdings in Enagás, S.A. at 31 December 2010 are as follows: % Company Shareholding Omán Oil Company, S.A.O.C. 5.000 Sagane Inversiones, S.L. 5.000 Bancaja Inversiones, S.A. 5.000 Cantábrica de Inversiones de Cartera, S.L. 5.000 Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales 5.000 Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa 5.000 299 Cantábrica de Inversiones de Cartera, S.L. and Bancaja Inversiones, S.A. are subsidiaries of Caja de Ahorros de Asturias (Cajastur), and Caja de Ahorros de Valencia, Castellón y Alicante (Bancaja), respectively. At 31 December 2010, REN, S.A. continued to hold a 1% shareholding in Enagás, S.A. It should be noted that article 92 of Law 62/2003 on tax, administration and social order measures of 31 December 2003, which amends Law 34/1998 on the hydrocarbon sector, establishes that “no individual or company may directly or indirectly hold more than 5% of Enagás, S.A.’s ordinary or voting shares”. Law 12/2007, of 2 July 2007, further limits the exercise of voting rights to 3%, in addition to the ownership cap of 5%. The law also stipulates the natural persons or legal entities that operate in the gas industry and those that, directly or indirectly, hold over 5% of the share capital of these companies may not exercise more than 1% of the voting rights in the technical system manager. These restrictions shall not apply to direct or indirect shareholdings held by public-sector enterprises. The Group has no treasury shares. 13.2 Reserves Legal reserve Under the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law, 10% of proﬁt for each year must be transferred to the legal reserve until the balance of this reserve reaches at least 20% of share capital. The legal reserve can be used to increase capital provided that the remaining reserve balance does not fall below 10% of the increased share capital amount. Otherwise, until the legal reserve exceeds 20% of share capital, it can only be used to oﬀset losses, provided that suﬃcient other reserves are not available for this purpose. The parent company of the Group has appropriated to the legal reserve an amount of 71,620 thousand euros, included under “Restricted reserves” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. In 2010, Gasoducto Al-Andalus, S.A. and Gasoducto de Extremadura, S.A. had also appropriated to their respective legal reserves the full required amount. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements 13.3 Interim dividend The distribution of net proﬁt for 2010 that Enagás, S.A.’s Board of Directors will propose for approval at the General Shareholders' Meeting is as follows: THOUSANDS OF EUROS Dividend 200,089 300 Voluntary reserves 126,976 327,065 At its meeting on 22 November 2010, the Board of Directors of Enagás, S.A. resolved to pay an interim dividend against 2010 profit of 74,485 thousand euros (0.312 euros per share, before tax). The company has prepared the necessary liquidity statement, expressed in thousands of euros, in accordance with article 277 of the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law. In accordance with legal requirements, the provisional ﬁnancial statements prepared by the Group, which showed that there were suﬃcient resources to pay the interim dividend against 2010 proﬁt, are set forth below: THOUSANDS OF EUROS Provisional Provisional financial statements financial statements 31 October 2010 31 October 2009 Consolidated Group profit 284,655 246,161 10% allocation to legal reserve Income available for distribution 284,655 246,161 Forecast interim dividend (74,485) (67,562) Forecast cash at bank and in hand (Group) between 31 October and 31 December: Cash at bank and in hand 1,033,621 500,958 Collections forecast for the period 149,000 209,000 Credit facilities and loans granted by banks 1,005,000 1,136,000 Payments forecast for the period (including interim dividend) (261,390) 332,800 Forecast cash at bank and in hand 1,926,231 2,178,758 The aforementioned interim dividend was paid on 21 December 2010. The proposed before-tax ﬁnal dividend (0.526 euros per share) is subject to shareholder approval and is not recognised as a liability in these ﬁnancial statements. 13.4 Net unrealised gains (losses) reserve Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets During the ﬁrst quarter of 2009, Enagás, S.A. sold all units it held in the fund (Note 8.4).

Earnings per share 302 Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁt for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the year, excluding the average number of treasury shares held in the year. Accordingly: 2010 2009 Change Profit for the year (thousands of euros) 333,481 298,031 11.89 % Weighted average number of shares outstanding (thousands of shares) 238,734 238,734 Basic earnings per share in euros 1.3969 1.2484 11.89 % Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing proﬁt for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent (adjusted for the eﬀect of dilutive potential ordinary shares) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares of the company. As there are no potential ordinary shares at either year-end 2009 or year-end 2008, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same. 15. Provisions and contingent liabilities 15.1 Provisions 303 The directors of the Enagás Group consider that the provisions recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet adequately cover risks from lawsuits, arbitration and other proceedings described in this note, and therefore do not expect these proceedings to give rise to additional liabilities. Given the nature of the risk covered by these provisions it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate as to the timing of any payments which may arise. The discounting of provisions is recognised with a charge to “Finance costs” in the accompanying consolidated income statement. The changes in this balance sheet heading in 2010 were as follows: 01.01.2010 Additions Discounting Amounts 31.12.2010 applied Non-current provisions Long-term incentive plan 2,762 (2,762) Tax Other 5,255 (5) 5,250 Abandonment costs 23,487 5,500 115 29,102 Total non-current provisions 31,504 5,495 115 (2,762) 34,352 Current provisions Other 3,294 3,294 Total, current 3,294 3,294 The most signiﬁcant items of provisions recorded in 2010 are as follows: • Personnel obligations.

The company is currently negotiating renewal of the main facilities maturing in 2011. Undrawn loans granted amount to 725 million euros (2009: 875 million euros). Management believes that these amounts suﬃciently cover potential short-term liquidity requirements based on commitments outstanding at the balance sheet date. Average annual interest in 2010 on Group loans and credit facilities in euros was 2.04% without considering hedges and fees and 2.52% factoring hedges and fees (2.26% and 3.30%, respectively, in 2009). Current loans and credit facilities of the parent company are denominated in euros and accrued interest at an average annual rate of 1.32% in 2010 The directors estimate that the change in the fair value of bank borrowings at 31 December 2010, calculated by discounting of future cash ﬂows at market interest rates, amounted to 4,748 million euros. The interest rate curve used in this calculation takes into account the risks associated with the industry and Enagás, S.A.’s creditworthiness. The sensitivity of the aforementioned fair value to ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is as follows: Millions of Euros Change in interest rates 0.25 % -0.25 % Change in fair value of borrowings 43.2 -43.8 Derivatives and other ﬁnancial liabilities classiﬁed as debts and other payables include: • 5,682 thousand euros corresponding to the adjustments envisaged in the income tax assessment for 1995 to 1998, updated as at 31 December 2010 (2009: 5,523 thousand euros). • The loan from the General Energy Secretariat, which forms part of the aid envisaged in the National Energy Programme granted by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade within the framework of the National Plan for Scientiﬁc Research, and Technical Development and Innovation (2004-2007). This loan is associated with the “Project for the electricity generation system at the Almendralejo compression station” being carried out by Enagás, S.A. The total amount of the loan granted is 3,265 thousand euros of which 168 thousand euros have been re-paid, 2,799 thousand euros are classiﬁed as non-current and 168 thousand euros as current. Also included is the loan from the General Industry Secretariat, which forms part of the aid envisaged in the aforementioned plan by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade. This loan is associated with the “Project for design and development of a high pressure gas meter calibration facility being carried out by Enagás, S.A. The total amount of the loan is 1,100 thousand euros, with 600 thousand euros allocated in 2007 and 500 thousand euros in 2008. The financing granted for each year was drawn down in December 2007 and 2008. In May 2009 the General Industry Secretariat notified Enagás, S.A. of its obligation to repay 204 thousand euros in connection with the loan received in 2007 to bring the amount received in line with the actual amount invested. The repayment was made in October of 2009. At 31 December 2010, 839 thousand euros are long term and 57 thousand euros short term. 307 This heading also includes another loan from the General Energy Secretariat as part of the aid envisaged in the aforementioned plan by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade. Speciﬁcally, this loan is associated with the “Project for Huelva power generation plant” being carried out by Enagás, S.A. The total amount of the loan granted is 3,598 thousand euros to be received in four annuities. During 2009 it disposed of 157 thousand euros from the ﬁrst annuity and during 2010 it disposed of 422 thousand euros from the second annuity. Both loans are repayable in 10 years, with a 3-year grace period and at a cost of 0.25%; the cost of the guarantees provided. • 4,779 thousand euros corresponding to long-term payables to suppliers of property, plant and equipment recognised by the Group in 2010.

Risk and capital management policy 310 18.1 Qualitative information The Enagás Group is exposed to certain risks, which it manages via systems of risk identiﬁcation, measurement, limits and oversight. The basic principles deﬁned by the Enagás Group in establishing the policy for managing its most signiﬁcant risks are as follows: • Compliance with corporate governance rules. • Strict compliance with the Group’s in-house rules. • Each business and corporate area deﬁnes: a) Its trading markets and products as a function of where it has suﬃcient knowledge and capacity to ensure eﬀective risk management b) Criteria for counterparties c) Authorised brokers • The businesses and corporate areas establish for each market in which they operate their risk threshold in accordance with the strategy deﬁned. • The limits are approved by the respective risk committees, or in their absence, by the Enagás Risk Committee. • All the transactions of the various businesses and corporate areas are carried out within the approved limits for each case. • The businesses, corporate areas, business lines and companies establish the necessary risk management controls to ensure that market transactions are carried out in accordance with the Group’s policies, rules and procedures. Interest rate risk Interest rate ﬂuctuations aﬀect the fair value of assets and liabilities carrying ﬁxed interest rates and the future ﬂows from assets and liabilities linked to ﬂoating interest rates. The objective of interest rate risk management is to achieve a balanced debt structure that minimises the cost of debt over the long term and mitigates volatility in the consolidated income statement. In line with its estimates and debt structure targets, the Enagás Group writes derivatives to hedge its risks. Liquidity risk The Group’s liquidity policy consists of taking out credit facilities and short term investments to cover requirements for a period consistent with debt and capital market conditions and expectations. Credit risk The Group has no signiﬁcant credit risk as the average customer collection period is very short and cash is placed or derivatives written with highly solvent entities. 311 18.2 Quantitative information a) Interest-rate exposure 2010 2009 Percentage of fixed-rate borrowings 70% 60% Based on the above levels of fixed-rate borrowings and after carrying out an analysis of the company’s sensitivity to a one percentage point variation in market interest rates, the company estimates that the higher cost of servicing its floating-rate debt resulting from such a variation would have an income-statement impact of approximately 19 million euros. In addition, and again in relation to its ﬂoating rate debt, management estimates that the impact on equity, as a result of derivatives arranged, of a similar change in market rates would not be signiﬁcant in 2011. 18.3 Capital management. The Group, and speciﬁcally its parent company Enagás, S.A., as a capitaland investment-intensive business within a regulated market, has a capital management focus at the corporate level aimed at achieving a ﬁnancial structure that optimises cost in order to maintain strong ﬁnancial health. To this end, despite not having to rely on external borrowing, it continuously seeks access to ﬁnancial markets at the most competitive cost possible to ﬁnance its investment plan without requiring changes to the Group’s dividend policy. During 2010 there have been no changes in capital management with respect to 2009. Overall, the Group’s capital structure consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent (capital, share premium, retained earnings, and others), borrowings, cash, and other liquid assets. In this regard, the Group provides quantitative disclosures in Notes 15 to 17 about the ﬁnancial liabilities which make up its capital structure, together with its policies for managing the related risks. These notes describe the ﬁnancial position in detail and describe the strength of this position, which the capital management policy mentioned in the ﬁrst paragraph of this section aims to ensure. Moreover, these notes indicate that the credit ratings held by the principle agencies did not change in respect of 2009 (see Note 33). The company monitors these ratings for decision-making purposes. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements 19. Derivative financial instruments 312 The company uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to business, operating and cash ﬂow risks. Speciﬁcally, the company has entered into the following hedging arrangements. 2010 Notional Instrument Date written amount Cap/Floor Fixed rate Start date Maturity Interest rate swap June-10 250,000 1.4167 27/08/2010 27/08/2013 Interest rate swap September-10 150,000 1.65425 23/11/2011 24/11/2014 Interest rate swap September-10 200,000 1.461 16/05/2011 10/04/2014 Interest rate swap September-10 100,000 1.397 03/11/2010 03/05/2013 Interest rate swap December-10 200,000 1.6851 01/01/2011 01/01/2014 Total 900,000 2009 Notional Instrument Date written amount Fixed rate Start date Maturity Cross Currency Swapjulio-2009 July-2009 147,514 15/09/2009 15/09/2039 Swap November-2009 250,000 1.98 27/11/2009 27/11/2012 Total 397,514 The notional amount of the cross currency swap is 20,000 million yen (JPY), corresponding to the 147,514 thousand euro private placement, at a spread to 6-month Euribor (see Note 16.1). The company has fulfilled the requirements set forth in Note 3.h regarding the measurement bases for classifying financial instruments as hedges. Specifically, they have been formally designated as such, and they have been tested for effectiveness. The notional and/or contractual amount of the contracts entered into does not represent the real risk assumed by Enagás, S.A., as the net position is derived by oﬀsetting and/or grouping these ﬁnancial instruments.

Trade and other payables 314 The breakdown of “Trade and other payables” is as follows: 31.12.2010 31.12.2009 Payable to Group companies 8,188 2,704 other trade payables 323,807 304,918 other suppliers 4,921 4,303 Current tax liabilities (see Note 22.2) 9,737 10,030 Total 346,653 321,955 “Payables to Group companies” relate to the payables, consolidated proportionately, for gas transport services the subsidiaries provide to Enagás, S.A. “Other suppliers” corresponds to amounts owed for the purchase of materials by and services rendered to Group companies, which are registered primarily in ”Other operating costs” and “Non-current assets”. As a result of the enforcement of Law 15/2010, laying down measures to combat late payment in commercial transactions, the Group amended contract conditions in relation to payment terms within their business operations to bring them into line with the new law. Under the heading of trade payables, the amount outstanding to suppliers at the end of 2010 accumulating a delay greater than the maximum legal term of payment amounts to 29,692 thousand euros, although this ﬁgure includes 12,287 thousand euros which are blocked by the company, either for not fulﬁlling certain contractual requirements, either because they relate to withheld guarantees which have not reached maturity or for amounts retained by the courts of justice. 21. Defined contribution plans The Group operates deﬁned contribution pension plans covering the commitments acquired by the company 315 with respect to qualifying serving employees. The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. Where employees leave the plans prior to full vesting of the contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of the forfeited contributions. The contributions made by the company to the pension plan in this connection amounted to 2,191 thousand euros in 2010 (2,082 thousand euros in 2009), recognised under“Personnel beneﬁts expense”in the accompanying consolidated income statement. 22. Taxation 22.1 Tax return The parent company, Enagás, S.A., and the Gasoducto Al-Andalus, S.A., Gasoducto de Extremadura, S.A., Gasoduto Campo Maior-Leiria-Braga, S.A. and Gasoduto Braga-Tuy, S.A. subsidiaries all ﬁle individual tax returns. 22.2 Tax receivable and payable Balances receivable from and payable to public authorities at year-end 2009 and 2008 were as follows: ThouSANDS oF euRoS 2010 2009 Tax receivable: value added tax 19,297 15,579 Income tax 1,710 22,001 Total 21,007 37,580 Taxes payable: Income tax 2,740 1,994 value added tax 70 other 6,997 7,966 Total 9,737 10,030 · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements In 2010 Enagás, S.A.’s current tax came out as a recoverable balance, which is why it had not recognised any payable to the tax authorities in this connection for that year (see Notes 22.3 and 22.7). At year-end 52,832 thousand euros had been paid (22,342 thousand euros in 2009) on account of the ﬁnal income tax expense payable, of which 48,012 thousand euros related to Enagás, S.A. (17,789 thousand euros in 2009), 2,664 thousand euros to Gasoducto Al-Andalus, S.A. (2,450 thousand euros in 2009), and 2,156 thousand euros to Gasoducto de Extremadura, S.A. (2,103 thousand euros in 2009). Likewise, the outstanding balance under Income Taxes relates mainly to the balance due for corporate income tax for 2006 resulting from that year’s Tax Inspection on Enagas, S.A.

At year-end 2009 Enagás, S.A. recognised the balance of current tax recoverable resulting from the 2009 calculation of income tax. The said balance of current tax recoverable was fully utilised in 2010. Within deferred tax assets included under Deductions outstanding and other are deductions of income tax for 2009 of Enagas, SA amounting to 6,342 thousand euros and deductions for investment in new ﬁxed assets of Bahía de Bizkaia Gas, S.L. which amount to 14,319 thousand euros on a pro-rata basis to the shareholding held. The Group does not have any unrecognised deferred tax assets. In 2009 and 2010 Enagás, S.A. availed of the free depreciation tax incentive tied to headcount maintenance, enacted 321 under Law 4/2008 of 23 December 2008. This measure allows unrestricted accelerated depreciation of certain assets put in use by the taxpayer in 2009 and 2010 providing the availing entity’s average headcount remains stable during the 24-month period following the start of the tax period in which the assets acquired are started up, in relation to the average workforce during the preceding 12-month period. As a result of the above, in 2010 Enagás, S.A. recognised a deferred tax liability in the amount of 71,599 euros (equivalent to an asset base of 238,663 thousand euros), corresponding to capital expenditure capitalised in 2010 (165,700 thousand euros equivalent to an asset base of 552,334 thousand euros in 2009). 22.8 Years open to inspection and tax audits In accordance with current legislation, tax returns cannot be considered deﬁnitive until they have been inspected by the tax authorities or the inspection period of four years has prescribed. In 2010 the authorities ﬁnalised a tax inspection in relation to Enagás, S.A.’s income tax ﬁlings for 2004 to 2007 and other taxes paid between 2005 and 2007. As a result of these actions, VAT and Income Tax assessments for the said years were accepted. As far as income tax is concerned, for 2004, 2005 and 2007, the Group appealed against the proposed adjustments by the tax authorities on the diﬀerence of opinion in the booking to income of Capital Grants and accepted the other proposed adjustments (primarily temporary diﬀerences), thus resulting in two assessments (one signed by the company under acceptance and one signed under protest) for each of the earlier. The adjustments related to 2006 show a balance in favour of Enagas, S.A. with the result that only one assessment has been issued by the tax authorities, signed under protest, reflecting all the adjustments (recognition of grants and others). All amounts included in assessments signed under acceptance have been settled in 2010. Regarding assessments signed under protest, settlement assessments were issued on 23 December 2010 conﬁrming the adjustments proposed by the tax authorities in relation to which the relevant appeals will be ﬁled in due course. The assessed amounts, in thousands of euros and broken down between tax due (deductible VAT) and late-payment interest, are as follows: · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements Year VAT charge Interest Total 2004 281 86 367 2005 196 51 247 2006 (1,122) (226) (1,348) 2007 253 34 287 322 At year-end 2010 Enagás, S.A. has open to inspection all applicable tax returns in respect of 2008, 2009 and 2010 while its Spanish and Portuguese subsidiaries have open to inspection taxes for all years of the statutory inspection period. At 31 December 2009 state tax authorities (AEAT) had opened assessments relating to VAT on imports in 2002 and 2004 signed under protest.

Business and geographical segments 26.1 Segmentation criteria Segment information is organised according to the Group’s various business units (primary reporting segment). Secondary information (geographical segments) is not detailed in this note because Enagás, S.A., the group’s parent company, carries out its activities within Spain, where all regions are subject to similar risks and returns, with no characteristics existing among the various regions which could lead to diﬀerent results from those obtained. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements In addition, Enagás, S.A. is by far the biggest contributor of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses to the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Operations involving companies based in Portugal represent less than 10% of the Group’s sales or assets, the limit established by IFRS for the disclosure of secondary segment information. 26.2 Main business segments The business areas described below have been established on the basis of the classiﬁcation included in the Hydrocarbons Law 34/1998 of 7 October and in accordance with the organisational structure of Enagás, S.A., which takes 328 into account the nature of the services and products oﬀered. a) Infrastructure activity (including gas transport, regasification, and storage): • Gas transport: Core activity which consists of the movement of gas through the company’s transport network, composed of gas pipelines for the primary (with maximum design pressure equal to or higher than 60 bars) and secondary (with maximum design pressure of between 60 and 16 bars) transport of gas to distribution points, as owner of most of the Spanish gas transport network. • Regasiﬁcation: The gas is transported from producer countries in methane tankers at 160ºC below zero in liquid form (LNG) and is unloaded at the regasiﬁcation plants, where it is stored in cryptogenic tanks. At these facilities, the temperature of the LNG is raised through a physical process, generally using saltwater vaporisers, transforming it into gas. The natural gas is then injected into gas pipelines and transported throughout the Spanish mainland. • Storage: Enagás, S.A. operates a single underground storage facility, namely the Serrablo facility, located between the towns of Jaca and Sabiñánigo (Huesca). This facility is owned by the company. b) Technical system management In 2010, Enagás, S.A. as technical system manager, continued to carry out the tasks entrusted to it under Royal Decree Laws 6/2000 of 23 June and 949/2001 of 3 August, aimed at guaranteeing the continuity and security of gas supply, and the correct coordination of access, storage, transport and distribution points. c) Liberalised activities These refer to all liberalised activities and transactions related to Group companies. 26.3 Basis and methodology for segment reporting The segment information provided below is based on monthly reports prepared by the Finance Department and generated via a computer programme which breaks down the ﬁnancial statements by activity. The structure of this information is designed as if each business line were an independent business, with its own resources, distributed on the basis of the assets assigned to each line in accordance with an internal system of cost allocation by percentages.

Environmental information 330 Enagás Group is aware of the environmental impact of its business activities. Hence, protecting the environment and biodiversity, combating climate change and contributing to the communities within which it operates, are essential elements in the development of its activities. This line of action consists of a series of environmental management procedures that aim to identify, prevent, minimise, and rectify the environmental impact of the company’s activities and facilities. The Group enacts the most stringent measures available possible in order to respect biodiversity and the natural habitat. The Enagás Group has integrated environmental protection within its political and strategic programs of the Company through the implementation of the Environmental Management System developed and certiﬁed by AENOR and prepared in accordance with the requirements of UNE EN ISO 14001, which ensures compliance with applicable environmental legislation and continual improvement of the environmental record in respect of the LNG storage and regasiﬁcation plants in Barcelona, Cartagena, Huelva, and Bilbao, the Serrablo underground storage facility, the facilities for the basic gas pipeline network, and the technological innovation unit. In 2010, AENOR, the Spanish accreditation company, issued Environmental Management System audit reports with a positive opinion, concluding that the System has a degree of development and maturity that ensures continuous improvement in that area. The Enagás Group goes to continual lengths to identify, classify and minimise the environmental fallout from its activities and installations, assessing risks and promoting eco-eﬃciency, practicing responsible waste and residue management, minimising its carbon footprint and attempting to mitigate any negative contribution to climate change. Furthermore, the Group incorporates environmental criteria into its contractor and supplier dealings and takes environmental issues into consideration when it awards service and product supply contracts. In 2010, these environmental activities entailed total capitalised investment of 38,777 thousand euros (35,088 thousand euros in 2009. Environmental expenses incurred by the company in 2010 totalled 1,198 thousand euros (852 thousand euros in 2009) and are recorded under “Other operating costs”. Potential contingencies, indemnities and other environmental risks to which the Enagás Group is exposed are suﬃciently covered by the third-party liability insurance policies. In 2010, the Group did not receive any grants or revenue relating to environmental activities, except those mentioned below in Note 23.3 detailing greenhouse gas emission rights. 28. Greenhouse gas emission rights Certain Enagás, S.A. and Group company, Bahía de Bizkaia Gas installations fall within the scope of Law 1/2006 of 331 9 March governing trading in greenhouse gas emission rights. In accordance with Order PRE/3420/2007 of 14 November, at its meeting of 2 November 2007, the Spanish cabinet, at the proposal of the Ministries for the Environment, for Finance and for Industry, Tourism and Trade, adopted an agreement approving the individual allocation of greenhouse gas emission rights to plants included in the National Allocation Plan 2008-2012. Accordingly, the total amount of rights deﬁnitively and freely assigned to Enagás, S.A.’s plant was 2,300,895 (442,763 for 2008 and 464,533 for each of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012), and the rights assigned to Bahía Bizkaia Gas, S.L. were 28,005 (5,601 for each year). The installations for which these allocations have been received are: • The Serrablo underground storage facility. • The LNG storage and regasiﬁcation plants at Barcelona, Cartagena, Huelva and Bilbao. • The compression stations in: Algete, Almendralejo, Almodóvar, Bañeras, Córdoba, Crevillente, Seville, Haro, Paterna, Tivissa, Zamora, Zaragoza, and Alcázar de San Juan. The 464,533 rights allocated for 2010 for Enagás, S.A. were valued at 13.3 euros/right, the spot price on the ﬁrst business day of 2010 of RWE Trading GMBH which implies an addition for the year of 6,178 thousand euros. In accordance with the provisions of Article 19 of Act 1/2005 of 9 March, which regulates the trading of greenhouse gases emission rights and provides for the establishment of an emission rights reserve for new facilities and for the expansion of existing facilities, the proposed allocation of allowances for the third group of incumbents to the 2008-2012 plan was announced in the Oﬃcial State Gazette and posted on the website of the Ministry for the Environment, Rural and Marine Aﬀairs on 25 January 2010. The facilities for which these allocations have been received are: • The extended Serrablo underground storage facility. • Increase in capacity at the Haro Compression Station. • Lumbier compression station. The measurement of rights for the third group of incumbents (32,861 rights related to 2009 and 50,431 rights related to 2010) implies additions for the year of 1,180 thousand euros. In a meeting held on 23 June 2008 the Board of Directors of Enagás, S.A. authorised the scaled sale of surplus emission allowances (European Union Allowance, EUAs) for each year between 2008 and 2012 and the swap of emission allowances for Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). In December 2010, 16,750 EUAs were swapped · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements with BBVA for CERs valued at €24.20/CER and 17,000 EUAs were swapped with Gas Natural SDG, S.A. for CERs valued at €23.75/CER. These transactions resulted in the total recognition of CERs amounting to 8,167 thousand euros in 2010. In 2010 the Enagás Group recognised 181,989 greenhouse gas emission rights and 121,525 rights in 2009. At 31 December 2010, total surplus rights in 2010 amounted to 346,559. Valued at 13.3 euros/right (their price on the ﬁrst business day of 2010), this surplus amounted to 4,609 thousand euros, while based on a reference price of 13.87 euros/right (their price on the last business day of 2010), they have a value of 4,806 thousand euros. 332 Likewise, total surplus rights in 2009 amounted to 16,920 rights. Valued at 15.5 euros/right, their price on the ﬁrst business day of 2009, this surplus amounted to 262 thousand euros, while the value of the surplus at 31 December 2009 was 206 thousand euros, based on a reference price of 12.16 euros/right, their price on the last business day of 2009. In the ﬁrst quarter of 2010, Enagás, S.A. submitted its emission reports, veriﬁed by the accredited DOE (AENOR), to the pertinent regional governments, which validated said emissions. In the second quarter of 2010, Enagás, S.A. delivered greenhouse gas emission rights equivalent to the veriﬁed emissions in 2009 for all these installations. In 2010, Enagás, S.A. did not arrange any futures contracts relating to greenhouse gas emission rights nor are there any contingencies related to provisional penalties or measures under the terms established by Law 1/2005. 29.

On 31 December 2009 the Oﬃcial State Gazette (BOE) published Order ITC/3520/2009 from the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade, which establishes the remuneration of regulated activities in the gas industry for 2010, and updated certain aspects relating to the remuneration of regulated activities in the gas industry. Throughout the year the Group continued to enlarge and enhance its regasiﬁcation, transport and storage installations to bring them in line with the outlook for demand going forward. In this respect, the main actions carried out were: • A seventh 150,000 m3 tank at the Barcelona Plant. • A ﬁfth 150,000 m3 tank at the Huelva and Cartagena Plants. • Enlargement of the methane tanker dock at the Cartagena Plant to 250,000 m3. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements • At the end of 2010 the Enagás Group operated 8,981 km of pipeline designed to function at maximum bar pressures of 72 and 80, compared with 8,884 km in December 2009. This increase helps secure continuity of supply and the development of areas that previously had no access to gas supplies. • RMS are included in transportation assets and diﬀerent pipeline positions have been modiﬁed. In addition, the boil-oﬀ system at the Huelva plant was upgraded and the Compression Station in Montesa and the Murcia workplace were built. A total of three new regulating and metering stations were brought into service in the course of the year, taking the total number in operation at year-end to 424. 344 Overall, at the end of 2010, the gas infrastructure of the Enagás Group comprising the basic natural gas grid was as follows: The Barcelona, Huelva and Cartagena regasiﬁcation plants, with total combined LNG storage capacity of 1,887,000 m3 in a total of 17 tanks, nine cistern loaders and emission capacity of 4,650,000 m3(n)/h. The Serrablo (Huesca) underground storage facility, in operation, with maximum injection of 4.4 Mm3/day and maximum output of 6.7 Mm3/day, and the concession for the Yela (Guadalajara) storage facility in accordance with the provisions of Royal Decree 1061 of 20 July 2007.

The following gas pipeline entry points to the gas system: North: the Calahorra-Lac Spain-France pipeline connecting Spain and Portugal with the European gas pipeline networkSouth: The Maghreb-Europe pipeline and connection to the Marismas-Palancares gas ﬁelds in the Guadalquivir valley. II. Main business risks Enagás Group, S.A. is exposed to various risks inherent to the sector, to the market in which it operates and to the activities it performs, which may prevent it from achieving its objectives and executing its strategies successfully. The main risks associated with Enagás’ business activities are classified as follows: 1. Business risk Business risk relates to losses caused by external factors such as regulation, economic growth patterns, competi345 tion levels, demand trends, structural industry factors, etc., as well as to those losses resulting from incorrect decision-making in relation to the company’s business plans and strategies. Within business risk, regulatory risk, which relates to the regulatory framework governing the company’s business activities and also refers to certain aspects of local rates, is particularly prominent. Enagás has implemented measures to control and manage its business risk within acceptable risk levels. To this end it continually monitors risks relating to regulation, the market and the competition. 2. Counterparty risk Counterparty risk relates to the possibility of losses deriving from a counterparty’s failure to comply with its obligations and to uncertainty as to a counterparty’s ability to honour its obligations. In the assessments performed in 2010, Enagás qualiﬁed its credit or counterparty risk as negligible as it only does business with solvent companies, as corroborated by these companies’ external credit ratings. The pertinent counterparty risk management information is disclosed in Note 18 to the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements. 3. Financial risk Financial risk is an assessment of earnings vulnerability to adverse ﬂuctuations in ﬁnancial variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, market liquidity conditions and other market drivers. The ﬁnancial risk management policy is detailed in Note 16 to the consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements. 4. Operational risk Enagás’ day-to-day operations can give rise to direct or indirect losses on account of inadequate internal processes, technological errors, human error or certain external events. Enagás has identiﬁed the following signiﬁcant operational risks: the impact of incidents on infrastructure, equipment and systems, poor quality or interruption of service, fraud and unauthorized activities and operational risk of suppliers and partners. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements The Enagás Group mitigates these risks by making the necessary investments, applying procedures and operation and maintenance programmes and procedures that are underpinned by quality systems and planning for an adequate training and skill management plus an adequate level of insurance coverage. 5. Reputational risk Reputational risk refers to any action, event or circumstance that could have either a harmful or beneﬁcial eﬀect on Enagás’ reputation. 346 During 2010, Enagas, S.A. implemented a reputational risk self-assessment procedure through the application of qualitative measurement techniques. This process contemplates the potential reputational eﬀect that any of the risks listed in the model (operational, business, ﬁnancial and counterparty) may have when their materialisation does not meet the expectations of stakeholders and strictly reputational events arising from the action, interest or opinion of a third party. The Group has identiﬁed as relevant any Reputational Risk that derives from the aftermath of the materialisation of certain risks: Operational, (service interruption, environmental damage and damage to third parties, incidents, and unavailability of certain infrastructures, equipment and systems, errors and delays in external communication, fraud, health, hygiene and safety at work, etc.), regulatory and liquidity risk. Also considered key, because of its relevance, is the management of certain risks strictly deﬁned as reputational, stemming from the action of a third party. III. Use of financial instruments In February 2008, the Board of Directors approved an interest rate hedging policy devised to align the company’s ﬁnancial cost with the target rate structure set under its Strategic Plan. In compliance with this policy, the company entered into a series of interest rate hedges during the year. As a result, at year-end, 70% of total gross debt was hedged against interest rate increases. IV. Outlook The company has earmarked capital expenditure of 650 million euros for 2011 and plans to bring 650 million euros worth of investments online during the year. Management expects a 5% year-on-year growth in net proﬁt over 2010. Likewise, the company has reiterated the growth targets set out under its 2010-2014 Strategic Plan. Cuentas Anuales V. Events after the balance sheet date On 25 January 2011 Portugal’s Competition Regulatory Authority ruled on the condition precedent clause contained in the separation agreements with Portuguese companies described in notes 3 f, 4a) and 9, considering the transaction acceptable and therefore eﬀective in 2011. The Group shall undertake during the ﬁrst quarter of 2011 the registration of that corporate transaction and other related issues to the separation agreements. VI. Research and development 347 Technological innovation initiatives carried out by the Group in 2010 were focused on assessing, developing and testing new gas technologies with the aim of increasing and improving the competitiveness of natural gas in various applications, and in particular on projects of strategic value for the company. The most signiﬁcant activities carried out in 2010 by area were: a) Production (LNG). The company continued to develop new phases of its project for designing a reliability model for plant equipment and installations. Within this area research has been carried out on the in situ generation of nitrogen using semi permeable membranes reducing the consumption of liquid nitrogen acquired externally. Noise maps of the three regasiﬁcation plants have been prepared. b) Transport. Work continued on the project to design, build and start-up an electricity generation plant at the Almendralejo compression station. In addition, technical and ﬁnancial feasibility studies were carried out to gauge the use of micro turbines combined with cogeneration in the supply of power at Enagás, S.A.’s positions. The studies were performed on various network positions or distribution points. Research has been carried out, along with other European companies, on new alternatives for the lining of pipelines. Improvements are being considered in venting installations for transport positions in order to reduce their cost. c) Safety. Work proceeded on various projects and studies related to the analysis of gas pipeline risks and LNG plants. d) Measurement. The company has initiated a procedure to certify the high pressure gas meter calibration bank. Research is being conducted on rolling out an ongoing monitoring system to oversee measurement variables at the most critical positions from the measurement standpoint. Several improvements to the chromatographic techniques and patterns used have been researched and tested. Research is being conducted, along with several European metrology laboratories, on improving the traceability of the technical measure of the amount of energy exchanged during the unloading of LNG carriers. e) Projects of general interest. A number of projects were started up in a bid to optimise management of the basic gas transport grid’s existing and future operations. The Group is also researching the impact of introducing biogas into the transport networks. f) Other matters. The company is carrying out a campaign to contact other energy companies with the aim of spearheading the joint development of R&D activities in order to share costs and exchange information. VII. Transactions with treasury shares The company did not carry out any transactions involving treasury shares during the year. · Annual Report 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements VIII.

The General Shareholders’ Meeting shall decide on the ﬁnal number. 2.The Board of Directors shall be composed of directors that belong to the categories stated below: a) Internal or executive directors: directors who perform senior management functions or are employed by the company or its Group. If a director performs senior management functions and, at the same time, is or represents a signiﬁcant shareholder or one that is represented on the Board of Directors, he/she shall be considered internal or executive for purposes of the present Regulations. No more than 20% of the total number of members of the Board of Directors may belong to this category. b) External directors: These directors shall in turn fall into three categories: b1) Proprietary directors: directors who hold a shareholding interest equal to or greater than that which is considered signiﬁcant under the law or have been appointed on account of their status as shareholders, even if their shareholding is less than said amount, as well as those who represent said shareholders. b2) Independent directors: directors of acknowledged professional prestige are able to contribute their experience and knowledge to corporate governance and, since they do not belong to either of the two preceding categories, meet the conditions set forth under article 9 of the present Regulations. The number of independent directors shall represent at least one third of all directors. b3) Other external directors: external directors who are not proprietary directors and cannot be classiﬁed as independent directors in accordance with article 9 of the present Regulations. In exercising its powers of co-option and proposal to the General Shareholders’Meeting to ﬁll vacancies, the Board of Directors shall endeavour to ensure that, within the composition of the body, independent directors represent a broad majority over executive directors and that among external directors, the relation between proprietary members and independents should match the proportion between the capital represented on the board by proprietary directors and the remainder of the company’s capital. ARTICLE 8. APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS. 1.Directors shall be appointed at the General Shareholders’Meeting or by the Board of Directors in conformity with the provisions contained in the Spanish Companies Act and the company’s Bylaws. 2.Those appointed to directorship must be people who, in addition to meeting the legal and bylaw-stipulated requirements, have acknowledged prestige and the appropriate professional knowledge and experience to perform their tasks eﬃciently. Proposals for the appointment of directors which the Board of Directors submits to the General Shareholders’Me353 eting, as well as appointments adopted by the Board by virtue of its powers of co-option, must be made subject to a report from the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. When the Board of Directors does not agree with the Committee’s recommendations, it must explain its reasons and duly record them in the minutes. 3.The process of ﬁlling board vacancies shall have no implicit bias against women candidates. The company shall make an eﬀort to include women with the target proﬁle among the candidates for Board positions. ARTICLE 9. APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS. Independent directors are deﬁned as directors appointed for their personal and professional qualities who are in a position to perform their duties without being inﬂuenced by any connection with the company, its signiﬁcant shareholders or its management. As such, the following shall in no circumstances qualify as independent directors: a) Past employees or executive directors of Group companies, unless three or ﬁve years have elapsed, respectively, from the end of the employment relationship. b) Those who have received some payment or other form of compensation from the company or its Group on top of their directors' fees, unless the amount involved is not signiﬁcant. Payment shall not include for the purposes of the provisions of this article, dividends or pension top-ups paid to the director in connection with his or her former professional or employment relationship, so long as their settlement is unconditional in nature and the company paying them cannot arbitrarily choose to suspend, modify or revoke their payment, unless the director is in breach of his or her obligations. c) Partners, now or in the past three years, in the external auditor or the ﬁrm responsible for the audit report, during the said period, of Enagás, S.A. or any other within its Group. d) Executive directors or senior oﬃcers of another company where an executive director or senior oﬃcer of Enagás, S.A. is an external director. e) Those having material business dealings with Enagás, S.A. or some other in its Group or who have had such dealings in the preceding year, either on their own account or as the signiﬁcant shareholder, director or senior oﬃcer of a company that has or has had such dealings. Business dealings are considered those with suppliers of goods or services, including ﬁnancial advisory and consultancy services. f ) Signiﬁcant shareholders, executive directors or senior oﬃcers of an entity that receives signiﬁcant donations from Enagás, S.A. or its Group, or has done so in the past three years.

In the case of the family relations set out in letter g), the limitation shall apply not only in connection with the shareholder but also with his or her proprietary directors in the investee company. Proprietary directors disqualiﬁed as such and obliged to resign due to the disposal of shares 354 by the shareholder they represent may only be re-elected as independents once the said shareholder has sold all remaining shares in the company. A director with shares in the company may qualify as independent, provided he or she meets all the conditions stated in this article and the holding in question is not signiﬁcant. ARTICLE 10. TENURE AND CO-OPTION. Directors may hold their post for a period of four years, and may be re-elected.

As a general rule, appropriate rotation of independent directors should be endeavoured.

Independent directors should not stay on as such for a continuous period of more than 12 years. ARTICLE 12. REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS. 1.Directors shall leave their post after the ﬁrst General Shareholders’Meeting following the end of their tenure and in all other cases in accordance with law, the company’s bylaws and the present Regulations. 2.Directors must place their oﬃce at the Board of Directors’ disposal, and tender, if the Board deems this appropriate, their resignation in the following cases: a) When they are involved in any of the legally stipulated circumstances of incompatibility or prohibition. b) When they are in serious breach of their obligations as directors. c) When they may put the interests of the company at risk or harm its name and reputation. If a director is indicted or an order is issued to initiate a trial against him/her for a crime speciﬁed under article 124 of the Spanish Companies Act, the Board shall examine the matter as promptly as possible and, in view of the particular circumstances, decide where or not the director should be called on to resign. d) When the circumstances motivating their appointment as directors no longer exist. e) When independent directors no longer fulﬁl the criteria required under article 9. f ) When the shareholders represented by proprietary directors dispose of their ownership interests. If such shareholders reduce their stakes, thereby losing some of their entitlement to proprietary directors, the latter’s number should be reduced proportionately.
