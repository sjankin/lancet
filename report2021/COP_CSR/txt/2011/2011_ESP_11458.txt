[ Antena 3 has been the media communications Company with the highest dividend and the best performance. ] 2010 marked a turning point for many reasons. On one hand, television advertising investment began to show signs of recovery, which has had a positive impact on our results, and, on the other hand, the Antena 3 Group, which has been implementing various strategies in the last few years in order to face the future challenges, has come out of the economic crisis noticeably stronger, so much so that we are now in the best situation to continue growing. The Antena 3 Group ended 2010 with some extraordinary economic results. Two consecutive years of growth in a negative economic cycle like the one we are currently in gives credence to the strategic approach established years before, when uncertainty and confusion set into the communications sector.
