A. de C. V. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer, S. A. de C. V. and Subsidiaries (the “Financial Group”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, all expressed in millions of Mexican pesos. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Financial Group’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Mexico. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and that they are prepared in conformity with the accounting criteria established by the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission (the “Commission”). An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting criteria used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Note 2 to the financial statements describes the operations of the Financial Group and the effects thereon of current regulatory conditions. Note 4 describes the accounting criteria established by the Commission through the issuance of accounting regulations for such purpose, which the Financial Group uses for the preparation of its financial information. Note 5 indicates the principal differences between the accounting criteria established by the Commission and Mexican Financial Reporting standards, commonly used in the preparation of financial statements for other types of unregulated entities. Furthermore, as explained in Note 4, in August 2009, the Commission issued modifications to the consumer portfolio rating methodology, along with accounting guidance allowing institutions to recognize the initial cumulative effect derived from applying the consumer portfolio rating methodology to credit card transactions as a charge to stockholders’ equity. The Financial Group recognized in 2009 the effect of this change of methodology in stockholders’ equity in the amount of $953 million pesos, net of related deferred taxes. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer, S. A. de C. V. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations, changes in their stockholders’ equity and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with the accounting criteria established by the Commission.

The VaR has been set based on the consideration that, in a day’s transactions, 99% of the time losses will not Derivative transactions exceed the calculated amount. Trading derivative instruments that are issued or acquired by the Treasury of the Financial Group are mainly Also, different types of VaR calculations are performed based on groups defined by risk factor: interest rate VaR, intended to offer hedging solutions and investment alternatives to meet client needs. Furthermore the treasury variable income VaR, volatility VaR (Vega VaR) and exchange rate VaR. of the Financial Group also acquires derivatives for the purpose of managing the risk from transactions with clients. With regard to the structural interest risk, categories are defined for each balance sheet heading based on their financial characteristics and the Economic Value and Financial Margin sensitivities are calculated using the Valuation methods methodology authorized by the Risk Committee. A red flag and limits system is in place for these sensitivities, whereby follow-up is provided each month in the Risk Committee and is presented quarterly to the Board of To determine the portfolio value, two procedures are used depending whether they are instruments listed in Directors. recognized markets or traded in “over-the-counter” markets. In the first case, the price information from the official price supplier is used, and in the second, internal methodologies have been developed with the support With regard to liquidity risk, follow-up and information mechanisms have been established and approved by of independent experts and the Mexican Central Bank itself, using variables provided in turn by the price supplier. the Risk Committee, both for the management of short-term liquidity and of liquidity risk in the balance sheet. There is also a liquidity risk contingency plan, as well as a red flag system for quantitative and qualitative risk with Internal control procedures to manage market risks different levels of risk. The short-term liquidity red flag system monitors the dynamic of the principal financing sources of the Treasury, and its distribution based on maturity deadlines.

Following is a summary of the principal market risk limits: The Assets and Liabilities Committee is the executive body responsible for managing the structural interest risk and liquidity risk. Limit In relation to the measurement of credit risks, the Risk Exposure (Exposure) is determined using two methodologies: VaR (one-day horizon) $ 327 the risk from batch positions is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation, which means that the valuation formulas and risk factors used are consistent with those used for the market risk calculations, and incorporate Annual loss $ 568 the effect of the credit risk mitigation techniques (netting and collateral), and the term effect correctly, because the future value of each position is calculated in each tranche, resulting in a lower consumption of credit risk and Monthly loss $ 227 therefore a better utilization of the limits. Also, for online determination, Potential Risk Factors (FRP’s) are used, which estimate the maximum expected increase for the positive market value of the transaction with a given Control of measures additional to VaR level of confidence. Such FRP’s will be applied based on the type of product, duration, currency and the amount involved. Apart from follow-up on the implicit VaR level in the trading positions of the operating and investment portfolios, the Risk Department establishes a series of limits related to the sensitivity of the positions to minimum movements of the risk factors (sensitivities). A control is applied daily to the use of the interest rate sensitivity limit (Delta).

It also requires that each line item in the statement of changes in stockholders ‘equity shows: a) initial balances previously reported, b) the effects of the retroactive application for each of the affected items in stockholders’ equity, segregating the effects of accounting changes and corrections of errors, and c) the beginning balances retroactively adjusted. NIF C-13, Related Parties.This standard defines a close family member as a related party and considers all persons who qualify as related parties or, excludes those who, despite the family relationship, are not related parties. Bulletin D-5, Leases.Bulletin D-5 removes the obligation to determine the incremental interest rate when the implicit rate is too low; consequently, it establishes that the discount rate to be used by the lessor to determine the present value should be the implicit interest rate of the lease agreement. It eliminates the requirement to use the lower interest rate between the incremental interest rate and the implicit interest rate of the lease agreement to determine the present value of minimum lease payments the lessee may capitalize. It requires using the implicit interest rate of the agreement if it can be easily determined; otherwise, the incremental interest rate should be used. Both the lessor and the lessee should disclose more detailed information on their leasing operations. The Bulletin requires that the result in a sale and leaseback transaction be deferred and amortized over the term of the agreement and not in proportion to the depreciation of the leased asset. The Bulletin also establishes that the gain or loss on the sale and leaseback in an operating lease be recognized in results at the time of sale, provided that the transaction is established at fair value, noting that if the sales price is lower, the result should be recognized immediately in current earnings, unless the loss is offset by future payments that are below the market price, in which case it should be deferred and amortized over the term of the agreement and, if the selling price is higher, the excess should be deferred and amortized over the term of agreement. At the date of issuance of these combined financial statements, the Financial Group has not fully assessed the effects of adopting these new standards on its combined financial information.
