DLH’s Annual Report and CSR Report complement one another, as the former provides an insight into the group’s financial statements while the CSR report provides an overview of non-financial statements material to our business. This year’s CSR Report represents a milestone for DLH’s growing CSR commitments, as it is our first COP report to UN Global Compact. 5 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility 2010 Staying focused Reporting Period and Cycle Performance data is available for some issues within Environment.

Forests help regulate the climate and act as natural carbon sinks by capturing CO2 and reducing its concentration in the atmosphere. Forests house around two-thirds of the world’s plants and animals, and provide for the livelihoods of 1.6 billion people around the world. In spite of these valuable properties, forests have over many decades been threatened by deforestation. Deforestation is a major contributor to global warming, as it accounts for approximately 18% of total CO2 emissions, more than the share of emissions of the global transport sector. Tropical forests, which are the main source of the hardwoods we commercialize, are highly threatened. Deforestation in tropical forests is mainly the result of land clearance for commercial agriculture and it is primarily driven by the increasing demand for food, plant oils and biofuels. Forestry and wood production, if conducted in accordance with local laws, environmental principles and social standards, do not contribute to deforestation. Well managed forests help ensuring the sustainability of flora and fauna over time. On the contrary, illegal and destructive Solar Energy logging activities threaten the preservation of the forests. Therefore, ensuring that the wood we source has been legally harvested constitute one of the major challenges of our business. Our overriding goal is thus to contribute to the conservation of the world’s forest by promoting legality and sustainable forest management. How? We explain so in the following paragraphs. DLH’s Environmental Policy can be found in the CSR Section on our group’s website or downloaded from here. Water Source: Træ Er Miljø www.trae.dk 9 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility 2010 Staying focused Our Suppliers Quick Facts about DLH’s Environmental Policy on Suppliers  All our suppliers must commit to and comply with DLH’s environment policy.  In countries where there is a potential risk of non-compliance with this policy, we implement our Good Supplier Programme (GSP), which serves as a risk-assessment tool. Participation in GSP is a pre-requisite for becoming a DLH Supplier.  In some supply countries, as a result of a country risk assessment, we have taken extra measures to avoid unacceptable wood. In other cases, we have stopped sourcing completely. The current list of countries with special sourcing guidelines includes Brazil, Burma, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa), Liberia, Malaysia (Sarawak), Nigeria, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Sierra Leone.  We will work with our suppliers on knowledge sharing and capacity building. We will use our position as one of the market leaders in certified tropical hardwoods in order to support them in achieving VLO and FSC certification.  DLH will investigate the origin of all wood originating from risk countries. Origin is defined by DLH as the forest in which the wood has been harvested. The Good Supplier Programme In a time where the world’s forests are threatened During 2010, in view of our new corporate strategy by illegal logging and high rates of deforestation, and in line with our commitment to continuously DLH is committed to the responsible sourcing of improve our CSR work, we have revised and wood products.

Quick Facts about DLH’s Environmental Policy on Product  DLH strives to purchase as much certified wood as possible and we want to continue to be the leading supplier of certified tropical hardwood in the future.  Our long term target is to only source sustainable wood and we consider FSC to be the best demonstration for sustainability. The success of this target is dependent on many factors, few of which we have any influence on. We therefore cannot set a fixed deadline for when we will reach this target.  Promote greater uptake of FSC certified products.

Approximately 72% of our sourcing activities are conducted in countries considered of risk. Therefore it is our responsibility to ensure that we do not directly or indirectly benefit from, contribute to, endorse, or in any way facilitate violations.

Corrupt practices have also negative effects on business, as they undermine the rule of law by distorting competition and creating unfair business environments. Advancing anti-corruption policies can be challenging for global companies due to cultural differences. Nonetheless the abuse of entrusted power for private gain is unacceptable in all cultures and societies. In view of this, DLH is committed to work for the advancement of ethical practices and against corrupt practices. We will do so by building awareness through the implementation of our Business Integrity Policy. 16 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility 2010 Staying focused Our Policy On February 2010, DLH formalized and launched a DLH’s position in respect of corruption in all its group-wide Business Integrity Policy.

In 2011, we will continue along the same route and focus on strengthening the programmes and procedures underpinning our Environmental, Social and Human Rights and Business Integrity Policies. As the new corporate strategy focuses on distribution, our CSR strategy will primarily focus on the management of our supply chain. During 2010 we have revised our Good Supplier Programme in order to adjust it to the new strategy and prepare it for the challenges ahead. It is our goal to have the new programme fully operational at the beginning of 2012. The new EU Illegal Timber Regulation, which was formally introduced by the European Council on October 2010 and will become effective at the beginning of 2013, represents an important step forward in the fight against illegally harvested timber and we expect that it will create a level playing field for responsible businesses. We will continue our work together with other industry organizations and NGOs in order to encourage both private and public procurement policies favouring legal and sustainable timber. 18 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility 2010 Staying focused GRI INDEX TABLE This report follows the Global Reporting Initiative Report, as well as their correspondence with the (GRI) guidelines, application level “C”.
