Focus: Reciprocal commitments P. 60_79 MICHELIN 01 A NEW PHAsE OF dyNAMIC GROWTH — With its high-quality products and services, attractive brands, outstanding operating performance and robust balance sheet, Michelin has emerged from the recent recession stronger than ever, thanks to the dedication of its employees, the loyalty of its customers, and the lasting trust of its shareholders. By 2030, the number of vehicles worldwide will increase very significantly and road mobility will have to substantially reduce its energy consumption and its environmental impact. Both of these trends represent powerful growth drivers for Michelin. A pioneer and active promoter of sustainable mobility and one of the few global tiremakers, Michelin has embarked on a new phase of dynamic growth. To meet the challenges that lie ahead, it can leverage such core strengths as its technological leadership, its capacity for innovation and the power of the Michelin Performance and Responsibility process. Throughout, it will remain sharply focused on enhancing mobility and creating value, while respecting the needs of its customers, employees, shareholders and society as a whole.

They are assisted by the Executive Council, comprised of seven executives responsible for Product Lines, Corporate Services and Performance Divisions. LONG-TERM An expanded Executive Council includes the eight regional chief executives and eight senior executives in charge of Procurement, Corporate Development, Research-Development-Process Engineering, New Projects and Sustainable RESPONSIBILITY Development, Quality, Finance, Legal Affairs and Information Systems. Tire manufacturing is a capital-intensive industry in which the pace of technological innovation is relatively slow. It is therefore essential to be able to devise long-term plans and follow them through. In France, incorporating as a partnership limited by shares (SCA) provides a legal framework aligned with this longerterm view. Organized as an SCA since its formation, Compagnie Générale des Etablissements Michelin (CGEM), the Group’s parent company, has found that this partnership model offers three main advantages: – It supports the deployment of long-term strategies by a stable management team whose interests are aligned with Michel Rollier Jean-Dominique Senard Didier Miraton — — — those of shareholders. – It guarantees clear segregation of management and • Born in 1944. •B  orn in 1953. • Born in 1958. supervisory powers. •G  raduate of Institut d’Etudes Politiques (IEP) •G  raduate of HEC business school, MA in Law. •G  raduate of Ponts et Chaussées engineering – It fosters direct ties with each shareholder as all shares must Paris, MA in Law. • F rom 1979 to 1996, held various management school. be registered. • Joined Aussedat-Rey (a member of the positions in finance and operations at Total • Joined Michelin in 1982, spending most of his International Paper Group) in 1971 as then Saint-Gobain. career working in research and innovation in To find out more about the Michelin partnership limited by shares, Financial Controller, going on to become • J oined Pechiney in 1996 as Chief Financial France and the United States, with a focus on please refer to www.michelin.com/corporate and to the 2010 head of an operating unit, then Chief Officer and member of the Executive Truck, Earthmover and Handling Equipment Registration Document, section 4.1.

Its growth, however, poses enormous challenges in the areas of safety, energy, climate, the environment and quality of life, where expectations are high and the sense of urgency is growing. To meet these expectations, Michelin is focusing all of its forward-looking capabilities and innovation on fostering the emergence of sustainable road mobility. THE CHANGING pollution. A well-organized mix of individual and public transportation solutions can help to attenuate these threats, but more will be FACE OF needed. As Michelin Challenge Bibendum has shown, hybrid and electric vehicles make it perfectly possible to achieve zero (or nextto-zero) emissions in city driving by 2030-2040. MOBILITY MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT MOBILITY More than 60% of the world’s oil output is used in transportation. Oil’s growing scarcity and rising cost represents a major geo-strategic challenge, raising doubts about the availability and price of oil-based fuels when the global vehicle fleet will have doubled. Swift action is required to reduce fuel consumption and speed the development of alternate propulsion energy sources. In today’s increasingly open world, freight transport is constantly on SAFER MOBILITY the rise, while people want to travel more often and more safely. The Every year, 1.2 million people are killed and 50 million are injured Like oil, which is also used to make synthetic rubber, energy and number of vehicles on the road could double by 2030, to more than in traffic accidents, which are the leading cause of mortality among non-renewable raw materials are becoming scarcer and more expensive. 1.5 billion. At the same time, the automobile industry is undergoing young people. The statistics are particularly dramatic in developing In 2010, raw material costs represented 27% of Michelin’s net sales. a profound mutation to address the challenges of dwindling fossil nations. If nothing is done, 2.4 million people could be killed in Optimizing their use is essential if these resources are to be conserved fuels, climate change, environmental protection and urbanization accidents each year as from 2030. Governments, international orgaover the long term and if tires are to remain affordably priced. The (more than 60% of the projected 8.2 billion people on the planet in nizations and businesses need to step up their efforts to improve challenge: to meet all these goals without sacrificing tire performance. 2030 will live in cities). The challenge: to develop cleaner, safer, more safety for all road users. fuel-efficient road mobility solutions that make the most of information and communication technologies. CLEANER MOBILITY Road transport accounts for 18% of all fossil-based CO2 emissions caused by human activity, with tires representing 4% from the fuel used to overcome their rolling resistance. This is roughly the equivalent of one full tank out of every five for a car and one out of three for a 97% Oil accounts of the fuel used in transportation, truck. To limit the average increase in global temperatures to 2°C by with biofuels, electricity and 2100 (compared with the pre-industrial period), CO2 emissions will other sources providing have to be halved by 2050 (compared with 2008), even though the the remaining 3% number of vehicles on the road and number of kilometers traveled is expected to double. What’s more, around the world, quality of life in big cities is under attack from the closely inter-related threats of congestion, noise and 21 Created in 1998, Michelin Challenge Bibendum 1.5 billion has become the world’s leading sustainable mobility event. Showcasing the latest over-the-horizon solutions, the Challenge enables carmakers, auto equipment manufacturers, energy companies and government agencies to exchange ideas about the vehicles on the road in 2030 future of mobility and to compare their leading edge technologies. After the 10th event held in Rio de Janeiro in 2010, the 11th Michelin Challenge Bibendum will take place in Berlin in 2011. NETWORKED MOBILITY The time it takes to travel from one point to another mainly depends on traffic, the itinerary, waiting times, the availability of a parking space and the speed of inter-modal connections. With a cell phone or onboard computer, travelers can access information to help them select the best options. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) can also be used to transmit technical data that allow motorists to schedule servicing, drive more safely and use less fuel. Other technologies can be used to develop smart transportation systems that improve traffic flows, thereby reducing fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and local pollution. The challenge: to integrate them more quickly into vehicles and infrastructure. Fostering sustainable mobility will require carmakers to devise new business models suited to the increasing shift towards fleets and rental systems, as well as to the growing demand for ICT-enabled services. Users will have to think in terms of total cost of ownership, accept innovation and learn more flexible, more responsible behaviors. And public authorities will need to listen carefully to citizens and businesses so that solutions meet real needs and are technically and financially feasible. They will also have to be very consistent in their objectives and decisions to encourage the long-term investment that such a transition requires. 3,000 Passenger vehicles 2,500 Commercial vehicles Total 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0 1990 2010 2030 2050 Sources: OECD, IRF, IMF, IHS Global Insight + To find out more about these challenges, please refer to www.challengebibendum.com, Michelin’s sustainable mobility portal, Number of vehicles on the road and www.wbcsd.org.mobility 2030, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development site that presents discussions on sustainable development worldwide, 1990-2050 by representatives from 200 global companies and recommendations in millions of units on sustainable mobility formulated by a working group that included Michelin 22 Challenges and strategic vision –– The shift in demand toward fast-growing countries and the increase in competition in mature markets are impacting manufacturing strategies, while today’s unstable economic environment requires faster, more effective responses than ever before. The growing globalization of purchasing and production calls for heightened vigilance with regard to working conditions and respect for people. That’s why instilling a real culture of diversity provides a significant competitive advantage. SUPPORTING NEW TYPES OF DEMAND DEEPENING MARKET INTIMACY The success of new Michelin tires has always been driven by our ability to listen attentively to the voice of the customers and to understand their needs and usage patterns. Today, this capability is being broadened and deepened to create true intimacy with our markets by systematically developing demonstrators (prototype tires) to encourage input from vehicle manufacturers, motorists, dealers, fleet managers and other stakeholders. During the experimental phases, our research, development and process engineering (RDI) and marketing teams work hand-in-hand with customers to develop the future product range and identify the benefits and value of each proposed innovation. The final offering is aligned as closely as possible with customer needs, Anniversary of the open-pit mine in Shui Zhou, China while enabling the created value to be equitably shared. 2010 MICHELIN 23 Annual and Sustainable Development Report BECOMING MORE COMPETITIVE ASIA Asia has five times as many people as BECOMING MORE RESPONSIVE In mature countries, the number of cars on the road will change only slightly, but government incentives and other factors will impel a shift w Western Europe and the United States combined, yet only 49 cars per 1,000 residents.

LEVERAGING OUR STRENGTHS A SUPERIOR BRAND, WIDELY RECOGNIZED AND CONSTANTLY ENHANCED Our first strength is the MICHELIN brand, which in most major markets ranks among the world’s top tire brands in terms of equity. For the public, the brand is associated with safety, reliability, durability, technology and expertise. This confidence stimulates the buy decision and nurtures customer loyalty, as seen in the brand’s performance in every geography, even in the depths of the recession. Carmakers and consumers can easily see that not all tires are created equal and that some outperform others. While generally priced higher, MICHELIN tires are safer, longer lasting and more fuel efficient, which reduces their environmental impact. Indeed, the savings in use mean that in the end, a MICHELIN tire is the least expensive in the market. We are committed to leveraging the brand’s unique ability to express this performance balance, which is being maintained over time and whose components are being simultaneously improved so as to offer the most competitive total cost of ownership in the market. 2010 MICHELIN 25 Annual and Sustainable Development Report MICHELIN in Germany, Spain, France, Italy, L’Aventure Michelin In the less than two years since L’Aventure Michelin THE LEADER the United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, opened, more than 100,000 visitors have discovered IN PERCEIVED China and the United States. the Michelin innovations that have supported the QUALITY The Michelin brand and the Michelin man development of mobility for the past 120 years. w are recognized and appreciated all around the world. www.laventuremichelin.com.

In addition, 34 plants or businesses reported no lost-time incidents in 2010, of which 13 for the third year in a row. ENSURING HIGH-QUALITY For occupational medical check-ups, Michelin focuses on prevention, with a Guide to Health Service Activities that leverages best practices to define organizational structures, priorities and action plans for each region. WORKING CONDITIONS The Group has been addressing the impact of psychosocial risks in the workplace since 2002. In France, for example, occupational physicians, personnel managers and team managers have received stress management training. A dedicated program has also been deployed to help operators manage their own stress and to identify people in need of assistance. To more effectively prevent this type of risk, an objective assessment method has been designed by the risk prevention unit, the Personnel Department, physicians and ergonomists. Tested in 2010, the method analyzes and quantifies a range of factors, including workloads, deadline-related pressure and the degree of self-management.

In particular, we support agronomic research, as well as measures to improve working and living conditions on small plantations (0.5 to 3 hectares), which account for more than 80% of global production. By deploying the full range of our expertise in technical assistance programs, audits and training courses, we are helping natural rubber farmers and producers around the world. SECURING THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL RUBBER SECURING SUPPLY Tire manufacturing uses 70% of the world’s output of natural rubber, whose exceptional physical properties make it irreplaceable for truck, aircraft, agricultural and earthmover tires. Demand is constantly rising, there are a large number of middlemen and prices are subject to wide fluctuations. In 2010, natural rubber accounted for 34% of Michelin’s raw material purchases in value, with higher prices substantially increasing annual expenditure compared with 2009. Although these increases were passed on in the selling prices of the tires in question, they have impacted operations in a number of areas, making it critically important to improve plantation output and productivity to secure supply. 2010 MICHELIN 85 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEvELOPMENT REPORT RuBBER – 10 million hectares planted.

Michelin is committed to further reducing these impacts by deploying disciplined environmental management systems and major initiatives to train employees and get them involved in the process. IMPROVING THE TIRE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS FOCUSED MANAGEMENT AND AMBITIOUS GOALS To manage the environmental performance of its production plants, Michelin has developed a propriety standard, known as the Michelin sites Environmental Footprint (MEF). Reported quarterly, MEF data are an integral part of the Group’s management indicators, reflecting a commitment to reducing the footprint by 35% in 2015 compared with 2005. By 2010, the improvement since 2005 had already reached 30%, thanks in large part to effective waste management and the deployment of good energy practices. All but two of the production plants have been certified to ISO 14001 standards, as have the natural rubber processing units, the main Technology Center facilities, the headquarters offices in Clermont-Ferrand, the offices in Paris and the supply chain facilities. The Michelin Environmental Management System (MEMS) has been deployed in 98% of R&D facilities, production units and plantations acquired more than five years ago and is now being deployed in the supply chain centers. In the manufacturing facilities, the MEMS is being upgraded to an Environmental and Risk Prevention Manage2010 MICHELIN 87 Annual and Sustainable Development Report 24,000 Tonnes ment System, with 70% of plants transitioned by end-2010 and completion expected before the end of 2011.

In France, the Cholet and Bourges plants also replaced part of their natural gas-fired steam generation systems with biomass-fired boilers. The new 10 MW boiler in Cholet will provide around 33% of the plant’s steam, while the 5.5 MW unit in Bourges will supply nearly 90%. Together, the two units will avoid United The Ballymena plant in Northern Ireland the emission of 19,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

In 2010, a different assessment method was trialed at the same plant in association with an outside organization. These pilot programs are part of a larger commitment to exploring a wide variety of available tools and resources, so that our plants’ potential interactions with surrounding ecosystems can be reassessed, thereby enabling the deployment of more effective preservation techniques.

SUPPORTING ENVIRONMENTALLY GENTLE MOBILITY The environmental performance of tires can vary widely, especially example, was specially developed for the huge rigid-frame dump in terms of fuel efficiency, robustness, longevity and noise. Michelin trucks used at open-pit mines, which are capable of carrying loads devotes substantial resources to simultaneously improving each of of up to 600 tonnes. Their tires weigh up to five tonnes each and these factors, while leading extensive information campaigns to raise need to be checked at least once a day. MEMS enables tire pressure awareness among tirebuyers and public authorities. We also offer and temperature to be monitored remotely and in real time without business users methods for calculating tire performance so that they having to stop the vehicle, making it more likely that the tires will can make informed buying decisions. actually be checked. By the end of 2010, MEMS had been fitted on 450 of these trucks in open-pit mines around the world.

FILL uP Conducted in seven countries in 2010, WITH AIR the “Fill up With Air” campaign revealed that 62% of the cars checked had underw inflated tires and 37% had dangerously low tire pressure. REduCING TIRE NOIsE Tires account for a signification portion of road traffic noise, ranging from at least 30% for a car traveling at 30 kph in second gear to at least 50% when traveling at 50 kph in third gear and around 90% in highway driving at 130 kph. Tire and road surface quality also have a major impact. For a given vehicle traveling at a given speed, for example, noise may vary by five decibels depending on the tire and 3 400 000 TONNES OF CO2 HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE ten decibels depending on the condition of the road. SINCE 1992 THANkS TO THE To reduce noise levels, Michelin is focusing on tire materials, archiMICHELIN gREEN TIRE LINE. tecture and tread design and conducting collaborative research with road surface experts. AssEssING THE IMPACT OF TIRE WEAR PARTICLEs Tire wear results in the release of small particles from both the tire and the road surface. As a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, Michelin is participating with its main competitors in the Tire Industry Project (TIP) to identify tire wear particles and analyze their health and environmental impact. In particular, we have provided the TIP with the same resources for collecting wear particles in real-world conditions that we have developed for our own research in recent years. Although the TIP’s interim report published in mid-2008 noted that these particles have a limited impact, additional studies are underway. + To find out more, please visit www.wbcsd.org 91 –– End-of-life tires pose two problems: processing the more than 17 million tires that are discarded each year and absorbing the estimated 50 million tonnes in legacy stockpiles. In response, Michelin is helping to implement effective, sustainable tire collection and recycling processes in its host countries. The development of these processes is also being driven by two structural factors, the scarcity of raw materials and their high prices.
