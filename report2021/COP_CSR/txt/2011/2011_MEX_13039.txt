Sustainable Transport In 2010 we built more than 100 KMS of bikeways in the housing projects, contributing with this to the use of non-motorized transport in our developments. In 2010 we delivered over 20,000 bicycles to our clients in the purchase of their homes. Water Development Projects Aldana Through the vertical housing project sustainable Aldana, completed in 2010 and developed with the Institute of Government Housing Federal District, systems were implemented for collection and use of rainwater, recicled-water treatment toilets for reuse in toilets, with which are calculated the following savings and volumes of recycled water: • 3840 liters of treated water used in sanitary toilets per housing per month. • 1080 liters of rain water used in toilets and washing facilities per housing per month. 48 FIRST REPORT OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES 2010 CASAS GEO Environmental Sustainability “La Sabana River” dredging In 2010 8,366.06 meters were dredged preventing Rio La Sabana from flooding whilst improving the conditions for environmental health and water quality.

Green City Project In 2010, 150,000 plants were reproduced through the Nursery Green City project, in conjunction with SEMARNAT. The aim of this project was to encourage suppliers to locally plant and implement a program on environmental education about growing and harvesting. This was implemented through development workshops and tree planting. 50 FIRST REPORT OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES 2010 CASAS GEO Environmental Sustainability Ecoefficiencies in our homes Green Mortgages Green Mortgages is a program by INFONAVIT which through an additional amount the beneficiary can obtain ecotechnologies of electricity, water and gas which will increment the savings at home. During 2010, 10,923 houses were built with eco-technology, bringing the total of 20,281 units. • 2.270 MWh per year in the use of 76,461 compact fluorescent lamps, corresponding to a reduction of 1,238 tons of CO2 emissions annually. • 7.325 MWh per year for the application of thermal insulation in 3.725 homes in warm climates and in 4.477homes in template climates, corresponding to a decrease of 3.993 Ton CO2 emissions annually. • 1,825,917 liters of LPG per year, by installing 7,198 solar water heaters corresponding to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 3.086 tons per year. • 865,802 Lts of LP gas per year by installing 3,725 heaters corresponding to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 1,463 tons per year. FIRST REPORT OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES 2010 CASAS GEO 51 Environmental Sustainability Green Block and Concrete In 2010 we participated in the “environmental leadership program” by SEMARNAT, in order to improve competitive value chains in the production of block and concrete. We achieved: 453.44 tons of CO2 reduced per year. Promote a culture of environmental care within the company. Optimize the costs of block to generate a minimum of waste. Bioclimatic Design In 2010 we began a pilot program called Zero Energy through which bioclimatic design elements and cells panels were incorporated in two projects: ·2 houses in Acapulco, Gro. and block of 6 flats in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz With the implementation of these technologies we estimate savings of: ·6,003 and 4,339 kWh / year power energy respectively. · 3 Ton CO2 / year in each home in Acapulco and 2.17 tons CO2 per year in Coatzacoalcos. 52 FIRST REPORT OF SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES 2010 CASAS GEO Environmental Sustainability Eco-efficiencies in our offices To ensure the permanence of natural resources over time is a central task in the development of sustainable communities to achieve this we take the following measures: Savings start at home In 2010 we reduced paper consumption As a measure to reduce emissions of greenhouse by 24%. This was achieved through the gases generated by shipments, in 2010 were implementation of 38 internal campaigns installed 26 rooms for videoconferencing which encouraged the responsible use of where installed. More than 200 sessions were energy and paper. conducted in these rooms. We currently have 842 vehicles for transfer of utility. Approximately 11, 365.000 km are travelled per year by these trucks.
