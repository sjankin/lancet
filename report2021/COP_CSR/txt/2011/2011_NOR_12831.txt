Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors 05 Report from 2010 was characterised by uncommonly cold and dry weather in the Nordic region, as well as increased consumption, resulting in the average the Board system price for 2010 increasing by 52% compared with 2009. The prices of ­Directors peaked in January–February and November–December. Power prices rose in Germany as well, compared with 2009, with an increase of 7%. Power consumption in the Nordic region increased by 3% in 2010. Statkraft has had high uptime for its power plants in 2010 and the hydropower production corresponded to the annual average. Through good management of the plants, Statkraft had available production ­capacity in the peak demand periods. The total production in 2010 was 57.4 TWh. The resource situation at the beginning of 2011 is relatively tight. At the end of 2010, the total ­reservoir water level in the Nordic region was 64.2% of normal, and this is expected to result in lower hydropower production than in 2010.

Focused growth strategy Based on a comprehensive assessment of Statkraft’s expertise, competitive advantages, market opportunities and synergies between activities, a more focused growth strategy than the Group had originally aimed for was adopted in 2010. The emphasis was placed on flexible power production and market operations in the Nordic region and Western Europe; international hydropower, wind power in Norway, Sweden and the UK, district heating and ownership in regional businesses. The capital situation In December, Statkraft’s owner injected NOK 14 billion in new equity. This provides solid support for the company’s strategy, and makes it possible to reinforce the investments in environmentally friendly and flexible power production in Norway and abroad. In January 2011, a new drawing facility of NOK 12 billion was signed. The drawing facility replaces existing facilities totalling NOK 8 billion. Long-term agreements with the power-intensive industry In 2010, Statkraft entered into long-term power agreements with Elkem, Norske Skog and Finnfjord Smelteverk. In total, these contracts involve an annual volume of 3 TWh. At the beginning of 2011, Statkraft has a contract portfolio of about 14 TWh per year in long-term power agreements. These agreements are in addition to leased-out power plants and energy service agreements with the industry. 06 Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors Growth in Norway The Group has a large number of projects underway in Norway. Svein aaser This includes maintenance of existing plants, as well as capacity increases. In total, these investments amounted to NOK 1.9 billion in 2010. Chairman of the Board and Chair of Statkraft’s Compensation Investments are made in the grid activities in Skagerak Energi, as well as in the Group’s ­Committee, Board ­member since 2010 hydropower plants. The largest investments are in connection with Eiriksdal and Makkoren, Nedre Røssåga and Svartisen. Svartisen is expected to start operation in the summer of 2011, while the two others will be commissioned in 2013 and 2017, respectively. In total, these investments will increase the Group’s installed capacity by 259 MW (Statkraft’s share), and the expected added production is 143 GWh per year. Both the district heating business, operated through the Customers segment, and the ­district heating activities in Skagerak Energi are going through a growth phase. Investments are made both in the new district heating grid, upgrading of existing plants and in new ­production capacity. The Customers segment invested a total of NOK 184 million in district heating in Norway and Sweden in 2010, and the largest projects are related to grid development, new capacity in Harstad as well as upgrading existing plants. Construction stage 1 in Harstad will have an installed capacity of 24 MW when completed in January 2012, and expected production will increase from about 10 GWh in 2012 to about 50 GWh in 2015. ­Skagerak Energi invested a total of NOK 69 million in district heating in 2010, and the ­investments relate to plants in Tønsberg, Horten and Skien. When completed, these plants will have an installed capacity totalling 82.5 MW, and the expected production is 173 GWh. In December, Norway and Sweden signed a protocol relating to a common market for green electricity certificates from 2012. The objective is to achieve the development of 26.4 TWh of renewable energy in the period leading up to 2020. To Statkraft, this means that development of wind and hydropower becomes more likely. International growth Over the course of 2010, the Group has consolidated its international position. New plants have come online in Turkey, India and Chile. Overall, the Group’s ­production capacity outside of Norway increased by 180 MW with an expected annual production of about 745 GWh in 2010 (Statkraft’s share). Furthermore, a decision has been made to make major investments both in and outside of Europe, for a total of NOK 10.4 billion and a total installed capacity of 880 MW. Planned maintenance investments come in addition. Cakit, the Group’s first hydropower plant in Turkey, came online in June. The installed capacity is 20 MW and the expected annual production is 95 GWh. In November, a decision was made to invest in a new hydropower plant, Kargi, north-east of Ankara. The power plant, scheduled for completion in late 2013/early 2014, will have an installed capacity of 102 MW and a planned annual production of about 470 GWh. The investment has a ceiling of NOK 2 billion. In the third quarter, the hydropower plants Allain Duhangan in India (192 MW and 43% ­shareholding) and La Higuera in Chile (155 MW and 50% shareholding) came online, and these p ­ rojects will be completed in 2011. A decision has been made to build the Cheves hydropower plant in Peru. The investment has a ceiling of about NOK 2.4 billion. The plant will have an installed capacity of 168 MW and an expected annual production of 834 GWh. ­Completion is expected in late 2013/early 2014. Early in 2010, a decision was made to develop the Em wind farm in Sweden. The farm, with an installed capacity of 9 MW, started trial operations in January 2011. The Group has received several licenses for additional development of wind power in Sweden. Statkraft is involved in several wind power projects in the UK. At the end of 2009, the ­Forewind consortium, where Statkraft owns 25% was awarded the rights to develop the Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors 07 Doggerbank offshore wind farm. The zone, which is the largest in the third licensing round in the UK, has a potential of 9000 MW. The foundation work for the Sheringham Shoal ­offshore wind power project started in June. Statkraft owns 50% and the Group’s share of the investment is about NOK 5 billion. The project will have an installed capacity of 315 MW. In the third quarter a decision was made to expand the gas power production at Knapsack outside of Cologne in Germany. The new plant, which will be ready for carbon capture and storage will have an installed capacity of 430 MW. The power plant is scheduled for completion in July 2013, and the investment has a ceiling of about NOK 3 billion. Statkraft plans no additional capacity growth within gas power in the next few years. In October 2010, Statkraft entered into an agreement with E.ON to acquire the remaining shares (33.3%) in Baltic Cable with accounting effect from 1 January 2011. The 600 MW subsea cable between Sweden and Germany will thus be wholly owned. Sale of activities As part of the focusing of the strategy, Trondheim Energi Nett was sold in the second quarter. Solar power has also been defined as being outside the focus areas and the shares in Ra1, the owner of the Casale solar park in Italy, were sold in December. Health and safety There were no work-related accidents with serious consequences in ­consolidated operations in 2010, but there were five fatal accidents in associated companies; four at plants abroad and one in Norway. All accidents have been investigated and followed up. To achieve the goal of zero work-related accidents, the work to follow up and implement preventive activities in the operations and projects will be strengthened. Furthermore, high safety requirements are also set for partners and suppliers. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 1 The Statkraft Group saw revenues increase significantly in 2010 as a result of higher power prices than in preceding years. The net revenues for 2010 were NOK 23 176 million and the fiscal operating profit was NOK 12 750 million. The increase from 2009 was 36 and 81% respectively. A decline in the value of the E.ON AG shares through 2010 resulted in a write-down of the shares and a recognised unrealised loss of NOK 3625 million in the fourth quarter. This is a consequence of amended accounting procedures, but has not influenced book value and equity. The Group’s profit for 2010 includes a dividend from the investment in E.ON of NOK 974 million. Changed assumptions and improved estimation models for calculation of deferred tax assets related to resource rent carryforwards have resulted in a positive effect on the EBITDA AND NET PROFIT* result for the fourth quarter of about NOK 1400 million. NOK bill. 40 The write-down of the E.ON shareholding is the main reason for the Group’s accounting profit before tax of NOK 12 599 million being on a par with 2009, and the profit after tax 30 of NOK 7451 million showing a reduction of 3% compared with 2009. 20 In the text below, the main emphasis has been on analysing the result from underlying 10 operations.

MARKET AND PRODUCTION Statkraft’s revenues come from spot sales (sale of own production in spot markets), ­contract sales to the industry, financial trading and grid activities, as well as district heating and power sales to end-users. Energy prices, water management and production make up the fundamental basis for Statkraft’s revenues. SYSTEM PRICE, NORD POOL EUR/MWh The power market The majority of Statkraft’s output is generated in the Nordic region and 90 Germany. The Group is also exposed in other European markets as well as markets outside Europe through its subsidiary SN Power. 60 Power prices both in the Nordic region and Germany rose in 2010 compared with 2009. The average system price in the Nordic market was higher in all the months in 2010 compared 30 with the corresponding periods in 2009, and the average system price on Nord Pool was 53.1 EUR/MWh for the year (35.0 EUR/MWh). The average spot price (base) on the European Energy Exchange (EEX) was 44.6 EUR/MWh in 2010 (38.9 EUR/MWh). This corresponds to an 0 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec increase of 52% in the Nordic region and 15% in Germany. Compared with the average prices Price interval 2005–2009 for the years 2005-2009, the price was 43% higher in the Nordic region, while it was 7% lower Average 2005–2009 2009 in Germany. The average gas price at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in the Netherlands was 2010 17.4 EUR/MWh (12.1 EUR/MWh), an increase of 44% from 2009. The demand for power increased by 3% in the Nordic region and 3.7% in N ­ orway from 2009 to 2010. Lower temperatures were the main reason for the increase in consumption. The power-intensive industry in Norway has increased its demand by 6.7% compared with 2009. Total production in Norway was 120.8 TWh, and 7.6 TWh or 6% of the consumption had to SPOT PRICE, EEX be imported to cover demand. In the Nordic region, imports amounted to 19.2 TWh, 5% of EUR/MWh the total consumption of 392.7 TWh. 90 At the end of December, the overall water level in the Nordic region’s reservoirs was 64.2% of normal, corresponding to 45.0 TWh. The water level was 45% of maximum capacity, which 60 is 121.2 TWh. 30 Production Statkraft’s production is determined by capacity, access to resources (hydrological balance and wind) and power optimisation. At the end of 2010, the installed capacity amounted to 16 010 MW, with hydropower contributing 12 969 MW, gas power 2178 MW, wind 0 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec power 304 MW, district heating 544 MW and biopower 16 MW. Price interval 2005–2009 Average 2005–2009 2009 The Group had an energy production totalling 57.4 TWh (57.0 TWh). Hydropower production 2010 declined by 0.1 TWh, while gas power production increased by 0.5 TWh. Wind power production was unchanged. Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors 09 The demand for power varies through the day and through the year, and the power NORDIC RESERVOIR WATER LEVELS ­markets are dependent on capacity that can be adjusted through the variations of the day. ­Statkraft’s large share of flexible production capacity in combination with sound expertise 90% in analysis and production contribute to making the Group able to achieve generally sound water resource management. This is achieved through good power optimisation as well as 60% available power plants in peak demand periods. This expertise is also used in the flexible power production on the Continent. 30% Statkraft’s hydropower production in 2010 has been in line with the annual mean ­production.

Median Source: Nord Pool Net operating revenues amounted to NOK 22 590 million (NOK 19 796 million). Power production is mainly sold in the spot market and under long-term commercial ­industrial contracts. In addition, the Group also delivers power at terms set by the authorities (concessionary and industrial power). The production revenues are optimised through ­financial power trading, and the Group also engages in pure trading activities. Downstream activities are conducted through the Skagerak Energi and Customers segments. UNDERLYING OPERATING REVENUES Figures in NOK mill. 2010 2009 Net physical spot sales, incl. green certificates 18 286 10 464 Concessionary sales at statutory prices 308 384 Sales of electricity to industry at statutory prices 1 535 1 671 Long-term commercial contracts 3 054 2 820 Nordic and Continental dynamic asset management portfolio 308 1 654 Trading and Origination 601 1 622 Distribution grid 1 421 1 485 End-users 5 986 4 285 District heating 634 505 Other/eliminations -4 354 -175 Sales revenues 27 780 24 715 Other operating revenues 1 079 960 Gross operating revenues 28 859 25 675 Energy purchase -4 678 -4 825 Transmission costs -1 595 -1 054 Net operating revenue 22 590 19 796 Long-term agreements with the power-intensive industry Statkraft is a major supplier to the energy-intensive industry, and some of this power has historically been sold at terms stipulated by the authorities. These contracts have successively expired in recent years, and the annual delivered volume will drop from about 7.9 TWh in 2010 to about 1.5 TWh in 2011. As these contracts have expired, the commercial energy-intensive industry contract portfolio has grown. In 2010, three major agreements were entered into with a total annual volume of about 3 TWh. The deliveries are divided into two terms, one from 2011 to 2020 and one from 2011 to 2022. After this, long-term contracts amount to about 14 TWh per year. In line with the expiration of the long-term agreements with statutory prices, Statkraft’s revenues from this volume of power will increase considerably. In 2010, the revenues from the commercial contract portfolio amounted to NOK 3054 million (NOK 2820 million), while the contracts with statutory prices amounted to NOK 1535 million (NOK 1671 million). 10 Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors Concessionary sales at statutory prices Statkraft is required to cede a share of the power ELLEN STENSRUD production to the district where the power is produced, so-called concessionary power. The price for this power corresponds to the average production cost, which is substantially Deputy chair, Board member lower than the power market price. In 2010, the revenues from concessionary sales since 2007 amounted to NOK 308 million (NOK 384 million). Portfolio management To mitigate risk related to uncertainty in future price and production volumes, as well as to increase the long-term revenues, the company hedges production revenues through financial power trading. The share of the production that is hedged changes in line with market development expectations. As power prices are influenced by other commodity prices such as coal, oil, gas and CO2, and as these prices can both be input factors in gas power production (gas and CO2), and price adjustment factors in contracts, Statkraft also engages in financial trading with these commodities. Statkraft’s analysis activities occupy a key position in the trading. The analysis activities are based on collection and processing of hydrological data and other market data. These data are used to estimate market prices and optimise the flexible production. In 2010, the revenues from the hedging transactions through the Nordic and Continental portfolio management amounted to NOK 308 million (NOK 1654 million). The decline is caused by contract losses in the first quarter due to the dry and cold winter and less available nuclear power resulted in very high power prices. Trading and origination Statkraft is also engaged in relatively short-term positioning with financial standard contracts (trading) and trading with structured products and customised agreements for industry and industry and commerce (origination). Realised revenues can vary considerably between periods and years, and must also be seen in the context of ­unrealised changes in the value of energy contracts. In 2010, the realised revenues from trading and origination amounted to NOK 601 million (NOK 1622 million). Downstream activities The downstream activities in Statkraft consist of grid operations, district heating and power sales to end users. The sales revenues from these activities are large, but the margins are low compared with the other activities. Trondheim Energi Nett was sold in the first half of 2010. In total, the revenues from the downstream activities amounted to NOK 8041 million (NOK 6275 million). Revenues from retail electricity sales and district heating rose as a result of higher prices and volumes, but grid revenues fell as a result of the divestment of the activities. Other operating revenues amounted to NOK 1079 million for the year (NOK 960 million). The increase is mainly generated by the increased activity in Skagerak Energi. About half of the revenues come from leasing of power plants. Revenues from fibre, natural gas, electrical entrepreneur and settlement activities in Skagerak Energi, as well as property management in Trondheim are also recognised as other operating revenues. Energy purchases totalled NOK 4674 million (NOK 4825 million). The decline is due to ­Fjordkraft now buying a larger share of the power for the retail customer activities i­nternally in the Group. The somewhat higher costs in connection with purchase of gas for power ­production count in the other direction. Transmission costs associated with the transport of power totalled NOK 1595 million (NOK 1054 million). The increase primarily related higher Nordic power prices. UNDERLYING OPERATING EXPENSES The operating expenses for 2010 were NOK 10 103 million. This is an increase of 3% from 2009. Increasing efficiency in both existing activities and in connection with the integration of new activities is emphasised. The organisation underwent a restructuring in 2010. In Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors 11 ­ ddition, efforts are underway to improve purchasing routines and processes for ­important a input categories. OPERATING EXPENSES Figures in NOK mill. 2010 2009 Salaries and payroll costs 2 726 2 517 Depreciation 2 543 2 635 Property tax and license fees 1 236 1 166 Other operating expenses 3 598 3 530 Operating expenses 10 103 9 849 Salaries and payroll costs rose by NOK 208 million to NOK 2726 million. The increase relates to higher average staffing in the segments Generation and Markets as well as Wind power, general wage growth as well as provisions in connection with the restructuring of the organisation. In recent years, the Group has increased the activities through take-over of assets from E.ON AG, consolidation of SN Power as a subsidiary as well as investments in new capacity in several of the business segments. During the last two years, assets have been written down by NOK 1.7 billion in total. Trondheim Energi Nett was sold with fiscal effect from 30 June 2010. Both write-downs and sale of businesses are important explanations for the reduction in the depreciation in the underlying activities of NOK 92 million from 2009 to NOK 2543 million in 2010. License fees are adjusted in line with the consumer price index, with the first adjustment taking place on 1 January five years after the licence was granted and every fifth year ­thereafter. The calculation basis for property tax on power plants is based on an average of the results for the power plant over the last five years, and high power prices will therefore influence tax costs. Statkraft’s license fees are relatively stable. Property tax has increased in recent years as a result of an increase in the calculation basis. The increase in 2010 is related to SN Power and wind power. In total, property tax and licence fees increased by NOK 69 million to NOK 1236 million. Other operating expenses include external services, materials, costs of power plants operated by third parties as well as compensation payments. In addition come other operating expenses, which include rent, IT expenses, marketing, insurance and travel expenses. In 2010, these expenses amounted to NOK 3598 million in total. The increase of NOK 69 million, UNDERLYING EBITDA corresponding to 2%, primarily relates to increased wind power activities in the UK and NOK mill. increased activity in Skagerak Energi. The increase is somewhat offset by lower costs as 60% 35 000 a result of the sale of Trondheim Energi Nett at the end of the second quarter of 2010. 25 000 40% UNDERLYING EBITDA AND UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULT EBITDA was NOK 15 030 million in 2010 (NOK 12 582 million), and the operating profit was 15 000 NOK 12 487 million (NOK 9947 million).

Outside of Norway, the growth in several cases takes place through ownership in partly-owned 12 Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors companies. The share of profit from the Group’s associated companies amounted to HALVOR NOK 921 million in 2010 (NOK 1033 million). STENSTADVOLD Chair of Statkraft’s The decline is primarily due to reduced contributions from BKK and Agder Energi as a Audit Committee, result of low production and losses in the hedging portfolio. Increased contributions from Board member since 2003 ­associated companies in SN Power, partly due to higher production in the Philippines, have a positive effect. UNDERLYING FINANCIAL ITEMS Net financial items were positive with NOK 452 million in 2010 (negative position of NOK 327 million). Statkraft’s external debt is considerably higher than placements, and this resulted in net interest charges of NOK 1246 million in 2010. Other financial items, mainly dividend from E.ON AG and realised currency gains from overdue debt, were positive, amounting to NOK 1698 million. Financial income amounted to NOK 2060 million (NOK 1911 million). The increase is mainly due to realised currency gains on external debt of NOK 498 million. The realisation of these gains has resulted in a reduction in unrealised changes in the value of financial items. Gains from hedging transactions in EUR and bank deposits denominated in foreign currency were reduced by NOK 371 million compared with 2009. Statkraft places significant amounts in banks and securities at times, particularly ahead of major payments. Counterparties are continually followed up to reduce the risk of losses. The return on placements was NOK 114 million lower so far this year as a result of lower average placed amounts. This is offset by NOK 88 million in increased interest income from lending to associated companies. At the end of the year, Statkraft received NOK 14 billion in the form of a share contribution from the owner. The new capital increased cash and cash equivalents to NOK 20 billion at the end of 2010. Financial expenses amounted to NOK 1607 million (NOK 2238 million). Interest charges fell by NOK 289 million, as a result of both lower market interest rates and lower average debt. Other financial expenses were NOK 318 million lower, and can mainly be explained by loss recognition for loans and guarantees in 2009. The Group has four loan portfolios in NOK, SEK, EUR and USD, respectively. The portfolios are exposed to both variable and fixed interest rates, with exposure to variable interest rates amounting to 64%. The average current interest rates in 2010 for loans denoted in NOK were 4.2%, in SEK 1.3%, in EUR 3.5% and in USD 4.1%. Debt in USD is in relation to project financing in SN Power. Statkraft has entered into agreements with its financial counterparties for the settlement of interest and currency rate changes in value, limiting counterparty risk resulting from derivative contracts to one week’s changes in value (cash collateral).

Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors 13 Write-down of the E.ON AG shares Statkraft owns 83 415 119 shares in E.ON AG, c­ orre­sponding to a shareholding of 4.17%. At year-end, the shareholding was entered BERIT RØDSETH in the balance sheet with market value of NOK 14 862 million. The market price has gone Member of from EUR 28.44 per share when the shares were transferred to Statkraft at the end of 2008 Statkraft’s Audit to EUR 22.94 per share at the end of 2010. In the same period, the currency exchange rate ­Committee, Board member for EUR to NOK has gone from 9.75 to 7.80. The currency loss has been recognised on the since 2007 income statement continuously as part of currency hedging against loans denominated in EUR. The part of the unrealised loss that can be attributed to a lower market price amounts to NOK 3625 million. As the loss of value has continued over a longer period of time, the result for the fourth quarter was charged with NOK 3625 million under financial items. Previously, the changes in value for the shares have been recognised against comprehensive income. As the loss is charged to the result, earlier charges against comprehensive income will be reversed. This means that the loss recognition has no effect on the equity. Unrealised changes in value on energy contracts Unrealised changes in value on energy contracts were NOK 193 million (negative position of NOK -2813 million). The Group’s contracts are indexed against various commodities, currencies and indices. In 2010, higher gas prices and a stronger US dollar were the primary influences on these unrealised items. Unrealised changes in value in associated companies and joint ventures Unrealised changes in value in associated companies and joint ventures amounted to NOK 235 million NOK (NOK 547 million). Higher power prices have influenced hedging contracts in BKK and Agder Energi negatively, while associated companies in Germany have increased their ­unrealised values in 2010. Unrealised changes in value of financial items Unrealised changes in value for financial items amounted to NOK -1369 million, and relate primarily to the following items in addition to the change resulting from the write-down of the E.ON AG shares mentioned above. Debt in SEK and EUR resulted in a total unrealised currency gain of NOK 267 million. The NOK became stronger in relation to EUR, which increased the unrealised currency gains seen in isolation. A substantial part of the debt in SEK was realised and rolled over. This reduced unrealised currency gains while the weaker NOK against SEK resulted in an unrealised currency loss. Statkraft uses currency hedging contracts to ensure that future agreed cash flows, mainly related to power sales in EUR, are hedged. Of the unrealised changes in value for financial items, currency hedging contracts and short currency positions amounted to NOK 253 million, mainly due to the stronger NOK against EUR. Currency gains on internal loans amounted to NOK 3373 million of the unrealised changes in value for financial items. The gain arose mainly as a result of a stronger NOK and SEK against EUR. The gain has no cash effect and will have a counterpart entry in comprehensive income under translation differences. Unrealised changes in value related to currency for the E.ON AG shares are shown as ­currency losses under financial items and amounted to NOK 1193 million. Currency effects are recognised in the income statement as part of the unrealised changes in value in order to reduce the effect of currency changes on internal and external loans in EUR. Changes in value for interest rate and inflation derivatives amounted to a gain of NOK 31 ­million. 14 Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors Non-recurring items Non-recurring items excluded from the calculation of the underlying silvija Seres profit amount to NOK -321 million in 2010 (NOK -1878 million). Member of Statkraft’s Compensation In 2010, Statkraft recorded a gain on the sale of shares in Trondheim Energi Nett of NOK 393 Committee, million. The gain has been classified as other operating revenues in the accounts. Board member since 2010 The pension reform for public schemes in Norway changes the rules for adjustment of retirement pension. This entails a reduction in the Group’s pension liabilities. The reform has retroactive effect, and the effect of this appears as a reduction in salaries and payroll costs of NOK 339 million for consolidated operations and NOK 121 million for associated companies. Non-recurring items include write-downs in consolidated and associated activities totalling NOK 1173 million. The write-downs are mainly related to gas power (NOK 589 million), wind power (NOK 114 million) and SN Power (NOK 459 million). The gas-fired power plant Robert Frank in Germany and the shares in Naturkraft (gas-fired power plant at Kårstø) have been written down due to lower expected earnings (spark spread). The wind farms at Hitra and Kjøllefjord have been written down as a result of lower production and higher operating expenses than previously anticipated. SN Power has written down a project portfolio in Chile on the basis of a market-related assessment. In addition, cost overruns and delayed start-up of the development project Allain Duhangan in India (43% shareholding) and La Confluencia in Chile (50% shareholding) contributed to a permanent impairment, while the value for Malana in India (49% shareholding) has previously been impaired as a result of new information relating to Indian tax rules. Tax recognised as income related to estimated negative resource rent tax carryforwards amounted to NOK 250 million in 2009, while the estimate change for 2010 was about NOK 1900 million. The recognition as income is a combination of changed assumptions during the course of the year, as well as improved methods for estimation of deferred tax assets. The estimated effect of the changed assumptions and improved estimation models is about NOK 1400 million. TAXES Accounting tax expenses increased by NOK 376 million from 2009 to 2010, and amounted to NOK 5148 million. The effective tax rate in 2010 was 40.9% (38.2%). The ­ordinary payable tax increased by about NOK 1050 million, mainly due to an increase in unrealised losses on shares and financial assets without tax-related deduction. High power prices have furthermore resulted in an increase in resource rent tax payable of NOK 709 million. The reduction in deferred tax of NOK 1381 million is mainly due to recognition of estimated deferred tax assets related to negative resource rent tax carryforwards as income.

The 2011 ­strategic platform aims for growth in: Employee-elected Board member, π European flexible power production and market operations ­member of Statkraft’s π International hydropower Audit Committee, Board member π Wind power in Norway, Sweden and the UK since 2002 π District heating and small-Scale hydro in Norway In addition to these areas, Statkraft will continue to support a sound development in the regional companies in Norway where Statkraft has ownership interests. Furthermore, the innovation strategy has been amended to strengthen Statkraft in the growth areas. Statkraft’s strategy is based on an evaluation of the market’s attractiveness and Statkraft’s ability to create value. In December, Statkraft received NOK 14 billion in new equity from the owner to implement the Group’s strategy. The premises for the strategy are that business development, construction and operation of power plants must be based on high health, safety and environment standards. The planned activities in emerging markets outside of Europe contribute to increased challenges in connection with corruption, health, safety and the environment as well as upholding Statkraft’s corporate social responsibilities. These challenges must be handled in a satis­ factory manner in order to create value. European flexible power production and market operations Statkraft’s ambition in ­European flexible power production is to maintain the position as Europe’s largest producer of hydropower and be an important supplier of flexible power production to Europe. On the basis of fundamental market analysis and a well-defined business model, Statkraft seeks to exploit the power plants’ flexibility to produce electricity when commercially attractive and the need for power is greatest. Statkraft will prioritise modernisation and expansion, as well as further development of expertise, models and systems to ensure ­efficient operations and increased creation of value from existing hydro and gas-fired power plants. Statkraft furthermore seeks to increase profitability and reduce risk through the Group’s market operations. Statkraft will consider portfolio optimisation and selective investments in hydropower in north-western Europe. The Group will prioritise hydropower in the Nordic region, Germany, France and the UK. The market outlook for north-western Europe is uncertain due to ­expectations of low or possibly negative growth in demand and considerable increase in renewable energy production. Statkraft will therefore emphasise understanding of the ­consequences for the future power balance, power prices and the value of flexible power production. International hydropower Statkraft has a global strategy for development of hydropower with ambitions to strengthen the Group’s position in attractive emerging markets. Statkraft invests in international hydropower both directly and through the subsidiary SN Power. The strategy for international hydropower is based on expected economic growth in selected markets, increased need for clean energy as well as a large potential for hydropower. ­Statkraft and SN Power have sound expertise related to development and production of hydropower which can form the basis for creation of value in new markets. Statkraft is developing hydropower production in the Turkish market, and is considering solutions for the development of the Devoll project in Albania together with the Austrian company EVN. SN Power prioritises development of hydropower in Peru, Chile, Nepal, India and the Philippines, where company already owns production capacity. SN Power is also Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors 19 seeking investment opportunities in Vietnam and Brazil. SN Power AfriCA, a subsidiary of SN Power, is considering investment opportunities in southern Africa and in Central America. SN Power normally seeks to invest in partnership with local interests or international investors. Wind power Statkraft’s ambition is to establish a position among the most profitable and cost-effective players in the industry within onshore wind power in Norway and Sweden. As regards offshore wind power in the UK, Statkraft’s ambition is to develop a future ­attractive position. The wind power market in Europe is considered to be attractive due to the rising need for new renewable energy production in Europe. Public subsidy schemes and reduced costs for wind power are necessary to achieve satisfactory profitability. Statkraft has a large project portfolio in Norway and Sweden. Statkraft will prioritise the work to secure binding licenses, establish cost-effective solutions within development, operation and maintenance and strengthen the wind analysis expertise. In the UK, Statkraft’s goal is to consolidate the existing land-based project portfolio. Within offshore wind power, Statkraft owns Sheringham Shoal 50-50 with Statoil. The ­project is scheduled for completion in 2012. The Group also develops projects on the Dogger Bank in the UK up to the license stage in cooperation with partners. The investment decisions for the projects on the Dogger Bank will be made at a later point in time. District heating and small-scale hydro Statkraft’s ambition is to further develop profitability, strengthen its position as one of the two largest district heating players in Norway and realise growth also outside existing license areas. In Sweden, Statkraft plans further development of existing plants, but has no ambitions regarding growth in new areas. Statkraft’s ambition within small-scale hydropower production in Norway is to grow through industrial ownership in Småkraft AS. Småkraft invests in and builds small-scale hydropower plants in partnership with local landowners. Småkraft AS is owned by Statkraft (40%), Skagerak Energi (20%), BKK (20%) and Agder Energi (20%). CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Statkraft’s corporate governance will contribute to sustainable and lasting value creation in the Group. Efficient and transparent management and control of the business will form the basis for creating long-term values for the owner, employees, other stakeholders and society in general, and will help inspire confidence among stakeholders through predicta­ bility and credibility. Open and accessible communication will ensure that the company has a good relationship with society in general and the stakeholders who are affected by the company’s activities in particular. Statkraft applies the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (NUES) within the framework established by the company’s organisation and ownership. Non-compliances are attributable to the fact that Statkraft is not a publicly listed company and that the ­Norwegian state is the sole owner of the company, as well as restrictions contained in the Articles of Association. The non-compliances relate to non-discrimination of shareholders, tradability of shares, dividends, the annual general meeting, the election committee and the corporate assembly. Statkraft also applies the Norwegian State’s ten principles for good ownership. Corporate governance is described in detail in the chapter “Corporate governance”. THE WORK OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS In connection with the board elections in 2010, both representatives appointed by the owner and directors elected by the employees were replaced. Svein Aaser took over as Chair after 20 Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors Arvid Grundekjøn on 30 June 2010. The Board of Directors now consists of Chair Svein Aaser, Deputy Chair Ellen Stensrud and Directors Halvor Stenstadvold, Berit Rødseth, Inge Ryan, Silvija Seres, Odd Vanvik, Lena Halvari and Thorbjørn Holøs. The Board of Statkraft AS is also the Board of Statkraft SF. The Board held 13 Board meetings through the year. In addition to monitoring the daily ­operations, a significant part of the work of the Board in 2010 related to Statkraft’s financial platform and adaptation of the Group’s strategy. The Board has appointed an Audit Committee consisting of four of the Directors. The Audit Committee has held six meetings during the course of the year. The Board has also appointed a Compensation Committee consisting of the Chair of the Board and two of the Board’s other members. The Compensation Committee has held one meeting during the course of the year. RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL The key risk factors for Statkraft relate to market operations, financial management, project ­execution, operating activities and framework conditions. The international growth con­ tributes to increased project risk, both in the concept and implementation phases. Handling of risk is important for value creation and is an integrated part of all business activities. This is followed up in the respective units through risk monitoring procedures and risk mitigation measures. Statkraft has a central investment committee that assesses the risk, profitability and strategic adaptations related to individual investments and across the project portfolio. In addition, the mandate, expertise and capacity of the Group risk function has been strengthened in 2010. There are substantial volume and price risks related to power production and trading. In the Nordic power market, precipitation levels and winter temperatures are of great significance and cause considerable fluctuations in both prices and output volumes. In addition, power prices are influenced by the price of gas, coal and oil, as well as carbon quota prices. In addition, gas power production is directly exposed to both gas, oil and CO2. Statkraft ­manages this market risk by trading in physical and financial instruments in several markets. Closer integration of the energy markets is of major importance for the company’s business models and risk management. Statkraft consequently attaches significant importance to seeing the various markets in context of each other. Internal authorisations and limits have been established for all trading, and these are subject to continuous follow-up. The central treasury department coordinates and manages the financial risk associated with foreign currencies, interest rates and liquidity, including refinancing and new borrowing. The most important instruments of this management are forward currency contracts, ­interest swap agreements and forward interest agreements. Currency and interest rate risk are ­regulated by means of mandates. Limits have also been established for liquidity and counterparty risk. Both market risk and the other financial risk, as well as exposure connected to the issued mandates, are followed up by independent middle office functions, and are regularly reported to Group management and the board. All processes in the value chain are exposed to operational risk, but the risk is greatest within project execution and operations. The operational risk is mainly handled by means of detailed procedures, emergency preparedness plans and insurance. A comprehensive system for mapping, registering and reporting hazardous conditions, undesirable incidents and injuries has also been established, and these are analysed on an ongoing basis. All ­projects above a certain size are subjected to continuous risk assessments where the p ­ robability and consequences are evaluated. Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors 21 Other risk is primarily related to general framework conditions and political decisions. ­Climate changes can present both threats and opportunities, and are of importance for all ODD VANVIK the risks described above. Statkraft is therefore concerned with the potential consequences Employee-elected of climate change. Board member, member of Statkraft’s ­Compensation Internal control is a key element in sound risk management, and Statkraft is focusing on ­Committee, Board ­further development of internal control. Statkraft has a system for internal control over ­member since 1993 financial reporting which aims to contribute to reliable financial reporting. Statkraft has a corporate audit function to assist the board and management in making an independent and impartial evaluation of whether the Group’s key risks and internal control procedures are sufficiently managed and supervised. Corporate Audit shall also contribute to ongoing quality improvement in internal management and control systems. A management system has been established that gathers all governing documents and facilitates a more efficient, systematic and uniform management of the Group with sufficient degree of formalisation, documentation and compliance. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Ethical business operations and anti-corruption work The Group’s revised business ­principles (”Statkraft’s code of conduct”) was implemented in the first quarter of 2010. The code of conduct applies to all employees and all companies in the Statkraft Group, and our business partners are expected to have standards in accordance with Statkraft’s code of conduct. Renewed ethical requirements especially intended for the Group’s ­suppliers are under preparation. Training and dilemma training for both managers and employees form a key component of the ethics work in Statkraft. To support this, a new anti-corruption manual and e-learning programs were developed in 2010, ready for introduction in 2011. Statkraft encourages employees to raise ethical concerns. The Group audit is an independent notification channel. Two cases were registered in 2010. Both cases were handled in line with applicable guidelines and have now been closed. Statkraft continues to express its support for the UN’s Global Compact and renews the company’s commitment to follow up the initiative and its ten principles. Environmental impact No serious environmental incidents were registered in 2010. However, 92 (118) less serious environmental incidents were registered, of which one with high environ­ mental risk. Most of these were in connection with minor and short-term breaches of the river management regulations and minor chemicals spills, and had little or no environmental impact. Statkraft’s emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to 1 693 400 tonnes of CO2 equivalents (1 600 100 tonnes) in 2010, of which 93% from the gas power activities. The Group buys ­emission quotas in the voluntary CO2 quota market to neutralise greenhouse gas emissions of from fuel consumption, business travel and accidental emissions. In 2010, 88% of the Group’s power and district heating production was based on renewable energy sources. In 2010, Statkraft consumed 737 GWh of electricity (1093 GWh). A major energy efficiency project was initiated at Statkraft’s Norwegian plants managed by the Generation and markets segment in 2010. The objective is an energy consumption reduction of 35% by 2014. The goal will be reached through installation of management systems, monitoring of operations and energy management, as well as assessment of alternative solutions for equipment and maintenance. All electricity consumed in the Group has been certified as renewable in accordance with RECS (Renewable Energy Certificate System). 22 Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors Statkraft generated 84 300 tonnes of hazardous waste that was treated in accordance with applicable regulations. The bulk of this (99.5%) are residual products from the district heating plant in Trondheim and the biopower plants in Germany. In 2010, Statkraft developed a method to document the company’s impact on biodiversity in the catchment areas in Norway. The method uses publicly available databases regarding protected areas, important nature types and existence of species combined with local knowledge and technical expertise. A pilot project has been conducted in the Nore catchment area. The result from the pilot project shows that the conflict potential between ­Statkraft’s activities and biodiversity is moderate or low. Documentation of potential ­ecological conflicts in all Norwegian catchment areas is planned. Employees At the end of 2010, the Group had 3301 full-time equivalents (3378). This is a reduction of 2.3% compared with 2009.The Group has employees in 20 countries, and 28% of the staff work outside Norway. The average seniority in Statkraft is 8.5 years. In 2010, the staff turnover rate in Statkraft was 3.9%. The Group’s trainee programme was continued in 2010 with ten new trainees. Statkraft strives to attain a diverse working environment and promotes equal treatment in its recruitment and HR policy. Employees and others involved in Statkraft’s activities must be chosen and treated in a manner which does not discriminate on the basis of gender, skin colour, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, nationality, social or ethnic origin, political conviction, trade union membership or other factors. Statkraft strives to attain an even gender distribution in the Group, and more women in managerial positions. In 2010, 23% of the Group’s employees were women (22%) and the LOST-TIME AND TOTAL RECORDABLE INJURIES ­percentage of women in managerial positions was 22 (23%). 44% of the board members FOR EMPLOYEES AND SUPPLIERS were women. The board follows up the work to achieve an even gender balance, including LTI/TRI 20 compliance with statutory requirements relating to gender distribution in the boards of ­subsidiaries and companies where Statkraft has major ownership interests. 15 Health and safety There were no working accidents with serious consequences in consoli10 dated operations in 2010, but a total of five fatal accidents were recorded in associated ­companies. In addition, there were two fatal accidents in associated activities in early 2011. 5 In 2010, one contractor employee died at the Allain Duhangan project (India) and four people 0 2007 2008 2009 2010 from the local community died near the Group’s plants (three in Laos and one in Norway). LTI – employees The contractor employee at the Allain Duhangan project died after falling from a mast, while TRI – employees LTI – suppliers the other four fatal accidents took place in connection with free time activities and traffic TRI – suppliers near the plants. At the beginning of 2011, one contractor employee died at THPC (Laos) and one employee at the Istad Group (Norway). The fatal accident at THPC took place in connection with finishing work on the main intake tunnel, while the employee in the Istad Group died after a tracked vehicle overturned. Several measures have been implemented following the accidents, for example increased focus on applicable guidelines for working at heights and use of safety equipment. Renewed information has also been given to local communities regarding risks and hazards in connection with Statkraft’s plants. The indicator for lost-time injuries, H1, was 3.4 (3.8) among the Group’s employees in 2010, while the indicator for all types of injuries, H2, was 6.8 (8.4). For contractors, H1 was 13.6 and H2 was 16.4 in 2010. In total, 81 injuries were recorded, of which 52 lost-time ­injuries, among the Group’s employees and contractors. The operations have seen a positive development Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors 23 in recent years as regards health and safety, but the Group’s development projects still show unsatisfactory results in this area. Statkraft emphasises that the same goals and lena halvari requirements for health and safety, including physically safeguarding assets and people, Employee-elected apply everywhere and in all activities involving Statkraft. Clear requirements and close folBoard member, Board low-up in all project phases are essential to achieving safe and sound w ­ orkplaces and good ­member since 2010 results. Statkraft works to achieve increased understanding for and compliance with safety ­requirements in all development projects it is involved in. The health and safety work is ­followed up directly in the projects and through the respective boards of directors. The Group emphasises learning from injuries and damage, near-misses and hazardous ­conditions, and using this knowledge to improve. In 2010, 4853 (5597) hazardous conditions and 114 near-misses were recorded. 2010 saw special emphasis on the work to develop and implement clear guidelines for investigation of serious incidents. In addition, a recently developed non-compliance system was applied to record, analyse and follow up incidents. Learning from incidents is a key aspect of the system. Absence due to illness in Statkraft was 3.4% in 2010 (3.3%). The company has a target of absence due to illness of less than 4%. All Norwegian companies in the Group have entered into Inclusive workplace (IA) agreements, with active follow-up of absence and close ­cooperation with the company health service. Role in society Statkraft is working to develop new production capacity which can contribute to long-term, reliable energy supply and wants to be a positive contributor in the societies where ­Statkraft operates. Statkraft strives to achieve an open and constructive dialogue with all stake­ holders and is working to develop the company in a manner which increases the value for the owner and the local communities and countries in which Statkraft operates. Identification and active follow-up of the company’s impact in local communities is a key aspect of all activities. Statkraft’s economic value creation amounted to NOK 17 472 million (NOK 19 743 million) in 2010. Of this, NOK 5973 million (NOK 3740 million) was returned to the owner as dividend and group contribution, while taxes and fees to the state and municipalities amounted to NOK 6679 million (NOK 6202 million). Statkraft’s total investments in 2010 amounted to NOK 3740 million (NOK 4907 million) (excluding loans given), of which NOK 1999 million (NOK 2355 million) in Norway and NOK 1741 million (NOK 2552 million) abroad. Of these ­investments, 50% were in connection with expansion of production capacity. Innovation is part of Statkraft’s contribution to society. The Group’s innovation investments are channelled through three programs within hydropower, wind power and bio-energy. Statkraft also focuses on technology monitoring and some long-term innovation projects such as osmotic power. Through the Statkraft Fund, the Group allocated NOK 5 million in 2010 to organisations and projects that in various ways focus on the connections between energy, climate and sustainable development. ALLOCATION OF THE NET PROFIT FOR THE YEAR The board of Statkraft SF proposes a dividend of NOK 5973 million, corresponding to 75% of the dividend basis. The dividend basis is calculated as group profit to Statkraft SF after tax and non-controlling interests, adjusted for unrealised gains and losses and further adjusted for a non-recurring effect of NOK 1430 million in connection with deferred tax assets. The dividend will be disbursed from Statkraft SF, and in order to provide Statkraft SF with 24 Statkraft annual report 2010 Report from the Board of Directors s­ ufficient a ­ bility to disburse dividend, the board proposes the following allocation of the annual profit in Statkraft AS: Amounts in NOK million Net profit in Statkraft AS’ company accounts 5 809 Allocation of profit for the year: Group contribution from Statkraft AS to Statkraft SF 7 432 Transferred from other equity 1 623 The parent company’s distributable equity was NOK 14 958 million at year-end. PROSPECTS Strategic focus In December, Statkraft’s owner injected NOK 14 billion in new equity. This provides solid support for the company’s strategy, and makes it possible to carry out ­several investment projects within environmentally friendly and flexible power production in Norway, Europe, Asia and South America. Statkraft has investment plans totalling NOK 70-80 billion in the period 2011-2015. At the end of 2010, Statkraft had adopted binding investments totalling NOK 14.5 billion for the period 2011-2013, excluding Norfund’s option to sell the shares in SN Power to Statkraft. Statkraft aims to maintain the company’s credit rating, and has substantial flexibility as regards the investment level in this period. Expectations for the year’s operations At the beginning of 2011, the resource situation in the Nordic region was relatively tight. The Group therefore expects lower hydropower ­production in 2011 compared with 2010. Forward prices for 2011 indicate continued relatively high prices in the Nordic region, and the prices in Germany are expected to rise further ­compared with 2010.

The aim is to achieve a flexible and dynamic organisation where new priorities and growth areas can be highlighted and achieve visibility as separate business units with clear performance targets. At the same time, the organisation model creates a foundation for an effective management and control structure. The Group has adopted a new segment structure from 1 January 2011. Generation and Markets The Generation and Markets segment is the largest segment, responsible for the operation and maintenance of hydropower plants and gas power plants in Europe, as well as physical and financial trading in energy and energyrelated products in Europe. Wind Power Wind Power is responsible for developing, constructing, operating and following up the ownership of onshore and offshore wind farms in Norway and the rest of Europe, as well as developing and commercialising offshore wind power technology. Emerging Markets Emerging Markets is responsible for managing and further developing ownership positions outside Europe, and mainly comprises the investment in SN Power. In addition, Theun Hinboun Power Company (THPC) is managed on behalf of Statkraft SF. THPC is not included in the segment’s financial figures. Skagerak Energi Activities in Skagerak Energi are followed up as a joint activity by management and reported as a separate segment. This segment focuses on the generation and sale of power and district heating, and distribution grid activities. Other activities involve fibre, natural gas distribution and electrical contractor and settlement activities. Customers At the end of 2010, the customers segment consisted of district heating. The grid activities were sold and the power sales activities transferred to the industrial ownership segment in 2010. Industrial ownership Industrial Ownership is responsible for managing and further developing Norwegian shareholdings where Statkraft has industrial ambitions. The segment comprises Fjordkraft, Bergenshalvøens Kommunale Kraftselskap (BKK) and Agder Energi. Other Other includes the business units Southeast Europe Hydro, Solar Power, Small-Scale Hydro, Innovation and Growth, along with the shareholding in E.ON AG, group functions and eliminations.

The fundamental basis for Statkraft's revenues comprises power prices, water management and production. Statkraft optimises its hydropower generation based on an assessment of the value of available water in relation to actual and expected future spot prices. This is done irrespective of contracts entered into. In the event that Statkraft has physical contractual obligations to supply power that deviate from actual output, the difference is either bought or sold on the spot market. Necessary spot purchases are recorded as a correction to power sales. Physical and financial contracts are used to hedge underlying production in the form of purchase and sales positions. Sales positions are taken to hedge the price of a specific part of the planned future output. Buying positions are taken to adjust the hedging level if the assumptions change and Statkraft is considered to have a too highly hedged position. All contracts are recognised as adjustments to the underlying revenue from production based on the margin between the contract price and the spot price (system price for financial contracts).

These contracts are entered into at prices below the market level. Statutory-priced industrial contracts mostly run until 2011. As the statutory-priced contracts expire, these will mainly be replaced by commercial agreements. In addition, Statkraft has a number of other physical contractual obligations of varying duration to both Norwegian and international customers. 08 Other operating revenues NOK million 2010 2009 Power plant leasing revenues 522 289 Other leasing and service revenues 230 477 Other operating revenues 721 194 Total 1 473 960 Other operating revenues include a gain of NOK 393 million from the sale of Trondheim Energi Nett. 09 Energy purchases NOK million 2010 2009 Gas purchases 2 871 2 225 End-user activities 1 803 2 600 Total 4 674 4 825 10 Unrealised changes in the value of energy contracts Unrealised changes in the value of energy derivatives are classified by portfolio in the table below.

Statkraft annual report 2010 group financial statements 43 Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report 12 PENSIONS Defined benefit schemes The companies in the Group have organised their pension schemes in the National Pension Fund (SPK), own pension funds as well as in insurance companies. Employees in the Group’s Norwegian companies participate in public service occupational pension schemes in accordance with the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund Act, the Norwegian Public Pension Service Pension Fund Transfer Agreement and the regulatory framework governing public service pensions. 2422 employees and 984 pensioners were covered by benefit schemes as of 31 December 2010. Pension benefits from the SPK are guaranteed by the Norwegian state (Section 1 of the Pension Act). The occupational pension schemes cover retirement, disability, surviving spouse and child’s pension. With maximum accrual, the retirement schemes provide pension benefits amounting to 66% of pensionable income, up to 12 times the National Insurance Scheme’s basic amount (G). In connection with the pension reform, a decision was made in 2010 to reduce the continuous adjustment of future pensions. Current pensions will be adjusted by the National Insurance Scheme's basic amount (G) less a fixed factor of 0.75 percentage points. The change will have retroactive effect and be treated as a scheme change in the accounts, resulting in a reduction in the pension commitment of NOK 339 million. The reduction in the pension commitment appears as a reduction in the pension costs for the year. Pension scheme benefits are coordinated with the benefits provided by the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. The majority of the companies also offer early retirement from the age of 62 under the Norwegian early retirement pension scheme. Employees who leave the company before pensionable age receive a deferred pension entitlement. In schemes that are part of SPK, participating companies are not responsible for these obligations. Deferred entitlements in the pension schemes will be continued as an obligation in the pension schemes. Companies with schemes in the SPK pay an annual premium and are responsible for the financing of the scheme. The SPK scheme is not asset-based, but management of the pension fund assets (fictitious assets) is simulated as though the assets were invested in 1, 3, 5 or 10-year Norwegian government bonds or a combination of these. In this simulation it is assumed that the bonds are held to maturity. The pension assets are guaranteed by the Norwegian government and up to 35% of the pension fund assets can be invested in the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which is a real fund where yields are linked to the market situation. The investment choice principles have been set out in a separate investment strategy for the Statkraft Group's pension assets in SPK. The Group will not make any new investments in the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global. The pension schemes have placed the pension assets in a diversified portfolio of Norwegian and foreign interest-bearing securities, Norwegian and foreign shares, secured loans to members, hedge funds and properties through external asset managers. Defined-benefit schemes have been established for a limited number of employees in companies outside Norway. Unsecured pension obligations In addition to the above, some Group companies in Norway have entered into pension agreements that provide all employees whose pensionable incomes exceed 12G with a retirement and disability pension equivalent to 66% of that portion of their pensionable income exceeding 12G. Employees who leave the company before pensionable age receive a deferred pension entitlement for the scheme above 12G, provided they have at least three years' pension entitlements. Actuarial calculations The present value of defined benefit pension liabilities and the current year’s accrued pension entitlements are calculated using the accrued benefits method. The net present value of pension benefits accrued at the balance sheet date adjusted for expected future salary increases until pensionable age is based on best estimate assumptions as of 31 December 2010. Calculations are based on staff numbers and salary data at the end of the year. Actuarial gains and losses in 2010 are mainly due to updated assumptions, staff numbers, actual salary increase and return on assets, as well as the transition from private AFP to public AFP for some of the companies. Explanation of the background for selected assumptions/risk table The discount rate is set at 3.7% for Norwegian pension schemes and is calculated as a weighted average of the risk-free interest rate until the time when payments are expected to be made. Salary adjustments for Norwegian schemes are mainly calculated as the total of the expected nominal salary increase of 1.75%, inflation of 2,0% and career progression increase of 0.25%, with some minor adaptations. For the majority of the Norwegian schemes, adjustment of current pensions follows the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme's basic amount (G -0.75 percentage points). For demographic factors, the K2005, GAP07 and IR73 tariffs are used to establish mortality and disability risks. The stipulation of parameters which apply to foreign defined-benefit schemes is adapted to local conditions. 44 Statkraft annual report 2010 group financial statements Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report Defined contribution schemes In companies outside of Norway, defined contribution schemes have been established in accordance with local statutes.

The estimate change is a combination of changed assumptions during the course of the year, as well as improved methods for estimating deferred tax assets. The calculated effect of the changed assumptions and improved estimation methods is about NOK 1400 million. Tax assets related to negative resource rent tax carryforward in power plants where the future tax-related profit for the next ten years can be estimated, are recognised in the balance sheet. Normal production and price curve expectations for the next ten years form the basis for the calculation of expected future taxable profit. Off-balance sheet deferred tax assets related to negative resource rent tax carryforward amounted to NOK 1665 million as of 31.12.2010. 48 Statkraft annual report 2010 group financial statements Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report Recognised Recognised in Acquisitions during comprehensive and sale of Group NOK million 01.01.09 the period income companies contribution 31.12.09 Current assets/current liabilities 500 -108 -31 -8 1 589 1 942 Property, plant and equipment 4 039 123 -290 715 4 587 Pension liabilities -616 -2 33 -4 -589 Other long-term items 370 21 12 -1 402 Tax loss carryforward/compensation -679 353 86 -240 Deferred tax, resource rent tax 1 916 326 2 242 Negative resource rent tax carryforward -903 -240 -1 143 Total net deferred tax liability 4 627 473 -276 788 1 589 7 202 Of which presented as deferred tax asset, see Note 17 1 518 1 163 Of which presented as deferred tax liability, see Note 26 6 145 8 365 Deferred tax recognised directly in comprehensive income NOK million 2010 2009 Estimate deviation pension -114 33 Translation differences -169 -309 Total deferred tax recognised in comprehensive income -283 -276 17 INTANGIBLE ASSETS NOK million 2010 2009 Deferred tax asset 1 953 1 163 Goodwill 547 648 Other 480 466 Total 2 981 2 277 Deferred tax is discussed in more detail in Note 16.

The book value at the end of 2010 was NOK 120 million. In total, the loan has been written down by NOK 597 million. Other shares and shareholdings in the balance sheet includes the E.ON AG shareholding with NOK 14 867 million. Shares are classified as assets available for sale and recognised in the accounts at fair value with changes in value recorded in comprehensive income. The part of the change in value which can be attributed to currency changes and which is within corresponding currency 52 Statkraft annual report 2010 group financial statements Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report change for loans in EUR is presented in the income statement under Unrealised changes in value financial items. The change in value in 2010 was NOK -5 282 million, of which NOK -1 193 million is due to lower exchange rate for EUR. In 2010, the E.ON AG shareholding has shown a lasting reduction in market value compared with the original cost price. This entailed a need for write-down of the shares by an amount that includes earlier changes in value recognised in comprehensive income. The change in share value in 2010 amounted to NOK -4 088 million. Previous changes in value recognised in comprehensive income amounted to NOK 463 million as of 2009. As a result of a lasting reduction in value, the income statement has been charged with NOK -3 625 million under Unrealised changes in value financial items. 21 Inventories NOK million 2010 2009 Valued at net realisable value: Green certificates 435 798 CO2 quotas 349 295 Spare parts 82 78 Other 147 76 Total 1 013 1 247 Green certificates and CO2 quotas are valued at net realisable value, while spare parts and other are valued at the lower of cost price and net realisable value 22 Receivables NOK million 2010 2009 Accounts receivable 5 739 2 746 Accrued revenues etc. 1 190 1 868 Receivables from Statkraft SF 1 049 Interest-bearing restricted funds 1 527 215 Other receivables 2 292 2 829 Total 10 748 8 707 Other receivables mainly comprises prepaid expenses of NOK 1 139 million and value added tax owed to Statkraft of NOK 585 million.

Most of the financial instruments can be categorised into the two main categories of financial activities and energy trading. In addition to the above, other financial instruments exist in the form of accounts receivable, accounts payable, cash, short-term financial investments and equity investments. Financial instruments in energy trading Within energy trading, financial instruments are used in the trading and as part of the Group's financial hedging strategy for continuous optimisation of future revenues from the expected production volume. Financial instruments in energy trading mainly consist of financial and physical agreements relating to purchase and sale of power, gas, oil, coal, CO2 quotas. Derivatives recognised in the balance sheet are shown as separate items in the balance sheet and are evaluated at fair value with changes in value recognised in the income statement. As the Group's future own production of power does not qualify for recognition in the balance sheet under IAS 39, the effect of changes in value of financial energy derivatives may have major effects on the income statement without necessarily reflecting the underlying activities. Financial instruments used in financial activities Financial instruments used in financial activities primarily consist of loans, interest rate swaps, combined interest rate and currency swaps and forward exchange contracts. Financial derivatives are used as hedging instruments in accordance with the Group's financial hedging strategy. The hedging objects will be assets in foreign currency, future cash flows or loan arrangements valued at amortised cost. For selected loan arrangements where the interest rate has been changed from fixed to floating (fair value hedging), some net investments in foreign units and cash flows, hedging is reflected in the accounts in accordance with IAS 39. As a result of not all financial hedging relationships being reflected in the accounts, changes in value for financial instruments may result in volatility in the income statement without fully reflecting the financial reality. 30 HEDGE ACCOUNTING Fair-value hedging Three loan arrangements are treated as fair value hedges. Issued bond loans have been designated as hedging objects in the hedging relationships, and the associated interest rate swaps have been designated as hedging instruments. Hedging of net investments in foreign entities Some investments in subsidiaries of SN Power have been subject to hedge accounting. Cash flow hedging As a general rule, the Group does not hedge cash flows. However, a cash flow hedge has been established in one subsidiary. This is related to cash flows in various currencies which have been hedged to USD in the project financing in one of SN Power's subsidiaries. Detailed description of fair value hedging The hedging objects are issued fixed-interest bonds with a total nominal value of EUR 1200 million. The hedging instruments are interest rate swaps with a nominal value of EUR 1200 million, entered into with major banks as the counterparties. The agreements swap interest rate from fixed to floating 3-month and 6-month EURIBOR. The hedging relationships have been established to reduce interest risk. The critical terms of the hedging object and hedging instrument are deemed to be approximately the same, and 90–110% hedging efficiency is assumed. The inefficiency is recognised in the income statement.

The fair value of other energy derivatives has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows. Below is a description of assumptions and parameters that have been applied in the determination of fair value. Electricity price Energy exchange contracts are valued at official closing rates on the balance sheet date. The closing rates are discounted. For other bilateral electricity contracts, the expected cash flow is stipulated on the basis of a market price curve on the balance sheet date. The market price curve for the next five years is stipulated on the basis of official closing rates on energy exchanges. For time horizons beyond five years, the price curve is adjusted for expected inflation. Prices in some contracts refer to area prices. These contracts are valued using the official closing rates on energy exchanges, where such exist. Separate models are used for regional prices without official closing prices. If the contracts extend beyond the horizon quoted on energy exchanges, the price is adjusted for the expected rate of inflation. Raw materials Statkraft has power and gas contracts where the references for the contract price include the price development of gas, coal and oil products. These are valued using forward prices from relevant commodity exchanges and major financial institutions. If quotes are not available for the entire time period, the commodity prices are adjusted for inflation based on the most recent quoted price in the market. CO2 CO2 contracts are priced based on the forward price of EUA quotas and CER quotas. For post-Kyoto contracts, the price in the last traded contract is used in the valuation of the contracts. Foreign currency Several energy contracts have prices in different currencies. Official foreign currency rates from Reuters and major financial institutions are used in the valuation of contracts denominated in foreign currency. If there are no quotes for the entire time period in question, the interest parity is used to calculate exchange rates. Interest rates The market interest rate curve (swap interest rate) is used as a basis for discounting derivatives. The market interest rates are stipulated on the basis of the publicised swap interest rate from major financial institutions. Credit surcharge is added to the market interest rate curve in cases where the credit risk is relevant. This applies to all external bilateral contracts classified as assets and liabilities. Fair value of currency and interest rate derivatives The fair value of interest rate swaps and currency swaps is determined by discounting expected future cash flows to current value through use of observed market interest rates and exchange rates. The valuation of forward currency exchange contracts is based on observed exchange rates, from which the forward exchange rate is extrapolated. Estimated present value is subjected to a test of reasonableness against calculations made by the counterparties to the contracts. Fair value of financial investments Certificates and bonds Certificates and bonds are valued at quoted prices. Shares and shareholdings Shares and shareholdings are valued at quoted prices where such are available and the securities are liquid. Other securities are valued using valuation techniques and by discounting expected future cash flows. Fair value of equity investments in the CO2 fund Equity investments in CO2 funds are valued by discounting expected future cash flows. Assumptions concerning the number of quotas that will be distributed by the fund are a discretionary estimate. The price assumption is described under CO2 above. Fair value of long-term liabilities, first year’s instalment on long-term liabilities and certificate loans The fair value is calculated on the basis of valuation techniques where expected future cash flows are discounted to present value. Expected cash flows are calculated and discounted using observed market interest rates and exchange rates for the various currencies (swap interest rate curve) adjusted upwards for credit risk.

Statkraft is engaged in activities that entail risk in many areas. Risk management is not about removing risk, but assuming the right risk based on the Group's ability and willingness to take risks, expertise, solidity and development plans. The purpose of the risk management is to identify threats and opportunities for the Group, and to manage the risk towards an acceptable level to provide reasonable surety for achieving the Group's objectives. Market risk is the risk that a financial instrument’s fair value or future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices. In Statkraft, market risk will primarily relate to electricity price risk, CO2 prices, gas price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The following section contains a more detailed account of the various types of market risk, and how these are managed. Statkraft annual report 2010 group financial statements 59 Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report DESCRIPTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT IN ENERGY TRADING AND THE POWER PORTFOLIOS Risk management in energy trading in Statkraft focuses on whole contract portfolios rather than specific contracts in accordance with IAS 39. Internal guidelines for market exposure have been established for all portfolios. Responsibility for continual monitoring of granted mandates and frameworks lies with independent organisational units. The frameworks for trading in both financial and physical contracts are continually monitored and regularly reported. A description of the power portfolios in Statkraft can be found below: Nordic hydropower The Nordic hydropower portfolio is intended to cover hydropower production in the Nordic region and its associated risk. Nordic hydropower is exposed to both price and volume risk, as both future prices and water inflow are unknown. Mandates are based on annual volume thresholds and available production. The objective of the portfolio management is to optimise portfolio revenues and in addition reduce the portfolio risk. The risk is quantified using simulations of various scenarios for relevant risk factors. Net exposure in this portfolio is derived from continually updated production forecasts, physical purchase and sale contracts, as well as contracts traded via energy exchanges and bilateral financial contracts. The financial contracts are both contracts traded via energy exchanges and bilateral contracts. These generally have terms of less than five years, though some financial contracts run until 2020. Some of the perpetual concessionary power agreements have been renegotiated to financial settlement for shorter terms. The physical sales commitments include statutory-priced industrial contracts, long-term sales contracts, concessionary power obligations, as well as miscellaneous free power and compensation power contracts. The majority of the statutory-priced industrial contracts will expire prior to 2011. The long-term contracts have varying terms, but the longest runs until 2030. The concessionary power contacts are perpetual. For certain of these sales obligations, the price is indexed to other market risks such as metals and foreign currency (embedded derivatives). Financial contracts and physical contracts with volume optionality and built-in derivatives are evaluated at fair value, other contracts do not qualify for recognition in the balance sheet and are recognised in the income statement in accordance with normal purchase and sale. Continental assets The purpose of the portfolio is to manage energy production in continental Europe, including the gas-fired power plant at Kårstø, as well as associated risks. The market risk in the portfolio is derived from the future market prices for electricity, CO2, gas, coal and oil products. Mandates are based on annual volume thresholds and available production. The objective of the portfolio management is to optimise portfolio revenues and in addition reduce the portfolio risk. The risk is quantified using simulations of various scenarios for relevant risk factors. The assets in this portfolio are Baltic Cable AB, the gas power plants, financial and physical energy contracts and other continental assets. Statkraft engages in trading in accordance with the applicable mandates by locking in earnings when electricity prices are attractive relative to gas prices plus CO2 costs. In addition, Statkraft also engages in financial trading to maximise the revenues from Baltic Cable. The contract portfolio consists of financial and physical contracts relating to these assets. All financial contracts as well as several physical contracts are recognised at fair value. The Group has shareholdings in five gas-fired power plants, four in Germany and one in Norway, and has in this connection entered into long-term supply contracts for natural gas. The purchase price for these contracts is indexed to coal and oil. The duration of the agreements differ. The gas agreements are mainly considered to be for own use except for contracts where the gas is resold and are therefore recognised at fair value in accordance with IAS 39. The financial contracts in the portfolio are forward contracts for electricity, CO2, oil products, gas and coal. The price development in the spot market for electricity, gas, the underlying commodities that are included in the indexing of the gas contracts, and CO2 therefore affect the earnings of the gas-fired power plants. Trading and Origination Statkraft has various portfolios for trading and origination that are managed independently of the Group’s expected electricity production. Trading teams have been established in Oslo, Trondheim, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Düsseldorf. The portfolios act in the market with the aim of realising gains on changes in the market value of energy and energy-related products, as well as gains on non-standardised contracts. Statkraft has allocated risk capital for the trading and origination business. Clear guidelines have been established for the types of products that are allowed to be traded. The mandates for trading and origination activities are adhered to through specified limits for Value-at-Risk and Profit-at-Risk. Both methods calculate the maximum potential loss a portfolio can incur, with a given probability factor over a given period of time. Credit risk and operational risk are also quantified in connection with the allocated risk capital. All trading and origination contracts are recognised at fair value in accordance with IAS 39.5 and 39.6. The trading activities The trading activities involve buying and selling standardised and traded products. Electricity and CO2 products, as well as green certificates, gas and oil products are traded. The contracts in the trading portfolio have durations ranging from 0 to 5 years. Origination activities Origination activities include buying and selling both standardised products and structured contracts. Structured products may be energy contracts with a special duration, long-term contracts or energy contracts in different currencies. The trading with transport capacity over borders and virtual power plant contracts are also included in the activities. Quoted, traded 60 Statkraft annual report 2010 group financial statements Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report contracts such as system price, regional prices and foreign currency are generally used to reduce the risk involved in trading in structured products and contracts. The majority of the contracts in the portfolio have a duration of up to five years, though some contracts run until 2026. FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK Statkraft is exposed to two main types of risk as regards the financial activities in the Group; foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. Statkraft uses interest rate and foreign currency instruments in its management of the company’s interest rate and foreign exchange exposure. Interest rate and currency swaps and forward exchange rate contracts are used to achieve the desired currency and interest rate structure for the company’s loan portfolio. Forward exchange rate contracts are also used to hedge cash flows denominated in foreign currency. Statkraft’s methods for managing these risks are described below. Foreign exchange risk Statkraft incurs currency risk in the form of transaction risk mainly in connection with energy sales revenues, investments and dividend from subsidiaries and associates in foreign currency. Balance sheet risk is related to shareholdings in foreign subsidiaries in Belgium, the UK, Sweden, Turkey and Germany as well as in SN Power which uses USD as its functional currency. There is also balance sheet risk in connection with investment in some associates. The operational currency for Statkraft's trading on energy exchanges is EUR, which means that all contracts that are entered into via energy exchanges are denoted in EUR and are thus exposed to EUR. A corresponding currency exposure is incurred in connection with energy trading on other exchanges in other currencies than EUR. Statkraft hedges its currency exposure related to cash flows from energy sales of physical contracts and financial trading on energy exchanges, investments, dividends and other currency exposures in accordance with the company's financial strategy. Exposure hedging is achieved by using financial derivatives and loans in foreign currencies as hedging instruments. Few of the hedging relationships fulfil the requirements of hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39. Compliance with the limit for currency risk is followed up continuously by the independent middle-office function. Responsibility for entering into and following up positions is subject to divisions of responsibility and is allocated to separate organisational units. The currency exposure in relation to established frameworks in the finance strategy is regularly reported to corporate management via the CFO. Interest rate risk Most of Statkraft’s interest rate risk exposure relates to the loan portfolio. An interest rate management framework has been established based on a mix between fixed and floating interest rates. The objective is to ensure that most of the net loan portfolio is exposed to floating interest rates, but that up to 50% of the loan portfolio can be exposed to fixed interest rates. As a rule fixed interest rates shall apply for a period of more than five years. The strategy for managing interest rate risk has been established based on an objective of achieving the most cost-efficient financing, coupled with the aim of a certain stability and predictability in finance costs. A management framework has also been established to limit the interest rate exposure in currencies other than NOK. The currency positions that are to be entered into are assessed on an ongoing basis, given the market conditions observed for the currency and the overall exposure that exists for that currency. Compliance with the limit for currency risk is followed up continuously by the independent middle-office function. Responsibility for entering into and following up positions is subject to divisions of responsibility and is allocated to separate organisational units. The interest rate exposure per currency in relation to established frameworks in the finance strategy is regularly reported to corporate management via the CFO. 33 ANALYSIS OF MARKET RISK Statkraft’s main activities are the generation and trading of electrical power. In a market in which hydropower plays an important role, and where the supply of water varies a great deal from year to year, price and generating capacity will also vary considerably. Statkraft makes considerable use of forward contracts and other financial instruments to optimise its revenues. Market risk connected with energy optimisation thus covers volume risk, electricity price risk in the spot market and risk connected with positions in financial instruments. Market positions are also taken in connection with the Trading and Origination portfolios. Statkraft is also exposed to market risk relating to interest rate and currency positions, district heating and end-user activities, as well as risk related to grid operations through the revenues being related to the interest market. The Group quantifies risk as deviations from expected post-tax results with a given confidence level. Market risk is included in these calculations, which are used both in the follow-up of the business areas/portfolios and at Group level as part of reporting to corporate management and the Board. Statkraft’s targets for market risk shall have a 95% probability of covering all potential losses (deviations from expected results) connected with the market risk of positions at the balance sheet date during the course of a year. Uncertainty in the underlying instruments/prices and their interrelatedness are calculated using statistical methods. The time period for the calculations is one year. For contracts with exposure of more than one year, only the uncertainty relating to the current year is reflected in the calculations. The exposure can take the form of actual exposure or an expected maximum utilisation of frameworks. The model also takes into account correlation, both within the individual areas and between the areas. Total market risk as of 31 December 2010 was calculated at NOK 1251 million, where the main risk relates to energy optimisation. A minor increase in market risk for energy optimisation explains most of the change from 2009. The risk related to energy optimisation varies substantially over a period of time as a result of uncertainty and the energy price level and production volumes. The increase in the risk for energy optimisation from 31 December 2009 to 31 December 2010 must be seen in the context of higher expected prices and revenues and the fact that the downside risk is therefore also somewhat higher. Statkraft annual report 2010 group financial statements 61 Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report The diversification effect emerges as the difference between total market risk in the specified areas and total market risk, where the correlation between e.g. energy prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates is taken into account. There is a minor reduction in diversification effects measured in NOK, but as the reduction in market risk before diversification effects is significantly higher, the diversification effect increases as a percentage.

CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of a party to a financial instrument inflicting a financial loss on the other party by not fulfilling its obligations. Statkraft assumes counterparty risk in connection with energy trading and physical sales, when placing surplus liquidity and when trading in financial instruments. It is assumed that no counterparty risk exists for financial energy contracts which are settled through an energy exchange. For all other energy contracts entered into, the limits are stipulated for the individual counterparty using an internal credit rating. The counterparties are allocated to different categories. The internal credit rating is based on financial key figures. Bilateral contracts are subject to limits for each counterparty as regards volume, amount and duration. Statkraft also has a separate category for counterparties with which the Group will not engage for ethical reasons. 62 Statkraft annual report 2010 group financial statements Statement of Comprehensive Income Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report In order to reduce credit risk, bank guarantees are used in some cases when entering into agreements. The bank which issues the guarantee must be an internationally rated commercial bank. Parent company guarantees are also used. In such cases, the parent company is assessed and classified in the normal way. Subsidiaries will naturally never be rated higher than the parent company. In connection with bank guarantees and parent company guarantees, the counterparty will be classified in the same category as the issuer of the guarantee. Statkraft has netting agreements with several of its energy trading counterparties. In the event of default, the netting agreements give a right to a final settlement where all future contract positions are netted and settled. Placement of surplus liquidity is mainly divided among institutions rated BBB+ or better. For financial instruments, loss exposure is calculated in the event of breach of contract by the counterparty. Statkraft has entered into agreements relating to interim cash settlement of the market value of financial derivaties with its counterparties (cash collateral), significantly reducing counterparty exposure in connection with these agreements. Statkraft has good follow-up routines for ensuring that outstanding receivables are paid as agreed. Customer lists sorted by age are followed up continuously. If a contractual counterparty experiences payment problems, special procedures are applied. The risk of counterparties not being able to meet their obligations is considered to be limited. Historically, Statkraft's losses on receivables have been limited. The individual counterparty exposure limits are monitored continuously and reported regularly. In addition, the counterparty risk is quantified by combining exposure with the probability of the individual counterparty defaulting. The overall counterparty risk is calculated and reported for all relevant units, in addition to being consolidated at the Group level and included in the Group risk management. Statkraft's gross credit risk exposure corresponds to the recognised value of financial assets, which are found in the various notes to the balance sheet. Statkraft has provided parent company guarantees for subsidiaries and associates (Note 39). The maximum credit risk exposure does not exceed the already recognised value of financial assets. Gross exposure to credit risk in financial assets is partly reduced through collateral. To the extent that relevant and substantial collateral has been provided, this has been presented below. NOK million Note 2010 2009 Gross exposure credit risk: Other non-current financial assets 20 15 249 21 939 Derivatives 24 9 487 8 003 Receivables 22 10 748 8 707 Short-term financial investments 23 424 421 Cash and cash equivalents 25 20 052 6 663 Total 55 960 45 733 Exposure reduced by security (guarantees, cash collateral etc.): Derivatives -1 079 -1 501 Net exposure credit risk 54 881 44 232 In the case of financial derivatives, the credit risk for most counterparties and derivatives is reduced by the provision of security in the form of cash collateral. Cash collateral is settled on a weekly basis and will therefore not always be settled on 31 December. There could therefore be an outstanding credit risk at the year-end. Frameworks for exposure to individual counterparties have been adopted in the case of short-term financial investments. All cash and cash equivalents are receivables due from banks. LIQUIDITY RISK Statkraft assumes a liquidity risk because the term of its financial obligations is not matched to the cash flows generated by its assets, and because of variations in security requirements linked to both financial contracts in the forward market (energy exchanges) and cash collateral requirements. Statkraft has good borrowing opportunities from the Norwegian and European money markets and in the banking market. Drawdown facilities have been established to secure access to short-term financing. Statkraft’s drawdown facilities are large enough to cover outstanding certificate liabilities at any time. A guarantee framework has been established to cope with significant fluctuations in the collateral required for financial contracts in the forward market required by Nord Pool. Statkraft has a liquidity capacity target of between 1.5 and 4.0. Liquidity capacity in this context is defined as cash and cash equivalents, plus committed drawdown facilities, overdrafts and projected receipts for the next six months divided by projected payments for the next six months. The finance department prepares the liquidity forecasts, which are important for daily liquidity management and for planning future financing requirements. The liquidity reserve is a tool for the finance department’s risk management and functions as a buffer in relation to the liquidity forecast. The liquidity reserve consists of the company’s cash and cash equivalents, committed drawdown facilities and overdraft facilities. Cash and cash equivalents are intended to cover normal fluctuations in the company’s cash flow. Committed drawdown facilities will be Statkraft’s buffer against unforeseen events with significant cash flow consequences. An individual target figure for short-term liquidity capacity, which reflects Statkraft’s ability to cover its future obligations, is included in the Group’s balanced scorecard.

Tools for long-term management of capital structure are primarily comprised by the draw-down and repayment of long-term liabilities and payments of share capital from/to the owner. The Group endeavours to obtain external financing from various capital markets. The Group is not subject to any external requirements with regard to the management of capital structure other than those relating to the market’s expectations and the owner’s dividend requirements. There were no changes in the Group’s targets and guidelines governing the management of capital structure in 2010. The most important target figure for the Group’s management of capital structure is long-term credit rating. Statkraft AS has a longterm credit rating of A(negative outlook) from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 (stable outlook) from Moody’s. In the short and medium term, Statkraft's goal is to maintain its current rating, and BBB+/Baa1 as a minimum. In the longer term, the goal is to achieve a stable A-level rating with both Standard & Poor's and Moody’s.

For individuals qualifying for the full entitlement, the scheme provides retirement and disability pension benefits amounting to 66% of pensionable income, up to a maximum of 12 times the National Insurance Scheme’s basic amount (G). The company’s employees are also entitled to retire early under the early retirement (AFP) scheme from the age of 62. Pension benefits from the SPK are guaranteed by the Norwegian state (Section 1 of the Pension Act). Statkraft pays an annual premium to the SPK and is responsible for the financing of the scheme. The SPK scheme is, however, not asset-based. Management of the pension fund assets (fictitious assets) is therefore simulated as though the assets were invested in long-term government bonds. In this simulation it is assumed that the bonds are held to maturity. Unsecured pension liabilities Statkraft has in addition to the above schemes entered into agreements that provide employees whose pensionable income exceeds 12G with a retirement and disability pension equivalent to 66% of that portion of their pensionable income exceeding 12G. These pensions are funded out of the company’s operations.

The accounting treatment adopted for these depends on their purpose as described in the accounting policies note. Currency and interest rate agreements Book value and fair value of interest rate and currency derivatives: 31.12.10 31.12.09 Book Fair Book Fair NOK million value value value value Interest rate swaps -483 503 223 Combined interest rate and currency swaps -62 -65 584 629 Currency futures contracts 523 523 203 203 Total -22 961 787 1 055 Fair value is calculated on the basis of relevant market prices and forward curves, since the bulk of the derivatives are not traded on organised markets. Interest rate derivatives, including the interest portion of combined interest rate and currency swaps, are used to manage the company’s interest rate risk and are recognised as hedging instruments or at the lowest value principle, depending on whether the requirements for hedge accounting have been achieved. The fair value of interest rate derivatives classified as hedging (value hedging) is NOK -20 million as of 31.12.2010, while interest rate derivatives valued at the lowest value principle amount to NOK -382 million. The amounts have been recognised in the income statement in 2010 in their entirety. The hedges expire during the period 2011-2019. Fair value of derivatives in cash flow hedging is not recognised in the balance sheet, and amounts to NOK -15 million. The fair value stated in the table does not include accrued interest. The currency component of combined interest rate and currency swaps is recognised at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. The change in value recognised in the income statement is offset by a comparable change in value of underlying loans in the same currency. The currency futures are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, presented gross and included in the accounting lines Other interest-free liabilities and Receivables 22 RELATED PARTIES Statkraft AS owns shareholdings in a number of companies.

Statkraft annual report 2010 Sustainability statement 83 Sustainability Statement Auditor's Statement The GHG-protocol (from the World Business Council for Sustainabile Development and World Resources Institute) divides greenhouse gas emissions into three types. Type 1 emissions are direct emissions from own activitites. Type 2 emissions are indirect emissions from purchased electricity and district heating, while Type 3 emissions are other emissions. All the emissions in the table above are Type 1, except for business travel, which falls under Type 3. The electricity consumption in Statkraft is guaranteed renewable, resulting in zero Type 2 emissions. For 2010, the Group's Type 1 emissions totalled 1 689 700 tonnes, while the Type 3 emissions totalled 3 700 tonnes.

AFT’S STATKR F CONDUCT CODE O raft.c om www.statk CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 99 Corporate Statkraft’s plants and projects often have a considerable impact on the responsibility environment and local communities. It is crucial to us that sustainability and responsible behaviour form the basis for our work so that we build in statkraft trust and good relations with our partners and stakeholders. We channel our corporate responsibility efforts towards those areas where we have the greatest impact on our surroundings, where the risk of taking the wrong step is the greatest and the potential consequences are the most serious. Health and safety International growth in new markets creates more demanding challenges with regards to establishing a behaviour and culture where health and safety is always a priority. Statkraft strives to adhere to the highest health and safety standards for employees, contractors and partners. Environmental impact Statkraft mainly produces renewable energy without emissions of greenhouse gases and thereby contributes to prevent climate change. However, renewable energy production also has an impact on the environment, primarily through interventions in nature and ecosystems. Our environmental work is based on the precautionary principle and we work systematically with environmental issues in all business activities. Business ethics The general focus on corruption has increased significantly in recent years. At the same time, Statkraft is growing and is now active in 20 countries. We must therefore work systematically to prevent corruption and promote ethical business practices across geographical and organisational boundaries. Corporate Responsibility (CR) – both risks and opportunities We see both risks and opportunities in connection with corporate responsibility. The risk perspective helps us identify weaknesses and implement measures. We also believe that high standards in this area create trust and new business opportunities. We therefore develop good systems for project and risk management and ensure that the necessary expertise is under continuous development. Corporate responsibility is an integrated part of our day-to-day business operations.

Source: Universum Graduate Survey MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 101 Managing Statkraft’s vision to meet the world’s need for cleaner energy – in corporate combination with our values of expertise, responsibility and innovation – define strict guidelines for our activities. Statkraft’s code of conduct responsibility clearly states that Statkraft will operate sustainably and develop the company in a manner that generates value for the owner, as well as in the countries and communities in which we operate. Our follow-up of corporate responsibility is based on national legislation and internationally recognised principles and guidelines. We also emphasise clear communication of our goals and results. Our management system Corporate Responsibility is a line responsibility in Statkraft. This means that each business unit in Statkraft has an independent responsibility for handling and following up corporate responsibility in connection with its own activities. Statkraft’s code of conduct describes the fundamental principle for corporate responsibility and ethical conduct in Statkraft. Follow-up of corporate responsibility Each individual business unit has an independent responsibility for ensuring that its activities are sustainable. This entails that handling and follow-up of areas such as health and safety, corruption, human rights and environment must be incorporated in all business processes. In addition, a corporate staff function has been established in order to follow up corporate responsibility. The staff has an advisory role vis-a-vis the business units, and is responsible for the further development of the Group’s corporate responsibility management systems. Governing documents The basis for Statkraft’s corporate social responsibility and ethical conduct is described in Statkraft’s code of conduct. More detailed descriptions of how Statkraft’s corporate social responsibility will be exercised can be found in the associated principle documents and guidelines. Management of health and safety Statkraft has a common management system for health and safety based on OHSAS 18001. Common guidelines are prepared for a number of areas, for example as regards reporting and investigation of incidents, handling of chemicals and emergency preparedness plans. Environmental management The Group’s environmental management system is designed in accordance with the requirements in ISO 14001:2004, and parts of the activities have been certified in accordance with this standard. Statkraft has Group-wide guidelines for environmental management. The guidelines include description of requirements for mapping environmental impact and risks. STATKRAFT’S CODE OF CONDUCT Dialogue with stakeholders Statkraft communicates openly and regularly with many stakeholders, including the www.statkraft.com owner, employees, business partners, suppliers, local and regional authorities, voluntary organisations and the media. This includes: ππ Hearings, information meetings and company visits in connection with development projects ππ Meetings with local stakeholders in areas where Statkraft is active ππ Internal information meetings and cooperation with trade unions MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 102 National legislation and Statkraft operates in accordance with applicable Norwegian laws and international principles regulations and applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we are active. In order to ensure sound and sustainable operations in Norway and abroad, we also comply with relevant internationally recognized standards and guidelines. Statutes and regulations Statkraft operates in accordance with applicable Norwegian laws and regulations and applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we are active. If there are differences between laws, regulations and Statkraft’s governing documents, we adhere to the norms which set the highest standards for our conduct. Internationally recognised standards Statkraft is growing internationally, and some of the growth takes place in areas where the standards for sustainable conduct differ from the standards in our domestic market. This is challenging and sets high standards for employees, contractors and partners. To ensure that the company operates in a sustainable manner, we use and apply internationally recognised standards and guidelines as the basis for our work. Statkraft is a member of the UN’s Global Compact and adheres to the ten principles, which include human rights, working environment standards, environment and anti-corruption. Statkraft also adheres to the OECD’s guidelines for responsible business conduct for multinational companies. In development projects, Statkraft emphasises the International Finance Corporation’s standards for sustainable behaviour, which among other things, requires thorough social and environmental impact analysis. International forums Statkraft is an active participant in several international forums where climate and energy policy is formulated. These include World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), International Hydropower Association and Eurelectric. Statkraft is also a member of Transparency International Norway. Transparency International is an organisation dedicated to fighting corruption around the world. Supplier follow-up Statkraft’s procurement guidelines aim to ensure equal treatment of suppliers and contain clear requirements as regards corporate responsibility, the environment, health and safety. Particularly important and vulnerable deliveries are subject to more rigorous follow-up through several supplier links. Requirements for suppliers Statkraft primarily wants to use suppliers that are approved in the Nordic energy industry’s common qualification scheme, Sellihca, including some 3100 approved suppliers. In accordance with the requirements in the regulations for public acquisitions and Statkraft’s own ethical guidelines, all suppliers must be treated equally. Statkraft’s suppliers are made familiar with Statkraft’s code of conduct and other relevant ethical requirements and guidelines relating to tender processes and contract entry. These requirements and guidelines include definitions of clear requirements and standards as regards ethics, environment and health and safety. Follow-up of suppliers Particularly important and vulnerable deliveries are subject to more rigorous follow-up through several supplier links, involving company visits and unscheduled inspections. A project is underway to further improve the integration of corporate responsibility in all stages of the procurement process, and where renewed ethical requirements especially directed at the Group’s suppliers are being drawn up. The requirements are based on the same rules that apply to Statkraft’s own employees, but these have been customised to MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 103 SUSTAINABILITY CONSIDERATIONS IN THE PURCHASING PROCESS SELECTION OF FOLLOW-UP PREQUALIFYING CONTRACT CONTRACTOR AND CONTROL π Establish minimum π Objective criteria: π Specific requireπ Control and requirements relat• Certification ments relating to monitoring that ing to health, safety, health, safety, envicontractual environment and • Statistics and ronment and ethics conditions are ethics measuring in contracts complied with systems π Establish a plan for π Ensuring continued follow-up of supply • Results and compliance with chain performance requirements by • Width • Improvement subcontractors objectives π Clarifying conse• Depth • Selection and quences of any follow-up of breaches of sustainsubcontractors ability requirements the supplier role.

Expertise development The right expertise is an important success factor for the Group’s growth and development. Statkraft therefore facilitates continuous development of the expertise of each individual employee. Systematic follow-up Statkraft engages in expertise development within three areas; technical expertise, project manager expertise and management expertise. In order to secure the necessary expertise, Statkraft has developed a number of training programmes within a broad range of areas, such as languages, operational optimisation and environmental strategy. In addition, employees are given access to external training as needed. Each individual employee’s need for training is followed up in the annual appraisal interview. Efforts are underway to develop e-learning courses within several disciplines. The courses will be made easily available for all employees in a training portal. Apprentices To maintain the current unique operating expertise, we must ensure sufficient recruitment of skilled workers to the Group’s power plants. We have therefore over a number of years offered apprentice programs, and 79 apprentices were employed in the Group in 2010. Project development Statkraft participates in a number of important development projects, mainly outside Norway. Through development of profitable power plants, Statkraft wishes to contribute to sustainable development both economically, socially and environmentally in the local communities where they are built. Project planning and implementation All power developments impact the environment and local communities, and the negative consequences must be weighed against the positive in all development projects. All projects are therefore planned in close cooperation with local authorities, local communities and experts within areas such as environment, social aspects, health and safety, and political risk. MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 104 All development projects require a continuous evaluation of risks and impacts. The International Finance Corporation’s standards regarding sustainable behaviour are emphasised and used as requirements for several of our projects. The standards’ requirements include extensive impact analyses of the environmental and social aspects of projects and that the developer has a detailed plan for involvement and handling of stakeholders. Our requirements must also be safeguarded by our partners and contractors. We conduct systematic surveys of our partners as regards ethical behaviour as needed prior to entering into contracts. Improved project management Statkraft is currently engaged in a major project where the overall objective is to prepare simpler and clearer guidelines for project execution in Statkraft. A more systematic follow-up of sustainability elements is an important part of the project, which includes development of checklists for various topics and project phases. Below are examples of selected ongoing projects: Expansion of the Theun Hinboun power plant in Laos The Theun Hinboun power plant, which has been in operation since 1998, is owned by Theun Hinboun Power Company, in which Statkraft owns 20 per cent. An expansion of the capacity from 200 MW to 500 MW started in 2008 and this expansion project has been named Theun Hinboun Expansion Project (THXP). Naturally, THXP has an impact on both the environment and people living in the area, about 50 000 in total. From the beginning, emphasis was placed on making THXP a sustainable project and 10 per cent of the total investment has been allocated to social and environmental measures. To achieve the best possible results, the project cooperation partners include voluntary organisations and experts. One of the major challenges in the project is the moving of eleven villages, involving the building of new homes for about 5000 people. Electricity to Turkish homes In June 2010, Statkraft delivered its first volume of produced hydropower from the Cakit power plant to the Turkish market. Cakit is a run-of-river power plant with an installed capacity of 20 MW and will supply about 32 000 Turkish households with electricity annually. Cakit is the first hydropower plant certified in accordance with the Socialcarbon standard. This standard aims to ensure that projects create social, environmental and financial benefits for everyone affected by the project. Two run-of-river power plants in Chile In 2010, SN Power and Pacific Hydro opened two new run-of-river power plants in Chile, La Higuera and La Confluencia, both in the Tinguiririca valley. The Tinguiririca Partisipp programme was established in 2007. The programme finances health, education and local development projects identified by neighbouring local communities. So far, 98 projects have received financing. Sustainability reporting Statkrafts sustainability reporting is based on the recommendations of the Global Reporting Initiative. Fundamental principles are transparency, accuracy and reporting in a timely manner. About Statkraft’s sustainability reporting Statkraft’s sustainability reporting is based on GRI’s recommendations for voluntary sustainability reporting, including GRI’s ten reporting principles. The principles describe a process to identify significant topics and outline the premises for the reporting. Statkraft has developed guidelines for the group’s sustainability reporting. The guidelines cover all important sustainability aspects and take into account requirements and MANAGING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY / ANTI-CORRUPTION WORK AND ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 105 expectations from our stakeholders. Statkraft’s sustainability report reflects the most important sustainability issues at the Group level. More detailed information about individual projects and local issues and activities can be found on our website. Verification of sustainability information Statkraft’s sustainability information must be transparent, relevant and reliable. Statkraft’s external auditor has therefore reviewed the company’s sustainability reporting for 2010, and the management systems and processes on which the reporting is based. The auditor’s work is based on the attestation standards ISAE 3000* and the AA1000 Assurance Standard (version 2008), where the latter in particular has been developed for attestation of sustainability reporting. The standard not only focuses on the report itself, but also includes an analysis of the company’s management systems and processes for handling sustainability issues. The AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard (2008 version) describes principles related to materiality, completeness and involvement of stakeholders. We believe that Statkraft’s reporting practice fulfils these principles. Auditor’s statement The auditor’s conclusion from the verification work is set out in the auditor’s statement. In addition, the auditor makes comments and recommendations regarding Statkraft’s status and further work on sustainability reporting. Anti-corruption Ethical and responsible conduct is of essential importance in Statkraft. work and ethical We have established regulations, management structures and training which aim to ensure ethical conduct in all parts of our activities. behaviour Statkraft can contribute in the fight against corruption in affected markets through systematic and responsible business behaviour. In addition to expertise enhancement in the Group, this entails ensuring that Statkraft’s business partners have the same attitude towards corruption as Statkraft. Statkraft’s code of conduct The Group’s revised business principles (”Statkraft’s code of conduct”) was implemented in the first quarter of 2010. The code of conduct applies to all employees and all companies in the Statkraft Group, and our business partners are expected to have standards in accordance with Statkraft’s ethical requirements. The code of conduct is supported by more detailed guidelines and tools. At the beginning of 2010, Statkraft became a member of the UN Global Compact, and Statkraft’s code of conduct has been formulated to include Global Compact’s ten principles. In addition, renewed ethical requirements particularly intended for Statkraft’s suppliers and partners are under preparation. The requirements, which will be implemented in 2011, further clarify what we expect from our suppliers. Training and dilemma training for both managers and employees form a key component of the ethics work in Statkraft. In 2010, we have maintained a special focus on anti-corruption training. To support this, a new anti-corruption manual was developed in 2010, ready for introduction in 2011. The manual contains an overview of relevant statutes and regulations, internal rules and procedures as well as specific examples and challenges associated with corruption. The manual is supplemented by an interactive, dilemma-based training program. 1 Attestation which is not an audit or a limited audit of historical financial information. HUMAN RIGHTS / ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 106 Statkraft encourages employees to blow the whistle on questionable matters. The Group audit is an independent whistle-blowing channel with a right and duty to report to the board. Two whistleblower cases were reported in 2010. Both cases were handled in line with applicable guidelines and have now been closed. Human rights Within its sphere of influence, Statkraft supports and respects internationally recognised human rights, and works to develop guidelines and routines that will ensure respect for human rights. Companies and human rights Human rights are a set of obligations directed at sovereign states, not companies. However, it has now become generally recognised that companies can play a vital role in the work to respect and comply with human rights. Statkraft and human rights Statkraft supports and respects internationally recognised employee rights, including freedom of association and recognition of the right to collective bargaining, abolition of all forms of forced labour and child labour and abolishment of discrimination as regards employment and profession. Statkraft’s commitment to contribute to respect for and promotion of human rights is described in Statkraft’s code of conduct and rooted in our support for the UN’s Global Compact principles, which include human rights, labour standards, environmental conditions and anti-corruption. In 2010, Statkraft participated in the road-testing process of the draft Guide to Human Rights Impact Assessment and Management a document released by the International Business Leaders Forum, the International Finance Corporation and the UN Global Compact Office. The revised version of the Guide was launched in June 2010. It provides companies with guidance on how to assess and manage human rights risk and impacts of their business activities. Environmental Concern for the environment shall characterise all activities in Statkraft. impact We work in accordance with the precautionary principle and carry out analyses of environmental risk prior to all activities with potential negative impact on the surroundings. Statkraft works to achieve sustainable utilization of natural resources, and Environmental focus strives to achieve outstanding environmental performance, both locally and in Statkraft globally. Leading international practice is the measure for the work we do and the results Statkraft wants to achieve. International and recognised standards are used as a basis for planning, implementation, measurement and reporting of the Group’s environmental work. Production of environmentally friendly energy Production of environmentally friendly energy is Statkraft’s most important contribution to the environment. In 2010, 88.1 per cent of Statkraft’s energy production was based on renewable energy sources. Hydropower has high operational efficiency and is a flexible and mature energy technology with a long economic life. Hydropower can also offer important multi-use functions such as flood mitigation, irrigation, transport and recreation. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 107 The Group’s non-renewable energy production includes gas-fired power and a small part of the district heating production. Gas-fired power plants with gas and steam turbines involve a low-carbon technology with lower emissions and higher operational efficiency than oil and coal-fired power plants. Gas-fired power is a flexible technology and can therefore be used to balance variable renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Most important environmental challenges Statkraft’s core business, hydro and wind power, entails interventions in the natural environment, both in ecosystems and the landscape. Areas used for energy production activities also have a value as habitats for animals and plants, as agricultural land and as recreational areas. It is possible to facilitate multi-purpose use of these areas through careful interventions adapted to local conditions. Statkraft works actively and systematically with mitigating and compensating measures to reduce potential negative environmental effects, such as strategic R&D programmes. The current and future environmental challenges are a natural part of our strategic focus and we work continuously to balance the consideration for supply safety and the environment. Overall guidelines The code of conduct and the Group environment principles define overall guidelines for Statkraft’s environmental work. Statkraft’s code of conduct states that we will support the precautionary principle as regards environmental challenges, take initiatives to promote increased responsibility for the environment and encourage development and proliferation of environmentally friendly technology. The Group’s environmental management system is designed in accordance with the requirements in ISO 14001:2004, and parts of the activities have been certified in accordance with this standard. Concern for the environment in all processes Concern for the environment has been integrated into all processes in the Group, from planning and choice of partners to operations and follow-up. Identification of environmental risk, implementation of measures, securing the necessary expertise as well as registration, follow-up and learning from all incidents are all key elements in the Group’s environmental work. The Group’s international development projects are planned and implemented with emphasis on with the International Finance Corporation’s guidelines relating to sustainable behaviour. For the environment, this entails impact analyses of environmental impact and systematic handling of environmental aspects through the entire project process. Statkraft also expects the suppliers to demonstrate concern for the environment, and environmental requirements have been set out in all supplier contracts. Participation in external arenas Statkraft is an active participant in external environmental arenas, both nationally and internationally. For example, both Statkraft and SN Power have in recent years been active in driving the process to develop criteria for sustainable development and operation of hydropower plants that is underway in the International Hydropower Association (IHA). Statkraft is a member and active participant in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and we assisted in the preparations for COP 16 in Cancun in 2010. Statkraft also cooperates also with several NGOs, including WWF, the Norwegian Society for the Preservation of Nature and Bellona. The purpose is to benefit from each other’s expertise and experience and thus increase the production of renewable energy and enhance the sustainability of renewable energy production. Greenhouse gases from water reservoirs Since 2003, Statkraft has been involved in international research into emission of greenhouse gases from water reservoirs. The work is particularly focused on establishing an internationally recognised measuring method for calculation of net emissions of the greenhouse gas methane. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 108 Climate Statkraft’s production of renewable energy is part of the solution to the climate challenges. The Group’s own emissions of greenhouse gases are very low compared to other industry and come principally from our gasfired power plants. 93 per cent from gas-fired power In 2010, the total emissions were 1.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents. The bulk of this, 93%, comes from the Group’s gas-fired power activities. The relative emission of CO2 equivalents in 2010 was 44 kg/MWh. The Group buys climate quotas in the voluntary CO2 quota market to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from that part of the business that is not subject to mandatory quota schemes. This applies to fuel consumption, business travel and some accidental emissions of the greenhouse gas SF6, and amounted to 10 200 tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2010. STATKRAFT’S EMISSIONS OF CO2 EQUIVALENTS 2010 AREA TOTAL PERCENTAGE OF COMMENT EMISSIONS STATKRAFT’S (TONNES) EMISSIONS) Gas-fired power 1 568 000 92,6 plants District heating 115 200 6,8 The emissions come from the non-renewable share of waste and some oil. Transport 8 000 0,5 Statkraft wants to reduce the amount of business travel and facilitates video conferences and conference calls. Measures have also been implemented to reduce CO2 emissions from Statkraft’s fleet of vehicles. CO2 emissions from business travel were 3700 tonnes in 2010, which is a reduction of 500 tonnes from 2009. Accidental 2 200 0,1 Minor emissions of the greenhouse gases halon and SF6 emissions can result from our activities, and halon also has an ozone-depleting effect. There were no halon emissions in 2010. Emission trading and green energy Statkraft is engaged in trading with all types of greenhouse gas emission quotas permitted in the European quota trading system (EU ETS). We trade in EUAs (European Union Allowances), CERs (Certified Emission Reductions) and ERUs (Emission Reduction Units). We also participate in projects under the green development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) and JI (Joint Implementation), and we buy emission permits directly from such projects. In addition, Statkraft offers guarantees of origin, a document guaranteeing the source of a given amount of electricity. Power suppliers often purchase guarantees of origin in order to provide documentation to their customers on the type of power supplied. Statkraft is not only a leading player in the use of Kyoto mechanisms, but also in engineering products that help customers reduce the cost of (CO2) compliance. For example, in 2010, Statkraft closed a large deal where Statkraft will deliver project credits to a Dutch energy company for EU ETS phase 3 (2012 2020). ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 109 Biodiversity Statkraft works actively to increase the knowledge of our impact on ecosystems and the landscape, and we implement measure to minimise our ecological footprint. Mitigating and compensating measures In order to reduce potential negative environmental effects related to Statkraft’s activities, we work actively and continuously to implement mitigating and compensating measures. An important focus area in this regard is sustainable fish populations in our river systems and lakes. The Group operates nine fish cultivation facilities and is a large producer of stocking fish and fish eggs in Norway and Sweden. We also carry out comprehensive freshwater biology studies and operate two of Norway’s three salmon gene banks. ππ Elvelangs The Elvelangs (along the river) project, which runs from 2007 to 2012, involves using NOK 15 million to improve conditions for angling and outdoor recreation along several regulated Norwegian river systems. Many different measures have been initiated, including: ππ Construction of campsites in Folgefonna national park ππ Fish restocking with large trout in the Totak river to keep the population of small fish down ππ Fishing courses for young people at the Suldalslågen river ππ Eel migration The European eel is currently under threat of extinction, and the eel is therefore a focus area in connection with regulation of river systems where this species can be found. Sexually mature silver eels can be up to 120 cm long and are particularly vulnerable to being injured in turbines when migrating out of regulated rivers. To contribute to protection of eel populations, Statkraft has, in cooperation with authorities, research institutions and other hydropower players, developed and carried out various measures in Swedish and German regulated rivers. In Sweden, the eel is moved downstream of the power plants, while turbine control systems are being developed in Germany to improve eel survival rates. Energy consumption In 2010, electricity consumption In Statkraft was 737 GWh, of which 75% was used for pumped-storaged hydropower. All electricity used to operate plants and offices has been certified as renewable in accordance with RECS. Statkraft will save energy A major energy efficiency project was initiated at Statkraft’s Norwegian hydropower plants in 2010. The objective is a 35 per cent reduction of internal energy consumption by 2014, which will be achieved through installation of management systems, plant supervision and energy management, as well as evaluation of alternative equipment and maintenance solutions. Aura power plant at Sunndalsøra is the first Statkraft power plant to implement energysaving methods. Relatively simple measures such as reducing the amount of energy used for heating, lighting and ventilation through monitoring of control systems have resulted in significantly reduced energy consumption.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 110 Customer programmes for more efficient energy use The power sales companies in Statkraft offer products, information, advice and tools to facilitate efficient energy use to both households and businesses. For households, we market various energy-saving measures, and for businesses, our products include webbased tools for overview and planning of optimal electricity consumption. Statkraft’s operation of hydro, wind and gas-fired power plants entails Local pollution and considerably lower production of waste, emissions and discharges waste management compared with other industry. The Group emphasises systematic waste handling where source separation and high recovery rates are key elements. All hazardous waste is processed in accordance with applicable regulations. Local pollution Statkraft faces only limited challenges as regards local pollution. The operation of gas-fired power plants entails emissions of NOX as well as discharge of cooling water. District heating plants entail emissions of NOX and SOX. These emissions may result in eutrophication and/or acidification, but the effect depends on the vulnerability of nearby areas. In 2010, a study on NOX emissions from gas-fired power plants in Germany was carried out. The study concluded that the emissions have no negative impact on local vulnerable nature areas in Germany. This conclusion must, however, be seen in connection with the gas-fired power plants location in an area already strongly characterised by industrial activity. Noise, dust and odours may occur locally in connection with transport, construction and operation of plants. The Group’s activities also entail a certain risk of oil spills from vehicles, as well as construction and production equipment.

There were no recorded serious environmental incidents in 2010, but 92 less serious environmental incidents that had little or no impact on the environment were reported. Most of these were in connection with minor and short-term breaches of the river management regulations and minor oil spills. Waste management Statkraft works systematically to manage waste and aims to source separate and recycle as much as possible. 84 072 tonnes of hazardous waste was generated in Statkraft in 2010. More than 99 per cent came from the Group’s biomass plant in Germany and residual products from the district heating plant in Trondheim. All hazardous waste is treated in accordance with applicable guidelines. In addition, slightly more than 8000 tonnes of other waste was generated.

HEALTH AND SAFETY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 111 Health and safety Safety is always priority number one in Statkraft. The Group works actively and systematically to achieve a working environment that is free of injuries, promotes health and strives for an open and preventive health and safety culture. All incidents are therefore registered, analysed and followed up in a systematic manner, both in the operations and the projects. Health and safety is also a key component of the Group’s expertise building and management training. In 2010, five people died in connection with activities where Statkraft is involved. All fatal accidents took place in associated activities. One contractor and four individuals from the communities near our plants lost their lives. In addition, there were two fatal accidents in associated activities at the beginning of 2011. 52 lost-time injuries were recorded among the Group’s employees and contractors in 2010. The H1 value was 3.4 for employees and 13.6 for contractors. Safe and healthy Statkraft is working actively to achieve our goal of zero injuries in a health workplace promoting working environment. The health and safety aspects must be identified and assessed prior to all operations and maintenance activities. The concern for health and safety is an important element of project development and in selecting partners and suppliers. All injuries and hazardous conditions are recorded, analysed and followed up in a systematic manner. Organisation of health and safety work Each individual operating unit and each individual project is responsible for health and safety always being priority number one. All employees also have a responsibility for carrying out their work in accordance with internal and external health and safety requirements. In addition, the corporate staff facilitates systematic health and safety work, for example through the use of guidelines, performance analysis and audit activities. HSE is a key element in the cooperation between the employee organisations and the management, for example through established working environment committees and safety delegates. Common management system Statkraft has a common management system for health and safety based on the international OHSAS 18001 standard. This ensures a common approach and follow-up of health and safety regardless of unit and geography. Common guidelines are prepared for a number of areas, for example as regards reporting and investigation of incidents, handling of chemicals and emergency preparedness plans. A new system for recording, analysis and follow-up of incidents, Emendo, was introduced in 2010. The system focuses on learning from recorded incidents. In 2010, the work has focused on preparing and implementing clear guidelines for notification and investigation of serious incidents, and maximum learning effect across the organisation has been facilitated. Furthermore, checklists and procedures have been prepared to ensure systematic attention to health and safety in all project phases, from planning and tender work to construction and operations. This work will be continued in 2011. Expertise Education and training related to desirable health and safety conduct is a key factor in achieving zero injuries. Basic health and safety information is included in the introduction for new employees and in the management programs. A web-based health and safety HEALTH AND SAFETY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 112 course is under development. Safety delegates and members of the Working Environment Committee attend 40-hour health and safety courses with regular updates. Emergency preparedness Emergency preparedness plans have been prepared for all operating units in the Group and regular emergency drills are held to ensure efficient handling of serious situations. Third party safety Statkraft must ensure that third parties do not suffer injury or damage as a result of the company’s activities. Measures must be implemented in cases with identified health or safety risk. Such measures may include signposting, installing of hand rails or deployment of rescue equipment. Ensuring that neighbouring local communities receive detailed information on Statkraft’s presence and the resulting health and safety risks to the local population is especially important. In 2010, four people from local communities around Statkraft’s plants died in accidents. Sickness absence Sickness absence in Statkraft has in recent years been stable at a low level and was 3.4 per cent in 2010. The objective is to keep the sickness absence below 4 per cent. All Norwegian companies in the Group are so-called IA companies, which entails active follow-up of absence and close cooperation with the company health service. Traffic safety award to Region Central Norway Region Central Norway received the traffic safety award from Sogn og Fjordane county council in 2010. The award was given for the region’s work to put traffic safety on the agenda, for example by offering all employees courses in safe driving and traffic behaviour. Accidents A total of five fatal accidents were recorded in connection with the Group’s activities in 2010. In addition, a contractor employee in THXP in Laos died in January 2011 and an employee of the Istad Group in Norway died in February 2011. All fatal accidents in 2010 took place in associated activities where one contractor employee in the Allain Duhangan project (India) and four people (three in Laos and one in Norway) from the local communities near our plants lost their lives. In total, 52 lost-time injuries and 81 injuries overall were recorded among the Group’s employees and contractors in 2010. Both the lost-time injuries and injuries frequency (H1 and H2) are significantly higher for contractors than for own employees. Five fatal accidents in 2010 in associated activities One contractor died at SN Power’s Allain Duhangan development project (India). The contractor fell from a mast in connection with stringing cable. Since construction started in 2006, a total of 16 people have died in work accidents at the Allain Duhangan project, where Statkraft has a 43 per cent shareholding. As a consequence of the many fatal accidents, a new project manager was appointed in 2009 and international health and safety expertise made available to the project. In spite of the fatal accident in March 2010, increased and continuous focus on safety has significantly improved the project’s injury statistics. Three people from the local community around Theun Hinboun (Laos), including one child, died in connection with Statkraft’s installations 2010. Two of the accidents took place in connection with swimming/fishing, while the third accident was a collision between a motorcycle and a construction vehicle. Also in Agder Energi, one person died after making his way into a fenced-in area and then falling into a turbine pipe to a disused power plant. HEALTH AND SAFETY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 113 Several measures have been implemented following the fatal accidents, for example increased focus on current guidelines for working at heights, use of safety equipment and renewed information to neighbouring communities on risks and hazards in connection with Statkraft’s installations. Statkraft works continuously to achieve increased understanding for and compliance with safety requirements in all companies and development projects the Group is involved in. The health and safety work is followed up directly in the projects and through Statkraft’s representation in the boards for the companies this applies to. 52 lost-time injuries in 2010 The H1 indicator (number of lost-time injuries per million working hours) was 3.4 (3.8 in 2009) among employees, while H1 among the Group’s contractors was 13.6 (8.0 in 2009). Correspondingly, the H2 indicator (number of injuries per million working hours) among employees was 6.8 (8.4 in 2009) and 16.4 among contractors. In total, 81 injuries were recorded, of which 52 lost-time injuries, among the Group’s employees and contractors. Operations have seen a positive development in recent years, with H1 reduced every year, from 7.2 in 2004 to 3.4 in 2010. A clear zero injuries goal, increased attention to reporting and analysis of incidents and observations, as well as more stringent requirements for examination of serious conditions are assumed to be the reason for the positive development. The health and safety results for the company’s development projects are not yet satisfactory. Statkraft emphasises that the same goals and requirements for health and safety, including physically safeguarding assets and people, apply everywhere and in all activities involving Statkraft. Clear requirements and close follow-up in all project phases are essential to achieving safe and sound workplaces. Unsafe conditions and near-misses The safety culture in the Group must be characterised by transparency, cooperation and willingness to comply. Follow-up of incidents and observations is an important part of this and 3164 hazardous conditions and 114 near-misses were recorded in 2010, (5597 in 2009). Safeguarding All buildings, plants and infrastructure in Statkraft are secured against people and assets unauthorized personnel. Activities in areas with political instability entail increased need for security measures that, if the risk profile so indicates, may include armed guards. Securing of plants All Statkraft buildings, plants and infrastructure are secured against unauthorised personnel. The purpose of this is both to secure the Group’s assets against theft, vandalism, etc., but also to protect third parties against hazards in connection with the Group’s installations. Security Statkraft is now involved in development activities in countries and areas which can be politically unstable. This entails an increased need to secure people and assets, for example through continuous presence of guards who may, should the risk situation so warrant, be armed. Statkraft operates in accordance with applicable Norwegian laws and regulations and applicable laws and regulations in the countries where we are active. Clear guidelines have been prepared for how security for people and assets should be handled in operational and project-related activities. These will be based on international best practice, including: HEALTH AND SAFETY / EMPLOYEES STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 114 ππ The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights ππ The UN Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials ππ The UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials The guidelines apply to all employees and contractors, and all incidents in this area are recorded, analysed and followed up. Employees Statkraft’s employees, current and future, are the company’s most important asset. The Group therefore works systematically to make Statkraft an exciting, attractive and enriching workplace. In the Universum Student Survey 2010, engineering and business administration students in Norway ranked Statkraft as Norway’s fifth and 17th most attractive workplace, respectively. At the end of 2010/beginning of 2011, the Group had 3301 full-time Statkraft as equivalents, a slight reduction from the preceding year. Statkraft remains a an employer popular employer, both among students and the working population. Reduction in the number of full-time equivalents Statkraft’s workforce was reduced by 77 permanent full-time equivalents in 2010, corresponding to a reduction of 2.3 per cent. As of 31 December 2010, the Group had 3301 full-time equivalents (3378 as of 31 December 2009). The main reasons for the reduction are limitations on the number of new employees, divestment of units and a minor increase in staff turnover. The effect of the staff/support programme has not been taken into account in the full-time equivalent figure as of 31 December 2010. The Group now has employees in 20 countries, and 28 per cent of the staff works outside Norway. Statkraft is a popular workplace Universum Student Survey is Norway’s largest career, working life and future expectations survey among students. Over the course of the last ten years, Statkraft has made steady progress in the ranking of attractive employers. In the 2010 survey, engineering students ranked Statkraft fifth (same place as in 2009), while business administration students ranked Statkraft as the 17th most attractive employer (25th in 2009). The positive development is a result of a goal-oriented effort to market Statkraft to students as an attractive workplace. Statkraft’s two-year trainee programme is an attractive option. The trainee programme is also an important measure to ensure that Statkraft maintains good access to the expertise necessary to ensure future profitability and growth. In 2010, a total of 17 trainees were at work in different parts of the Group. In recent years, the trainee programme has achieved a more international profile, and 2010 saw the first trainees at offices abroad. Several of the trainees have been assigned to Statkraft’s development projects abroad in their first trainee period, and 2011 will be the first year that SN Power participates in the programme. Statkraft also achieved good results in the Universum Professionals Survey, which measures popularity among employees with an average 5.5 years of work experience. Among engineers, Statkraft was ranked ninth in 2010 (eleventh in 2009), while business professional rank Statkraft as Norway’s 14th best workplace (17th in 2009). Collective and performance-related salary schemes Statkraft has established performance-related salary schemes. The schemes vary in the various companies and disbursement is based on different indices which may reflect factors such as operational performance and health and safety performance. The collective EMPLOYEES STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 115 variable salary scheme disbursed NOK x000-x000 per employee in the various Group companies in 2010. In addition, the parent company’s Norwegian activities and Trondheim Energi have a scheme involving performance-related salary. This is based on goal attainment and compliance with Statkraft’s values and requirements for managers, and has an upper limit for each individual employee of 10 per cent of own salary. SN Power has established a similar scheme where the ceiling for each individual employee is 10-20 per cent of own salary. Organisation Statkraft regularly conducts surveys to evaluate the organisation and and management management of the parent company and the subsidiaries. The results from the surveys are generally very good. Statkraft has special management programmes and a systematic manager evaluation and follow-up scheme. Organisation and management evaluation Statkraft regularly conducts surveys to evaluate the organisation and management of the parent company and the subsidiaries. The surveys cover topics such as strategy, goals, expertise, ethics and corporate responsibility, organisational factors and working environment. The overall performance is reported to the corporate management and board of directors. Various surveys were carried out in the different companies in 2010. Excellent results were the common denominator. These surveys indicate that Statkraft has passionate and competent employees that are happy in their work and identify strongly with their employer. Management follow-up In 2010, 206 managers participated in the Group’s management programmes. The programmes are undergoing continuous development and are adapted to new challenges, including those that result from international growth. The revised introduction tool for new managers, Leadership in Statkraft, was introduced in 2010. Statkraft also has its own training programme for project managers, and 132 employees participated in these programmes in 2010. Statkraft has developed and implemented a systematic and comprehensive evaluation and follow-up of managers, both as regards performance and behaviour.

More diversity among the company’s employees will strengthen us in our nationalities represented in our workforce in 20 countries international development, for example by providing us with necessary expertise as regards legal matters and administration processes, language and local customs. The average seniority in Statkraft is 8.5 years, while staff turnover in the workforce was 3.9 per cent in 2010. Role in society Statkraft wants to be a positive contributor in the communities where we are active. We want to maintain an open and continuous dialogue with all stakeholders, be they customers, the owner, potential employees, environmental organizations or people that are otherwise affected by our activities. An active dialogue with our stakeholders will be essential to succeed with our strategy to be a responsible player in an increasingly globalised market – and to develop the company in a manner that increases the value for the shareholder and the local communities and countries where we operate. Economic value creation The below figures illustrate Statkraft’s economic value creation in 2010. From Society statement: Economic value creation: NOK 17 472 million Dividend to the State: NOK 5973 million Taxes and fees to the state and local authorities in Norway: NOK 6679 million Tax contribution: Tax contribution to Norwegian local authorities: NOK 1349.3 million Tax contribution to the ten municipalities that received the most: NOK 659.5 million Five local authorities that receive the most: ππ Vinje – NOK 96.5 million ππ Hemnes – NOK 90.3 million ππ Suldal – NOK 86.7 million ππ Rana NOK 77.0 million ππ Tokke NOK 56.5 million Investments: Total investments: NOK 3740 million ππ In Norway: NOK 1999 million ππ Outside Norway: NOK 1741 million Goods and services purchased: Total: Nok 5000 million Total number of suppliers: 7200 Employment: In Norway: 2365 full-time equivalents Outside Norway: 936 full-time equivalents ROLE IN SOCIETY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 117 Values stay in Northern Norway A study carried out by the Bodø Graduate School of Business shows that Statkraft’s creation of value in Northern Norway measured in benefit to society and local importance equalled NOK 1 billion in 2009. Innovation Innovation is part of Statkraft’s contribution to society. Activities within innovation, research and development will strengthen the Group’s competitive advantage as a leader in renewable and flexible power production and contribute to reaching our business objectives. Technology analysis, continuous operational improvements, R&D programmes and longterm projects are key elements in the innovation drive. Innovation with focus on the core business Statkraft’s innovation strategy is closely linked to the Group’s core business. The innovation efforts in Statkraft are directed towards projects that will give us more knowledge and enable us to meet the world’s need for clean energy. Statkraft has three own R&D programmes aimed at the Group’s strategic focus areas , namely hydropower, wind power and bio-energy: ππ The hydropower programme Future Hydro Power covers Statkraft’s focus on flexible power production in Northwestern Europe and hydropower in emerging markets. The objective is to develop methods, systems and technology to improve project development, development, operations and market operations in connection with hydropower. ππ The wind power programme Competitive Wind Power covers onshore and offshore wind power. The objective is to increase the company’s ability to exploit existing expertise and technology and to make Statkraft one of the most cost-effective wind power players. ππ The bio-programme Energy from Biomass is closely connected to Statkraft’s district heating plants. The objective is to reduce the risk and fuel costs in the district heating activities, to increase the share of renewable energy in district heating production, and to increase Statkraft’s ability to invest in projects within combined heat and power production based on bio-energy. In addition to own R&D projects, Statkraft participates in several jointly financed research programmes. Examples include research centres for renewable energy within hydropower (Cedren), wind power (Nowitech and Norcove), bio-energy (Cenbio) and carbon capture and storage (BigCCS). Statkraft also participates in the British Offshore Wind Accelerator programme. Technology analyses to monitor trends and identify opportunities Monitoring and analysis of technology development, trends, drivers and barriers form part of Statkraft’s innovation work. The work helps to identify current and future costs for technologies that Statkraft uses or that compete with technologies Statkraft uses. The analyses can provide a basis for new initiatives and business areas for Statkraft. Osmotic power Statkraft also invests in selected long-term innovation projects. Osmotic power is one example. Statkraft has researched osmotic power for ten years and is today a world leader in the development of osmotic power. Osmotic power is a renewable and emission-free energy source that could make a significant contribution to environmentally friendly energy production. The concept involves producing electricity by exploiting the energy that is generated when fresh water and salt water meet. Statkraft’s prototype facility at Tofte is used for testing and development, and Statkraft aims to make an investment decision for an osmotic power pilot in 2013. ROLE IN SOCIETY STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 118 Membrane conference In 2010, Statkraft co-hosted an international membrane conference in San Diego. Statkraft’s experiences from the osmotic power plant at Tofte received a lot of attention. An increasing number of players are working on the technology in the US, Europe and Asia, and Statkraft received confirmation of its position as a world leader in the field. Sponsorship agreements The Group has both national and regional sponsor agreements, in addition and branding to supporting local causes within culture and sports. Sponsor agreements also form part of Statkraft’s reputation and branding activities. Statkraft’s sponsor agreements Statkraft spent about NOK 24 million on sponsor agreements in 2010. The Group currently has sponsor agreements with: ππ The Norwegian Biathlon Union ππ Det Norske Teatret ππ Oslo Jazzfestival ππ The Nobel Peace Prize concert ππ Hardanger Musikkfest Photo: Mimsy Møller In addition, Statkraft supports sports and culture in the local communities where we are present. Building reputation and brand Statkraft wants to be perceived as a leading commercial player that works to meet the world’s need for cleaner energy. The main purpose of goal-oriented communication and branding is to increase knowledge of and about the Group’s role, activities and results. Polls in Norway show that the Group’s reputation among decision-makers and the financial community is at a stable high level. Among the population in general, the percentage that have a fairly good or very good impression of Statkraft has dropped somewhat in 2010. In 2010, the Statkraft Fund awarded a total of NOK 5 million to Norwegian The statkraft fund Church Aid, the Science Centre of Northern Norway, the Norwegian Red Cross, Renewable World and the New Ålesund Symposium in 2010. What is the Statkraft Fund? The Statkraft Fund has been established to support causes that benefit the greater community. The Fund disburses up to NOK 5 million annually to volunteer organisations, foundations or similar upon application from the recipient or initiative from Statkraft’s management. The projects must have a clear connection with Statkraft’s activities and be primarily directed towards developing countries. Recipients focus on energy, climate and sustainable development In accordance with Statkraft’s work to develop more renewable energy both in Europe and in developing countries, the fund was awarded to organisations and projects that, in various ways, focus on the relationships between energy, climate and sustainable development in 2010. The recipients were: ππ Norwegian Church Aid received to NOK 1 million in total for two projects: One project aims to provide electricity to four villages in Zambia using solar power. The other project will provide clean potable water to people in Ethiopia – an effort that Norwegian Church Aid has been involved in for more than 20 years. ππ The Science Centre of Northern Norway received NOK 1 million for the work to increase interest in natural sciences and technology among young people. Energy, climate and ROLE IN SOCIETY / SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 119 sustainable development are among the centre’s main focus areas. The funds will be used for a new education room in Tromsø. ππ The Norwegian Red Cross received NOK 500 000 for the organisation’s global climate centre in the Netherlands. The centre works to prevent humanitarian consequences of climate change. The funds will be used for climate-related measures in countries at risk of climate-related disasters. ππ Renewable World received NOK 500 000 for the development of small-scale, locally operated power projects in developing countries. The organisation is based in the UK and cooperates with RenewableUK and the European Wind Energy Association. ππ The Ny-Ålesund Symposium received NOK 2 million, following an earlier award from the Statkraft Fund. The symposium gathers researchers, politicians and business leaders from all over the world to discuss climate and environmental issues under the Arctic skies of Svalbard. Sustainability Statkraft’s sustainability statement shall describe the company’s statement sustainability performance clearly and correctly. Guidelines for sustainability reporting Statkraft has guidelines that describe the Group’s sustainability reporting, and all relevant units report their sustainability performance accordingly. The goal is to make all information complete and correct, but there may be uncertainty as regards some of the material. Scope of the statement The sustainability reporting mainly follows the Group’s accounting principles for treatment of subsidiaries, partly-owned power plants and associated companies. Sustainability data are collected from all companies where Statkraft is the majority owner, and these are included in the accounts in their entirety. The main principle is that the presented sustainability data should cover the entire Group, but this has not been possible for some indicators. These cases have been explained in their respective notes. The notes also clarify some terms, explain major, year-on-year changes and describe any changes in calculation methods.

The Report is part of the Statkraft Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2010 on the Internet (www.annualreport2010.statkraft.com). The Report includes the Sustainability Statement published also in the printed Statkraft Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2010. The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of Statkraft AS (“the Company”). Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on emerging best practice and standards for independent assurance on sustainability reporting, including ISAE 3000, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board as well as on the principles of AA1000 Assurance Standard issued by AccountAbility. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the Company and included in the subject matters on which we provide our conclusions below. Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have performed interviews with management responsible for sustainability aspects at corporate and at selected reporting units represented by the head office of Statkraft Sweden – Hydropower and the head offices of the Company’s subsidiaries Skagerak Energi and SN Power. We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to provide a conclusion with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than if an audit-level engagement had been performed. Separate from, and not impacting, our conclusions stated below we have provided “Auditor’s commentary and recommendations”, presented in the Report. Conclusions In conclusion, in all material respects, nothing has come to our attention causing us not to believe that:  Statkraft has established systems to identify, manage and to involve stakeholders on material aspects related to sustainable value creation, as described in the Report, in accordance with the principles of AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard.  Statkraft applies procedures to identify, collect, compile and validate data and information for 2010 to be included in the Report, as described in the Report. Data presented for 2010 is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately presented in the Report.  The management systems referred to above have been implemented and locally adopted as necessary at the reporting units that we have visited, as specified above. Data for 2010 from these units has been reported according to the procedures noted above and is consistent with source documentation presented to us.  Statkraft applies a reporting practice for its sustainability reporting aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines reporting principles and the reporting fulfils Application Level B+ according to the GRI guidelines. The GRI Index presented in the Report appropriately reflects where information on each of the elements and indicators of the GRIs guidelines is to be found within the Statkraft Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2010 on the Internet. Oslo, Norway, 16 March 2011 Deloitte AS Preben J. Sørensen State Authorised Public Accountant (Corporate Responsibility) Deloitte refers to one or more of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, a UK Limited company, and its network of member firms, each of which is a legally separate and independent entity. Please see www.deloitte.com/no/omoss for a detailed description of the legal structure of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and its member firms. Org.nr: 980 211 282 SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 121 Auditor’s statement Auditor’s commentary and recommendations In addition to the independent auditor’s report on the Statkraft Sustainability Report 2010 (the Report) included in the Statkraft Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2010 (www.annualreport2010.statkraft.com) we provide the management of Statkraft with a management letter including observations and recommendations based on our work. According to the requirements of the AA1000 Assurance Standard a summary of our comments and recommendations to the Statkraft management and certain complementary formal information is summarized below. Comments and recommendations As in previous years, Statkraft’s sustainability reporting for 2010 integrates sustainability information in the annual report. The reporting is for the second time web-based. A shorter printed version has been prepared to comply with the minimum requirements by law. The printed version also includes the Statkraft Sustainability Statement for 2010 demonstrating that sustainability has a high priority at Statkraft. The sustainability reporting for 2010 provides a comprehensive picture of how Statkraft works with sustainability and describes relevant initiatives and actions taken in 2010. The reporting supports Statkraft’s vision of meeting the world’s need for pure energy and the company’s values – competence, responsibility, and innovation. The reporting also demonstrates how Statkraft follow-up on their business principles for HR, health and safety, the environment, and corporate responsibility. The sustainability report for 2010 only to a minor extent presents specific targets on sustainability issues. We recommend Statkraft to develop targets and to report more extensively on targets and performance against such targets in coming sustainability reports. Following the changes in Statkraft’s group management in 2010 a new strategy for Statkraft was developed and organizational changes were implemented. This included a merge of the staff units HSE (Health, safety and environment) and CR (Corporate Responsibility). In our opinion this may ensure a suitable utilization of adjacent resources and the building of a strong corporate staff function within this area. The focus on organizational changes and new strategy in 2010 may have caused some delay in the efforts to update steering documents and the implementation of planned activities and initiatives within Corporate Responsibility. Examples are implementation of a specific supplier code of conduct and the Statkraft anti-corruption handbook and accompanying training program. This work should be carried through in 2011 as planned. Statkraft’s group management strongly focuses on the challenges that meet Statkraft to improve HSE performance and in particular related to fatal accidents. These challenges are highly linked to project development and activities in developing countries as well as in joint ventures where Statkraft does not have majority share. HSE considerations in project development and in the continued international growth process should still be a high priority. We observe that Statkraft places great emphasis in continuously improving their project development and purchasing processes, based on experience and including HSE and CR considerations as a mandatory part of the process. Statkraft has in 2010 updated the procedure for collection of information and data in the area of sustainability. The procedure is based on the Global Reporting Intitiative’s sustainability reporting SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 122 guidelines for the energy industry and adjusted to Statkraft’s priorities and needs. We still find that the quality of the reporting varies dependent upon reporting units. We perceive, however, that Statkraft is committed to ensure quality in its reporting on sustainability, and expect that this work will remain a priority. Formal information and limitations Information presented above is a summary of issues addressed in our management letter to the management of Statkraft. The full management letter is intended for the management of Statkraft who is familiar with the context, decisions and subjects dealt with in the Report. Management also knows the engagement letter directing our engagement. The objectives and terms of our engagement are stated in our assurance statement referred to above. While we recognize that stakeholders of Statkraft may find information in this document useful, and while we have no bias towards any particular outcome, we do not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than Statkraft, for information provided in this document. As requested by AA1000 Assurance Standard we note that we are independent of Statkraft and that we comply with all relevant legislation and requirements on independence. Both the company and Deloitte have extensive measures in place to safeguard auditor’s independence and we comply with such measures. We also note that Deloitte and the team that provided this assurance engagement to Statkraft possess the necessary competency. GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI) STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 123 Global Reporting In order to enable external stakeholders to analyse and compare the Initiative (GRI) company’s sustainability performance, the results must be prepared and collated in a systematic and uniform manner. Since 1997, GRI has worked to create a more standardised format for corporate sustainability reporting. About GRI GRI develops industry-adapted guidelines for sustainability reporting. The guidelines define essential reporting principles and a number of indicators for all sustainability areas. GRI develops tools for sustainability reporting The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent organisation which, since its establishment in 1997, has worked to create a more standardised format for corporate sustainability reporting. The latest version of GRI’s guidelines (G3) for sustainability reporting was issued in the autumn of 2006. In 2009, guidelines specially prepared for the energy industry (Electric Utilities Sector Supplement) were approved. GRI defines ten reporting principles. Four of these deal with establishing the scope and contents of the report, while the remaining six address the quality of the information presented. Furthermore, GRI defines a number of indicators, distributed between core and additional indicators, for enterprise profile, economy, environment, working conditions, human rights, social and product responsibility. Description of follow-up and management mechanisms is also requested for all areas. Different levels for sustainability reporting GRI facilitates sustainability reporting at different levels – A, B and C – where A is the highest level. In addition, the reporting level is marked with a ”+” if the reporting has been verified by an external third party. Statkraft’s GRI-index Since 2002, Statkraft has issued information about sustainability strategy and performance. From 2004, the reporting has been based on GRI’s guidelines. Statkraft’s sustainability reporting for 2010 is based on GRI’s Energy Utilities Sector Supplement. In Statkraft’s opinion, the Group’s reporting practice is in line with GRI’s ten basic reporting principles and the reporting conforms with GRI level B. Statkraft’s sustainability reporting has been verified by an external auditor to make the reporting conform with level B+. Explanations Reported = The indicator has been reported completely or partially Not reported = The indicator has not been reported Not significant = The indicator has been considered as insignificant on the Group level * = Additional indicator in GRI’s Energy Utilities Sector Supplement EU = Indicator numbers starting with EU mean that the indicator is specific for the energy utilities sector GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI) STATKRAFT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 124 REFERENCE / RESPOND STATUS PROFILE Strategy and analysis 1.1 Statement from the CEO President and CEO Reported 1.2 Description of key impacts, risks, and opportunities President and CEO Reported Report from the Board of Directors Risk management and internal control for increased value creation Corporate Governance Corporate Responsibility in Statkraft Organisasjon 2.1 Name of the organisation Statkraft AS Reported 2.2 Primary brands, products, and/or services Facts Reported Report from the Board of Directors 2.3 Operational structure of the organisation Organisation Reported 2.4 Location of organisation's headquarters Oslo, Norway Reported 2.5 Countries where the organisation operates Facts Reported 2.6 Nature of ownership and legal form Stateowned limited company Reported 2.7 Markets served Facts Reported Report from the Board of Directors 2.8 Scale of the reporting organisation Facts Reported 2010 Financial key figures Non-financial key figures 2.9 Significant changes regarding size, structure, or ownership Report from the Board of Directors Reported Note 3: Important events Note 4: Acquisitions and business combinations 2.10 Awards received in the reporting period Region Midt-Norge (RG MN Norway) was awarded Reported the traffic safety award from Sogn og Fjordane fylkeskommune.
