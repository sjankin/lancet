The 14% increase in chemicals/auxilliary material and 9% increase in consumption of packaging materials primarily originate from a change in product mix and extraordinary consumption of N2 for cooling purposes. A new packaging concept will be implemented in 2011/12, which is expected to reduce our packaging material consumption. We will strive to reduce the consumption of materials per produced unit from 2011/12 and onwards.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2010/11 16 Note 4 Energy The total energy consumption increased by 1% compared to 2009/10. Except for steam usage there were no significant changes in the consumption pattern. The steam consumption was reduced by 8% which is a result of energy optimization. Focus on insulation has improved the energy consumption profile significantly for the involved production site. District heating and natural gas increased due to a cold winter in 2010/11. Energy focus is an important part of our strategy towards 2020.

However a 4% decrease is observed for potable water. It is a normalization compared to 2009/10 and a result of increased focus on water consumption. It is worth noticing that the production volume increased in the same period. The effort continues. Reducing water consumption is a high priority target and part of our 2020 strategy.

Phosphorous (Total P) was reduced by 25% and nitrogen (Total N) by 8% compared to 2009/10. The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) was reduced by 4%. The main reason was implementation of new waste water handling in France, where more concentrated biomass is reused as fertilizer, feed or biogas production. We expect further reduction of nutients in 2011/12 where the new setup will be fully implemented.

The decrease relates to a change in the product mix and reallocation of activities like outsourcing of processes. All biomass is utilized as liquid fertilizer, liquid feed or for biogas production. The volume of recycled biomass is expected to increase in 2011/12 due to new waste stream handling at our production site in France.

In comparison the total recycled waste increased by 6%. The overall recycling percentage is unchanged at 21%. The specific recycling within each category fluctuated considerably compared to last financial year. The explanation is that a few sites have got new recycling fractions and others have carried out clean-up activities like recycling production equipment. The 19% increase in hazardous waste also originates from scrapping.

The energy consumption did not increase significantly and the energy mix did not change compared to 2009/10. We managed to keep the emission level from 2009/10 in a situation where our production increased. Reducing the total CO2 emission and striving to implement cleaner technology and processes remain focus areas.

Hansen had six notices of violation of regulatory requirements in 2010/11 from the authorities. Four related to wastewater discharge, one related to odor and the last notice related to noise. All notices were handled in cooperation with the authorities, and there are no outstanding claims. We have recorded an additional 30 non-conformities, including accidental releases that were reported to the authorities. 25 of these were nutrient concentrations above the waste water discharge permit limit, including accidental product releases. Four related to handling of waste. In addition, one non-conformity in the category odor was reported. No adverse effects from the mentioned non-compliances were observed. The increase in the number of violations is primarily a result of increased focus on reporting of incidents. In 2010/11 we received six environmental complaints from stakeholders. Three complaints concerning odor and three regarding noise. All complaints were handled and solved in dialogue with the involved stakeholders.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2010/11 18 Note 11 People During 2010/11 the number of employees increased by 2% on average to 2,360 employed persons at the end of the year, which equals full-time-equivalents (FTEs) of 2,337. The average number of employees were 2,411 during 2010/11. Our regions South America and Europe reduced the number of employees, while the regions Asia-Pacific, Middle East & Africa and North America, respectively, increased because of more activity in the regions. The greatest percentage increase was in Asia-Pacific, Middle East & Africa by 58%. The gender ratio remains 61% men and 39% women. The employee turnover rate has increased from 9% to 13% (Voluntary 9%, Involuntary 3%) compared to 2009/10, which lies within our target of 10-15%. Attracting and retaining the right talented people are key objectives for Chr. Hansen.

The number is likely to be higher, as e.g. Danish data only partially includes external training (open enrolment course). The total number of training days constitutes approximately 2.6 training day per employee, which is an increase from last financial year. The strong and persistent focus on training and development in the past five years, clearly illustrated by the increased number of training days, will continue in the coming years. Training and development are strategic focus areas for Chr. Hansen. In 2010/11 we increased the number of employees, who have had a Performance Development Interview with their immediate manager to 94%. This indicates that we continue to have a strong focus on individual development planning, as this is an established part of the PDI process. The numbers support that PDIs are now integrated in our business.

The lost time incidents fall consistently in the categories strains, contusions and heat injuries. It is indicated that the severity of accidents has decreased. Chr. Hansen has had no fatal accidents. There is focus on preventive actions, safe behavior initiatives and incentive drivers such as implementation of health and safety performance in our bonus program and to include health and safety in our annual organizational review. The aim for 2012/13 is maintained at reducing the frequency to 5 accidents with absence per one million working hours. The number of occupational illnesses increased from 8 to 9 in 2010/11. Muscle-skeletal disorder is the main reason for the illnesses. The incidents have not required transfer to other jobs neither internally in Chr. Hansen nor to other companies. There has been one notice from the authorities, including 12 violations, related to health and safety. We were fined for half of the violations. All has been corrected and there are no outstanding claims. There were no complaints in 2010/11.

HANSEN – ANNUAL REPORT 2010/11 20 Note 15 Ethics In 2010/11 we focused on developing an e-learning platform for more extensive training in anti-trust. Approximately 420 employees have been trained including executive management. During the coming year, we expect to roll out a similar program on anti-corruption as well. Of the 420 trained several are already included in the number reported for 2009/10, therefore, the percentage remains unchanged.

Hansen passed all audits in 2010/11. We are benchmarking audit performance between the sites and measure it up against food safety KPIs. Going forward we will include certifying agencies in the audit overview. The number of complaints has increased 23% reflecting a general increase in activities. The operational target will be changed for the coming year to allow for an increase in activity level, i.e. to express the number of complaints in proportion to turnover but to maintain the 10% target level. The compensation level is above the 10% goal. The handling time of each complaint is still too high compared to our goal of 80% response in 2 weeks.

There are no specific trends in the number or types of product retrievals. All incidents that can lead to withdrawal or recall of products are managed by specially trained teams to ensure 100% harmonization and coordination in all markets.
