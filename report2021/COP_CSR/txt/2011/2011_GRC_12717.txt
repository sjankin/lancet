Respecting the environment, the ecosystem and its resources is the fundamental priority of Hatzopoulos S.A. and a significant part of our philosophy and culture. We put this philosophy into practice by taking environmentally responsible and preventive actions every day for saving resources and minimizing the environmental impacts that our activities may have in accordance with the ISO 14001:2004 certification. Our programs include raw and secondary materials’ recycling as well as waste that is inevitably produced from our daily operations. In 2010 we have recycled 690 tones of wood and 14 tones of paper, while in 2011 until now 270 tones of wood and 30 tones of paper have been recycled. Since 2010 80 tones of waste have been sent for recycling, while batteries and metals are also available. We use integrated information systems to minimize paper consumption, our employees are trained to follow environmentally sensitive practices, printing of electronically available material and correspondence is discouraged and preventive maintenance on equipment and building is regularly performed. Our company’s contribution towards sustainable development also extends to the development and diffusion of environmentally-friendlier technologies. The R&D team of Hatzopoulos S.A. intensively works on the development of alternative packaging solutions and thinner material structures for our customers which results in less raw 10 A. Hatzopoulos S.A. – United Nations Global Compact | Communication on Progress, 2011 materials need and usage. Our efforts expand also to the development of new applications in flexible packaging such as re-closable packaging solutions which significantly contribute to food protection and food waste minimization. Additionally our culture of environmental responsibility is reflected on our systematic efforts to measure and minimize our emissions to the environment and reduce our products’ carbon footprint. For this reason we have launched the implementation of Measurement of Sustainable Values of the company (Sustainable Values Score Card) and we participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project by disclosing information regarding the company’s strategy in subjects related to the global climate change. Our total score placed us in the 2nd Quartile of all 709 companies participating, significantly higher than the average total, giving an objective positive indication regarding gas emissions of our company associated with global warming, setting up goals and action plans for the reduction of those emissions. In parallel, our company’s investments in solvent recovery and solvent abatement systems focus on the same target. A state-of-the-art air-purification system with solvent recovery bas been installed at the new factory in Kalohori. The system operates by means of activated carbon adsorption, with annual capacity of 1500 tons of recovered solvents, mainly ethyl acetate. Since the beginning of 2011 the solvent recovery system has been equipped with a new distillation column, which also allows ethanol separation. This way Hatzopoulos S.A. achieves the re-use of the 95% of the solvents required for the printing and the lamination processes, drastically reducing its emissions to the environment. 11 A.
