Electricity is a driving force behind economic development and a source of KOSPO is now competing not only with the other five GENCOs, but also energy indispensable to our daily lives. Electricity is neither stored nor private power generation companies to sell electricity in the market. We are reused. In particular it is not replaceable with other sources of energy. The making every effort to manage cost and quality to supply electric power in power generation industry is closely related to economic growth. It is an efficient and stable manner. generally noted that electricity sales grows faster than the economy, while declining slower in economic recessions. The instant peak demand for electricity occurs in summer season due to cooling demand, however, recently electricity consumption in winter season is on a sharp increase with the increasing demand for heating. 16 Sustainability Report 2010 KOSPO's Business and Joint Growth based Sustainability Management Issues on Social Responsibility With the development of economy, the demand for high quality energy including It is important for KOSPO to play a key role in the development of national electricity and gas is continuously growing so that it is required to construct economy, by executing growth strategies through green management and power generation facilities at the right time to ensure a stable power supply. As equally important is to create a sustainable society through cooperation and joint Korea will be obliged to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions under the growth with all stakeholders involved. As such, we have conducted Convention on Climate Change, the Korean government is introducing people-valued management in which the personal life of employees is Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), energy savings, Emissions Trading System respected, while implemented communication-valued management to meet the (ETS), and carbon tax, which will intensify competition in the low-carbon, green expectations of shareholders, investors, and customers externally. In addition, we power generation business. have improved our VOC (Voice of Customers) system and established a strong anti-corruption system to pursue joint-development with suppliers. One step As it is inevitable to build a GHG reduction mechanism, reduce energy further from the primary role of stable power supply, we have engaged in a consumption and lower dependency on fossil fuel around the world, it is variety of social contribution activities such as community services for local necessary to develop new renewable energy and expand low-carbon, green residents and the socially underprivileged, and participations of environmental power generation. Moreover the convergence between ICT and energy protection campaign, cultural events, natural disaster relief and recovery efforts technologies will bring a significant change to the structure of the electric power with an intention to realize a Bight and Warm Welfare Society. industry. With the rapid development of emerging markets such as China and India, international commodity prices are going up and resource nationalism is raising its head. This exacerbates national competition for natural resources, which in turn, raise the price of oil and coal. With the growing demand for high quality energy, the demand for electricity will have to stay strong. KOSPO produces electricity by firing bituminous coal, LNG, heavy oil, and heating oil, and among which, bituminous coal is imported 100% while other fuels are purchased from Korean companies. Competitive Advantage through Green Management In this 21st century, companies cannot grow sustainably without taking into account the environment. As the power generation business is directly related to energy resource issues as well as environmental issues, KOSPO is fully committed to new value creation through green management. In line with national efforts to pursue a low carbon economy as new growth engine, we are striving to commercialize new renewable energy and low carbon technologies with a belief that the success of commercialization is crucial not only to the sustainable growth of KOSPO but also the sustainable development of society. As part of environmental management, we have put great effort to reduce and manage effectively environmental load of our divers businesses so as to be positioned as an environmentally friendly company.

To this end, we defined Environmental Vision as 'Realizing an Environmentally-Clean Company that Leads Sustainability Management.' In order to realize the vision, we revised and announced the below environmental policy in August, 2010. KOSPO is committed to generating environmentally-sound electric power, recognizing that the environment is the source of life and the foundation of daily lives. In order to establish eco-friendly conditions, we decare the Environmental Policy as follows: 1. The fundamental objective of environmental policy is to realize Sustainable Development for both environmental preservation and economic growth. We regularly conduct environmental impact assessments on all the process of our business activities and continue to make improvements. 2. We clarify roles and responsibilities of each organization to prevent environmental contamination, encouraging all employees to serve as guards for the environment through environmental awareness training. 3. Considering characteristics by power generation facility, we set targets stricter than the requirements defined in laws and regulations as well as agreements with local governments in an endeavor to minimize pollutant emissions. 4. We improve transparency and reliability by building an open environmental management system and disclosing environmental information. 5. We take the lead in building a resource-recyclable society by considering the recyclable factor of waste from the generation stage and maximizing the recycling or reuse of waste. We keep in mind that this environmental policy can be achieved only when all our employees including the CEO, suppliers and contractors, put the policy into action with a strong sense of responsibility. We are committed to complying with this policy and taking the lead in creating a sustainable communities through community support projects. August 2010 CEO of KOSPO <World's Lowest Environmental Pollutant Emissions Eco Action> Environmental Management Goals KOSPO will reduce SOx and NOx emissions from each location of operation by World's Lowest Environmental Pollutant Emissions 10-33% and 10-50% respectively by 2012, compared to 2006. In accordance with the government's upcoming policy on GHG reduction, we will set midto long-term targets and come up with response measures. As for resource recycling, our goal is to achieve the legally-defined coal ash recycling rate and reuse 100% of the de-sulfurized gypsum generated. On August 27, 2010, we formulated the Midto Long-Term Basic Plan for Environmental Management in an effort to respond pro-actively to changes in the domestic and foreign Operation and Pollutant environment and promote sustainable development. The plan includes Construction of Emissions as Low Eco-Friendly step-by-step objectives to reduce pollutant emissions, recycle resources and Eco-Friendly as 42% of legal Best Practice develop new renewable energy. Power Plants requirements Sustainability Report 2010 37 | Environmental Performance | Environmental Management Mechanism Environmental Management System KOSPO makes environmental improvement in a continuous and systematic manner based on the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle. We establish a vision, policies and action plans for environmental management, under which detailed objectives are set up every year. In order to meet the objectives, our power plants strive to optimize the operation of eco-friendly facilities and conduct environment improvement activities. Moreover, we conduct various environmental assessment programs every year such as audits, on-site inspection and internal evaluation in order to ensure the efficient operation of environmental management system and assess the adequacy of environmental management. Thanks to such efforts, we reacquired the ISO 14001 certificate from a leading certification organization in December, 2009. KOSPO carries out environmental impact surveys as per the Act on Environmental Impact Assessment of Environment, Transportation, Disasters, etc. Survey outcomes are reported to the Ministry of Environment (MOE) and the Ministry of Knowledge Economy. Action plans are prepared by MOE and KOSPO. ※ Period of Environmental Impact Survey: From ground-breaking until 5 years after completion or the time agreed with MOE <PDCA for Environmental Management System> Environmental Deployment / Internal Audit & ISO 14001 Execution of Ex-Post Audit Management Plan Revised System Feedback Certification Professional System Training to Nurture Experts Standardization Self-Regulating Environmental Environmental Accounting to Agreements Minimize Environmental Impact KOSPO made the best efforts to comply with environmental laws and regulations We made a steady investment in installing eco-friendly facilities. In 2010, on air quality, water quality and waste. We signed a self-regulating approximately KRW 56 billion was invested to install and run eco-friendly environmental agreement with MOE for Hadong Thermal Power Site and facilities. For instance, we improved de-NOx facilities of Hadong Thermal Power Youngnam Thermal Power Plant. We also signed the agreement with the Units 1-8 and repaired yellow plume reduction facilities of Busan Combined concerned local government for Shinincheon Combined Cycle Thermal Power Cycle Power Site. In the days to come, we will continue to make environmental Site.

As part of efforts to minimize emissions, KOSPO installed the most advanced flue-gas desulfurization and electric dust collection facilities in Hadong coal-fired power plants, Namjeju heavy-oil fired Power Plant Units 3 & 4 and Youngnam Thermal Power Plant. Shininchecon, Busan, and Yeongwol Combined Cycle Power Sites are operating LNG-fired power plants, whereas Namjeju Thermal Power plant is burning low-surfur heavy oil. We are also operating the latest SCR flue-gas de-NOx facilities in Hadong Units 1-8, Youngnam Unit 2, Namjeju Internal Combustion Units 1-4, and Namjeju Steam Units 3 & 4. In the case of Shinincheon and Busan Combined Cycle Power Sites, the world's best Low-NOx burner is well in place. <Electric Dust Collector> Combined Cycle Power Plants, located in the downtown of big cities, emit yellow plume during the period of plant start-up and shutdown. This sparked local residents' complaints, undermining a stable operation of power generation facilities. To resolve the issue, we developed a yellow plume reduction technology, for the first time in the world. Currently, the SNCR yellow plume reduction facility is installed at all units of Busan and Shinincheon Combined Cycle Plants. <Flow of Environmental Pollutant Treatment> Flue Gas Monitoring Removal of SOx & Dust NOx Reduction Noise Prevention Harmony with Surroundings Flue Gas Monitoring Indoor Boiler Sound Absorber Flue Gas Treatment Indoor Turbine Transmission DeNOx Tower DeDust SOx Collection Generator Condenser Coal Ash Gypsum Coal Ash Transformer Switchgear Households, Effective Removal of SOx & Dust Integrated Plants Use Gymsum Coal Ash Storage Waste Water Intake Revetment Storage Treatment Area Ash Treatment Facility Waste Facility Water Closed-type Coal Elevator Reclaimer Water Temperature Monitoring Collier /Coal Sprinkler Coal Stock drainage hole Belt Conveyor System Prevention of Coal Fly Purification Drainage Water Monitoring Sustainability Report 2010 39 | Environmental Performance | Environmental Management Activities <De-SOx Waste Water Treatment Facilities> Water Pollution Management A.

Convention on Climate Change such as the Obligatory Reduction Quota, Energy Target Management System and Emissions Trading System. CO2 Capture & Treatment Technology Development Road Map for the Convention KOSPO is developing a CCR (Carbon Capture & Reuse) technology for which on Climate Change the application of trademark has been already filed. The home grown technology In December, 2008, KOSPO formulated the“Midto Long-Term Road Map to will enable us to reuse CO2 as a high value added resource with no need of Respond to the Convention on Climate Change”to become a model company storage. As part of the development, we work on a resource conversion for low carbon green management. Under the motto of the“Clean & Green technology, taking advantage of microalgae. As the 1st phase of the CO2 Village KOSPO 2020” , we set CO2 reduction target of 5,900,000tons by 2020. With this project which starts from May 2011, we will embark on a validation test to in mind, we are implementing 14 action plans across the company. Meanwhile, cultivate microalgae and produce bio disel in a 3,000 pyeong farm using hot we are concentrating on developing new renewable energy. In July, 2009, the waste water and captured CO2 of Hadong power plants. Based on which, we will New Renewable Energy Midto Long-Term Strategy was devised as part of move on to the 2nd phrase in which the farm is extended to 10,000 pyeong in the follow-up policy to respond to climate change. In this strategy, we decided to order to develop strategies for disseminating the CO2 technology to farmers and pursue wind power generation as our specialized business, while diversifying securing economic viability. This project will eventually be extended to a project energy sources to include photovoltaic power, IGCC, bio energy, and tidal power to drive up income of rural households around Hadong Thermal Power Site and in response to the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Samcheok Green Power. Meanwhile, another technology development is underway to electrolyze CO2 into formic acid (CHOOH). We already undertook the development of a ERC (Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon dioxide) system (10kg/day), upon an GHG Reduction & CDM Projects agreement with the Canadian company Mantra and the Korean company KC Cottrell in August, 2010. Furthermore, we are planning a validation test for a In 2004, KOSPO set up four 1.5 MW wind power units in Hankyong-myun, CO2-using formic acid production facility (Capacity; 10kg/day) in cooperation with Jeju-do, for the first time in Korea. This project was followed by a successful Seogang University who possess a theoretical technology regarding this. Once installation of five more 3MW units in December, 2007. These five units, in CCR technologies are completed, we can turn CO2 into energy such as bio fuel particular, were registered to the UNFCCC as a Clean Development Management or formic acid, thus creating a virtuous energy cycle. On top of this, we can (CDM) project in October, 2007 and they are expected to receive Certified expect a win-win situation with local residents through high value-creating Emissions Reduction (CER) credits for reducing 29,000 tones on an annual basis. CO2-using projects. Afterwards, we built a 20MW Sungsan wind power unit completed in March 2010, as part of our strategy to pursue a CDM project. At the moment, the Sungsan unit is under deliberation in the CDM Executive Board of UNFCCC. Moreover, 1.4 MW photovoltaic power units installed inside the Hadong and Busan Power Sites were registered as CDM project in December, 2010. Currently we work to add wind power units in Taebaek (18MW) and Pyeongchang (26MW) to the list of CDM projects. If they are all combined, we will be able to secure 156,000 tons of CER credits annually, generating KRW 3 billion of profits from credit trading a year. Meanwhile, the above-mentioned Hankyoung project and the supercharger Sustainability Report 2010 43 | Environmental Performance | Environmental Performance Data Environmental Performance Data Environmental Impact Survey The environment is seriously affected by large-scale development projects or urban planning.
