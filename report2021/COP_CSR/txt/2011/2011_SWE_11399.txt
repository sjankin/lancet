The latter puts new demands not only on the financial system but also of course on companies. Today, we can not only view a company’s role in society as providing financial value to the shareholders. Companies also need to provide products and services that contribute to sustainable growth and development and hereby create value for other stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, employees and future generations. Our world is facing huge challenges; climate change, depleting natural resources and a large uneven distribution of wealth, only to mention a few. It is thus obvious that sustainability is and will remain a key concept in the future and Volvo Group is committed to take the lead, within our sphere of influence, towards sustainable mobility. To be able to meet the challenges, the growing expectations from our stakeholders and for us to create growth and new business opportunities we have decided to review our CSR-strategy during 2011. I am convinced there is no contradiction in running a financially viable business, while contributing to societal development and creating long-term value. Our experience shows that conducting business with integrity truly builds brand equity, and strong relations with all our stakeholders. We are on our way to Creation of Shared Value (CSV). To exchange experiences, to find new innovative solutions By offering environmentally enhanced products we have and approaches strategic partnerships with key organizagained a leading position in our industry; something that is tions are vital.

The Code sets out areas that influence the trust of stakeholders in us as a company. Our work has earned us a position as an industry leader, with a reputation aligned with our corporate core values – safety, quality and environmental care. We have two different approaches for our CSR commitment: firstly, acting in compliance with our Code of Conduct and Adapting to changes in our stakeholders’ expectations and in certain international standards, and secondly, engaging in society at large activities to maintain and develop our trustworthiness among To us, CSR is a central part of our business and we integrate our stakeholders and increase brand equity.

Things that seemed impossible a couple of years ago have become a reality. Our ability to effectively address future needs for efficient and sustainable transports, maintain a safe yet efficient work environment and act responsibly are imperative to our future success. We prioritize our CSR efforts and particularly focus on areas that have a major impact or that involve significant risks or opportunities for Volvo Group.

It is expected that roughly 20 percent of the world’s population will live in cities having more than 2 million inhabitants by 2015. The largest mega cities will be found in Asia dues to the strong population growth there. At present, more than 50 percent of the world’s population lives in cities. It is forecast that 85 percent of the population in Northern and Western Europe will live in urban areas in 2030. Each inhabitant of a European city corresponds to between 30 and 50 tonnes of goods being transported in and out of the city every year. The urbanization trend and high-density megacities will create more and more challenges for commercial transport solutions, which will have an impact on demand.

This new structure helped us to benefit from synergies in 2010 and accelerate the pace of development within the Group. Increased focus on relevant issues We have introduced ten horizontal Group Issue Boards (GIB) for different areas of concern for the Group. GIBs have been established to gain benefits from synergies and accelerate the pace of development and the process of change within Volvo Group. The Chair of each GIB is a member of Volvo Group Executive Committee (GEC). Concerned companies within the Group are represented by a manager. The GEC sets process targets and approves funding principles, while GIBs are responsible for strategies, overall direction, policies and processes within their respective area of expertise. The Chairman of the GIB is the process owner for defined processes owned by the GIB. The GIB Chairman shall keep the GEC regularly informed about the progress of the work within GIB structure the GIB’s area of responsibility.

It is a deeply rooted value within Volvo Group that we should do things that are good for Volvo, but also for others. Caring for the environment is in our DNA. At first, we had difficulties finding the resources to invest in changes, but supported by management we found the tools to start making the most essential investments. We also exchanged ideas across companies in the Group, finding innovative and cost-efficient solutions.

We therefore need to communicate our views on how to run a business in a correct and fair way. It is essential that our employees in all parts of the world understand the purpose of the policies and how to interpret them in everyday business. Employees are trained online and on-site All white collar employees will participate in e-learning relating to the Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption every three years. On-site training for selected groups is conducted every year. It is crucial to communicate both the advantages of doing business in the right way as well as the potential consequences of non-compliance. Personal meetings and discussions are important for creating awareness. In the past year and in years to come thousands of employees have received and will receive on-site training through the Chief Compliance Officer or other members of the compliance network.

Our focused environmental work had already started in 1972, when we participated in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, Sweden. Volvo’s preparatory work resulted in a document on environmental politics called ‘Mobility and the Environment’. Since then, we have communicated and trained employees and management on environmental responsibility issues. Today, environmental issues are an integral part of not only our business strategy but also our daily work. We have faced many challenges over the years, some of which seemed impossible to solve, but looking back we have been able to tackle most of them. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges faced by mankind. As one of the largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles we have a responsibility to address this issue. We believe that carbon dioxide neutral transport is not a utopian Strategic challenge dream.

While transportation is closely linked to the development of societal welfare and growth, transport also contributes to climate change. Volvo Group is committed to developing solutions that enhance mobility while having a reduced impact on the environment. We are convinced that our future products will also remain an important part of a sustainable society. The challenge – reducing emissions of greenhouse gases caused by humans. Goods transports on roads account for Climate change is on the political as well as the corporate about four percent globally. agenda. The European Union has formulated a reduction target for emissions of greenhouse gases for the transport sector. The EU target for the transport sector is a reduction of 20 percent by 2030, based on 2008 levels, and at least 60 percent by 2050, with the baseline 1990. Great emphasis will be put on urban transports, where the target is to achieve essentially carbon dioxide-neutral city logistics in major urban centers by 2030. Road transport emissions in the EU Emissions need to decrease dramatically over the long-term perspective. Climate change is very much a global issue and requires global action. According to the United Nations’ Climate Panel (IPCC), greenhouse gases must decrease by 50– 80 percent between 2000 and 2050. Preparing for upcoming carbon dioxide regulation Volvo Group is affected by the cost of, access to and availability of fuel, as well as legislation in the environmental area. Continued problems with air pollution and climate change entail The EU has stated that new technologies for vehicles, through more stringent legislation.

Joint industry partnerships Climate partnership with WWF We have gone into partnership with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to further underline Volvo Group’s commitment to climate action. In 2010, Volvo Group became the world’s first manufacturer in the automotive industry to join the WWF Climate Savers Program. Being a partner in Climate Savers, we have agreed to even more ambitious emission targets for greenhouse gases. Volvo Group’s truck companies have undertaken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles manufactured between 2009 and 2014 by 13 million tonnes. The results will be monitored by independent technical experts. 45 VOLVO GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY CASE Ambitious commitments Volvo Group is the first vehicle manufacturer to join the proVolvo Group joins WWF partnership gram; Volvo truck companies have undertaken to reduce carDuring 2010 Volvo joined the WWF Climate Savers Program – bon dioxide emissions from the vehicles they manufacture by a partnership between some of the leading companies in each 13 million tonnes and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industry and the World Wide Fund for Nature.

Increasing fuel efficiency further The most significant share of a vehicles environmental impact occurs during the use phase, and this is largely attributed to fuel consumption. When a fully loaded truck is compared with a fully loaded passenger car, the carbon dioxide emissions of the truck are approximately ten times lower per tonne kilometer. The fuel consumption for a Volvo Truck FH tractor and semi-trailer combination, fully loaded, is well below 3 liter per 100 kilometers in long-haul operations. This fuel consumption corresponds to carbon dioxide emissions of approximately 30 g per ton kilometer.

Recycling of vehicles Volvo Group’s products are to a large extent recyclable, since by weight they consist of almost 85 percent metal, mostly iron, steel and aluminum. The additional materials are mainly: • Plastic • Rubber • Material from electronics components. The total weight of a truck, such as a Volvo FH tractor, is approximately 7,000 kg, of which approximately 33 percent is made of recycled material. Virgin material is needed to ensure quality and solidity. Handbooks which show how to disassemble the vehicle are available for most products to support the optimal materials recovery. Disassembly stations are available where trucks and buses can be disassembled for recycling and where reusable product Emissions regulations for trucks and buses parts can be harvested.

Hybrid technology is one of the most promising and competitive technologies for commercial vehicles. It saves fuel and reduces emissions, and can be run on renewable fuels. Environmental and cost benefits Volvo Group is well positioned with our unique solution for hybrid technology for heavy-duty vehicles. Hybrid technology is best suited to urban operations since the most appropriate vehicles for hybrid drivelines are those operating in continuous stop-go conditions, such as city buses and refuse or distribution trucks. Because of its potential for saving fuel, hybrid technology means lower operating costs for customers while at the same time significantly reducing environmental impact. We have tested various types of hybrid solutions since the 1980s and unveiled the first commercially viable hybrid solution for heavy-duty vehicles in March 2006. Our solution is based on a concept known as I-SAM (Integrated Starter Alternator Motor). Serial production of hybrid trucks and buses Hybrid solution with proven track record The Volvo 7700 Hybrid city bus had its world premiere in April The I-SAM concept involves an electric motor and a diesel 2009 following successful field tests of hybrid buses in Stockengine working in parallel, whereby each of them can be used holm and Gothenburg, Sweden and London, England. where they are most effective.

This vehicle offers two very distinctive advantages: no atmosphere-polluting and carbon dioxide emissions at all and no noise pollution. Renault Maxity Electric can therefore be operated at night and in restricted low-emission zones. Noise emission requirements for heavy-duty vehicles Less noise emissions Noise pollution is a growing problem in urban areas. Vehicles equipped with hybrid technology are almost noiseless when operating on the electric engine. There are different regulations around the world for noise emissions for the transport sector. EU and South Korea have among the strictest noise level regulations: 80 decibels for heavy-duty vehicles. Other countries are gradually approaching the same level. Volvo Group products meet these regulations. 52 VOLVO GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Product Development Carbon Dioxide Neutral Transports – Future vision of carbon dioxide neutral transport Carbon dioxide neutral vehicles are powered by fuel produced from renewable raw materials such as biomass. Vehicles that operate on renewable fuels do not add extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

We believe that no renewable fuel alone will replace oil globally; different regional solutions will be used based on regional prerequisites. Since we know that biomass will be a limited resource, it is very important to choose the most energyefficient alternative from a well-to-wheel perspective. Assessment of sustainability features of fuel categories Transit to renewable fuels requires collaboration The diesel engine is one of the most efficient energy converters around. A major advantage of the diesel engine is that it can be adapted to run on a wide range of renewable fuels. The transit to a low-carbon society requires collaboration to gain broader acceptance. We have the technology and knowhow to develop carbon neutral transports. Already in 2007 we presented seven trucks which can be operated on seven different renewable fuels. All of these can all be driven without net emissions of carbon emissions. The purpose of showcasing these vehicles was to create discussions with different actors in society. Cooperation between vehicle manufacturers, politicians, government agencies and 53 VOLVO GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2010 ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY fuel producers is necessary.

This impact can be reduced by developing more energy-efficient products. However, the behavior of drivers is also key to further decrease fuel consumption. We actively contribute to reducing fuel consumption both through technological solutions and through awareness raising activities to influence attitudes and behavior. Eco Driving targeting attitudes Human behavior is an important factor for sustainable transports. The driver’s attitude to and behavior in respect of speed and driving patterns significantly affect the impact on the environment, fuel consumption and traffic safety. Eco Driving is a way of driving that helps reduce the vehicle’s fuel consumption, emissions and causes less wear and tear on the vehicle. This reduces costs and environmental impact. In addition to this, the risk of accidents is also reduced through the better planning of routes. A number of Volvo Group companies worldwide offer driver training to improve vehicle knowledge while addressing safety issues and the reduction of fuel consumption. On average drivers can save five to ten percent in fuel consumption after participating in a course in fuel-efficient driving.

Carbon dioxide emissions increased by six percent in relation to net sales. Modern and efficient foundry in Volvo Powertrain Volvo Powertrain inaugurated a new foundry in 2010 to increase the capacity in Skövde, Sweden. The new foundry, which is the world’s most modern facility in terms of technology, energy consumption, working environment and overall environmental impact, has increased the annual casting capacity to 150 000 tonnes. Energy consumption for the foundry has been reduced by 45 percent, and no coal dust is produced by the process. Energy-saving targets Since 1995 Volvo Group has worked systematically to improve energy efficiency. Between 2003 and 2008 the challenge for energy savings in production was 50 percent per unit produced.

We need to be accountable, aligned, agile, and able to execute decisions. We need to add customer value and drive change. Relying on culture to drive change and transformation, we decided to review The Volvo Way. Extensive research and employee involvement supported this review. In August 2009 the new version of The Volvo Way was unanimously approved by the Group Executive Committee. All managers received the new Volvo Way in October 2009, which was translated into twelve different languages, together with a Manager’s Workbook for Self-study.

Individual competence development Securing and enhancing competences is crucial to being competitive and attractive as an employer and business. We regularly map our strategic competences, and annually aggregate findings on a Group level to identify the most important competencies for future needs. We thus offer a wide variety of training programs at all levels for employees, in specific professional areas as well as for stimulating personal growth. The activities range from traditional and e-based training to individual coaching and mentoring. Individual competence development is based on a personal business plan, which provides support for translating corporate strategic objectives into individual objectives and contribution.

This is one way of highlighting great initiatives and encouraging an increased focus on safety. One of the most common causes of traffic accidents is drivers not paying attention. Finding ways of reducing the risk of accidents caused by driver fatigue or inattention can have a large impact. Driver Alert Support is a mechanism that monitors and analyses a truck driver's lane-keeping behavior and kicks in when the driver shows signs of being tired.
