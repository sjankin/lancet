Albertus Magnus “De Alchimia”  INTRODUction  Chief Executive Officer’s Dear Shareholders and Stakeholders, letter to stakeholders For the Sabaf Group, 2010 was a time of significant recovery in terms of revenue compared with 2009. Nevertheless, sales are still significantly lower than the highs seen in 2008, and the widespread instability, accentuated in recent weeks by events in the Mediterranean, has made forecasting difficult both in terms of the markets and commodity prices. Once again we are having plot our way carefully, whereas at one time it was possible to make long-term projections. In other words, we need to be permanently ready for change, despite not knowing when it will happen and what form it will take. Overall, the group’s sales revenue in 2010 totalled €150.9 million, 18.7% higher than the €127.1 million of 2009, but below the €162 million of 2008. Conversely, average selling prices in 2010 were not vastly different from those of 2009, despite the increase in commodity prices during the year. Given this context, in order to improve margins we have concentrated on the efficiency of our plants, increasing automation and productivity levels and focusing more on the construction of machinery and machine tools. This will remain a priority in future. In short, we have taken action at every level of the chain, and this, together with an improved product mix, has yielded a significant improvement in net profit, which has risen from 9.1% to 11.2%. EBITDA represented 25.5% of sales (22.4% in 2009), while EBIT represented 17.1% of sales (12.8% in 2009). All product families contributed to the growth in sales, although we should highlight the steadier growth rates in our most innovative products, such as light alloy valves and special burners, where we will continue to target most of our research efforts: after a couple of years dedicated to research and development, some product families are now in production, while others were launched on the market in 2010. We expect more positive results from these both in 2011 and beyond. Alongside productivity, innovation remains the most credible driver of business development and competitiveness. Productivity, as I have said in the past in answer to questions from Group employees, is our insurance policy for the next decade. It is the safety net for everyone who works here. The future of Sabaf employees and the company are closely bound up with its ability to be competitive in the global marketplace, to offer innovative, energy-efficient and high-tech products. For this reason we have invested considerable resources in research, and this will continue to be our guide in the coming years. In addition, we have decided to focus increasingly on emerging markets, and some of our products are designed with them in mind. The 2010 figures are already reassuring: while a recovery was confirmed in Italy and other European markets, the best results were recorded on markets outside Europe, which now represent 30% of the Group’s direct sales; in these countries, moreover, demographic growth has for some time been more robust than in the western hemisphere. Sales were particularly strong in South America, especially in the first half of the year; the Group posted excellent growth rates in the US, Canada and Mexico, a market in which sales are still fairly low, however. The growth in the Asian market has been satisfactory, despite the increasing difficulties in the Middle East and the still-modest contribution of sales in China. In Europe, the country with the most interesting potential is Turkey. Here Sabaf has decided to build INTRODUCTION 2 0 1 0 Annual Report  a plant to serve the region, where growth is expected to gather pace over the next few years. In response to tensions on regional markets, Sabaf has chosen to go down the route of opening local plants in the past few years. Turkey will join Brazil and later China, areas that in our opinion require a direct presence to fully interpret local requirements and avoid administrative constraints in some cases. In Brazil, our plant has recently been awarded quality certification, confirmation of Sabaf’s commitment to global sustainability: opening foreign plants does not mean sacrificing the principles of good governance, but simply paying more attention to the specific features of local markets. Our membership of the United Nations Global Compact and its principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption remains one of our strengths, irrespective of the location of our production sites and the markets that they serve. In 2010, we successfully concluded negotiations for the second-level contract, which will be valid for the next three years. We believe that this recognises some of the legitimate expectations of workers, without ignoring the global context in which the company operates. Only with collective intelligence can we address the major challenges that face us in future. For this to succeed, however, it must be born of cohesion and common goals. To conclude, I would once again like to mention sustainability, which represents the common denominator of our entire philosophy, the belief which has accompanied us over the years and which Sabaf implements at an economic, environmental and social level. I have mentioned economic sustainability before: this is the ability to remain competitive in the face of an immense global challenge, keeping or even improving our market share and continuing to generate revenue, without which no business worthy of that name can exist. We are therefore investing in the latest technology to improve the energy efficiency of our products and processes. In a world where raw materials are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive and we face ever more stringent environmental restrictions, Sabaf has endeavoured to launch a virtuous circle with reduced environmental impact and lower consumption, both in the production and use of our products. This is the guarantee for one of our fundamental objectives; in other words, the ability to create jobs, ensuring that people remain central to our vision. In 2010, as soon as the first signs of recovery appeared, Sabaf began investing in its workforce again: in the space of 12 months, we have increased our headcount by 30, roughly equivalent to 5% of the total. We remain true to one principle: in order to grow, we must all grow together.

The text of the Shareholders’ Meeting Regulation, which governs the orderly proceedings of the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings, while simultaneously encouraging participation by shareholders and exercise of their voting rights, was amended to take these regulations into account. The complete text of the Regulation, the updated version of which was approved on 14 December 2010 by the Shareholders’ Meeting, is available on the Company’s website, at: http://www.sabaf.it/opencms/opencms/investor/corporate/documenti_societari.html The Board of Directors reported to the Shareholders’ Meeting on its past and scheduled activities, and it undertook to provide shareholders with adequate information so that they could take informed decisions on the matters to be resolved by the Shareholders’ Meeting. In 2010, no significant changes occurred in the market capitalisation or ownership structure of the Company such as would compel the Board of Directors to consider the possibility of proposing to the Shareholders’ Meeting that it amend the Bylaws in regard to the percentages established for taking the actions and exercising the prerogatives envisaged for protection of minority shareholders.

Ospitaletto, 21 marzo 2011 The Chief Executive Officer The Financial Reporting Officer Angelo Bettinzoli Alberto Bartoli STATUTORY 2 0 1 0 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS AT 31 DECEMBER 2010 Annual Report Board of Statutory Auditor’s Report to the Sabaf S.p.A. Shareholders’ Meeting pursuant to Article 153 of 174 Legislative Decree No. 58/1998 Shareholders, The board of statutory auditors of Sabaf S.p.A. (“Sabaf” or “the company” or “the parent company”) hereby reports to you on the supervision carried out and the results thereof, in accordance with and pursuant to article 153 of legislative decree 58/1998 (the “Italian consolidated law on finance”), taking into account Consob recommendations for listed companies. This report is divided into the following sections: 1) supervision in fiscal year 2010; 2) significant business, financial and capital transactions, atypical and/or unusual transactions, and related party transactions; 3) organisational structure, administrative and accounting system and internal control system; 4) corporate governance; 5) conclusions and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010. 1. Supervision in fiscal year 2010 During the year ended 31 December 2010, the board of statutory auditors performed the supervision required by law, taking into account Consob recommendations on corporate governance and industry codes of conduct for boards of statutory auditors. In terms of the work carried out, the board of statutory auditors reports to you that: it held five board meetings, each attended by all members in office; it attended the seven meetings of the board of directors; it attended the four meetings of the internal control committee; it attended two meetings between supervisory bodies (independent auditor, internal control committee, supervisory body), in the presence of the financial reporting officer and chief internal auditor); it attended two shareholders’ meetings held on 27 April 2010 and 14 December 2010; it remained in constant communication with the independent auditor, with a view to the timely exchange of data and information relating to the performance of their respective tasks; it met regularly both with staff from Protiviti s.r.l. (“Protiviti”), to which the internal audit has been outsourced, and the chief internal auditor; it has compiled the documents and information considered relevant by executive directors and managers from other corporate functions where necessary. During meetings of the board of directors, the board of statutory auditors was informed of the management activities carried out and, where relevant, the most significant business, financial and capital transactions performed by the company or its subsidiaries in 2010. In terms of supervision, the board of statutory auditors observes that in the areas within its purview, the principles of sound management have been applied by the company. In the context of its supervision, and during meetings and discussions with managers from Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. (the “independent auditor”), the board of statutory auditors confirms that no reprehensible actions were detected, nor any actions otherwise worthy of mention. 175 Specifically with reference to the work of the independent auditor, the board of statutory auditors has examined the review procedures adopted, or in the process of being adopted, in connection with the programme of work submitted by the independent auditor on confirmation of its appointment; the board of statutory auditors has also received the technical information requested concerning the accounting policies adopted, in addition to the reporting criteria for the most significant business, financial and capital transactions. The board of statutory auditors has examined the procedure adopted by the board of directors for the impairment test carried out on the shareholding in Faringosi Hinges S.r.l., and did not detect any anomalies or reprehensible actions according to the applicable technical standards. Finally, the board of statutory auditors reports that, from the shareholders’ meeting held on 27 April 2010 and until the date of this report, no reports or complaints were received or submitted within the meaning of article 2408 of the Italian civil code. The board also reports that, during the 2009 financial year, it did not issue any opinions in the legal sense. Faringosi Hinges S.r.l.; Sabaf Immobiliare S.r.l. Both companies have duly satisfied the obligations prescribed by the Italian civil code concerning management and coordination. Sabaf S.p.A. is controlled by Giuseppe Saleri S.a.p.A., which is not responsible for management and coordination, as mentioned and explained in the report on operations approved by the board of directors at its meeting on 21 March 2011. 2.Significant business, financial and capital transactions, atypical and/or unusual transactions, and related party transactions In relation to the most significant business, financial and capital transactions carried out by the company and the group during the financial year, the board of statutory auditors reports that: on 23 March 2010, following the expiry of the 2007-2009 stock option plan, the board of directors, on the recommendation of the remuneration committee, approved an MBO (management by objectives) variable remuneration plan, implemented in accordance with the obligations set forth in the plan itself; on 11 May 2010, the board of directors approved the renewal of the national tax consolidation scheme for the period 2010-2012; on 9 November 2010, the board of directors approved the subscription of a capital increase in its subsidiary Sabaf Appliance Components (Kunshan, China). The aforementioned transactions have had no significant impact on the business/financial situation or capital of the company. Finally, in terms of the most significant events occurring during the period, the board recalls that, on 14 December 2010, the ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meeting approved the cancellation of the capital increase authorised by the shareholders’ meeting on 2 August 2007, in addition to the amendments to the company’s articles of association in order to comply with legislative decree 27 of 27-1-2010 STATUTORY 2 0 1 0 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS AT 31 DECEMBER 2010 Annual Report 176 and legislative decree 39 of 27-1-2010. In general, based on the supervision carried out, the board of statutory auditors considers that, in the performance of the aforementioned transactions, the law, the articles of association and the principles of sound management were followed in the areas within its purview. The board of statutory auditors has also found that the aforementioned transactions were not manifestly imprudent or risky, potentially causing a conflict of interests, contrary to the resolutions adopted by the shareholders’ meeting or otherwise liable to compromise the integrity of the company; finally, based on the information received, the board has found that said transactions were consistent with the principles of economic rationality, without this constituting any opinion on the merits of directors’ management decisions. The board of statutory auditors has not identified nor received information from the independent auditor or the chief internal auditor about atypical and/or unusual transactions as defined in the Consob Communication of 6 April 2001, carried out with third parties, related parties or within the group. In the report on operations, approved by the board of directors at its meeting on 21 March 2011, the directors indicated that group companies did not engage in any atypical and/or unusual transactions in 2010. On 9 November 2010, Sabaf’s board of directors, in accordance with the applicable legislation and Consob Regulation No. 17221 of 12 March 2010, approved the procedure for related party transactions. In their report on operations at 31 December 2010, the directors have also given an account of related party transactions. Details of the nature and amount of these transactions can be found in the notes to the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements. Related party transactions are of minor importance compared with group activity as a whole; they also seem consistent with and beneficial to the interests of the company. Taking this into account, the information supplied on related party transactions seems adequate. There were no “non-recurring material transactions” within the meaning of Consob Communication No. 6064293 of 28 July 2006. 3. Organisational structure, administrative and accounting system and internal control system The board of statutory auditors has verified the existence of an adequate organisational structure in relation to the size and structure of the business and the objectives pursued, in compliance with the applicable legislation. In particular, the board of statutory auditors has identified the existence of adequate procedures, as well as the presence of a system of delegated powers and proxies consistent with the responsibilities assigned. The company has adopted an organisational model in accordance with the provisions of legislative decree 231/2001. This model is periodically updated. The company has also adopted a code of ethics and has demonstrated its commitment to health, safety and the environment. 177 IThe board of statutory auditors has verified the suitability of the internal control system and the administrative and accounting system, in addition to its ability to give a true and fair view of the business, through: a) examining the chief internal auditor’s report on Sabaf’s internal control system; b) examining the periodic internal audit reports, outsourced to Protiviti; c) obtaining information from the heads of the various corporate functions; d) examining company documents; e) analysing the findings of the independent auditor; f) liaising with the supervisory bodies of subsidiaries; g) being permanently involved in the work of the internal control committee. Specifically, the board of statutory auditors acknowledges that the chief internal auditor is actively and constantly involved in monitoring the internal control system, reporting to the chief executive officer and submitting frequent and regular reports to the internal control committee and board of statutory auditors, to which he also submits the annual programme of work. By taking part in the work of the internal control committee, the board of statutory auditors has been able to coordinate the adoption of new requirements following the entry into force of article 19 of legislative decree 39/2010, which states that, for listed companies, the internal control and audit committee must be the same as the board of statutory auditors. Based on the work carried out, the board expresses its opinion on the adequacy of Sabaf’s internal control system and, in its capacity as the internal control and audit committee, reports that it has no observations to make to the shareholders’ meeting. The annual report on corporate governance and ownership structure contains, in accordance with article 123-bis of the Italian consolidated law on finance, detailed information about the features of the risk management and internal control system in relation to the financial reporting process. The main risk factors to which the group is exposed, together with the measures adopted by the company in order to address them, are suitably classified and described in detail in the notes to the financial statements and in the report on operations. With reference to the administrative and accounting system, the company has complied with the provisions introduced by law 262/2005 by appointing a financial reporting officer. The administrative and accounting system as a whole is found to be comprehensive, integrated (including the information procedures) and consistent with the size and organisational structure of the company and the group. Finally, special administrative and accounting procedures have been adopted relating to the periodic closing of the accounts, the preparation of the financial statements and the preparation of reporting packages by subsidiaries. The financial reporting officer has performed an administrative and accounting assessment of the internal control system, with testing carried out independently by the internal audit division. With reference to the continuous reporting obligations referred to in article 114(1) of the consolidated law on finance, the company has issued special instructions to its subsidiaries to comply with the reporting obligations laid down in article 114(2) of that law, in the context of company rules on privileged information.

The annual and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 contain the information required by article 149-duodecies of the Consob issuers’ regulation. The board of statutory auditors, having established that the independent auditor satisfied the independence criteria at the time of its appointment, confirms that during the period and up until today’s date, no critical issues have emerged concerning the independence of the independent auditor. The board of statutory auditors acknowledges that on 6 April 2011, Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. submitted the report referred to in article 19(3) of legislative decree 39/2010, indicating that no fundamental issues had emerged during the audit, nor were there any material deficiencies in terms of financial reporting within the internal control system. 4. Corporate governance Detailed information about the procedures used to implement the corporate governance principles approved by Borsa Italiana, as contained in the corresponding code of corporate governance for listed companies, is provided by the directors in the annual report on corporate governance and ownership structure. The company has signed up to the corporate governance code of listed companies approved by the corporate governance committee and recommended by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. The board of statutory auditors acknowledges that the company has verified the independence of directors classed as “independent”; in this regard, the board confirms the correct application of the criteria and investigation procedures in accordance with article 3(5) of the corporate governance code for listed companies. The board of statutory auditors has also confirmed that its members continue to satisfy the independence criteria, as required by article 10(2) of the corporate governance code for listed companies. 5. Conclusions and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 Sabaf’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2010 show a consolidated net profit of euro16,867,000; the annual financial statements of the parent company for the year ended 31 December 2010 show a net profit of euro13,217,000. The draft financial statements, with the accompanying notes and directors’ report on operations, were approved within the statutory time limit and were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) approved by the European Union, which are mandatory for listed companies. 179 The consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2010 shows a net financial position of euro 12,545,000, while the parent company closed its financial statements at 31 December 2010 with a net financial position of euro 9,180,000. Consolidated equity at 31 December 2010 was euro 121,846,000, compared with euro 109,133,000 in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2009; the annual financial statements of the parent company report shareholders’ equity of euro 106,519,000, compared with euro 99,053,000 for the year ended 31 December 2009. Based on these factors, in view of the general position of the company and group, in addition to the directors’ forecasts, the board does not detect the presence of any events or circumstances that might raise doubts over the going concern assumption applied. The independent auditor, in the report issued on 6 April 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion without requesting additional information on the annual and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010. Furthermore, in its reports, the independent auditor also concludes that the report on operations, in addition to the information referred to in sections 1(c), (d), (f), (l), and (m) and section 2(b) of article 123-bis of legislative decree 58/1998, contained in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure, is consistent with Sabaf’s financial statements at 31 December 2010. The annual and consolidated financial statements are accompanied by the declarations of the financial reporting officer and chief executive officer required by article 154-bis of the Italian consolidated law on finance. The board of statutory auditors, based on the work carried out during the year, found no impediment to the approval of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 and the proposals for a resolution made by the board of directors.
