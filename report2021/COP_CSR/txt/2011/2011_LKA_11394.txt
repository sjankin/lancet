However, erratic weather patterns which disrupted regular harvesting programmes impacted negatively on Rubber crop outputs, preventing producers from deriving maximum With 70% of world production being consumed by the benefit from a robust market. motor vehicle industry, rubber suffered acutely from the 2009 recession. Major growers responded with planned suppression of production and withheld inputs whilst leading international speculators depleted stockpiles to minimise stock holding losses. These factors, combined with adverse weather conditions in major growing countries which resulted in lower harvests in 2010, supported by an unexpected resurgence in the motor industries in India and China in particular, created a supply-demand disparity of significance. The market reacted with a price escalation commencing at around USD 3 per kg in January and closing at around USD 5 per kg at major trading centres, in December 2010. The Kalupahana Power Company, assisted by regular and heavy rainfall which permitted the more or less uninterrupted generation of power through the year, recorded a post-tax profit of Rs. 9 m as compared to Rs. 3.8 m the previous year. Kelani Valley Green Tea (Pvt) Ltd., ended the year with a post-tax profit of Rs 2.03 m, as against Rs. 0.77 m in 2009. The price revival in this segment was slow as, under adverse market conditions, niche products do not demonstrate the same resilience as mainstream consumer preferences.

Local consumption of national rubber output reached 70% in 2010, the highest on record. Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 16 Nuwara Eliya speciality varieties declined owing to limited demand. Overall, despite production improvements, the average price increases were insufficient to significantly offset escalating input costs. Moving into 2011, anticipated increases in internal consumption by major producers such as India and China and more aggressive purchasing by the Middle Eastern and the ex-Soviet blocs, are expected to sustain prices at attractive levels. However, expectations of additional gains from market improvements into 2011 must, necessarily, be viewed against the inevitable input cost escalation arising from the impending worker wage increase and other impacts, such as the enhanced energy tariffs already in place. The International Rubber Study Group (IRSG) forecasts an overall 8% growth in the tyre industry in 2011, as against a decline of similar proportions seen in late 2009. This consumption increase, combined with a likely escalation of oil prices currently at USD 91 per barrel, is expected to maintain rubber market buoyancy into 2011. However, invariably, manufacturers respond to surging raw material costs with moderating counter strategies of their own whilst natural market dynamics also exert countervailing pressures in adjustment. In this context, moving forward, it would be prudent to anticipate a market stabilisation at more realistic levels.

The basic rental payable under the revised basis was Rs. 19,598,000/per annum. This amount is to be inflated annually by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator in the form of contingent rent. This lease agreement was further amended on 1st August, 2002, freezing annual lease rental at Rs. 25,839,041/from 18th June, 2002. Hence, the GDP deflator adjustment has been frozen at Rs. 6,241,041/per annum until 17th June, 2008. There after which will be inflated annually by GDP deflator. According to the ruling given by Urgent Issue Task Force (UITF) of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, the amount stated in the accounts have been adjusted to reflect the following: 1. Future liability on annual lease payment of Rs. 19,598,000/would continue until year 2045. The Net Present Value of this liability at 4% discounting rate (as recommended by UITF) would result in a liability of Rs. 362,854,124/-. 2. Net present value of Rs. 362,854,124/is represented by gross liability of Rs. 676,131,000/(Rs. 19,598,000/x 34 1/2 years) and interest in suspense of Rs. 313,277,238/-. 3. The charge to the Income Statement during the current period is Rs. 66.8 m (2009 Rs. 21.1 m). 27.
