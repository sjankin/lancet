The to change the gearing in an air compressor to optimize the balance technology is designed to recover clean-burning biogas from mill waste between the pressure and volume of air produced. Reduced energy sludge and the benefits are significant. They include reduced sludge use at the compressor and reduced use of a back-up compressor is de-watering requirements as well as the recovery and reuse saving about $100,000 annually. of high-cost nutrients added in earlier stages of waste treatment. The project will operate at Crofton for 15 months beginning in 2011. Catalyst is both a host and one of the financial contributors. If the pilot proves viable, the benefits will be shared within the British Columbia pulp and paper industry as a whole. 12 catalyst paper 2010 Sustainability report Energy Mix and Renewability – Energy Mix and Renewability – Canadian Operations Corporate Wide 2 (% 2010) (% 2010) 8 27 BIOMASS FUELS (100% RENEWABLE) BIOMASS FUELS (100% RENEWABLE) ELECTRICAL ENERGY (92% RENEWABLE) 48 ELECTRICAL ENERGY (91% RENEWABLE) 30 FOSSIL FUELS FOSSIL FUELS 62 TOTAL ENERGY USE 37.9 MILLION GJ 1 TOTAL ENERGY USE 48.1 MILLION GJ 1 TOTAL RENEWABLE 89% TOTAL RENEWABLE 70% 24 1 This is a net energy use figure, which accounts for the “renewable” portion of total fuel energy being the source of the “self-generated” portion of total electricity use (see graphs below) 2 Figures do not total 100 due to rounding Total Fuel Energy Use Total Electricity Use (millions of GJ) (millions of MWh) 50 6.0 35 4.5 36.9 self-generated 4.8 renewables 26.4 20 3.0 3.5 3.3 19.6 purchased 5 1.5 fossil fuels 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 46.5 41.0 42.9 3 25.5 34.2 5.5 5.1 5.1 3.8 3.7 PERFORMANCE EXCLUDING SNOWFLAKE PERFORMANCE EXCLUDING SNOWFLAKE Most fuel energy use is accounted for by carbon-neutral biomass fuels (mainly waste wood), which are used to produce the self-generated portion of total electricity use. 3 2008 figures updated to reflect a calculation adjustment 2009 and 2010 results reflect reduced production, see page 25. catalyst paper 2010 Sustainability report 13 Carbon Management Reported emissions reflect all fuels (direct, scope 1) and all purchased electricity (indirect, scope 2) used within our production Catalyst’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emission calculations are consistent facilities.

Catalyst neutralizes its Sage paper direct carbon emissions from its British Columbia mills with the purchase of reputable, independently verified carbon offsets. These are sourced from a variety of Pacific Northwest-based projects that involve energy efficiency improvements, landfill methane collection, renewable wind power, and permanent reforestation initiatives. Catalyst has independently verified each mill’s carbon footprint as well as its approach to tracking and offsetting carbon emissions in its Sage product line. 18 catalyst paper 2010 Sustainability report We’re Connected Sustainability can’t be achieved in isolation, and involves working with partners up and down the supply chain to improve efficiency and reduce impacts.

Refrigerant Ozone-Depleting Substances units were converted to use of non-ODS at each operation, with prioritization of units containing larger volumes. Port Alberni expects to complete conversion of all large units in the first half of 2011, while other mills will complete the conversions over a longer timeframe. ODS releases at Snowflake were reduced by nearly 50 kg during 2010 compared to 2009, and prompt mill response to each incident meant that none needed to be reported to regulatory authorities. In British Columbia, all refrigerant releases of more than 10 kg must be reported.

Snowflake Energy Use – Comparative Considerations Snowflake’s fuel energy intensity is high compared with most recycling mills, in large part because Snowflake self-generates almost all of the energy it uses. Its intensity measure, therefore, includes use and loss of energy at the generation stage, which are not included in the more typical scenario of a mill that buys energy generated elsewhere. Of total fuel energy use per tonne of production at Snowflake (26.6 GJ in 2010) only roughly 45 per cent is used for paper production. Snowflake’s energy self-sufficiency also affects its carbon intensity, as it results in much higher scope 1 or direct emissions and much lower scope 2 emissions (associated with purchased electricity). 30 catalyst paper 2010 Sustainability report Effluent (by mill) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Crofton TSS kg/day 2,259 1,373 3,095 2,731 3,376 TSS kg/adt 1.4 0.9 1.6 1.3 1.7 BOD kg/day 831 530 1,012 864 1,230 BOD kg/adt 0.51 0.44 0.51 0.41 0.61 AOX kg/day 321 322 408 448 305 AOX kg/adt pulp 0.32 0.46 0.32 0.34 0.31 2378TCDD ppq n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d 2378TCDF ppq n/d n/d n/d n/d n/d Trout toxicity % compliance 100 100 100 100 100 Paper Recycling 1 TSS kg/day 2 727 569 443 713 396 TSS kg/adt 2 2.1 1.7 1.2 1.8 0.9 BOD kg/day 2 1,625 1,143 703 1,210 1,103 BOD kg/adt 2 4.74 3.33 1.96 3.07 2.51 Trout toxicity % compliance n/a n/a n/a n/a 100 Port Alberni TSS kg/day 414 380 352 389 354 TSS kg/adt 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.4 BOD kg/day 270 190 290 305 400 BOD kg/adt 3 0.31 0.23 0.39 0.38 0.43 Trout toxicity % compliance 100 100 100 100 100 Powell River TSS kg/day 1,718 1,483 1,330 1,991 2,465 TSS kg/adt 3 1.4 1.0 1.1 1.6 2.0 BOD kg/day 661 652 532 797 778 BOD kg/adt 0.52 0.44 0.42 0.63 0.64 Trout toxicity % compliance 98.0 98.1 100 96.6 100 Snowflake (all figures are for full year) TSS kg/day 4 2,941 1,256 4,009 2,893 3,068 TSS kg/adt 3.7 2.0 3.5 2.4 2.5 1 2010 results at Paper Recycling Division are generally not comparable to previous years due to its very short period of operation and low production tonnage 2 Based on 11 operating days 3 Intensity measures for previous years (amount per tonne of production) have been restated based on the application of a consistent methodology at all mills for accounting for water content in finished product 4 See discussion on effluent treatment efficiency, page 27 n/d – Non-detectable (test result below two parts per quadrillion) n/a – Not applicable 2378TCDD, 2378TCDF – Specific dioxin and furan substances A complete glossary of terms and definitions is available at http://catalystpaper.com/products/glossary. catalyst paper 2010 Sustainability report 31 Water and Energy Use (by mill) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Crofton Water use m3/adt 1 85 71 73 68 65 Fuel energy usage GJ 1 15,593,050 8,395,893 17,298,684 17,683,893 17,946,830 Fuel energy intensity GJ/adt 26.13 18.10 23.75 22.86 24.50 Electricity usage MWh 1,248,957 1,135,131 1,367,436 1,390,892 1,364,452 Electricity intensity MWh/adt 2.09 2.45 1.88 1.80 1.86 Paper Recycling 2 Water use m3/adt 13 11 9 9 9 Fuel energy usage GJ 2,314 125,083 104,183 138,675 137,617 Fuel energy intensity GJ/adt 0.61 1.07 0.80 0.97 0.97 Electricity usage MWh 3 6,528 55,255 57,546 67,033 67,326 Electricity intensity MWh/adt 4 0.63 0.44 0.44 0.47 0.48 Port Alberni 5 Water use m3/adt 72 78 75 86 95 Fuel energy usage GJ 4,629,396 4,475,620 4,120,219 4,576,657 5,642,218 Fuel energy intensity GJ/adt 14.66 15.34 15.31 15.96 16.77 Electricity usage MWh 843,236 742,641 674,704 706,895 835,365 Electricity intensity MWh/adt 2.67 2.55 2.51 2.39 2.49 Powell River 5 Water use m3/adt 71 73 79 82 94 Fuel energy usage GJ 6,187,485 5,947,653 5,928,542 6,325,759 6,998,712 Fuel energy intensity GJ/adt 13.37 12.96 13.25 13.79 15.89 Electricity usage MWh 1,188,899 1,414,846 1,347,160 1,382,634 1,364,746 Electricity intensity MWh/adt 2.57 3.08 3.01 3.01 3.10 Snowflake (all figures are for full year) Water use m3/adt 6 61 62 45 34 32 Fuel energy usage GJ 7,783,613 5,959,461 8,249,652 8,232,088 8,040,776 Fuel energy intensity GJ/adt 26.63 25.68 20.58 18.52 17.62 Electricity usage MWh 375,247 269,302 382,974 423,052 410,736 Electricity intensity MWh/adt 1.28 1.16 0.96 0.95 0.90 1 Two known factors are believed to have contributed to increased water use at Crofton, including primarily the restart of full-capacity kraft pulp production in April 2010 (a higher water-intensity production activity) while issues with secondary effluent treatment further contributed (see discussion on page 27);

Reported volumes are based on actual measurement or estimates arrived at using defensible methodologies. This information is compiled by Environment Canada in the NPRI, and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), and is available via www.ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri and www.epa.gov/tri. The table above shows the combined total of all releases reported to the NPRI and TRI for all of Catalyst’s operations. Full-year releases from Snowflake are included for 2008 (see measures marked with an asterisk*), notwithstanding the acquisition date of April 10. Since releases are reported in the spring for the previous calendar year, 2009 data were not yet available when this report was prepared. Data are not included [ – ] in instances where reporting was not required by the regulator. Speciated PAHs, while reported individually to Environment Canada, are reflected in the table above as part of the “Sum of PAHs”.
