In 2010, it has been applied to the category of director and/ or higher, whereas in previous years the term was applied to directors, deputy directors, heads of department and/or higher. The term “local executive” is applied to the senior executive who works for a company that belongs to the local community. The general fall reflected in the figure is due to the application of a more restrictive criterion in the definition of senior executive.
