Sincerely Pramod Bhasin President & CEO, Genpact Our History Genpact has a unique heritage, which has contributed to our deep understanding of business processes. We began in 1997 as a business unit within GE, building the Company from the ground up. Our charter was to provide business process services to GE’s businesses, with the goal of enabling outstanding efficiencies. During the eight years that followed, we earned the opportunity to manage a wide range of processes from the simple to complex, operating across GE’s financial-services and manufacturing businesses. In January 2005, we became an independent company bringing our process expertise and unique DNA in Lean Six Sigma to clients outside the GE family. Our new name, Genpact, conveys the business impact we generate for our clients. In August 2007, Genpact was listed on the NYSE under the symbol ‘G’. Since then we have grown rapidly, expanding our range of services and diversifying our client base.

Human Rights As a part of Genpact core integrity policy, Company has a policy on fair employment which ensures equal employment opportunity to all employees. Genpact works hard to provide its employees with a workplace free of harassment, and requires that all decisions relating to employment be made on the basis of merit, which protects the rights of minorities and all protected classes of people. In the event that an employee believes that any of these policies have been violated, the employee has recourse to Genpact’s Human Resources Group as well as an independent ombudsperson. Genpact’s Fair Employment Policy & Right of Collective Bargaining Genpact is committed to Fair Employment Practices, including the prohibition against all forms of discrimination – whether based on age, race, community, color, region, religion or gender. Genpact is committed to observing all applicable labor and employment laws wherever it operates. That includes observing those laws that pertain to privacy, the prohibition of forced, compulsory and child labor, and those laws that pertain to the elimination of any improper employment discrimination. • Genpact does not tolerate Nepotism or adverse bias • Merit, qualifications (for example, education, experience, or competencies) and other job-related criteria are the sole basis for all employment related decisions affecting employees and applicants • No allowances are given to any discriminatory practices regardless of what cultural practices may persist in the wider society • Genpact’s goal is to maintain a congenial working environment conducive for all Discrimination Genpact prohibits taking any action against a person because of his or her race, color, religion, sex, caste, sexual orientation, the region which he or she belongs to, or any other characteristic protected by law. For example, it would violate Genpact Policy to deny someone a promotion because of his race or age, or to avoid sharing important work-related information with a co-worker because of his or her religion. Genpact's Policy is to use merit, qualifications and other job-related and HR sanctioned criteria as the sole basis for all employment-related decisions Gender diversity Having an environment in which Fair Employment Practices are implemented and executed helps Genpact compete for, attract and retain a high quality, increasingly diverse workforce, and thereby be the employer of choice. Genpact will continue to make efforts in good faith to recruit and retain diversified pools of applicants and employees. Harassment by third parties Where harassment occurs as a result of an act or omission by any third party or outsider, Genpact and its legal counsel will take all steps that are reasonable and appropriate to assist the affected person in terms of support and preventive action. Employee personal information Genpact respects employee's privacy as regards any personal information or communication stored on official systems. Genpact informs its employees that it may however access any files/information (personal or otherwise) stored in a computer system of Genpact and may monitor, investigate, copy and inspect files/information (personal or otherwise) for legitimate business interests, such as to protect business property, for avoidance of business risk, safeguarding trade secrets, security issues, investigation or prevention of crime and ensuring integrity of information systems and compliance with Genpact Policies. Any private information will be disclosed to third parties if required by law. Genpact’s Ethic’s policy recognizes the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. This right is protected under the policy. Forced Labour As a part of Fair Employment Policy, Genpact strictly prohibits employment of all forms of forced, compulsory and child labour either directly or through contractors. Genpact endeavours to ensure that age criteria as per law are met by company and contractors of company Actions Taken • Every employee as a mandatory company policy has to undergo background check to ensure date of birth proof is verified. • For vendor employees, date of birth proof taken and audited in areas of high risk, • During our construction stage of new buildings where potential risk of child labour can exist, we have a special team of project and safety committee who continually audits and ensures no form of forced, compulsory or child labour practices occur. • Vendors are regularly audited and vendor employees are spoken to get assurance that conditions of policy to mitigate all forms of compulsory and forced labour including child labour are banned in the organization. • Genpact allows no tolerance against violating its basic integrity policy which outlines all forms of compliance towards human rights, corruption compulsory and forced labour including child labour. • Genpact is united on a foundation of unyielding integrity. Our customers rely on our integrity when they entrust their business to us. Each and every one of us needs to exemplify this essential value every day in everything we do in order to maintain this trust. • Business results are never more important than ethical conduct, compliance with law and compliance with Genpact policies. In order to illustrate the importance Genpact places on compliance, going forward Genpact plans to share with employees instances where Group of employees or vendors have fallen short of these values, as well as the actions Genpact is taking to ensure that Genpact’s foundation of integrity remains strong. • Genpact will continue to communicate to its employees all the inappropriate actions and its outcome to make sure employees and vendor staff is aware of zero tolerance towards breeching these policies. Bribery and Corruption Improper Payments Genpact policy prohibits its employees from offering anything of value to customers, governmental authorities or any person or party in order to obtain any advantage in selling goods and services, conducting financial transactions, or representing Genpact’s interests. Genpact does not authorize, involve itself in, or tolerate any business practice that does not follow this Policy. Any violation of this Policy would result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may also result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Genpact instructs its employees to never give, offer, or authorize the offer of, directly or indirectly, anything of value (such as money, goods or a service) to a customer or government official to obtain any improper advantage. Genpact also prohibits its employees from receiving improper payments Permissible payments Genpact does permit its employees to provide customers with ordinary and reasonable entertainment and gifts for the purpose of furthering business relationships, but only if such entertainment or gifts are permitted by: • Applicable law of the country concerned • The customer's own policies and procedures • The particular Genpact business component's procedures This Policy does not prohibit lawful reimbursement for reasonable and bona fide expenditures for travel and living expenses incurred by customers and directly related to the promotion of products or services, or to the execution of a contract. However, Genpact employees are instructed to consult their business legal counsel before making these kind of payments as the applicable laws in some jurisdictions may prohibit them. Genpact instructs its employees never to provide gifts or entertainment to government officials and employees without prior consultation with counsel, as these are highly regulated by law. Political contributions Genpact instructs it employees to obey the laws and regulations of all applicable jurisdictions with respect to political contributions and to never give or offer, directly or indirectly, a payment or anything of value (such as money, goods or services) to any political party, party official, or any candidate for political office of any country to influence or reward any governmental act or decision, or to obtain any improper advantage. Actions Taken • Genpact is among the first few to become a member of Partnering against Corruption Initiative. • Genpact conducts focused training on our policies relating to corruption to key risk groups, such as our business development terms and those handling government contracts. The company entertainment and travel policies have a clear approval matrix to ensure adherence and are audited on a sample basis to ensure compliance against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery. How to Raise a Concern Genpact believes that all its employees have a duty to act ethically, and to conduct business in accordance with applicable law and Genpact’s Values, which are based on a foundation of unyielding integrity. Genpact asks its employees to be vigilant for circumstances that may indicate illegal or unethical behavior, and to act appropriately and timely to prevent improper conduct. If an employee observes conduct that may violate Genpact’s policies, including improper payments, they have an obligation to report it. Genpact offers multiple avenues for such reporting – it can be to an employee’s immediate supervisor, a higher level of management, a local compliance person, a member of the Legal Department or a local or global ombudsperson. In addition, there is an ‘Ombuds box’ at most of Genpact’s larger locations where employees can place a concern, either signed or anonymously. Concerns can also be raised via email to ombudsperson@genpact.com anonymously or signed. Employee Responsibility Raising a Concern • Avoid grey areas • Raise the concern with your manager, compliance person assigned to your business, the legal counsel, • Ombudsperson or the next level of management • Complaints should address Policy breaches • Know the Genpact “No Retaliation Policy” Raising a concern is the duty of every Genpact employee What happens when a concern is raised Note:Each Genpact operating unit has a nominated Ombudsperson. For reporting any integrity concern or for answers to related queries contact your site Ombudsperson. You may also log on concerns at global.ombudsperson@genpact.com To the extent possible, anonymity and privacy of anyone raising a concern will be protected. Communication Genpact sends out communications on its anti-corruption policies at least twice a year. In the spring, Genpact sends out communications describing its anti-corruption policies in general, with examples targeting those areas that we deem of the greatest risk. This year, we are also sending a holiday reminder on Genpact’s policy requiring that entertainment and business courtesies be used only to enhance relationships, and prohibiting improper payments. The holiday reminder is sent at different times at different locations, to coincide with local holiday periods. In addition, Genpact sends out multiple reminders during the year of its Ombudsman process which enables employees to raise concerns outside their normal reporting channels, including the option to raise such concerns anonymously. Genpact also sends out multiple reminders of its anti-relation policy. Monitoring and Review Genpact conducts a Compliance Risk Assessment periodically. The CRA is a selfassessment aimed at identifying our business risks, assessing how we are responding to those risks and identifying key areas for improvement. The goal of this periodic assessment is to establish a baseline level of compliance risks, including risks of non-compliance with Genpact policies on corruption and related laws. The assessment includes verification of how well our controls are implemented and are working, whether training has been given as scheduled and whether issues have been reported, inter alia. Where shortfalls are found, the business unit is required to formulate an action plan to eliminate the shortfall, and reports on progress towards completion of all such plans. Reports detailing violations of Genpact integrity policies are prepared quarterly, and submitted to the Audit Committee of the Genpact Board of Directors. Any employee who has a question relating to a Genpact policy, is concerned that a policy is being violated or feels that he or she might be a victim of a policy violation such as harassment or unfair employment practices is encouraged to raise that concern, with assurance of privacy / anonymity, if desired. If such instances are to be reported or cited at any forum, then care is taken to protect the privacy of the individuals concerned especially of the victim, so that employees are not discouraged from bringing up these issues. Genpact believes that employees who come forward and raise policy concerns play an important role in maintaining our ethical workplace and protect the entire Genpact community: our company, our colleagues and our stakeholders. Genpact absolutely prohibits retaliation against anyone for raising a concern in good faith or assisting in an investigation of a policy question. Retaliation is grounds for discipline, up to and including dismissal Corporate Citizenship Genpact cares for the community. Caring@Genpact, our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, aims to mesh our social and environmental principles into our operational fabric. We have institutionalized a culture of giving among our employees through a number of global platforms and programs, like payroll giving and volunteerism. We provide our employees with a single community engagement interface to volunteer for community service events, including those related to the elderly, the differently-abled and children. Being a Responsible Corporate Citizen At Genpact, giving is a way of life. Genpact empowers its employees to give back to the communities where they live and work. Key themes are Environmental Conservation, Diversity in Workforce, community impact programs such as Genpact Volunteers, Employee Payroll Donations, Disaster Relief, Social Investments, and Recycling Used IT Equipment. Corporate Social Responsibility Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is the continuing commitment by companies to behave ethically and contribute to the economic development while improving the quality of life of their workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large. As we expand our footprint into more cities around the world, we also take on the responsibility to care for the communities from which we draw our talent. Corporate Citizenship has a critical role to play in shaping our company's success. Caring@Genpact is our global Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR) initiative. It involves us as an individual as well as a company and has a cross-functional stakeholder involvement to institutionalize Caring@Genpact. Our guiding principles are: • Embedded social and environmental code of conduct into our core operations and functions • Leverage our differentiating skills and competencies • Design and implement sustainable and scalable solutions We focus on sociallyrelevant areas that complement our business model and skills/competencies and systematically apply our distinctive strengths to maximize social and environmental value. Towards this goal, we have designed a number of global platforms and programs to make giving a way of life at Genpact and empower us to build stronger communities, where we live and work. While giving has always been a way of life at Genpact, we formally appointed a Global CSR Leader in 2007. We have been successfully able to deliver Global Business Impact and Local Community Impact, with 49,000 employees applying their unique skills to serve others. Genpact Volunteers ‘Employee volunteering’ was designed to mobilize community service and unleash the potential of our employees. Our mission is to encourage skill-based volunteering i.e. 'Teach a man to fish versus simply giving a man a fish' and strive for long-term partnerships that deliver sustainable impact. We believe our Volunteer base is the single most important asset we have which far outshines any amount of financial resources we can spend on society. We have partnered with credible non-profit organizations to support causes which are determined by the employees’ preferences and skills. While Europe runs a number of Environment-related voluntary programs, US volunteers for a number of United Way–related causes like Breast Cancer and AIDS. Most of the sites on the east of the globe work primarily on Education-related causes. One such program is the Junior Achievement program which opens up the possibilities of career options for underprivileged students and engages volunteers throughout India. We have an Executive Champion and team of Community Champions at each of our sites to catalyze this initiative and design effective community outreach programs, supporting a wide range of causes and non-profit organizations. In 2010 we saw 16% of our global population volunteering 7hours a year. This represents a hundred percent growth form 2009. In 2010 we also instituted a guideline which allows for an employee to take a minimum of 3 hours from work to devote to a social cause he or she is passionate about. Diversity in Workforce: Gender Currently, approximately 40% of Genpact’s global headcount and 35% of Indian headcount constitute women. Our SVP, Anju Talwar has been honoured with the WILL Recognition Award, under the WILL Women’s' Choice segment. To promote gender diversity, we have a global women affinity group called GenWIN (Genpact Women’s International Network). The mission of GenWIN is to foster the professional development of our women force. Some of the key highlights of this program are:  Empowering women with an informal base, support system, and training ground to gain professional and personal skills to build successful careers and strike a fine work-life balance  Providing women a platform to connect with other women colleagues and learn from each other’s experience  Actively promoting ‘Work from Home’ initiative to ensure women have the flexibility to strike a better work – life balance  Permitting extended maternity leave and sabbatical, when required  Actively working towards opening creche/day-care centers in all our upcoming sites  Providing need-based mentoring programs for women in leadership roles  Organizing specialized gender sensitivity trainings  Enforcing policies against sexual harassment  Promoting specialized hiring agreements with our manpower consultants, wherein consultants hiring women employees in leadership positions get a higher sourcing fee Diversity in Workforce: Hiring the Differently-Abled Today, Genpact has a family of 60 employees who are people with disabilities – orthopedically challenged, hearing, and visually impaired. These employees are all engaged with different operations and functions, ranging from accounting, insurance, and customer care to hiring and HR shared services. Some of our visually-impaired employees have been with us for more than 3 years and have grown from an associate level to middle management positions, handling different roles and responsibilities and even leading teams. We have also hired candidates with severe to extreme orthopaedic and hearing impairment to work in our Insurance vertical. To promote this initiative, Genpact is working on the following measures:  Promoting targeted hiring drives and participating in job fairs for differently-abled  Launching special Employee Referral Programs for employees to refer their differently-abled friends and relatives  Engaging with consultants to carry out a job mapping exercise to identify suitable opportunities for candidates who are differently-abled  Organizing a sensitization session for representatives from departments like hiring, training, operations, and other teams that comprise differently-abled talent  Conducting facilities access audits to ensure that our differently-abled employees do not face difficulties in the work environment; we earmark accessibility of our facilities and work towards implementing recommendations  Exploring and leveraging local Government incentives for differently-abled  Ensuring that our disabled workforce is not segregated or treated/tracked separately Employee Payroll Giving Donations Genpact has partnered with leading non-profit organizations to provide flexible and transparent platforms that enable employees to donate a small part of their salary to credible local charities with convenience and confidence. While these programs are voluntary, the employees have the option to change or discontinue their contribution. Today more than 5,000 employees across India, Mexico, Romania, Hungary and Philippines are cumulatively donating more than USD $275,000 a year! Country % of employees Partner Annual donating Donations India 20% Give India INR >75,00,000 Romania 20% United Way EURO 52,000 Hungary 30% United Way EURO 25,000 Mexico 33% United Way USD$ 26,500 Disaster Relief and Social Investments Disaster Relief The victims of natural disaster struggle to rebuild their lives and get back to their normal routine. Their immediate priority is food, shelter, clothing, medical assistance, and security. Genpact has always contributed significantly in the recovery process and has extended all the necessary support and resources to the victims. The most recent relief efforts include contributing to the Leh and Japan Disaster Relief. Social Investments We present solutions that leverage our unique competencies and our donations are targeted at sustainable and scalable socio-economic developments. In 2010, we have spent more than USD$ 300,000 to support the cause of employability, healthcare, environment and inclusion of rural folks and differently-abled folks. In addition, Genpact is currently involved in various other ongoing social investments programs. Two programs which merit mention are Primary Healthcare Dispensary and Industry-Academia Partnership. Public Health – Genpact has adopted and restored a non-functional government-run primary health centre in Gurgaon, Haryana. As part of this effort, Genpact has provided the healthcare centre with a team of doctors and nurses to help the many underprivileged citizens who otherwise do not have access to primary medical care. Services at the health centre focus on the preventive aspects of diseases such as basic health check-ups, pathological tests, immunizations, eye examinations and diagnostic tests. Free medicine is also provided at the facility. As an extension of these services we have also sponsored an emergency response ambulance service in Haryana, India where the services were non existent. This has enabled us to save lives of people caught in road accidents or otherwise in a critical condition. Industry-Academia Partnership – Genpact is working with colleges to enable more employable graduates. Genpact time-tested curriculum is imparted to the teachers who in turn teach the students. These include lessons to help students improve their pronunciation, grammar and fluency in English, business etiquette classes to help them handle interviews, customer service orientation required for all service areas today, as well as technical skills like accounting and customer service orientation. To date Genpact has conducted training in 40 colleges and trained 100 teachers. The teachers are expected to pass on the teaching so we can employ the best students from the graduating class. Genpact also trains students through Knowledge Centres established in Rajasthan to impart training directly to students who otherwise would not be able to get employment with us due to lack of certain domain skills, communication skills or other soft skills. We also provide scholarships to students in a college in Rajasthan and sponsor events to encourage the underprivileged kids get a well-rounded education. Recycle of Used IT Equipment Genpact has been in the process of streamlining IT asset donation programs, including End-to-End process from testing to assessing longevity, reloading OS, suggesting affordable Annual Maintenance Costs (AMC), and prescribing vendors for e-Waste disposal. So far, we have disposed over 7200 systems and laptops through authorized 'eWaste' vendors. In addition, we have donated over 1,500 systems to educational outfits and non-profit organizations in India. Environmental Conservation and Green Initiatives Environmental Conservation Genpact is committed to achieving excellence in safe and environment-friendly work practices by keeping in mind employees’ interest as well as those of the planet at large. Genpact has a global consolidated Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) policy signed by our CEO, Pramod Bhasin and displayed across every location. To remain in alignment with our legal policy, we have renamed it as Genpact SWE (Safe Work Environment) policy. Some of the key highlights of this program are: • Genpact has received ISO-14001 certification by BSI for all its Global operating sites for achieving environmental excellence at par with world-class standards this includes primarily India, China, Mexico, EMEA, Philippines • We ensure 100% compliance to all established regulatory standards for air pollution, noise pollution, effluent quality, etc. • We have set our own internal objectives and Mission Statement: targets on specific GENPACT is committed to achieving Safe Work environment environmental standards excellence by keeping in mind the employees’ interest as well as as per the requirement of those of the community at large.

Between 2009 and 2010 at least 4 of our sites in India were released transferring its employee based to new and more energy efficient sites. • Renewable energy source like solar power for heating water requirement is installed at one of the residential building. • Key energy initiatives at Genpact biggest and owned buildings like Uppal, Hyderabad and Phase V Gurgoan has alone reached to 16.5 and 14 % savings in consumptions already. Energy Recovery Ventilators treats fresh air unit with EcoFresh inside, exhausts stale, contaminated, conditioned room air and exchanges it with fresh outdoor air, recovering 75% energy from exhaust air through a next generation EcoFresh enthalpy rotor. Energy Recovery wheel slowly rotates between its two sections as explain in figure given below. In one section, the stale, conditioned air is passed through the wheel, and exhausted in the atmosphere. During this process, the wheel absorbs sensible and latent energy from the conditioned air, which is used to condition (cool/heat) the incoming fresh air in the other section, during the second half of its rotation cycle. Benefits of ERVs • Reduces the load on AHU’s by 65% latent & sensible heat recovery from conditioned air • Maintain Indoor Air Quality thus reduce IAQ related health risks • Avoid risk of infections from spreading • No need to increase the existing air – conditioning facility capacity • Huge savings on air – conditioning / energy bills • Decrease indoor exposure to mold • Decrease in absenteeism and health – related complaints from staff • Avoid negative publicity and loss of trust Carbon footprint for Travel Since the time we started monitoring our air carbon footprint in year 2008, Genpact has put forward stringent measures to reduce the air travel Measures like audio bridges, web chats, Video conferencing were primarily driven to educate employees to reduce travel, employee communications and campaigns were run across sites to educate and empower employees to switch off to VCs then to travel. • All these initiatives have Air Travel 2008 2009 2010 helped to bring down our travel footprint by Domestic 6754 1284 1323 75 % for domestic and International 15,785 7993 11603 30 % for international Ground travel. Travel Cabs 11420 9423 8649 Bus 897 697 522 • Ground travel used to Total commute employees Travel from home to office is carbon Tons of primarily driven with the emission CO2e 34856 19397 22097 fact considering safety of employees and night time travels, measures like optimum vehicle utilization, optimum travel time and route, frequency. • 4 Greenbelt projects were indentified and implemented under this initiative with over all impact of reducing 26 % reduction of our carbon foot-print since 2008. • As a part of our work life balance initiative, we also encourage employee to avoid travelling and allow them to work from home, this aspect ahs also helped to reduce our employee commute footprint Water Footprint Genpact had an increasing trend in its water footprint since 2005 to 2008 with direct increase in employee strength, once Genpact realised the fact, Genpact took several measures since 2008 to reduce its water footprint. Genpact developed several 2008 2009 2010 measures like • Replacing spring loaded taps water with normal taps consumption 348228 264899 274647 • Capping leaking hydrant and in KL plumbing lines employee 24,513 28282 29859 • Developing STP( sewage strength treatment plant) in each and per capita every of its owned site and water 14.2 9.3 9.1 making sure all leased site footprint has the STP to recycle nearly sqm 155,357 194171 194255.91 70-80 % of its get recycled per sqm and reused mostly for water 2.24 1.36 1.41 landscaping. footprint • 2 of its three Genpact owned sites already have water harvesting, including most of its leased site. • Uppal Site, at Hyderabad has developed self sustaining irrigation system. Employee Awareness and Engagement Journey towards sustainable future cannot be attained without employee participation and engagement. Employees form the core strength for Genpact. Genpact firmly believes that conservation stars from each one of us and each employee is ecologically empowered and responsible to contribute towards sustainable future. Genpact Safe work Environment team developed an initiative as’ YES’ – You Environment and Sustainability’. Under this initiative, various programs and campaigns like ‘ Personal carbon footprint calculator’ (web based calculator), launch of ; IThink’ link for employees to share their eco-friendly ideas, Blogs like ‘ I am doing My bit’ where every leader posted their story of what they do in their daily life in office and at home towards sustainable future, This has been a great inspirational blog where even some of the leaders learned from employees on how simple steps in our day to day life can help Environment. ‘one minute video’ showcase for employees to share their bit towards sustainability, carpool programs, clean up drives for premises and society at large, sapling plantation by employees and leaders who visits Genpact, sapling plantation at community at large ‘polyman’ walk across floors to make employees aware of the ill effects of plastics what would it lead to if we do not stop the wastage of it, Eco-friendly product kiosks for employees to explore and buy what’s latest green in the market, a source for them to explore renewable energy sources as well has hand made products. Participation in WWF Initiated ‘Earth hour’, Fashion show’ junk to Funk’, showcasing documentaries and movies related to global warming, Green gift to a fried, Eco-friendly day are also fun ways to make employees aware to contribute towards Environment Launch of personal carbon calculator Personal carbon calculator initiative was launched with an objective to make employees personally accountable and aware on how our everyday activities like watching TV, using car to commute, using water for everyday use, lights/fans AC, travelling through flights, In-fact many aspects of most of our activities impacts environment and when start calculating, we would realize the real effect of it and thereby create a sense of responsibility that even small things like switching off lights when you enter other room, changing all incandescent bulbs to CFL, carpooling and many simple tasks can help make a positive impact to the environment. We all talk about caring of environment but how much, how often is always a gray area so if we have measurement around it, that makes a real sense that at least if each person takes accountability of reducing their footprint, it eventually leads to environmental benefits. This has been perceived very positively among employees and each day we receive many employees who calculate and pledges to reduce their own footprint not only for office but even at home. Carpool initiative Many of our employees use their own cars to travel to work and back. We realized early on that getting groups of people to travel together living in one area not only helps employees save on the travel cost but also helps in reducing pollution and conserve natural resources. On top of all of this, employees also get a chance to connect with their peers outside work and at a more personal level – it’s; therefore, a win-win situation at all levels. Till date more than 1000 employees have registered across sites, we also have made special provisions for car-poolers to park in the prime first spots of parking.. We also have launched a website where car-poolers can register them self with the routes and employees can register themselves for the route and time. We continue to drive this among employees to reduce our over all impact on environment. YES! With the ‘ YES’ Program Genpact also launched a link ‘IThink’ where employees can submit ideas on environmental conservation which are evaluated and implemented where practically feasible So far more than 60 ideas have been successfully implemented across sites, some of them are using sippers or reusable glasses instead of disposable for drinking water, reduction of paper towels, double sided printing, reduction in the prints of our transport related log sheets, computer hibernation projects, spring loaded taps to reduce the water wastage. Employee blogs is another medium through which we continually engage and involve employee for best practice sharing and Eco-friendly ideas. Sapling plantation and offsetting the footprint Genpact decided to offset it s carbon footprint generated out of its annual customer facing event ‘ Focus 2009. In order to do this Genpact has to plant 350 saplings in order to offset 117 tons of CO2 generated out of the vent in next 30 years. Genpact volunteers planted remarkable 600 samplings at a government owned RTA (Road Transport Authority) which trains and issues driving licence to public to serve the community and reduce its carbon footprint. Earth Hour participation Since 2007 Genpact has been participating to support WWF initiative of Earth Hour globally, Watch Genpact in CNN-IBN Earth Hour Special! 2009 On the occasion Earth Day, Genpact participated in a TV show tonight on CNN-IBN channel's Earth Hour special, which was telecast live from Genpact, Building 4 in Gurgaon.

Thanks and regards, Vidya Srinivasan Global infrastructure and Logistics Leader Green IT Green IT is the latest buzz word in the industry. Genpact is committed to Green IT initiative and champions it aggressively. Towards this initiative, Genpact Corporate IT team explored various ideas, which could be implemented at low cost with high returns. Under the Leadership of Genpact CTO, SV Ramana, multiple areas of opportunity were identified and teams were assigned, with clear target time lines to achieve results. The Green IT initiative resulted in aggregated benefits of Rs206Mn Productivity in all form has been a key driver of all IT initiatives taken at Genpact. Industry drive towards Greener IT, clubbed with the organizational culture encouraged, the IT team to conceptualize and identify areas of opportunity in this area. Also while studying the benefits, behind this Green IT initiative, reduction in power consumption, paper usage, optimization of resource utilization, contribution to reduction in carbon emission, made it a very compelling proposition to undertake this as a project. Pressure to reduce IT cost during the present crisis was another key driver in identifying new areas of improvement. By enabling the systems to go into sleep mode, during idle time, availability of systems for longer period was enhanced Achievements made in the areas of concession for work from home, would help companies realize the benefits through lower attrition, employment opportunity for women employees, etc Green IT initiatives have contributed to the increased working capital and more cash flow for Genpact. In the area of Travel and Living, spend reduction resulted in a saving of Rs 90Mn. Using the data de-duplication 10TB of storage space was freed up. Server virtualization and consolidations have contributed to the tune of Rs 130Mn.
