The Aso-Nishihara Wind Farm generates 25 million kWh of electricity annually. ∆ Introduction of the Pre Isomeriser & Evaporator (PIE) method Asahi Breweries has successfully removed some of the flavor that negatively affects the beer, by boiling the hops in a small apparatus separately from the wort on their evaluation of the heat energy needed in detail by considering the amounts necessary for each reaction of constituents of the wort. With the PIE method, CO2 emission is reduced by 30 % in the boiling process of beer brewing and the Copyright © ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD. All rights reserved. 34 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities The Environment （Issued July 2011） amount of hops used has also been decreased by about 5%. Additionally, the method effectively increases the protein content, which allows the beer to maintain a head for longer. ∆ Utilizing Green Power to Produce Asahi Super Dry Promoting the use of natural energy, Asahi Breweries has proven itself an industry leader through its green power utilization at its breweries. One example of this utilization is at the Kanagawa Brewery of Asahi Breweries, which has been commissioning wind-powered generation through the Green Power Certification Program since 2002. Taking this effort a step further, we signed a new agreement with Japan New Energy Co., Ltd. in April 2009 for use of green energy for the production of Asahi Super Dry and other flagship products. Based on this agreement, 33.5 million kWh of energy needed to produce 350 ml canned Asahi Super Dry and beers used in gift sets are being generated by green power. These products carry a “Green Energy Mark” and are contributing to green power promotion and education. In 2009, we were awarded the 14th New Energy Award from the Director-General of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy in recognition of this effort. Furthermore, we began using green power to generate all the electricity (6.5 million kWh) consumed at our Head Office building from 2009. This brings our total annual use of green power to 40 million kWh, making us the largest user of green power in the food industry. ∆ Capturing CO2 through the Corporate-Owned Asahi Forest The corporate-owned Asahi Forest, managed by Asahi Breweries since 1941, spans a total of 2,165 hectares and absorbs 12,200 tons of CO2 each year. The Asahi Forest received FSC certification in 2001. ∆ Use of Solar Power Asahi Breweries installed a solar power generation system at the Hakata Brewery in March 2007. The system generates approximately 153,250 kWh each year, which reduces the amount of annual CO2 emissions by approximately 85 tons. The electricity generated by solar power is equivalent to the annual electricity used in areas of the brewery where visitor tours are conducted. ∆ Participation in the Challenge 25 Campaign Asahi Breweries is a participant in the Challenge 25 Campaign—a national movement promoted by the Japanese government—and is pursuing efforts to prevent global warming. ●Exhaust (Atmospheric Emissions) Management of Hazardous Chemical Substances In addition to monitoring and managing the volume of substances that fall under the PRTR Law, we formulated the Standards for Handling Reagents and Standards for Handling Poisonous and Deleterious Substances to carefully control the receiving, use and disposal of reagents designated by the Poisonous and Deleterious Substances Control Act used to check the quality of our products. Registration of Hazardous Chemical Substances In fiscal 2010 (April 2010 through March 2011), chemical substances requiring registration were as follows: Chemical Substances Requiring Registration (FY 2010, Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)

Efforts for Water Resource Preservation ∆ Reduction of Water Consumption, Control of Wastewater To save service water, we are reducing the amount of water we use for washing and sterilizing our tanks and pipe works and efficiently using water collected from the breweries. To control wastewater quality, Asahi Breweries purifies wastewater generated through the manufacturing process of beer-type beverages using anaerobic processing systems within our breweries before discharging it into sewers and rivers. Preventing Soil Contamination We set up breakwaters surrounding all entrances and storage tanks at our breweries to prevent soil contamination by cleansing agents and other chemicals used during the manufacturing process. To provide additional safeguard against any possible leakage of these liquids from tanks and other areas, we have established a system for ensuring the liquids are treated as wastewater by our in-house wastewater processing facility. In addition, we stringently control analytical reagents through inventory and usage records and locked storage, and we restrict their use to indoor analysis rooms to completely prevent them from contaminating the soil. We have obtained confirmation under ISO 14001-based audits that these activities are being maintained on a continuous basis. Copyright © ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD.

In 2001 we sought to strengthen our implementation of the Guidelines by establishing our own Eco Point Calculation Standard, a guideline for assessing levels of environmental consideration, which directs us in our selection of sales-promotion tools. Environmental Guidelines for reducing the Environmental Burden of Products and Sales-promotion Tools (Effective July 1, 2000) 1. Objective The goal is to observe the Environmental Guidelines for Reducing the Environmental Burden of Products and Sales-promotion Tools as the company develops products that comply with environmental conservation and promote waste reduction and recycling in sales activities, all in our continued efforts to advance the environmental preservation activities of the Asahi Group. 2. Basic Policy (2.1 Green Purchasing) Always practice green purchasing when producing or adopting product containers/packaging and sales-promotion tools. This is done by selecting materials that can be easily recycled after use, and choosing certified products bearing the Eco Mark and other badges of environmental certification. (2.2 Product Development) In the course of product development, consider the environmental burden of the product’s containers and packaging designs. (2.2.1 Container) Introduce lightweight, single-composition, recyclable materials for product containers to promote resource-saving, energy-saving, and recycling. (2.2.2 Container Packaging) Simplify container packaging to reduce the generation of waste. (2.3 Sales-promotion Tools) Reduce environmental burden in the production, adoption, and use of sales-promotion tools. (2.3.1 Materials for Sales-promotion Tools) In the production and adoption of sales-promotion tools, always practice green purchasing, and be sure that inappropriate materials are never used. Furthermore, pay attention to the use of composite or nonflammable materials that may prevent recycling or remanufacturing. (2.3.2 Review of Packing Style) For the packing of sales-promotion tools, consider packing materials and designs that produce less waste. Also be sure to check for packing materials that are environmentally friendly, and for excess packing materials in individual wrappings. (2.3.3 Appropriate Production Volume and Inventory Levels) Before producing and using sales-promotion tools, review plans to determine whether the production volume, inventory level, and items themselves are appropriate, with minimal chances of wasteful consumption due to nonuse or other reasons. (2.3.4 Waste Disposition) Promote the sorting and recycling of refuse in the waste treatment of sales-promotion tools. 3. Promotion of Recycling Actively educate business partners and customers on the processes involved in container recycling, including the collection of returnable bottles and empty containers.

Development of Technology for Simultaneous Production of Sugar and Ethanol from Sugarcane Asahi Breweries and the National Agricultural Research Center for Kyushu Okinawa Region have jointly developed a combined process for producing sugar and ethanol that uses a new variety of high-biomass sugarcane. With 1.5 times more biomass than the sugarcane used in sugar production, it can be used to produce large quantities of biomass at low cost while maintaining sugar production volume. The process not only allows for simultaneous production of sugar and ethanol through a single process, but also enables ethanol production without fossil fuel consumption.This is possible through the use of bagasse (residue generated from sugarcane production) as a sole energy source. We began conducting verification tests on the technology on Ie Island in Okinawa from January 2006 to March 2010. We successfully verified that it can yield over five times the production volume of ethanol from the same area of cropland, compared with conventional technology, while maintaining the current level of sugar production volume. We also confirmed that the process reduces greenhouse gases by approximately 40 tons per hectare of cropland, or 57 times more than the conventional technology. The tests proved that the technology offers both economic and environmental benefits. The result of our experiment has been ranked among the Ten outstanding topics of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Research Results, 2010 compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. It is regarded as a promising technology that may also be effective in reducing greenhouse gases. Asahi Breweries will remain committed to enhancing this technology for commercialization. Development of Technology for Low-cost Production of Cellulase Enzyme from Wastepaper Asahi Breweries was the first company worldwide to develop a technology that uses wastepaper as raw material for producing cellulase enzymes that break down cellulose—a main constituent of plant fiber and cell walls—into sugar. Our technology has made it possible to produce cellulase at less than one-tenth of the cost of conventional methods without involving genetic modification, and is thus expected to contribute significantly to food processing and the diffusion and promotion of bioethanol. We intend to continue developing a mass production technology for cellulase. Copyright © ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD.

Efforts for ecosystem preservation Theme Company Content Asahi Breweries, Created a dragonfly pond in 1996. Utilized as public environmental Ltd. Nishinomiya education site. Brewery An employee with Class-II biotope management qualifications of the Asahi Breweries, Ecosystem Conservation Society-Japan created a biotope in the Ltd. Ibaraki corner of the open garden in which local children released Luciola Brewery lateralis firefly larvae. In 2009, several larvae matured into adult fireflies. We intend to continue our efforts to revive natural habitats. With the factory’s advantage of being near the abundant natural Biotope construction environment at the foot of Mt. Mikami (also known as Omi-Fuji), a biotope was constructed in the green space on the factory grounds through the efforts of all the employees. Its pond is home to killifish, Asahi Beer Malt, carp, Japanese bitterling and dragonfly larvae, and over it various Ltd. dragonfly species glide about, including the red dragonfly, darner and commons skimmer as well as damselflies. The biotope’s protected forest is visited by pheasants, sparrows, bush warblers, bulbuls, starlings and other birds. Asahi Breweries, Constructed a biotope in which firefly larvae have been bred 2002, Ltd. Kanagawa when the brewery was completed. The pond has become a habitat Brewery supporting the birth of many fireflies. We received FSC certification* from the Forest Stewardship Council, an international forest certification organization, in 2001 for conducting Ecosystem forest management that emphasizes environmental preservation. In preservation efforts 2008, we became the first to receive CO2 absorption certification from Asahi Breweries, through the a third-party organization. Since then, we have continued to promote Ltd. corporate-owned forestation and the nurturing of planted forests as well as the Asahi Forest protection of native forests based on FSC’s 10 Principles and Criteria for forest management, including regular monitoring using a GIS (Geographic Information System). To save forests, an essential element of our business, Asahi Breweries has made a continuous effort to preserve the forests serving as water resources for each brewery. Employees and their families from all Asahi Breweries and Group companies consistently volunteer for Water preservation community-based activities, including planting saplings, trimming Asahi Breweries, activities for shrubs and overgrown branches, in addition to thinning, with the Ltd. breweries cooperation of local NPOs, forestry unions, administration offices, and the National Land Afforestation Promotion Organization. In 2010, 13 such efforts were undertaken at all 9 breweries. This has raised the aggregate total from between 2004 and 2010 to 58, and the total number of participants to 2,900. * FSC certification: A system under which an independent third-party organization screens and certifies that a forest is being managed appropriately.

Under this guideline, incidents are promptly reported through a designated emergency channel to the president, who then chairs a Crisis Response Meeting, and a task force is established to handle the situation. In responding to accidents, we place top priority on safeguarding the lives (health) of our customers and make a company-wide effort to minimize any damage through the following basic approach. (1) We endeavor to ascertain the facts and circumstances, promptly disclose necessary information and contain potential damage and increase in concern. (2) We take the initiative in taking every appropriate action for our customers and society, including disclosure to the mass media, corporate announcements (information calling for attention), recalls, and so forth. (3) We promptly report to the supervising authorities and quickly respond to any requirements. The Asahi Group implemented three voluntary recalls in fiscal 2010 as outlined below. Each case has been taken up by the Asahi Group Quality Management Committee, which has conducted discussions and information sharing on tasks and measures related to quality assurance as well as our emergency response. Efforts are underway to prevent recurrences and to reinforce our quality assurance system as a group. Report on voluntary product recalls (FY 2010) Company Outline and Response to Accidents Incident summary: In December 2010, it was discovered that some of the canned Asahi Chocolat Cocktail products manufactured and sold under consignment by Japan Foods Co. might have been shipped and sold without their lids having been properly sealed. Asahi Response: Breweries, We immediately held a Crisis Response Meeting and set up a task force. After confirming the Ltd. facts, we determined that the incident was unlikely to recur. However, it was possible that affected products had not been detected and removed during inspectionｓ in the manufacturing process due to a combination of conditions. We therefore decided to voluntarily recall the product in order to ensure maximum safety.

Improvements in label’s text on casings for beer-type beverages to show whether the content can be removed individually or in six-packs In response to customers commenting that from the external packaging it was difficult to ascertain whether cans were packed in units of six or individually, we added the expressions, “Cans may be taken out of the box individually” and “Six-pack × 4” on three sides (top, a long side, a short side). Easy-to-understand disclosure of nutritional information of products via our Web site We provide detailed nutritional information about beer-type beverages on the Asahi Breweries Web site in response to the growing number of customer inquiries on ingredient labeling.

Under this system, employees submit their work information to their supervisors for confirmation and approval on the administrator’s screen. Since the system was based on self-reported data, however, service overtime was possible. Therefore, Asahi Breweries introduced an additional overtime management system in December 2007 that displays log-in and log-off times on employees’ computers to encourage proper reporting of work hours. The system records when employees log-in and log-off their computers and displays this data as a point of reference on each employee’s computer screen as well as the screen for supervisor authorization. Any significant discrepancy from self-reported data is displayed as highlighted text to alert the related worker. We intend to use this new system as an opportunity for raising employee awareness of appropriate self-reporting and work habits and to encourage them to adopt more productive practices.
