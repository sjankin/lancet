In a context marked by major accidents (Deepwater Horizon, Fukushima), political instability in the Arab world, and ever-fiercer competition, energy issues are raising concerns and expectations. It is still too early to learn all of the lessons from the Fukushima accident, but it is clear that absolute requirement with safety and security standards is paramount. AREVA has always made safety and security its priority, and has done so with transparency and dialogue. This is, for us, the very foundation of the sustainable development philosophy that has been the mainstay of our industrial strategy ever since the Group was created. Nuclear energy is part of the solution to the world’s energy issues. We remain convinced that we can develop this technology in perfect harmony with the economic, environmental and societal standards required for sustainable development. We are also pursuing our development in renewable energies: we believe they are complementary to nuclear energy as part of a range of solutions designed to generate electricity with fewer CO2 emissions. Inspired by these ambitions, I made a personal commitment, alongside the Secretary-General of the United Nations, when that organization published the Global Compact – the first effective partnership ever established between the UN and the business world – to further the cause of sustainable development. For us, the Global Compact is a platform for exchange that gives us deeper insights into how to deliver our actions on human rights, labour standards, the environment and the fight against corruption. The Compact’s ten principles guide our actions and provide the basis for our Values Charter. This Communication on Progress for 2010 attests to AREVA’s constant and renewed commitment to a strategy of sustainable development and responsible growth, in keeping with the Global Compact. It is therefore with pleasure, and with determination, that the AREVA group reaffirms it support for the principles of the Global Compact. Anne Lauvergeon Chairman of the Executive Board and Chief Executive Officer 2001-2011 4 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 1. Introduction 1.1. About the AREVA group AREVA is a société anonyme (limited company under French law) with executive and supervisory boards, incorporated under French law. Its head office is in Paris, France. AREVA’s customer base consists of large electric utilities, public entities and major industries. AREVA supplies solutions for power generation with less carbon. Its expertise and unwavering insistence on safety, security, transparency and ethics are setting the standard, and its responsible development is anchored in a process of continuous improvement. Ranked first in the global nuclear power industry, AREVA’s unique integrated offering to utilities covers every stage of the fuel cycle, nuclear reactor design and construction, and related services. The group is also expanding in renewable energies – wind, solar, bioenergies, hydrogen and storage – to be one of the top three in this sector worldwide by 2012. With these two major offers, AREVA’s 48,000 employees are helping to supply ever safer, cleaner and more economical energy to the greatest number of people. The group’s operational organization is based on 5 Business groups: Mining, Front End, Reactors and Services, Back End, and Renewable Energy. 1.2. Sustainable development – at the heart of AREVA’s industrial strategy The AREVA group is a supplier of low-carbon energy production technologies: nuclear and renewables. A strategy that puts it at the heart of the issues – economic, technical, environmental, social – facing the world of today, and particularly those relating to energy. Ever since AREVA was founded, the Board has sought to embed the group’s strategy in a commitment to sustainable development and continuous improvement. Ten sustainable development commitments AREVA’s sustainable development policy centers around ten commitments that embody the group’s attitude of responsibility. They determine the conduct of our operations, and the attainment of our strategic objectives. The management is responsible for implementing these commitments at every level. As part of our continuous improvement dynamic, all of the group's entities regularly assess their performance towards fulfilling the 10 commitments. Our continuous improvement process is based on the analysis of these assessments, as well as on benchmark studies and on the opinions of our stakeholders, which we elicit at regular intervals. 5 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 AREVA’s 10 sustainable development commitments Regular trust-based dialogue with stakeholders Dialogue and consensus building form one of our ten sustainable development commitments. The aim for AREVA is to develop and maintain a relationship of trust with all of the actors it deals with, broadening and enriching its vision by taking on board the concerns and expectations of the stakeholders, and creating lasting local ties. AREVA listens: through local interviews and through a global consultation approach with an international panel of representatives from civil society, as well as through active participation in local forums such as information commissions, multidisciplinary expert groups, and public debates. AREVA commits to the principles of the Global Compact AREVA signed up to the UN Global Compact in March 2003, thereby committing to ten universal principles concerning human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and the fight against corruption Beyond its participation in initiatives developed by the Global Compact itself (such as the Human Rights Working group, or the “Caring for Climate” initiative) AREVA is an active member of other organizations and initiatives set up to promote and share experience in the fields covered by the Global Compact, including Businesses and Human Rights (BHR), the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). Our Values Charter explicitly incorporates the principles of the Global Compact. The Values Charter applies to every operation managed by the group, in every country where we do business. 6 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Our Values  Customer satisfaction  Profitability  Responsibility  Sincerity  Integrity  Acute sense of professionalism  Sincerity  Partnership To find out more: See the Appendix for the 2010 Sustainable Development Action Scorecard Anticipating requirements – and turning them into new opportunities Beyond these commitments, AREVA is attentive to new developments in corporate social responsibility. The group took an active part in the development of the “ISO 26000” process in France: a set of guidelines aimed at providing an international voluntary framework of reference on matters of corporate social responsibility. The group is convinced that, independently of the voluntary or statutory nature of such mechanisms, their effective implementation creates new perspectives for its various activities and enables AREVA to improve the way it does business. 7 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 AREVA and the ISO 26000 In a spirit of continuous improvement, and to anticipate new challenges and new stakeholder expectations, AREVA is receptive to all CSR initiatives, and interacts with numerous working groups in this field. AREVA sees ISO 26000 as a significant step forward and as a frame of reference for its core subject areas, due to its international character and to the broad panel of stakeholders involved in its development. AREVA was engaged upstream in ISO 26000 by participating in the French standard drafting committee and in the organization of the 2nd Symposium on Corporate Social Responsibility on 7 December 2010, the event that marked the launch of ISO 26000 in France Moreover, most of the ISO 26000 core subject areas are already part of the group’s sustainable development and continuous improvement approach. Those that were not already covered are currently being integrated into the AREVA WAY internal self-assessment program. 2. AREVA’s implementation of the principles of the Global Compact AREVA publishes a number of documents reporting on its objectives and on the results obtained for each of its ten sustainable development commitments, notably: the “Report on Responsible Growth in 2010” (the group’s annual and sustainable development report), the Figures supplement of the report, the 2010 Reference Document1, and the Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire. This Communication on progress is a non-exhaustive illustration of how AREVA sets about implementing, on a daily basis, the ten principles of the Global Compact. The attached documents, and those referenced in the text, are an essential complement to this Communication on Progress. To find out more: Available on www.areva.com: • The Report on Responsible Growth • The “2010 Figures” supplement 1 This Reference Document was filed with the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF, the French financial market authority) on March 30, 2011, in accordance with article 212-13 of its general regulations. 8 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 2.1. The Global Compact in action: implementing the principles on human rights Human rights 1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and 2. make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Commitment For AREVA, respect for human rights is built into the group’s Values Charter, and is an integral part of the policies, practices, actions and initiatives across all of the group’s businesses. For a multinational company, respect of human rights encompasses in particular the respect for human dignity, non-discrimination and the rejection of harassment in all its forms, respect for privacy, neutrality with regard to philosophical, political and religious beliefs, compliance with safety standards and prevention of damage to health, social dialogue, training, the absence of forced labour, compliance with labour regulations, and the prohibition of child labour at its sites and at those of its suppliers and partners. Actions Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Values Charter AREVA’s Values Charter, established in 2003, refers explicitly to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention, to the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and to the principles of the Global Compact. The Charter is distributed to every employee (it is available in 15 languages) and is brought to the attention of the stakeholders. It sets out the values, principles of action, and rules of conduct to be applied and implemented by the Corporate Directors and by the management of every one of the group’s units and subsidiaries. Compliance with the Charter is included in the scope of the group audit. Ensuring safety in the workplace for our employees and subcontractors The protection of employees and subcontractor personnel is a priority for the AREVA group. Because safety is integral to the group’s business, it is factored into the design of facilities and monitored throughout their operating life, through to their final dismantling. With the constant aim of preventing any risk to the health and safety of our employees, our subcontractors and the people who live near our sites, we apply the strictest international standards in assessing the 9 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 impact of our activities. These standards are regularly updated to take account of technological advances, new knowledge, and the feedback of experience. To this end, AREVA is committed to constantly improving health and safety at work, reinforcing the consideration given to quality of life in the workplace, and monitoring the impact of its sites’ activities on the health of nearby populations. In 2010, the group continued to roll out its safety at work policy via regular site visits by teams from the Safety, Health, Security and Environment department, building on management responsibility, continuous improvement and the involvement of all personnel. * The frequency rate for work-related accidents is calculated as follows: Number of accidents with lost time per million hours worked * The gravity rate for work-related accidents is calculated as follows: Number of days lost per thousand hours worked The frequency rate has been divided by three in the space of five years (FR of 6.6 in 2004, 2.04 in 2009, 2.03 in 2010) and the target frequency rate for 2010 has been achieved 18 months in advance. AREVA seeks to extend this ambitious policy to its suppliers. By way of example, the Safety, Quality and Purchasing departments of the Mining BG organized for the first time, on December 14, 2010, a safety convention for their suppliers, bringing together 33 subcontractor firms from all five continents. In an atmosphere of fruitful discussion, the event gave the Mining BG teams the opportunity to present safety issues and related objectives, as well as their expectations with regard to their suppliers. AREVA also used the occasion to salute the 2010 results of three of its subcontractor partners, by awarding prizes in recognition of their commitment to safety in the workplace. Improving the health of our employees and subcontractors The priority objectives of AREVA’s health policy for 2008-2010 were the improvement of health in the workplace, the implementation of measures to improve living conditions at work, and the pursuit of public health actions in the countries where the group operates. AREVA’s nuclear safety charter guides group policy on nuclear safety and radiation protection, and defines the corresponding principles of organization and action. The group consistently applies the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle to keep personnel exposure to ionizing radiation as low as is 10 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 reasonably possible with regard to the technical, economic and social factors. All of the group’s employees and subcontractors benefit from the same prevention and protection actions. AREVA has voluntarily set itself the target of not exceeding a maximum individual ionizing radiation exposure dose of 20 mSv over twelve months, for all of its employees and subcontractors in all of the countries where it operates, even if the local regulations allow for a higher limit. In 2010, no employee or service provider received an annual dose greater than 20 mSv. 64.3% of employees and 75.3% of subcontractor staff received a dose of between 0 and 2 mSv. To put these figures in context, the average annual exposure to ionizing radiation from natural sources in France is in the order of 2.4 mSv. AREVA’s health policy for 2008-2010 focused on three main goals: • Contributing to the constant improvement of the health of our employees and subcontractors; • Promoting public health actions in the different countries where we operate; • Developing actions aimed at improving quality of life in the workplace. In 2010, the deployment of the health policy centered mainly on: • Implementing actions for the integration and employment maintenance for workers with limited work capacity, across all of the sites; • Psychosocial risks, with the gradual deployment of support and counseling for employees; • The definition and application of standards for the preservation of health at work, notably with regard to hazardous chemical agents. The group also pursued ongoing initiatives in the following areas: • Implementing a procedure for the protection of employees in noisy work environments; • The deployment of the health observatories; • AIDS policy. Preventing psychosocial risks As part of a general impetus towards improving quality of life in the workplace, jointly driven by the Safety, Health, Security and Environment department and the Human Resources department, several psychosocial risk management actions have been undertaken since 2007. Three mechanisms are currently being phased 11 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 in at the French sites: support and counseling for employees, studies of workplace living conditions, and specific training for senior and middle managers. The support and counseling mechanism covers more than 65% of the group’s employees. Several surveys of living conditions at work were carried out in 2010, giving nearly 25% of the personnel an opportunity to express their feelings about their day-to-day working conditions. These studies were followed by action plans designed on the basis of inclusive participation. Finally, a training program for managers and management committees was defined in 2010 and will be rolled out across the group starting in July 2011. The program is designed to reinforce the AREVA group’s determination to foster a culture of risk prevention in psychosocial as well as other areas, and to improve the quality of life in the workplace at every level of the business. In parallel with these initiatives, a negotiation process was launched in 2010 with the social partners on the quality of life in the workp, for the whole of AREVA France. Pursuing the health observatory project In pursuance of the initiative announced by AREVA’s Chief Executive Officer in March 2007, the group concluded an agreement with the NGOs SHERPA and Médecins du Monde in 2009 to create health observatories around the mining sites operated by AREVA, and to set up a Multidisciplinary Health Observation group. The aim of this body is to study, in France and abroad, the health of workers in AREVA’s uranium mines and the potential impact of mining activities on the health of local populations. If cases of mining-related illness are detected, the corresponding treatment will be paid for by AREVA in exactly the same way as under the French health insurance system. The progressive implementation of these health observatories is an unprecedented initiative, and seeks to provide answers to questions that have been raised by civil society and a number of stakeholders. The first health observatory was set up in Gabon on October 19, 2010, and the procedures for validating and authorizing the necessary structures are still under way to open a one in Niger. Similar initiatives are also ongoing to conduct epidemiological studies and provide medical surveillance for the current and former miners in Namibia, Canada, and Kazakhstan. Improving the health of local populations: AREVA’s AIDS policy AREVA’s contribution to achieving Millennium Development Goal 6: “Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases” Conscious of the grave human, social and economic consequences of the pandemic, AREVA contributes, within its sphere of influence, to containing the spread of the disease and reducing its impact via a specific HIV /AIDS policy that reflects the group’s values and its sustainable development policy. This multi-dimensional approach – covering education and prevention, testing, access to healthcare and advice, privacy and non-discrimination – is designed to fit in with national health policies. 12 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 For a broader vision of the issues, AREVA participates in the work of the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GBC Health), a forum for sharing cross-sector best practices, of which it is a member. In this context, AREVA helped set up a tripartite public/private partnership in Niger (jointly with the healthcare NGO Esther and the government of Niger) at the end of 2006, with support from the Global Fund. To find out more See the Global Compact document: Embedding Human Rights in Business Practice In parallel, the AREVA Foundation is committed to working for medical research and access to healthcare for all, especially population groups affected by AIDS. It provides financial support for medical bodies and NGOs to train local teams, renovate healthcare centers, or fund expensive equipment. The AREVA Foundation also finances research programs by the Pasteur Institute in Paris and Shanghai. Support for research programs… The Pasteur Institute in Paris has launched a two-year research project on the treatment of patients infected by the HIV virus since childhood. The project seeks to establish the detailed immunology of 200 subjects infected by AIDS for at least the last fifteen years. The results of the study will improve knowledge of the disease and strengthen therapeutic care for subjects infected at birth. The AREVA Foundation also supports field actions to assist patients affected by the virus, notably in South Africa, India and China. …and for field actions Between 2008 and 2010, the AREVA Foundation sponsored a village run by the Association François-Xavier Bagnoud in Medinipur, India, one of several such FXB Villages , as they are known, in countries affected by AIDS and poverty. The model is based on community mutual assistance and sharing. The AREVA Foundation has renewed its commitment to FXB, for a further three-year period, from 2011 to 2013, supporting a rural village in the Buo To district of China. 13 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Contributing to local economic development AREVA participates in the economic and social development of the areas where it operates. The group invests in a number of fields to promote development, the diversification of economic activity, and job creation. It is also active in encouraging education initiatives, the deployment of training programs, and community access to healthcare. To do so, the group works alongside local partners. On the ground, AREVA relies on AREVADELFI, a company that came into being in 1998. AREVADELFI operates in every area where AREVA has industrial facilities, providing financial support for SMEs/SMIs in the form of venture capital or growth contracts. To date, in 2010, 4218 jobs have been created, or are being created in France with AREVADELFI’s help. A specific campaign called AREVADELFI HANDICAP has been launched to encourage the emergence of businesses developed by people with disabilities. Principle 2: Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Corporate complicity in human rights abuses by third parties often stems from a lack of awareness among the management. For this reason, at AREVA, the management is accountable for implementing the various policies, for which it can call on the support of several of the group’s functional departments (Business Ethics; HR; Sustainable Development; Safety, Security, Health, Environment, etc.), all of which are active in the global initiative to promote human rights. The management is given specific awareness training, described below. Promoting human rights AREVA is one of the eight French-speaking companies behind Entreprises pour les Droits de l’Homme (EDH), an initiative inspired by Business Leaders Initiative on Human Rights (BLIHR) and which aims to build human rights considerations into all corporate strategy and professional practice. EDH, a non-profit French organization, focused in 2010 mainly on the implementation of two awarenessraising sessions on human rights in business for the senior executives of the eight EDH member companies. AREVA was closely involved in organizing these sessions, making available a member of the Sustainable Development department, also active in promoting EDH’s activities and respect for human rights within the group. The target for 2011 is to organize three training sessions, including one in English. Almost 100 people have taken this inter-company module since October 2009. AREVA also participated actively, within EDH, in the public consultation on the guiding principles on human rights proposed by John Ruggie, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative on human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. EDH’s contribution to the debate, “Towards an operational implementation of human rights in business practice” was published on the website of the Business and Human Rights Resource Center. Ethics training The Corporate Business Ethics Advisor and AREVA University continued in 2010 to organize and run residential training sessions for senior and middle managers on business ethics and the group’s values, with a series of diversified programs. A specific chapter on human rights has now been added to the training 14 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 module. Three sessions were held in 2010, one in Germany and two in the United States, involving a total of 60 participants. Since 2003, 18 sessions have been dispensed. To reach out to a larger number of employees, an international group values and business ethics awareness course (in English) has been made available on-line as an e-learning module. Versions in German, Chinese, and French are planned in 2010. Supplier awareness raising and the sustainable development commitments In keeping with its overarching sustainable development and continuous improvement approach, the AREVA group has, since 2006, asked its suppliers to contribute to this approach by inviting them to sign up to the “Sustainable Development Declaration for Suppliers”. Other, complementary, initiatives have been launched by the Purchasing department, based on detailed supplier mapping, including buyer training, supplier audits, and supplier support. The first social and environmental responsibility (CSR) audits were conducted at the end of 2008 by an external expert. The audit framework was compiled by combining the experience of the partner firm with the more specific expertise of several of the group’s departments (Sustainable Development; Health, Safety, Security and Environment). The reference framework covers a wide range of chapters: human rights, labour standards, health and safety, the environment, community involvement, and risk management. At the end of 2008, the AREVA Purchasing department implemented a training module dedicated to the “Responsible Purchasing” program, as part of a two-year professional qualification program. With its mix of videos, in-situation photos, key figures, case studies and explanations of the procedures to follow, this course goes down very well with the buyers, who appreciate some support and guidance in an area that they see as an integral part of their remit. The training includes a human rights awareness component. At the end of 2010, 192 participants had taken the course. Purchasing has also developed a supplier support process in consultation with other departments: Sustainable Development; Health, Safety, Security, Environment; Human Resources, and Quality. 2.2. The Global Compact in action: implementing the principles on labour standards Labour standards 3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; 4. the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; 5. the effective abolition of child labour; and 6. the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 15 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Commitment AREVA undertakes to be an attentive, responsible employer, to encourage professional development among its employees and to monitor their working conditions. The professional and personal development of its employees is a key priority for AREVA, and the group has implemented various procedures to measure working conditions and employee satisfaction. AREVA is convinced that social dialogue and diversity are sources of innovation and progress, and does all it can to create a climate of understanding and acceptance of others that favors inclusion and equal opportunity for all. This approach is based on the principles of honesty and transparency that govern relations between the HR teams, the social partners and the management. These principles are embodied in the group’s Values Charter. Extracts from the Values Charter: “We trust our employees and are committed to honest, frank, two-way dialog with them and the organizations that represent them.” “We conduct our operations with the utmost respect for human dignity and will not tolerate harassment of any kind nor any violation of human and children’s rights.” “AREVA’s workforce is constituted without discrimination as to, in particular, race, color, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, political opinions, national extraction or social origin. We believe that management should increasingly mirror this diversity. At AREVA, we respect the privacy of our employees. AREVA remains neutral regarding political opinions, philosophical beliefs and religious faiths. We expect our employees to respect the beliefs of others and to refrain from any proselytizing.” Actions Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining AREVA wants employee representatives to be closely involved in major social change within the group. The theme of diversity is ideally suited for this type of dialogue, and several activities were carried out in the ODEO spirit (“Open Dialogue through Equal Opportunities”): ensuring the sustainability of the ODEO initiative with an amendment to the 2006 agreement that renews the agreement on workers with disabilities, organizing the second ODEO European Days on gender balance and disabilities, negotiating and deploying the action plan for seniors, and the signature of an agreement on equal opportunity in the workplace. Involving employee representatives in the decision-making process The AREVA group has rolled out an ambitious social policy to promote dialogue in its European operations. On average, nearly two agreements are signed each week with its labour partners. The labour partners have also been closely involved in defining the optimized, operations-oriented organization for the group. The group’s Supervisory Board includes three members elected by company personnel. In each of the countries where the group operates, the management engages in social dialogue in a way that is sensitive to local systems and practices. In Germany, for example, the HR department conducted 16 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 negotiations on new projects in 2010, relating to evaluation processes, target-setting, short-term performance-based pay and people reviews. In Niger, employee representative bodies have been put in place: unions, staff delegates, and a committee on health and safety at work. These bodies meet regularly with the employer, at monthly, quarterly or annual meetings, which are recorded in official minutes. Consultations are organized with the workers’ representatives when information needs to be circulated to the employees. Awareness-raising sessions for workers on their rights and responsibilities, notably on workplace health and safety issues, are also held with the unions and staff delegates. The latter are received by the management, either at their request, or at the management’s initiative, to discuss any pressing concerns. In China, AREVA complies with the local law that allows legal entities with more than 25 local employees to set up a representative body, if the employees so wish, with the support of the management. At the request of the representatives, a collective agreement can be signed to define the pay structure. Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced & compulsory labour Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour Respect for human dignity is a core value for AREVA: the group condemns any abuse of human rights and in particular children’s rights. This means that there must be no recourse to forced or compulsory labour, or to child labour, at any of its sites. In every country where it operates, the group conforms to the local labour legislation and universally complies with the Declaration of the International Labour Organization (ILO) on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Where provided for by local regulations, employees are given work contracts from their country of origin or country of employment, specifying the job for which they have been recruited. In China, for example, every employee signs a work contract for a fixed or indefinite period, which automatically becomes a permanent work contract on its second renewal, in accordance with Chinese legislation passed in 2008. Similarly, all suppliers are given a copy of the AREVA Values Charter, which explicitly cites the principles of the Global Compact and the founding texts of the ILO. In 2005, AREVA introduced a sustainable development commitment to be honored by its suppliers. At the end of 2010, 88% of the Group’s purchases (by volume) were from suppliers who had signed the “Sustainable Development Declaration”. This document was signed by all of AREVA’s new business partners in 2010. At the end of 2008, AREVA’s Purchasing department put in place a training module dedicated to the “Responsible Purchasing” program, as part of a two-year professional qualification course. This module looks in particular at the issue of compliance with international legislation on child labour. 17 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation AREVA’s contribution to achieving Millennium Development Goal 3: “Promote gender equality and empower women” Commitment AREVA guarantees equal opportunity for all: in recruitment, in skills development, regardless of gender, age, political or religious affiliation, physical characteristics or ethnic origin. AREVA seeks to set a standard for fairness in the treatment of its employees throughout the world. AREVA’s non-discrimination policy is rooted in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the internal Values Charter, the AREVA Way continuous improvement approach, and the European equal opportunity agreement signed in 2006 and renewed in April 2010. The importance given to these values, and to their implementation at ground level, led to the creation of the “Diversity & Equal Opportunity” section of the group’s Human Resources department. Organization and processes This new entity, set up in January 2010, reflects the group’s commitment to diversity. The Diversity and Equal Opportunity department has a dual purpose: federating all of the group’s initiatives in favor of diversity and equal opportunity, and mobilizing for the fight against discrimination in all its forms. The principles of non-discrimination and respect for diversity are built into the recruitment process. Recruiters take a common training course that enables everyone involved in recruitment to be more objective in their decision-making, thus ensuring equal treatment for applicants. To support this joint approach, the group has acquired a centralized recruitment tool – “e-Talent” – that brings together, and archives, all of the elements involved in the selection and tracking of job applications. This means that the recruitment process can be analyzed retrospectively to prevent any risk of discrimination. With regard to employee career management, the development goals of diversity and equal treatment are integrated into the existing system of personnel reviews, at panel and committee meetings. Moreover, all employees, whatever their status – management or non-management – are given an annual appraisal based on an interview format common to the entire group. 18 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Focus: Recognition of diversity and anti-discrimination actions In keeping with its commitments and the diversity and equal opportunity actions undertaken since its creation, AREVA took another step forward on March 5, 2010, by obtaining diversity certification – the Label Diversité – becoming the first group to gain certification as part of a global initiative for all of its entities in France. The label is intended to reward and reinforce the group’s social responsibility initiatives. As well as recognizing the commitments made by AREVA, the label is also an invitation to continue along the same path. It requires the group to maintain particularly high standards as it rolls out its initiatives on a European and global scale. Actions Diversity and equal opportunity AREVA sees diversity as a key factor in performance. In support of people with disabilities The role of the Handicap Mission is to raise awareness of disability-related issues, so that disability ceases to be a barrier to employment and to the development of skills and careers. Its ultimate goal is for every talent to find a place at AREVA. The Handicap Mission’s policy rests on four pillars: • Diversity: AREVA aims to offer better integration and acceptance of “difference” in business; • Negotiation: involving the social partners in discussions. In June 2010, AREVA signed a 2nd threeyear agreement on the employment of people with disabilities in France, in full unanimity with the social partners; • Network-based organization: some one hundred front-line personnel – “champions of the disabled”, a Purchasing network, and a Health network; • Operational integration: each Business Group must align its decisions with AREVA’s commitments. AREVA’s commitments cover five domains: recruitment; the use of sheltered and supported employment; work integration and vocational training; employment continuity, and awareness & communication. Some figures on disability at AREVA in France: • 3.77%: disabled employment rate for the group in 2010; • 15 million euros: the planned volume of business with the sheltered sector under the 2010-2012 agreement, of which 4.87 million was realized in 2010; • 600 disabled worker integration placements over three years under the previous agreement (20062009), resulting in 113 permanent work contracts; • 240 recruitments: the group’s target under the new agreement (2010-2012), divided up between 120 permanent posts (16 filled in 2010), 50 temporary posts (19 filled in 2010) and 70 work-study places (17 filled in 2010); • 2.42 million euros: the total budget for disability support actions in 2010; • 87 employees applied for official Disabled Worker status in 2010 – a sign of confidence in the structures put in place by the group. 19 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 In support of gender equality in the workplace One of AREVA’s ambitions is to seek out and promote greater diversity of profiles and backgrounds among its employees. The European equal opportunity agreement of November 2006, and its amendment of April 2010, set out the measures required to achieve this goal. The agreement asserts that professional equality is a right, and that gender diversity in the workplace is a factor of collective enrichment, social cohesion and economic effectiveness. The agreement defines five lines of development in this area: recruitment, career development, vocational training, equal pay and parental support. In line with the group-level agreement, the main group subsidiaries have signed collective agreements on gender equality in the workplace. Some figures on gender equality in the group: • 20%: proportion of women recruited to permanent positions, around the world; • 16%: proportion of women on management committees, around the world. Target: 20% by 2011 and 25% by 2012; • 20%: proportion of women among the group’s permanent staff, around the world; • Membership of the “Crèches et Entreprises” club, created in France by the Labour Ministry and the Office of the Secretary of State for the Family and Solidarity. Eleven child daycare centers – 9 of them in France – offering some 300 places; • Two European gender diversity awareness days were held at more than 80 of AREVA’s European sites in 2009 and 2010. The third such event is scheduled for June 9, 2011. In support of age diversity and the employment of seniors AREVA sees experienced employees (age 50+), who in 2010 made up one third of the permanent staff, as essential pillars of the company, able to share their experience with the younger members. The 2010-2012 action plan for seniors at AREVA France centers around five work streams: • Foreseeing and managing changes in career patterns; • Developing skills and qualifications and access to training; • Transmitting skills and know-how, and developing mentorship; • Managing the final working years and the transition from work to retirement; • Improving working conditions and the prevention of hardness. In support of social, ethnic and cultural diversity The AREVA group makes a point of recruiting employees from all backgrounds, regardless of their origins, and sees social, ethnic and cultural diversity as a source of enrichment for the group’s development. It has set itself four objectives in this area: • To recruit people from diverse social, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and support their career development; • To sensitize and motivate people about diversity issues through tangible in-house actions; • To clearly signal AREVA’s determination to be a “multicultural” enterprise to the outside world; • To combat discrimination and discriminatory behavior in any form. AREVA is continuing and stepping up the commitments it has made in recent years in the fields of diversity in education, access to employment, skills volunteering and sponsorship. 20 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Parenthood Focus: Parental support The French Parenthood Charter, signed in April 2008, is an integral component of the equal rights initiative. The Charter is a commitment to fostering “a work environment where employees who are parents can better reconcile their personal and professional lives”. AREVA is also a member of the French Corporate Parenthood Observatory (Observatoire de la Parentalité) launched in November 2008 to promote best practices and encourage the translation of the Parenthood Charter into concrete action in the business world. A number of good practices have already emerged: • Nearly 300 company daycare places have been made available in France and in Germany, where such initiatives are unusual. The centers are located in Paris and in the regions, at service sites as well as at industrial sites. “AREVA is French company that provides the most childcare facilities for its employees” (Jerôme Ballarin, President of the Parenthood Observatory); • Interviews pre and post child-related leave (maternity and paternity leave, parental and adoption) are standard procedure at the AREVA group’s European entities; • Under an agreement signed in June 2010 at AREVA NC, the company extends the use of Time Savings Accounts to cover parental leave and the employer’s contribution to health and pension schemes over the corresponding period. On the ground: age diversity Some 100 career mentors trained and mobilized to support the seniors policy. The mentors are themselves seniors – high-grade technicians or operational managers – with a solid grasp of the group’s business. A similar number of post-retirement consultants work at AREVA under the Experconnect system, sharing their technical expertise. A communication campaign, the first of its kind, was run in July 2010 to inform employees about the options provided by the group: Of course there are career prospects for the over-50s – you’re about to prove it. On the ground: social, ethnic and cultural diversity AREVA has signed up to a number of commitments in favor of social diversity: • The Business Charter for Equal Opportunity in Education, signed in December 2006; • A partnership agreement under the “Espoir Banlieues” plan for troubled urban areas, signed in February 2008 with the Ministry for the Economy, Finance and Employment. The agreement seeks to promote and showcase the company’s activities, to encourage people to find out more about the company, and to facilitate access to employment for young people. AREVA is also developing structures for employees in work-study programs (of whom there were 1,200 in 2010). Work-study is another way of diversifying candidate profiles. For some, it also offers a second chance to get a solid foothold in the world of work. The first “Café de la Diversité” was organized at the Tricastin site on July 1, 2010. It enabled young people supported by local employment initiatives to meet with recruiters in order to learn about the company. To raise managers’ awareness of social, ethnic and cultural diversity, AREVA organized a “questions and answers” session on religious practice in the workplace. The question of philosophical and religious practice has rarely been an issue at AREVA. The group does not seek to take a position on its employees’ personal 21 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 convictions; rather, it wants to give managers a set of responses to the situations that can arise in this area. The joint responses provided for the various scenarios have been approved by France’s High Authority to Combat Discrimination and Promote Equality (HALDE). 2.3. The Global Compact in action: implementing the principles on the environment Environment 7. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; 8. undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and 9. encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Commitment Environment policy Accident prevention, technological risk management and, more specifically, the protection of the environment form an integral part of the Group’s sustainable development commitments, and are therefore central to its industrial strategy. Their implementation centers on an environment policy (updated in 2007 for the period 2008-2011), on environmental, health and safety standards (such as the “EHS Master Way”2, which places our sites on the road to continuous improvement) and on environmental impact management tools designed by the environment specialists at the Safety, Health, Security & Environment department. The AREVA Group environment policy applies to all of the Group’s entities, in France and around the world. It is based on six commitments: • Managing; • Innovating; • Preventing accidental and chronic risks; • Preventing environmental liabilities; • Minimizing our environmental footprint; • Measuring and reporting. 2 EHS Master Way: a manual containing the AREVA Group’s basic standards and good practices in the various fields covered by the environment, health, safety and security policy. 22 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Actions Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges AREVA’s contribution to achieving Millennium Development Goal 7: “Ensure environmental sustainability” Supervision and implementation of the group’s environment policy This policy includes quantified objectives that are based on risk mapping, stakeholder expectations, best internal and external practices, environmental reporting, an external benchmark, and dialogue with the operating entities. AREVA is determined to put the internal “Environment Community” on a professional footing, and to reinforce training and awareness towards meeting our environmental responsibilities. Since 2007, the specialists at the Safety, Health, Security & Environment department have been running a training module called “Environment: Risks and Opportunities” in partnership with AREVA University. The course was delivered again in 2010, with a session in France. More than 250 people had been trained by the end of 2010. AREVA has compiled a company framework defining the group’s standards on health, safety and the environment. This framework is used for site self-assessments and for reviews by the Safety, Health, Security and Environment department. A program of environmental reviews is also deployed across the group’s sites. 108 such reviews were conducted in 2010 on targeted topics (e.g. environmental liabilities). Audits can also be organized jointly by the Audit department and the Safety, Health, Security and Environment department. Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Reducing our environmental footprint The results achieved at the end of 2010 are significant, demonstrating that actions have been implemented year after year. They also confirm the group’s determination to make environmental protection an integral part of its continuous improvement approach. The graph below shows the trends in the main indicators used to track the Group’s environmental footprint since 2004, based on constant volume of business (relative to revenue). 23 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 In terms of environmental risk management, by the end of 2010, 80% of our Significant Environmental Aspect (SEA) industrial sites were ISO 14001 certified (100% of the “nuclear” sites are certified). Managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions AREVA is one of the first large industrial groups to achieve the objective of carbon neutrality for its activeties. To attain this goal, AREVA has deployed an ambitious multi-year program to control and reduce its own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which includes the following targets: • A 50% reduction in total GHG emissions by the end of 2011 (relative to 2004); • The eradication of N2O at the Comurhex Malvési uranium conversion site; • An annual reduction of 4% in emissions linked to the use of SF6. The result of this program has been a 52% decrease in the Group’s direct emissions since 2004 (at constant revenue). In 2010, they amount to 712,480 tons of CO2 equivalent: a low volume in comparison with other industrial groups. Above and beyond these efforts, in order to be fully consistent with its own low-carbon energy product and service offering, AREVA has opted to voluntarily offset its residual direct emissions. To this end, the Group has teamed up with EcoAct since 2008, in a partnership aimed at providing financial support – by purchasing the “carbon credits” that they generate – for economic development projects that combine low CO2 emissions with a strong social component in the countries where the Group operates (biomass in Brazil, hydroelectric in India, hydro and wind power in China). Meanwhile, AREVA’s biomass activities have continued to boost the supply of carbon credits for the Group’s 2010 offset program. In terms of external reporting, AREVA’s direct greenhouse gas emissions are verified annually by the Statutory Auditors (who ascribe a “reasonable level of assurance” to this indicator). 24 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Finally, AREVA completes the Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire every year, and is listed in the annual rankings of the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) and the Carbon Performance Leadership Index (CPLI). AREVA is also actively engaged in initiatives within the business world as part of regional or international forums or group projects to exchange best practices and seek solutions, or common positions, on topics discussed in international negotiations on energy and climate change. To this end, AREVA is a member of the WBCSD, the WEC (World Energy Council) and the lCC, among others, and is an active contributor to the Global Compact “Caring for Climate” initiative. To find out more: See AREVA’s response to the Carbon Disclosure Project 2010 in the Appendix In the concrete fulfillment of its GHG commitments, the AREVA group has mobilized a significant part of its efforts at the site of Comurhex Malvési (Narbonne, France), the group’s main source of GHG emissions. The site has introduced an innovative process, in collabouration with Technip and CTP, to eliminate N2O emissions (1 ton of N2O = 298t of CO2 equivalent). Thanks to a major investment program, the site built a processing unit in 2010 (operational since January 2011), which will achieve a reduction of some 200,000t CO2 eq. in 2011. To find out more: Read the article published in the Entreprises pour l’Environnement report for May 2011 (see Appendix) Mesurer et piloter ses émissions de gaz à effet de serre Managing water AREVA is taking steps to improve its management of the water cycle, particularly at the production sites, so that less water is tapped from the natural environment. This requires precise knowledge of water consumption patterns and the actual costs associated with managing the water cycle, as well as a concerted effort by site personnel and subcontractors. Careful management of water resources is of particular relevance to the Group’s mining operations, especially those that are located in arid or desert zones. The mining sites participate in the group’s proactive policy of constantly reducing its environmental footprint and water consumption. AREVA’s annual consumption in Niger has been reduced by 35% in the space of fifteen years. It is now down to about eight million cubic meters a year, 65% of which is used to supply urban areas in the Arlit and Akokan regions. In 2010, an assessment of the drinking water supply networks in the towns of Cominak (in Akokan) and Somair (in Arlit) was carried out by Veolia. A series of measures designed to limit water consumption in the mining towns was launched in 2010 and is continuing into 2011. 25 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 To find out more: Read the report Commitment to Responsible Development – AREVA and Niger: a Sustainable Partnership on the website www.areva.com Meanwhile, a number of high-consumption industrial sites have been introducing innovative systems to reduce their water needs. At the Creusot Forge plant, for example, reliability work on the closed water circuit, combined with improvements to pipework and valves, the monitoring of water use, and the fitting of dry seals on new furnaces, brought about a significant drop in water consumption of 55% 2010/2009. Managing biodiversity AREVA attaches particular importance to monitoring and preserving biodiversity. The study of plant and animal life at the site begins in the design phase and continues throughout facility operations right up to the rehabilitation of industrial sites. Special care is devoted to native species and to how species introduced (or reintroduced) during reclamation adapt to the local biotope (plant and animal habitat). Since 2006, AREVA has been looking in depth at its impact on biodiversity. Having conducted research involving international experts and representatives from each of the Group’s business units, the Safety, Health, Security & Environment department designed and deployed, in 2009, a tool for assessing the interaction between the Group’s operations and biodiversity. 2010 – declared International Biodiversity Year – enabled the group to reaffirm its commitment to biodiversity (the Safety, Health, Security & Environment department produced a brochure to highlight the vital importance of biodiversity). AREVA also supported the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and Entreprises pour l’Environnement (EpE) at an international conference on “Business & Biodiversity”, held in Paris on October 19. The event enabled business leaders and top-level experts to debate the challenges and opportunities involved in integrating biodiversity into business strategy and practice. To find out more: Read the AREVA brochure A Continuous Commitment to Biodiversity on the website www.areva.com Recycling waste The recycling of conventional waste is an important plank in AREVA’s environment policy. The CEZUS site at Paimboeuf (Nantes, France) has reduced its output of hazardous waste related to normal activity by more than 20% since 2009. This was achieved through process optimization (more efficient use of evaporation units) and through awareness-raising on the shop floor (about reducing the quantity of waste in production). 26 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Harnessing innovation to serve sustainable development The environmental management of the AREVA group relies on innovation: building lower environmental impact into the design of products, services, processes and infrastructures, throughout their life cycle. The Georges Besse II plant, inaugurated on December 14, 2010, plays a central role in AREVA's strategy for continuous progress and sustainable development. Located on the Tricastin nuclear site in Southern France, Georges Besse II is one of the largest industrial investment projects in France in recent years. Thanks to its centrifugation technology, considered by the experts to be the safest and most efficient in the world, it has the distinct advantage of consuming 50 times less electricity than the current gaseous diffusion method. The process does not need to extract water from the nearby Rhône river for cooling. The buildings of the Georges Besse II plant are half the height of the existing plant and there is no noise pollution, facilitating the new plant’s integration into the landscape and the surrounding environment. Another illustration comes from the project for a hybrid electricity generation system for mobile prospecting camps in Australia. This is the first application of its kind for mining exploration. The electricity for AREVA’s mobile exploration camps in Australia is now produced 24 hours a day by a hybrid system using solar panels and a diesel-powered generator, combined with a battery-based storage system. The diesel generator now runs for just 4 hours a day instead of 24, with a corresponding improvement in living and working conditions (less noise and heat). The AREVA Sustainable Development Awards To focus employees' minds on sustainable development issues, the Sustainable Development and Continuous Improvement department has organized an internal competition every other year since 2005: the AREVA Sustainable Development Awards (or “ASDA”). The competition rewards the best sustainable development, continuous improvement and innovation projects put forward by our employees, setting an example for all AREVA group entities worldwide. The aim is to stimulate initiative and to win recognition, coverage, and support for ground-level projects, encouraging everyone to play an active part in AREVA’s sustainable development and innovation policy, whatever their function, business group or entity. Two award-winning projects are presented below: they constitute innovations in delivering better service to our customers, and have consequently been patented. 27 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 DMT: cleaning steam generators with “zero chemical waste” Over time, deposits build up on the surfaces and in the secondary cooling systems of steam generators, hampering heat exchange in pressurized water reactors, Eliminating these deposits is a major maintenance operation that has to be planned between 9 and 12 months in advance. It involves a cleaning stage which, until now, relied exclusively on chemical stripping. This process used toxic substances, leading to dangerous releases for health and the environment: 380,000 liters of liquid waste laced with hydrazine had to be disposed of. An AREVA NP team from Lynchburg (Virginia, USA) came up with an alternative solution, less aggressive but just as effective, called “Deposit Minimization Treatment (DMT)”. Nitrojet®: for faster, easier, reliable dismantling Nitrojet® is a process that facilitates the dismantling of nuclear installations. By projecting liquid nitrogen under high pressure, it reduces by a factor of ten the time required for scabbing – removing potentially contaminated material – from concrete walls, ceilings and floors, as well as cutting them up and processing them. And all without using chemicals. Nitrojet® will be operational on-site at the end of 2011. Its development doesn't stop there; the process is being adapted for use with other materials than concrete, such as stainless steel and other metals. 2.4. The Global Compact in action: implementing the principles on the fight against corruption Corruption 10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Commitment The AREVA Values Charter also addresses the topic of corruption. The precision of the provisions governing this complex area were further reinforced in the 2009 update of the Values Charter, as were those governing compliance with competition law. The compliance instructions issued by the Business Ethics Advisor to all entity managers in 2010 explicitly mention the AREVA group’s zero tolerance policy on corruption. Extracts from the Charter: “Relations between group employees and partners, and public services shall be handled with objectivity and integrity. Management shall be notified forthwith of any known cases of corruption, be it active or passive, and of any attempts to corrupt third parties, and shall immediately take the measures it sees fit to determine 28 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 the veracity of the situation, notably by performing the appropriate audits, and to put an end to this unlawful behavior should it be proven. AREVA prohibits corruption in any form whatsoever, public and private, active and passive. AREVA shall refrain from giving, proposing, promising or soliciting, either directly or indirectly, all payment or supply of services, gifts or leisure activities from or to a government official or private agent, in order to illegally obtain or conserve a market or a competitive advantage. Employees shall avoid all situations in which they might find themselves beholden to a third party, however temporarily, as well as all ambiguous situations and all situations in which misunderstanding is possible.” Actions Participation in EITI (the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative) In 2003, AREVA was one of the first multinationals to subscribe to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), which aims for greater transparency on sums paid by mining companies to the governments of the nations where their operations are based, and on the way in which these sums are accounted for in the national systems of the states that are signatories to the initiative. In terms of organization and functioning, EITI brings together, around the same table, the extraction companies (oil, mining and gas), NGOs, the government of the country that holds the natural resources, and the financial sector (mainly the World Bank, the IMF and some one hundred socially responsible investors). To obtain EITI certification, solid evidence is required of the effective, unobstructed participation of local civil society and NGOs in the process. EITI is supervised by an international board based in Oslo, of which AREVA is a member. Since the end of 2009, AREVA has also become a member of the EITI governance committee. 2010 and 2011 are watershed years for the EITI, as almost thirty countries have begun to implement the process over the last two years and are now waiting for EITI certification, representing “multi-party” recognition (by governments, civil society and business) of the transparency of payments received from the extractive industries operating on their soil. In December 2010, the EITI granted “near-compliant” status to several countries, including two – Kazakhstan and Niger – where AREVA operates mines. Today, at AREVA, the initiative takes the form of a central EITI coordinator appointed by the Board. At the mining operations level, an EITI correspondent has been appointed for the Mining Business Group, as well as EITI contacts at each of the mining subsidiaries in EITI member countries. The Mining BG’s Financial department, in liaison with the AREVA Financial department, also monitors the reporting of host country payment statements. The company’s internal ethics reports, meanwhile, list the payments made by the group’s mining subsidiaries to the governments of host countries that are members of EITI. 29 AREVA / Communication on Progress 2010 Appendices • AREVA Values Charter (AREVA website) http://www.areva.com/EN/group-1261/the-values-charter-rights-and-responsibilities-foreverybody-everyday.html • Sustainable Development Action Scorecard 2010 • AREVA 2010 Responsible Growth Report (AREVA website) http://www.areva.com/mediatheque/liblocal/docs/pdf/develop-durable/Rapport-decroissance-responsable-pdf/pdf-rcr-2011-va.pdf • “Embedding Human Rights in Business Practice” (page 112) http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/news_events/8.1/EHRBPII_Final.pdf • EDH’s contribution to John Ruggie’s Guiding Principles http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/1004116 • AREVA’s response to the Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire • “Mesurer et piloter ses émissions de gaz à effet de serre” (page 15) http://www.epe-asso.org/pdf_rap/EpE_rapports_and_documents107.pdf • “Commitment to Responsible Development – AREVA and Niger: a Sustainable Partnership” http://www.areva.com/EN/operations-609/mining-uranium-processing-mine-reclamationmining-operations.html • “A Continuous Commitment to Biodiversity” http://www.areva.com/EN/group-2181/a-continuous-commitment-to-biodiversity.html 30 In this edition, sustainable development goals are completely integrated into our activity report.

Governance 1.1 Where is the highest level of direct responsibility for climate change within your company? Individual/Sub-set of the Board or other committee appointed by the Board 1.1a Please identify the position of the individual or name of the committee with this responsibility The Executive Committee takes overall responsibility for climate change. The overall climate change strategy and implementation measures are jointly defined and monitored between several Senior Officers, all of them either being a member of the Executive Committee, or reporting directly to the CEO: the Sustainable Development Senior VP, the Safety, Security, Health and Environment Senior VP, the CFO, the Strategy Senior VP, the Purchase Department Senior VP, and the Senior Executive VP of the Renewable Energies Business Group. They, or their designated representatives, meet twice a year as the “Group’s carbon committee” convened by the Senior VP Sustainable Development and Continuous Improvement. At the operations level, the Sustainable Development and Continuous Improvement Department and the Safety, Security, Health and Environment Department, are in charge of coordinating, deploying, and reporting on the Group’s Climate Change Policy. 1.2 Do you provide incentives for the management of climate change issues, including the attainment of targets? Yes 1.2a Please complete the table Who is entitled to benefit from The type of incentives Incentivised performance indicator these incentives?

Strategy 2.1 Please select the option that best describes your risk management procedures with regard to climate change risks and opportunities Integrated into multi-disciplinary company wide risk management processes 2.1a Please provide further details (see guidance) All Business Units of the AREVA Group perform risk analysis on a regular basis, including regulatory, physical and financial risks and constantly improve those studies, reviewing the assumptions, so as to take into account any new risk. At the corporate level (Safety, Security, Health and Environment Department), the Strategic Analysis” (SWOT identification for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) conducted each year for environmental issues includes energy issues and Green House Gases (“GHG”) emissions. It scans transversal priority environmental issues for the year, identifies strengths and weaknesses, emerging threats and opportunities, and their evolution within the Business Units. Yearly internal goals and objectives for the environmental corporate specialists are derived directly from this SWOT analysis. This analysis has been conducted last year (2010) in order to : • define whether our environmental policy with targets for GHG emissions reductions and energy consumption is adapted to our risks and opportunities • elaborate the dashboard of the yearly objectives which represent the synthesis of multi-annual progress goals in accordance with the policy and strategic priorities • define thematic objectives which are prioritized by the Business Units to direct and deploy actions on these objectives. All the information is validated by AREVA’s Environment Committee which also monitors the progress of actions. In addition, a program was implemented to monetize the impact on the environment, for example the economical quantification of the energy and water saved through efficiency programs. 2.2 Is climate change integrated into your business strategy? Yes 2.2a Please describe the process and outcomes (see guidance) Risk management and reports on GHG emissions and energy consumption form part of the mainstream reviews and reporting system of the Group. All Business Units, in coordination with the Safety, Security, Health and Environment Department and the Sustainable Development and Continuous Improvement Department, submit periodical reports (at least twice a year) to the Executive Committee; such reports include indicators on GHG emissions. We believe that energy supply and demand, associated with climate change and carbon management issues continue to be a high priority on the international agenda and a strong driver for action for responsible actors. AREVA’s customers belong to this category and we believe that market opportunities will grow as new energy systems as well as new strategies and behaviours emerge as a response to climate change. Our approach gives priority to the continuous improvement of our existing products and services through contact with our customers, while investing in future technologies. Our objective is to strengthen our position as number 1 in nuclear energy. Our nuclear offer is completed by our offer in Renewable energies, consistent with the Group’s strategy of offering customers a wide range of solutions for power generation with less carbon. Our Renewable Energies Business Group has four product lines: wind energy, biomass, hydrogen and storage, and solar energy (CSP technology, “concentrated solar power”) with the acquisition of U.S.-based company Ausra in 2010. 2.2b Please explain why not 2.3 Do you engage with policy makers to encourage further action on mitigation and/or adaptation? Yes 2.3a Please explain (i) the engagement process and (ii) actions you are advocating We maintain a frequent interaction with policymakers dealing with possible responses to climate change including taxation, regulation and carbon trading. AREVA participates in many forums, at the national, regional, or international levels, where climate change issues and the potential responses are discussed. In particular, AREVA is a member – both at national and international levels of several Business and Industry or multi-stakeholder associations and organizations (for example the French MEDEF, the WBCSD, the UN Global Compact, the ICC, the WEC, the WNA) having an interest in engaging dialogue with policymakers and other actors of society on the issue of energy and climate change. In a variety of contexts and formats, we engage in dialogues, consultations, and discussions either separately or through the working groups which we are a member of. Amongst the messages that we advocate are the need to maintain all energy options open, the need to have a price for carbon and a sound and robust carbon market, and the need to factor all externalities, in terms of cost and impact, when comparing energy solutions.

A new I-01 86% 100% target is being defined for the year 2012 and beyond. 3.1e Please explain (i) why not; and (ii) forecast how your emissions will change over the next five years 3.2 Does the use of your goods and/or services directly enable GHG emissions to be avoided by a third party? Yes 3.2a Please provide details (see guidance) AREVA offers low carbon products and technologies to its customers, thus helping them avoid or reduce their own emissions. To further consolidate its commitment to low carbon power generation, AREVA is working on its own estimates for the environmental footprint (including GHG emissions) of its main technology solutions (the nuclear fuel cycle, offshore wind, biomass, concentrated solar power) through a life cycle analysis (LCA) detailing each environmental footprint. A/ Nuclear power plants and associated nuclear fuel services: the AREVA Group is the world’s leading supplier of the nuclear industry and the only company to cover all industrial activities in this field (except the power generation itself). Comparing energy production sources shows that the GHG emissions of nuclear power plants are the lowest varying between 6 and 29 g CO2/kWh depending on the enrichment method. As a global illustration, in Europe, emissions avoided through nuclear generated electricity are approximately equivalent to the total emissions of the European automobile fleet. B/ Bio-energy is considered carbon neutral by US Federal and state environmental agencies, subject to sustainable management of wood resources. The renewable energy power plants engineered and supplied by the Renewable Energy Business Unit provide significant GHG emissions savings to their owners, when compared to carbon intensive energy sources. As indicative information only and using the countries grid carbon factor as baseline, we estimate that the plants installed worldwide by our Renewable Energy Business Group save more than 3 millions tCO2e per year. In addition, projects located in developing countries can generate CERs or VERs for their owners either under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) process or for voluntary offsetting schemes: _ On average, 50000 CER/year for a 10 MWe capacity biomass power plants in India _ On average, 30000 CER/year for a 10 MWe capacity biomass power plants in Thailand _ On average, 30000 CER/year for a 50 MWe capacity biomass power plants in Brazil Projects located in developed countries can also generate carbon credits under Joint Implementation (JI). For instance, offshore wind turbines installed in developed countries may generate ERUs under the JI, provided that projects are approved by the host government. However projects are assessed on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, the methodologies used to calculate the GHG emission savings from renewable energy projects are approved CDM methodologies, available on the UNFCCC website (http://cdm.unfccc.int/index.html) C/ Wind Power and solar power plants proposed by AREVA are two additional low CO2 energy solutions, helping utilities and other power generators to reduce their emissions. As an example, our solar CSP “booster” projects can augment generation at existing coal-fired plants to increase output while reducing emissions. Australian utility CS Energy recently selected AREVA’s technology to build a 44-MW power augmentation project at its Kogan Creek coal-fired power station. Upon completion in 2013, our solar steam generators will help avoid 35,600 tons of GHG emissions annually for this project. 3.3 Did you have emissions reduction initiatives that were active within the reporting year (this can include those in the planning and/or implementation phases) Yes 3.3a Please provide details in the table below Annual monetary Investment Payback Activity type Description of activity savings (unit required (unit period currency) currency) Process emissions On COMURHEX Malvesi site, it has been decided to completely eradicate 2000000 3500000 1-3 years reductions emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O).

Then, the nature of the risk to be assessed can be multiple: physical, regulatory or administrative (including trading schemes, emissions quotas, taxation, and other fiscal or regulatory instruments). AREVA’s own operations could in the future be affected by more regulatory constraints attached to carbon management, although not in a significant manner, based on current assumptions, given the nature and the size of our industrial facilities and their emissions. Activities in the nuclear fuel cycle emit very few GHGs and the full life cycle emissions associated to nuclear power generation are very low. Nevertheless, we believe that both existing and potential regulatory requirements deserve a close and constant monitoring. AREVA complies with the rules and regulations where and when they exist, and we follow very actively the development of the international negotiations on climate change, and their potential impacts, internationally as well as nationally (such as, for example, the discussions linked to the “Grenelle de l’Environnement” in France). Some of AREVA’s European industrial facilities are currently and potentially in the future subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). In the 1st trading period AREVA was subject to the ETS for 2 sites (combustion units in France) the emissions of which never exceeded the allocated quotas. In the 2nd trading period that started in January 2008, one only of AREVA’s industrial sites is subject to the EU ETS: the La Hague plant in France. We anticipate that there will be new measures associated with the 3rd trading period (from 2013). The new regulatory measures that could impact AREVA’s own facilities are mainly the following: the modifications of the scope of the EU directive, which could modify the present perimeter of our facilities impacted by the EU ETS, the integration of other GHGs in the European trading scheme (SF6, N2O): this has been anticipated as we currently implement an emissions reduction plan for these gases too. Regarding our customers the level of emissions reductions that would be imposed on electricity utilities either under the next period of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) or under any other scheme, in or outside Europe, would impact their carbon management and potentially the evolution of their energy mix. AREVA’s commercial offer can greatly contribute to initiatives and investments aimed at “decarbonising” the energy mix. A new international agreement on climate change (i.e. as a result of the current UNFCCC-led negotiation) could also impact AREVA worldwide as we have manufacturing facilities in several countries. International carbon taxes (or any regulation that internalizes the cost of greenhouse gases emissions in the form of a tax) could also impact AREVA’s business. In countries where AREVA has mining activities, for which large quantities of fossil fuel are required, we pay special attention to the existence or emergence of carbon-related legislations. One key challenge for the next years is that our mining activities will strongly increase with important consequences on our energy consumption and GHG emissions. Low carbon energy supply solutions are therefore systematically evaluated. Regulatory air pollution limits could also impact the way we use energy or control our emissions. For example, the BREF (Best References) concerning energy efficiency linked to the IPPC (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) directive is dealing with some technologies that are considered as best available technologies for energy efficiency. Regulations or standards that require specific efficiency in the production or commercialization of a given product could also impact AREVA. Regulatory risks are included in the risk analysis performed by the different units of the AREVA Group. More specifically, the regulatory constraints associated with climate change are also analyzed by a group of in-house experts (Environment, Strategy, Finance departments, Sustainable Development and Continuous Improvement department, Renewable Energy Business Group). We also seek to collaborate in a constructive manner and at an early stage with decision-makers on these issues, and have numerous opportunities and channels to do so. New regulatory measures can lead to new financial constraints. In the case of AREVA, those measures that could impact our business are the following: o For our own facilities in Europe: in case of an international agreement (UNFCCC) , the reduction objective of the EU package on climate and energy could become 30% and could impact AREVA for its factories affected by the EU ETS; Similarly, the modifications of the scope of the EU directive (inclusion of major chemical installations and additional gases such as N2O for the emissions trading period after 2012, exclusion of the combustion plants of less than 35 MW) could also modify the present perimeter of our factories impacted by the EU ETS. The integration of other GHGs in the European trading scheme (SF6, N2O) has been anticipated as we currently implement an emissions reduction plan for these gases too. It is worth noting the eradication of N2O emissions in one of our major facilities is already being implemented. o For our customers (electricity utilities) and their power plants in Europe: emissions to be cut to 21% below 2005 levels by 2020 by granting fewer emission allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). This could lead to increasing the share of nuclear power and /or renewable energies in their respective European energy mix and be an opportunity for AREVA; o For our customers in countries such as US, India or China: an international agreement could also lead to an evolution in their respective energy mix, and thus also represent an opportunity for AREVA. We do not anticipate paying any penalties for regulatory non-compliance. Note: as a general principle, we consider that potential financial implications related to climate change are an element of a commercial nature, and therefore we do not wish to include more details or figures in our response to this specific question. 5.1c Please describe your risks that are driven by change in physical climate parameters Direct/ Magnitude ID Risk driver Description Potential impact Timeframe Indirect Likelihood of impact Change in mean (average) Increased Current Direct More likely than not Medium temperature operational cost Change in mean (average) Increased Indirect (Supply Current More likely than not Medium temperature operational cost chain) Increased Change in temperature extremes Current Direct More likely than not Medium operational cost Increased Indirect (Supply Change in temperature extremes Current More likely than not Medium operational cost chain) Change in mean (average) Increased Current Direct More likely than not Medium precipitation operational cost Change in mean (average) Increased Indirect (Supply Current More likely than not Medium precipitation operational cost chain) Increased Change in precipitation pattern Current Direct More likely than not Medium operational cost Increased Indirect (Supply Change in precipitation pattern Current More likely than not Medium operational cost chain) Change in precipitation extremes Increased Current Direct More likely than not Medium and droughts operational cost Change in precipitation extremes Increased Indirect (Supply Current More likely than not Medium and droughts operational cost chain) 5.1d Please describe (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk; and (iii) the costs associated with these actions In light of all the risks listed in Q5.1c, the main issues to be addressed by the energy sector as a whole relates to water management, extreme weather events, health of workers and populations, and the preservation of biodiversity. The basic principles applied to assess our exposure to physical risks resulting from climate change are directly derived from the safety and security analysis that our industry systematically performs and improves. The assumptions are permanently reviewed to take into account any new physical risk or event. In accordance with applicable standards and regulations, the nuclear and high risk facilities (SEVESO plants) of the Group are designed to withstand a very large range of adverse circumstances, including extreme weather events. The risk is taken into consideration in the design of the facilities based on local conditions with significant margins. Those safety analyses are periodically reviewed to take into consideration changes in regulation and hypothesis used in the design and in particular on extreme weather events. For other facilities, regarding the risk of flood and because of the location and kinetic phenomena, large sites (according to their vulnerability) already have a warning system and procedures in place. For other weather events like strong winds and extreme precipitations, advanced analysis are at a refinement stage and will be fed into the design and or operating parameters of our installations. For the better assessment and integration of extreme weather conditions, we have called upon third party expertise to validate the potential issues and our responses and priorities in the light of the climate change expected by the end of the century. We also use data from insurers and reinsurers worldwide, to benefit from their watch on climate risks (zoning, dedicated Geospatial Systems). The different units of the AREVA Group perform risk analysis and constantly improve those studies. To this end, the Group has drawn up a business risk model (BRM) to be used by its Business Units. Working from a defined number of typical risks or families of risk (BRM risk), the model indexes all of the foreseeable or unexpected situations or events that could have an impact on employee safety, on the environment, on the financial performance of the Business Unit, the subsidiary or the Group, and on its corporate reputation. The BRM is enhanced based on best practices and lessons learned. Using the BRM as a starting point, each Business Unit establishes an operational risk map that graphically illustrates the seriousness of its risks and its degree of management at any given period. The risk map defines criteria for implementing appropriate action plans. The financial implications are linked to the various above-mentioned studies. Moreover, the eco-efficiency actions (such as cooling loops), at certain sites of our Zirconium activity and at other sites like COMURHEX Malvesi or our mines (cooling towers) require financial investments. Water management can also lead to modifying the design of our installations, and hence necessitate investments. Temperature and water supply: AREVA’s own activities can be affected, like many other industrial activities, by a severe drought and the resulting shortage in water supply. Temperature increases also represent an important factor to be monitored for the liquid emissions of our plants. Physical climate change parameters are also important for operating a nuclear power plant and are therefore carefully reviewed and mitigated at the reactor conception and design stage. Permanent consultation takes place on these parameters with our power utilities customers. As far as our water forecast and management is concerned in France, there exists an “observatory” covering France and its data is available from the French Environment Ministry. It provides AREVA with its needed vigilance information via the internet. Regarding the operational management of water resources, ecoefficiency actions (cooling loops) and reduction of releases as low as reasonably achievable are the preferred solutions and have been the subject of a particular attention in recent years. For example, certain sites of our Zirconium activity have already installed cooling loops; more similar investments are planned. Water management is also a permanent and top priority for our development projects in the front-end activities of the fuel cycle (mining operations in particular). As an illustration of the attention paid to water management, AREVA has invested more than US$200 million in a desalination plant in Namibia (association with a Namibian partner (United Africa Group) who now owns half of the desalination plant). As a result no water will be pumped from the Namibian aquifer to operate the AREVA Trekkopje mine. Natural freshwater is scarce in Namibia and the desalination plant will also increase access to water for neighboring populations and other mines in the region (the desalination plant will produce more water than actually needed by the Trekkopje mine). Workers and population: of a different nature, and potentially very important to us, is the vulnerability of local communities to the impacts of climate change. A significant part of our workforce, as well as sub-contractors, originate from these communities. We therefore need to understand and anticipate the possible impacts (e.g. relative to health, mobility, food supply, education) and remedies to ensure a stable continuation of our activities. Such risk varies of course from one geographical region to the other. We believe in particular that some geographical areas of Africa could potentially be more at risk if severe climate change-related events occur. Recent severe climate events in the United States have also demonstrated the vulnerability of highly developed countries where the Group also has operations. In case of impacts on our workforce (health, living and working conditions, transportation, etc…), especially at mining sites where employees come from local communities, measures to mitigate those impacts could be significant. Biodiversity: climate change is one of the biodiversity erosion mechanisms: it has an impact on the distribution, migration or survival of species (fauna and flora), particularly the difficulties of adaptation to high temperature and desynchronization of the food chain caused by the early seasons. Biodiversity protection is one of the challenges for the AREVA Group, in particular at our mining sites (Canada, Niger, Namibia, Kazakhstan). We have to be able to differentiate the impacts of our activities (monitoring of the evolution of the ecosystems impacted) and the impact of climate change on biodiversity in order to operate in the most responsible manner and avoid degrading biodiversity. If the impact is due to our activity, we can choose to offset the negative impact through the protection of rare or critical biotopes of similar size elsewhere. All those calculation and monitoring measures have a cost, and so have the measures to protect biodiversity. Note: as a general principle, we consider that potential financial implications related to climate change are an element of a commercial nature, and therefore we do not wish to include more details or figures in our response to this specific question. 5.1e Please describe your risks that are driven by changes in other climate-related developments Direct/ Potential Magnitude of ID Risk driver Description Timeframe Indirect Likelihood impact impact 5.1f Please describe (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk; (iii) the costs associated with these actions 5.1g Please explain why you do not consider your company to be exposed to risks driven by changes in regulation that have the potential to generate a substantive change in your business operations, revenue or expenditure 5.1h Please explain why you do not consider your company to be exposed to risks driven by physical climate parameters that have the potential to generate a substantive change in your business operations, revenue or expenditure 5.1i Please explain why you do not consider your company to be exposed to risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments that have the potential to generate a substantive change in your business operations, revenue or expenditure We believe that most of the risks that can affect our Group are dealt with in the text provided under Q5.1a, Q5.1b, Q5.1c and Q5.1d.

For instance, the regulatory requirements associated with carbon emissions (EU ETS, carbon market, carbon tax…) lead to establishing a visible and possibly long term cost for CO2 emissions. This will drive the evolution of the energy portfolio of utilities and therefore enhances the competitiveness of low carbon energy solutions that the AREVA Group currently offers to its customers: nuclear power plants and fuel cycle products and services, biomass plants, wind turbines, solar energy solutions Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). We believe that market opportunities will grow as new energy systems as well as new strategies and behaviours emerge as a response to climate change. Moreover, the development of our commercial positions will be achieved by strengthening our lead in terms of innovation. Our approach gives priority to the continuous improvement of existing products and services through a dedicated management system, and through interaction with our customers, while investing in future technologies. AREVA offers its customers a large number of innovative products and technologies as solutions to meet those regulatory requirements as well as for climate protection and for energy and resource efficiency. Examples of these propositions to meet regulatory requirements include: A/ our expertise and skills throughout the uranium cycle to make nuclear energy ever safer and competitive: the Group is the world leader in providing products and services for nuclear power generation and the only company to cover all industrial activities in this field (except owning and operating a power plant). B/ our Renewable Energies portfolio (wind power, bio-energies, solar energy (CSP) and hydrogen energy and storage). In this sector, the Group aims at being one of the top three suppliers worldwide in 2012. In particular, wind power and solar power plants proposed by AREVA are two low CO2 energy solutions, helping utilities and other power generators to reduce their emissions. As an example, our solar CSP “booster” projects can augment generation at existing coal-fired plants to increase output while reducing emissions. Australian utility CS Energy recently selected AREVA’s technology to build a 44-MW power augmentation project at its Kogan Creek coal-fired power station. Upon completion in 2013, our solar steam generators will help avoid 35,600 tons of GHG emissions annually. Bio-energy also has great potential. US Federal and state environmental agencies consider biopower carbon neutral, a significant advantage over traditional power facilities. Moreover, projects implemented through our Renewable Energies Business Group in countries where such projects qualify, can generate marketable carbon credits such as CERs and VERs. Last but not least, our strategic and competitive positioning on this emerging energy market has a significant bearing on the manner in which we can attract and retain talents and a skilled workforce. Job creation and job sustainability have become a top priority, as most countries are progressively moving out of the 2009 financial crisis. To anticipate market opportunities, many of which are associated with energy demand and climate change considerations, AREVA is pursuing a significant investment program in both the nuclear fuel cycle and the renewable energies sector. In 2010, gross capital expenditure (Capex) in the Nuclear and Renewable operations rose to 2.176 billion Euros, compared with 1.808 billion Euros in 2009. The following examples illustrate some of those investments. 1) Uranium fuel cycle: The Group’s Georges Besse gaseous diffusion enrichment plant now in operation will be replaced by a new plant named Georges Besse II. The new plant uses commercially proven centrifuge enrichment technology, which will make enrichment prices less dependent on the price of electricity, the principal component of current production costs. This translates into an investment of nearly 3 billion Euros to produce at least 7.5 million separative work units (SWU) per year starting in 2016. Spin-up of the first centrifuge cascade took place in 2009 and the first container of uranium feed material was delivered to the Georges Besse II plant in 2010. As far as our mining operations are concerned, AREVA has invested in the first seawater desalination plant in Namibia, 30 kilometers north of Swakopmund on the Atlantic coast. The inauguration marks the beginning of water production at the plant and is a major breakthrough in the development of AREVA’s mining project in Namibia. 2) Wind energy AREVA acquired the remaining 49% of Multibrid, a German wind turbine manufacturer and established AREVA Wind, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. This acquisition will enable it to ramp-up production capacity in response to the growth of this burgeoning industry. This new platform will also include the rotor blade manufacturing division, PN Rotor. 3) Concentrated solar power AREVA acquired 100% of Ausra, which was renamed AREVA Solar. Based in Mountain View, California, Ausra offers process steam and power generation solutions produced with concentrated solar energy. With this acquisition, AREVA expands its portfolio of renewable energy solutions to become a major player in the concentrated solar energy market. As another illustration of the sustainability of our activities in the energy sector, a sector heavily impacted by its carbon footprint and the ways to manage it, the Group’s backlog was 44,2 billion Euros at 31st December 2010, a 2% increase from 2009. Note: as a general principle, we consider that potential financial implications related to climate change are an element of a commercial nature, and therefore we do not wish to include more details or figures in our response to this specific question. 6.1c Please describe the opportunities that are driven by changes in physical climate parameters Magnitude ID Opportunity driver Description Potential impact Timeframe Direct/ Indirect Likelihood of impact Change in mean (average) Reduced operational Current Direct More likely than Medium Magnitude ID Opportunity driver Description Potential impact Timeframe Direct/ Indirect Likelihood of impact temperature costs not Reduced operational More likely than Change in temperature extremes Current Direct Medium costs not Change in mean (average) Reduced operational More likely than Current Direct Medium precipitation costs not Reduced operational More likely than Change in precipitation pattern Current Direct Medium costs not Change in precipitation extremes Reduced operational More likely than Current Direct Medium and droughts costs not 6.1d Please describe (i) the potential financial implications of the opportunity; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this opportunity; (iii) the costs associated with these actions AREVA takes actions to mitigate the physical risks described in Q5.1c and Q5.1d, in the areas of water management, extreme weather events, health impacts and biodiversity preservation. Some of these actions can have significant cost. Our continuous improvement approach seeks to identify the best practices within the Group in order to deploy them to all sites or facilities facing similar constraints or environments. We believe that market opportunities, such as the ones listed in Q6.1c, will grow as new energy systems as well as new strategies and behaviours emerge as a response to climate change. Moreover, the development of our commercial positions will be achieved by strengthening our lead in terms of innovation. Our approach gives priority to the continuous improvement of existing products and services through a dedicated management system, and through interaction with our customers, while investing in future technologies. For example, the management of our water consumption has improved significantly over the years, and is under a constant improvement process. This achievement has provided operational security and at the same time has generated significant monetary savings for the Group. We also benefit from our constant and significant efforts in R&D, a fair part of which is dedicated to eco-design, to energy efficiency, and to risk management and mitigation. Our total R&D expenditure was 928 million Euros in 2010 (816 million Euros in 2009) representing 10,2% of our total revenue. In addition, our R&D efforts lead to registering patents (91 patents registered in 2010) which can bring value to our industry as a whole and potentially to other industrial sectors.

Our La Hague facility (France) is the only one in the Group to be covered by the EU ETS. The first component of our strategy is to pursue our aggressive reduction plan for our own emissions, progressively including all reporting scopes. The goal is a 50% reduction from 2004 levels by the end of 2011. To achieve this, the group is improving its industrial processes to use energy wisely, including switching to less carbon intensive sources, and promoting more eco-efficient attitudes internally. In the coming years, we anticipate that emissions at the group’s facility (La Hague) covered by the EU ETS will still be below its allowance and that the plant will seek to sell its excess quotas as CER or EUA on the carbon market. We also anticipate the incorporation of our industrial site Creusot Forge in the EU ETS phase 3 from 2013. In addition we are now involved in a carbon neutrality program and we will continue to offset our direct emissions on the voluntary market in addition to our current reduction program. This carbon neutrality program is achieved through a partnership with Eco-Act, a reputable firm developing projects that protect the environment and yield economic and social benefit to communities, and through emissions reduction projects in developing countries brought by our Renewable Energy Business Group. In 2010 100% of our offset program was achieved with VERs originating from projects in India (including 2003 tonnes of CO2e carried forward from the previous year). 14.2 Has your company originated any project-based carbon credits or purchased any within the reporting period?
