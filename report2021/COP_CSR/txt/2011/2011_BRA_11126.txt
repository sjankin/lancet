Participation and commitment Fundação Dom Cabral is a signatory of the Global Compact, a UN initiative to engage the business world in the building of a more stable, egalitarian and inclusive market and so generate a prosperous society while ensuring sustainable development. One of the commitments it has accepted is that of writing an annual Report to communicate to stakeholders the progress it has made in implementing and disseminating the ten Global Compact principles in its activities. As FDC is a business school strongly involved in developing future leaders, there are two other UN proposals that speak directly to it: the definition of Globally Responsible Leadership (GRLI) and the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME). FDC played an active part in writing down the guidelines for both proposals, together with other renowned business schools in the world. By itself, such participation is already an expression of its commitment to implementing the Global Compact; however, it would not be enough if it did not translate itself into action. FDC has worked towards changing its internal processes and giving its collaborators the chance to develop themselves. It has also worked towards complementing its offer of programs and courses, as it constantly updates its practices and concepts, aligning them with the demands put to business leaders by society and by the world of business.

Recognition The Financial Times Executive Education Ranking In the first semester, FDC achieved important conquests as regards rankings and accreditations. It was ranked the 6th best businesses schools in the world in the 2010 Financial Times Executive Education ranking. As the best placed school from Latin America on the list, FDC rose seven positions in relation to last year’s ranking and remains in a select group of renowned businesses schools such as Iese Business School (Spain), IMD (Switzerland), HEC Paris (France) and the Harvard Business School (USA). Executive Education Ranking Fundação Dom Cabral has taken top honors by placing 1st in the 2010 América Economia executive education ranking among the dozens of schools that are present in Latin America. Four criteria were assessed to prepare the ranking: clients, the characteristics of the programs offered, faculty, and the degree of internationalization of the schools. Você S/A Ranking FDC stood out in the Você S/A magazine ranking as the Sustainability Report business school that was best assessed in Brazil by HR executives. In this specific ranking, FDC places 5th on the list of MBA courses, 3rd in specialization in Marketing and Finance, and 2nd in specialization in People Management. ( 15 ) Certifications AMBA In May, Fundação Dom Cabral received a five-year extension to its accreditation to the Association of MBAs (AMBA). This entity is headquartered in the UK and it accredits the best MBA programs in the world, thus guaranteeing quality standards and promoting an exchange of knowledge, ideas and best practices among its member international business schools. Before accrediting a school, AMBA auditors assess its qualitative and quantitative indicators its faculty and student body, the structure and content of its programs, its teaching methods, its assessment systems, and the infrastructure it offers. FDC has been accredited since 2005 and it will keep its accreditation up to 2015, when it will be audited once again. EQUIS I����������������������������������������������������� n June, Fundação Dom Cabral received a three-year extension to the accreditation it had received in 2007 from the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS), an accreditation system managed by the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD), thus restating its qualification and international recognition in executive education. By joining other EQUIS members, FDC stands out as a high-quality institution in all the dimensions of Sustainability Report its activities, besides having a high level of internationalization. EQUIS promotes a total assessment of a school: it takes into account all its programs, research activities, teaching methodologies, facilities and its relations with its collaborators and the community. It also takes into account the balance between the academic quality of its ( ) 16 teachings and its contact with business reality. Awards and Honors Fundação Dom Cabral received the 2010 Corporate Award at a ceremony held at the 7th Corporate Congress. The award aims to recognize companies in the market that stand out in criteria such as service quality and services. The event aims to share the main trends, solutions, concepts and best business management practices. Among others, it was made up by the Rio de Janeiro State government, the Rio de Janeiro City Hall, the FIRJAN System, CFA Federal Administration Council, COFECON Federal Economics Council, CFC Federal Accounting Council, AMCHAM and Inmetro.

Understanding the Report Shared Challenge Transparency (I) Continuous interaction with stakeholders on the ethical, environmental and socio-economic aspects involved in carrying out the Institution’s activities, disseminating its philosophy and the initiatives it is a signatory of , as well as accounting for the commitments it has taken on and the activities it has carried out. Sustainability Report This Report aims to inform our audiences and, based on the responsible commitments taken on, the actions, the activities and the results achieved in 2010. The results of this process to insert sustainability can be seen in this document, whose chapters present macro themes related to the FDC shared challenges. From this issue onwards, Fundação Dom Cabral will publish its Sustainability Report every year. We believe that the Report will follow the broad and deep evolution of sustainability at FDC. Thus, we have opted for now to prepare a report based on the FDC shared challenges, the Principles of the Global Compact, PRME and GRLI. FDC recognizes the relevance of the GRI – Global Reporting Initiative as an international standard to report information on sustainability in the actions carried out by companies. Despite the fact that FDC is not yet ready to follow this standard in full, this is one of our commitments for the coming years. Thus, at the end of this report we present a remissive index of the indicators that have already been collected by FDC in 2010. These will be our references to evolve in coming years. We hope that this document can be, at the same time, a source of information, inspiration and a management tool that will allow us to better measure FDC performance from the perspective of sustainability.

Sustainability: A Strategic Vision The FDC mission – to contribute to the sustainable development of society by educating and building the skills of executives, entrepreneurs and public administrators – is aligned with commitments to sustainability and social inclusion, and its consequences are specified in the Internal Covenant, the document that sets behavior guidelines for all those who work with the Institution. The concepts of sustainability and social responsibility have been taken into account in FDC strategic planning and results. Furthermore, these concepts guide the Institution’s institutional and pedagogic actions in its partnerships and programs. To coordinate such actions, the Sustainability Committee was created in 2008, and its attributions are as follow: To subsidize the continuous philosophic and conceptual updating of the theme. To contribute to include sustainability and social inclusion in FDC strategy and operations. To contribute to define, structure and operationalize the “Business Emphasizing Social Inclusion” Project. To recommend measures and support projects that can strengthen volunteer actions taken by collaborators, and those of sustainability and social inclusion in the processes and businesses carried out by the Institution. To seek to integrate and care for the synergy among the different projects and actions within the various processes and among people, all related to sustainability and social inclusion, in the short, mid and long terms. To recommend the institutionalization and promotion of cooperative relations with other entities from the community and from society. In 2010, the Sustainability Committee went through changes as its makeup was changed to enhance its influence over all FDC actions. A new operational model was prepared, and it will be implemented during 2011, when it will create work groups guided by specific themes that will respond to FDC commitments. Sustainability Report Each work group will be free to develop programs and projects linked to its field of action. However, it will always act in synergy with the other groups and it will report its projects to the sustainability committee. There is a leader for each work group, and the leader will call and conduct meetings whenever it should be necessary. As of 2011, the sustainability community will meet four times a year to plan, follow-up on and wrap up actions aimed at sustainability.

It will support FDC activities as well as the projects presented by the workgroups. The Letter of Shared Challenges for Sustainability seeks to translate the strategic challenge of being relevant to society through structuring projects that will allow each sector and each collaborator to be a change agent. The shared challenges were grouped into six themes: individual responsibility, knowledge, social innovation, transparency, responsible management, companies and society. FDC shared challenges.

Educational Solutions Shared Challenge Companies and Society (I) Generate and implement educational solutions to achieve sustainable results for companies and for society. (II) Incorporate in its programs the values of social responsibility and build the skills of effective managers who will generate sustainable value for business and for society. FDC educational solutions are developed based on committed listening to the needs of organizations. Such listening seeks to integrate consistent and up-to-date knowledge with the business practices it deals with and systematizes, and with which it interacts and contributes. Besides the knowledge developed in its research activities and offered by its faculty, FDC mobilizes and articulates partnerships with social and academic organizations in its quest for new approaches to face contemporary business management challenges. Its educational solutions are grouped into four families: Open Programs: aimed at building the skills of executives Postgraduate: MBA, Master’s and Specialization Customized Programs: aimed at business development Partnerships: building a basis, systematizing and exchanging experiences Sustainability Report ( 32 ) Sustainability Report ( 33 ) Innovation ) 8. Educating for Sustainability Business Partnerships PARTNERSHIP WITH SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS POS This partnership makes it possible for FDC to offer experience in management and in educating executives to enhance the development of social organizations, thus making them self-sustainable and attractive to investments. POS is based on the joint building of knowledge through the exchange of experiences among executives from civil society who share common characteristics and objectives. It is an effort that focuses on professionalizing the management of social organizations and on promoting improved results in the mid and long terms. The objective of this partnership is to contribute to enhance the management of civil society entities, and so FDC practices what it does best: it contributes to the development of society. In 2010, POS set up 1 group with the participation of 11 companies. Seventeen events were held, and they were attended by 110 executives. POS holds its first leaders’ meeting The first Meeting of the Leaders of the Partnership with Social Organizations (POS) was held in April. The theme of the meeting was the funding of social organizations. The meeting offered the leaders of the partnering entities the opportunity to exchange experiences and to come into contact with up-to-date content and cases. It also dealt with how to deal with funding, sources of financing for the third sector, fiscal incentives, and tax and accounting perspectives. Sustainability Report Asmare members and Professor Vanderlei Soela ( 34 ) A meeting between the Association of Paper and Recyclable Material ASMARE and FDC. On August 3, there was a meeting between the Association of Paper and Recyclable Material and FDC. ASMARE, which is a member of the Fundação Dom Cabral POS – Partnership with Social Organizations –, was present with 10 of its representatives, who prepared the association’s Strategic Planning. The group developed the first part of the PE (Business Project) by defining its ideology (cause, mission, values and vision). Furthermore, they made an important reflection about the moment the institution is going through as the main entity in the State that brings these workers together, and its perspectives for the future. The next step is to begin to assess the institution’s positive and negative points and carry out a brief scenario analysis to help them set out their strategic objectives. PARTNERSHIP FOR SUSTAINED AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH – PCSS PCSS was launched this year, and it brings together the expertise of mid and large size companies that seek to find and share new growth models of continuous and sustainable growth. These companies seek their original entrepreneurial spirit, and they believe that maintaining growth also depends on business management that can promote growth and bring profits, recognizing and facilitating their carrying out their economic and non-economic aspirations – the sustainable development of all social actors. It is a partnership for lasting and sustainable company growth, and it places social and business responsibility into the organization’s agendas. A committee of sponsors made up by FDC professors, member schools and executives from the areas of finance, market, people, and sustainability works together with the member company’s CEO by offering advice, validating models, offering conceptual knowledge and references, and sharing knowledge. The partnership has brought together 312 participants from 12 companies into a group. Fifty-eight events have been carried out. Sustainability Report Partnership for sustained and sustainable growth – PCSS ( 35 ) Social Network – Sustained and Sustainable Growth Set up by our collaborator, FDC professor Luis Augusto Lobão Mendes, the Sustained and Sustainable Growth Social Network is an initiative to discuss the capacity to meld performance, growth and socioenvironmental responsibility. www.crescimentosustentado.ning.com Annual PAEX Network Meeting PAEX – Partners for Excellence is a partnership that brings together mid size companies focused on a quest for results. The partnership currently includes 358 companies organized into 48 regional groups in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Portugal. The 13th PAEX Network Meeting brought together 450 participants for a 3-day event. In 2010, “Sustained and Sustainable Growth” was the core theme of the meeting. The keynote speech and the presentation of the business cases were led by Professor Cláudio Boechat from the Petrobras Sustainability Center. PAEX – Jardim Canadá Paex Jardim Canadá aims to support local entrepreneurs by meeting the needs of the small and mid size companies set up in the district and in the FDC surroundings. The group is supported by the Jardim Sustainability Report Canadá Industry and Commerce Association – AICJC, and there are eight member companies. The amount of the contribution made by the companies is subsidized by FDC, and the activities have been fitted to this audience’s reality. RDI – Integrated Development Network ( 36 ) Partnership Management and Cooperation Networks: Sustainability within a Network RDI – Integrated Development Network – seeks to develop management skills for sustainability and governance within cooperation networks in general terms and within networks made up by organizations within the context of their productive chains, in LPAs (Local Productive Arrangements), in cooperatives or associations, and others. Thus, as they build management skills at companies in their productive chains, RDI intends to prepare them both individually and in networks as they strengthen each other reciprocally within a competitive context that will favor the building of increasingly stronger alliances. RDI intends to generate reciprocal value by establishing strategic alignment and cooperation among the partner organizations, thereby achieving the objectives agreed upon among the partnership’s members. The partnership set up nine groups in 2010, as 112 companies joined it. There were 58 events and 250 executives attended them. Open Programs GRS – Responsible Management for Sustainability The 9th group of the Responsible Management for Sustainability Program was run in 2010. The group was made up by 44 professionals, and three of them came from abroad (two from Paraguay and one from Argentina). The theme has been at the top of the business world agenda, and organizations have striven to get to know the concept of sustainability better by focusing on company prosperity, the environmental quality of the systems that surround them, and the social equality of the communities they are inserted in. GRS has been a profitable arena for learning and discussing these three instances. As they involve various fields of knowledge, sustainability and responsible management have become extremely busy themes. This has demanded that GRS content should be dealt with and updated every year, which has been done in 2010 and which certainly will also be done in 2011. The content dealt with in the program is based on the Biogram, a model supported by the concept of an aware organization. The Program is held in São Paulo, and it is structured into three modules: I – Positioning the Company within Sustainability II – Managing the Company Responsibly III Practicing Corporate Responsibility To enable participants to build an action plan, the Program includes eight exercises that use the DL methodology. These exercises are structured so that, at the end, participants will have a single, structured result.

FIBRIA – Responsible Management for Sustainability 10,000 Women – Entrepreneurial Women The 10,000 Women project aims to develop the entrepreneurial talent, administrative skills and the business knowledge development of women from emerging markets who, otherwise, would not have such an opportunity. Sustainability Report ( 38 ) Women who have graduated from the 10,000 Women program The project, which was set up by the Goldman Sachs Bank, aims to take management education to 10,000 women throughout the world by offering them business management knowledge and developing their management skills. Therefore, the initiative aims to increase the number of women who are decisively present in business, besides helping to improve the quality of education all over the world. The project is run through a partnership among world-renowned business schools. In Brazil, Fundação Dom Cabral, in partnership with INSEAD (France), is one of the schools that has been chosen for this important initiative, and it will develop 500 women in 5 years by means of a business management program. At the end of the first semester of 2010, 97 women graduated from the 10,000 Women – Entrepreneurial Women Program, and their projects brought improvements to their communities. In September, 2010, Fundação Dom Cabral launched another group made up by 95 entrepreneurs. Halma FDC brings international executives closer to Brazilian children The Halma Executive Development Programe (HEDP) carried out an activity in its third module that aimed to broaden the international mindset of executives, besides promoting interaction between the 14 participants and the reality of a country that has been increasingly present in the international media due to its recent, current and possible future economic and social development, its performance vis-àvis the international crisis, and its ambitions in the international scenario. On June 26, Group Halma directors, who remained at FDC for one week, took part in a different activity: they played ball, practiced capoeira and helped students from Casa do Jardim school to build paper airplanes. Besides these joint activities, the participants distributed gifts to the children and made a US$5,500.00 donation to the institution for it to invest in areas the school’s board may believe necessary. Postgraduate: specialization, executive corporate MBA and Master’s Professors incorporate Sustainability and Social Responsibility into their class content The first module of the workshop on sustainability for the professors who teach the FDC Specialization Programs was held in 2010. From the knowledge garnered in the two workshop modules, the 26 participants began to develop their course syllabus by incorporating the concepts of sustainability. Sustainability Report The workshop aims to encourage the professors who teach the Fundação Dom Cabral Specialization Programs to insert into their syllabuses the concepts of sustainability and social responsibility. The first module was held at the BH Office and the professors were provoked to debate about how important it is to broach these principles when developing participants. ( 39 ) Incorporating Sustainability into the Mainstream The highlight of the year 2010 was the hosting of a Specialization in Business Management course that pioneered the incorporation of sustainability as a mainstream theme, both directly in the disciplines and at key moments of the agenda. A workshop to deal with conceptual alignment was held before the start of the course, and it was led by the Petrobras Sustainability Center. During this two-day stage, 27 professors (three from each emphasis) were able to align concepts and then propose syllabuses and activities permeated by sustainability themes. The application project that participants will develop must also present sustainability as a mainstream theme. Social Action – MBA Group 23 The task of restoring the São Judas Tadeu nursery school, in Nova Lima, was finished in 2010. The initiative to carry out this project was launched by FDC MBA participants from group 23. The work began in July, 2009, and it aimed to build a new wing with 6 classrooms, which made it possible to host a further 300 children and to create a space destined for teaching trades and crafts. The FDC MBA participants, together with the local community, got to work and managed to offer better service and peace of mind to the parents and to the children who benefit from the São Judas Tadeu nursery school. The São Judas Tadeu nursery school, Nova Lima, MG São Judas Tadeu nursery school children Sustainability Report Through everyone’s efforts, we managed to gather... R$9,400.00, counting private and company donations 15 computers ( 40 ) KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT Shared Challenge: Knowledge (I) To develop the competence to structure educational solutions through centers, products and events that will be able to respond to the demands put forth by society; (II) To engage in research and facilitate the dialogue among investors, companies, the government, civil society organizations and other stakeholders on the challenges related to social responsibility and to sustainability and to overcoming barriers. FDC has significantly invested in generating and disseminating knowledge related to strategic themes from the business world, and it has made an effort to create an environment and structures that encourage and lead to such activities. The Knowledge Generation Centers are part of such initiatives. They are spaces aimed at developing multidisciplinary studies, research, content development, methodologies, and innovative technologies and solutions that involve clients, companies, partners and other domestic and international teaching and research institutions. The knowledge generated by the centers is disseminated by means of books, articles, case studies, and participating and organizing conferences, forums and seminars. The following centers are already currently active: ENTREPRENEURSHIP BUSINESS MANAGEMENT B2B MARKET MANAGEMENT CCR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CCR INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOGISTICS INNOVATION VALE LEADERSHIP INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SUSTAINABILITY AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY The Knowledge Generation Centers are supported and sponsored by different domestic and multinational companies, and also by partnerships with important teaching institutions and research centers. The activities carried out by the centers include meeting some demands put forth by programs or clients, applying the knowledge they generate, and systematizing experiences as part of the development process. Petrobras Sustainability Center Sustainability Report It was set up to develop knowledge about sustainability. Its commitments also include disseminating knowledge and contributing towards developing globally responsible leaders, as it aims to induce sustainability in people, business, society and the planet. ( 41 ) Its model is based on three pillars: The Center, which concentrates incursions on new themes and models, and the incubation and articulation of the other creative spaces (the sub-centers). Furthermore, the Center is responsible for the open program named Responsible Management for Sustainability (GRS) and for meeting demands as regards sustainability and corporate responsibility. The Reference Center is a space shared with groups of companies and dedicated to developing and applying knowledge on specific themes, though they are appropriate to companies of any kind and from any industry. The Development Centers are spaces shared with groups of companies and dedicated to developing and applying knowledge that is appropriate to certain industries. Petrobras is the new Sustainability Center partner Fundação Dom Cabral has signed a contract with Petrobras for it to sponsor the Sustainability Center. Supported by the company, the Petrobras Sustainability Center will promote broader actions, and so it will be able to enhance the effectiveness of its activities. The event that launched the partnership was held in Rio de Janeiro, at Petrobras headquarters. The following people were present: Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira, Rio de Janeiro State Environment Secretary Marilene Ramos, Petrobras institutional communications executive manager Wilson Santa Rosa. FDC was represented by executive director Elson Valim, institutional relations manager Ricardo Siqueira Campos, and Petrobras Sustainability Center coordinator Maria Raquel Grassi. Once again in 2010, a partnership between FDC and Universidade Petrobras led to the Responsible Leader Manual. The document is part of the Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative (GRLI) created by the two international institutions, and it aims to disseminate socially responsible business initiatives. Furthermore, a bimonthly newsletter began to be published at the end of July to disseminate topics and practices in globally responsible business leadership. FDC collaborators will be able to access information about the Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative (GRLI) through this new newsletter that will be published by the organization in “FDC em Notícias”. REFERENCE CENTER IN RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT FOR SUSTAINABILITY – CRGRS The CRGRS was created in 2004 and it began to generate knowledge to explore the internal and business environments of our partner companies, the market, the social and natural Brazilian environments, and the worldwide and globalized environments. Sustainability Report RESPONSIBLE RETAILING DEVELOPMENT CENTER – CDVR CDVR was set up in 2007 to generate knowledge aimed at retail companies in the mass goods and services industry and to the components of their supply chain, thus favoring the practice of the principles of conscious consumption, ethical behavior and commitment to the great issues demanded ( 42 ) by Brazilian society.

Snacks were served at the Belgo Theater before and during the games, and so the fans could watch the games played by the Brazilian team. 2010 World Cup Christmas Party To wrap up the end of the year activities, the collaborators took part in a Christmas Party named FDC Grocery Store. Sustainability Report Christmas Party ( 52 ) Charity Shop Through an initiative by our collaborator Valéria Hudson, and with the support of the Internal Communications Department, the event gathered R$ 3,600.00 for nurseries in Jardim Canadá and Venda Nova. Shirts, blazers, dresses, pants, shoes, earrings, necklaces, accessories and boxes turned the hall at the Olympic Club into a market stall for solidarity on September 11th. The aim of the shop was to gather funds to help maintain the Primeiros Passos project (PPP) and Recanto do Menor institution. Sustainability Report ( 53 ) FDC Aware In May, FDC began an internal project on awareness and sustainability by launching selective garbage disposal at the Institution. The project involved several departments. The janitorial team was taught the proper way to collect the trash and to follow up, daily, on the results at workstations and classrooms. Space was set aside on the Intranet to publish the actions carried out by the FDC Aware program. On the first stage of the Program, this space offers information about selective garbage disposal and encourages collaborators to participate through the channel Conscious Employee and the Suggestion Box. Other actions are planned to be implemented during the Program, such as an environmental blitz in which the janitorial team will move through the FDC facilities checking up on learning. Such actions are expected to raise awareness and promote attitude changes.

Server virtualization: reducing power consumption by deactivating several physical servers and implementing virtual machines. Project to replace CRT monitors by LCD ones (reduced power consumption). Acquiring only machines that comply with RFC demands. Power saved in six months amounted to... 8.7MW through the project to replace CRT monitors by LCD ones 90MW through server virtualization Planet Hour Fundação Dom Cabral can be counted among the thousands of companies that took up the idea of turning the lights off for one hour as a mobilizing action to use resources consciously. Lights were turned off between 8:30 PM and 9:30 PM at its three offices. Sustainability Report ( 55 ) Planet Hour CED – Document Publishing Department CED carried out a study about the new digital technologies and solutions for the products the sector develops so that it could create a proposal to work according to sustainability concepts. They are: Firstly, it looked for printing paper that would adequately meet such concepts. The layout was restructured to make better use of the paper’s printing area by frequently using both the back and the front. A digital technology was developed to minimize most of the printing process, making for faster product delivery, decreasing the amount of paper used, the cost of transportation, and consequently, the release of polluting gases. Another strong point offered by this technology is that the activities carried out can be performed in real time and interactively between participants and the professor, besides allowing the professor easier access to the material used. This kind of product is already being tested in the Specialization Courses. In terms of reusing paper, CED collects the paper used by the institution and turns it into notepads that are distributed to FDC collaborators. CED has developed a proposal for visual communication to be used in the corridors, thus replacing the old canvas and vinyl banners that use oil by-products. Marketing By respecting ethics and relationship aspects, FDC seeks to follow good sustainability practices at all its events. Therefore, some important points are taken into account: The use of certified wood to set up the booth. Using neither mortar nor paint in the structures and walls of the booths. Using coverings made of cloth on the wooden structures, for assembled booths, which can be reused and are less damaging to the environment. Hiring suppliers that adopt good practices as regards labor laws and recycle leftovers and refuse correctly. As regards hiring catering services, they must use crockery instead of disposable material, thus avoiding creating trash (plastics, Styrofoam cups, etc.) Using organic coffee at the coffee stands set up inside FDC booths. Using paper that is certified for the advertising material that is produced. At some events, using materials such as: signs made from toothpaste tube cuttings and OSB (Oriented Strand Board).

Sustainability Report Children’s Day For the seventh year running, FDC received children from Benvinda Pinto Rocha Municipal school, in Jardim Canadá, in Nova Lima, to celebrate Children’s Day. ( ) 59 Children’s Day The children were split into teams that represented the four elements in nature and then took part in workshops that involved not only many games but also disseminated knowledge. Moving around among the activities, the groups named Fire, Water, Earth and Air learned how to plant seeds and crossbreed the seeds of violets of different colors. The children had great fun Children’s Day making animals out of the balloons and playing with the crazy hula-hoop, besides having a good laugh with magician Caio Makai. To take advantage of the space offered by the Belgo Theater, a treasure hunt was instituted and children were able to dash after clues and answer questions about creating a more sustainable world. Generous Tree In partnership with Associação Ponto Cultural, underserved children from the western region Children’s Day of Belo Horizonte create Christmas cards that are hung from trees set up in the lobby of the three FDC offices.

Undergraduate Scholarship Grants Every quarter, FDC donates 1% of its operational revenues to Fundação José Fernandes, besides sponsoring research and centers, for undergraduate scholarship grants at PUC Minas. In 2010, donations amounted to R$ 1,463,153.27 and 184 students benefited from grants. External Grant Pilot Project The External Grant Project aims to make it possible for people who do not have the same opportunities within society, and who do not enjoy favorable financial conditions, to have access to skills-building programs aimed at developing their own businesses while also benefiting their surrounding community by generating income. The idea to grant scholarships is also linked to the principle of being Useful, which is defined as “Fundação Dom Cabral’s reason for being, in the sense that the idea is to be useful to the building of society”. Initially, a pilot project is being carried out with women in Nova Lima County – MG to validate the conditions set out by the Program. In 2010, five scholarship grants to the amount of R$75,000 were offered the percentages were defined after studying the grantees’ socio-economic condition – for the FDC Specialization in Management Program, which lasts for two years and grants a specialist certificate to participants that meet all the accreditation conditions set out by both MEC and FDC. A full scholarship to the amount of R$8,900.00 was granted to a young student who took part as a listener in the “Strategy in Value Chains: from Demand to Supply” program. From such an experience, the External Grant Program will be extended to other FDC programs. Testimonials by FDC Specialization Program participants “The course has offered me all the theoretical/technical bases in business management I need to apply to my own business, a Physiotherapy Clinic dedicated to treating pain, here at the Jardim Canadá district. Through this enterprise, I am sure I will be developing the county, and particularly the district, generating taxes and job opportunities for the community”. Neuzenir Silva Sustainability Report “Taking a management course at Fundação Dom Cabral is an opportunity that has changed my life both as a person and as a professional. Each class, professor, book and text has made an incredible contribution to potentialize my perspectives as regards my future, my career and my personal development. I have felt such a deep change that every day I notice how the program has influenced my way of the looking at the world. I am very privileged to be part of Fundação Dom Cabral. This ( 62 ) opportunity has brought me an incredible will to grow, learn and make a difference both at companies I might work for and at the community in which I live.” Albânia Ribeiro “When I managed to receive a scholarship in People Management at FDC I felt like I had discovered a new and enormous window open to me. This course has made me renew my personal, professional and academic perspectives. It is a great privilege to have received an FDC scholarship grant, it is a great gift that I have savored every day. Congratulations to FDC for this great initiative and social responsibility.” Rosimeire Nascimento “There are two moments in my life: one before Fundação, and the other after it. Taking part in the FDC Specialization Program has been the differential in my life, and for sure it will make a difference to the Nova Lima community’s life. It was through this course that what used to be a wish is now a project that is headed in the right direction. My project is to teach extra classes to children who do not have a place to stay while they are parents are working, and add knowledge to them and get them away from the streets. My colleague at the program and I have already planned to develop our project through a possible partnership with an NGO from the city of Nova Lima.” Elisângela Moreira Youth Qualification Course on Wood Furniture Conservation To qualify young people in the field of wood furniture restoration, FDC has set up a partnership with Valor Social, a program that is run by the Flávio Gutierrez Cultural Institute. This course makes it possible for young people to work as restorer’s assistants and thus join the labor market. Valor Social is a promising, socio-cultural insertion initiative developed in Minas Gerais, a State where 60% of the Brazilian heritage sites can be found and where there is great lack of specialized labor in the fields of conservation/ restoration. The course began in June 2008, and its 420-hour workload was completed in six months. In 2010, the Qualification Course on Wood Furniture Conservation certified 30 people.

Support for PLIC – The Lagoa dos Ingleses Citizenship Program The Sustainable Fashion project was one of the most remarkable initiatives taken by the Lagoa dos Ingleses Citizenship Program in 2010. It consists of a partnership set up between the Alphaville Lagoa dos Ingleses General Association and Fundação Dom Cabral, and it uses funding from the Nova Lima City Hall Productive Inclusion Municipal Program to offer women from the northeastern region of Nova Lima an alternative income by casting a sustainable look on fashion. Through its Fashion Design course, Universidade Fumec teaches the course and is responsible for the technical aspects of the project. Currently, 14 students develop the layout and produce clothes that use ecologically correct material. The focus is on working to encourage entrepreneurship and solidarity economy. The first fashion collection was themed “Gourmet”, and it was made up by aprons, table cloth and cup holders. A great success! Sustainability Report Members of the Sustainable Fashion project ( 65 ) A Networked Environment In 2010, Fundação Dom Cabral, V&M Mineração, Associação Alphaville – Lagoa dos Ingleses and Lagoa dos Ingleses Cidadania set up the “Networked Environment” workgroup. Its aim is to contribute to turn the Alphaville Lagoa dos Ingleses region and its surroundings (10 to 12 km around) near the mining operations as a place that is better perceived as regards its environmental quality for the current, fluctuating and future populations. The Networked Environment Program is divided into six projects: the Water Project (monitoring and transparency); the Soil Project (vegetal cover and silting); the Air-Quality Project (measuring points and tree corridor); the Refuse Project (compost and selective garbage disposal); the Traffic Project (roads and traffic stops); building projects (lecturers and supplier fairs). The main results expected from the work carried out by the Networked Environment Group are to become a benchmark and to contribute to multiply and apply this initiative to other regions of the county, the state, and the country. Taking advantage of the events celebrating Alphaville’s 10 years, the Networked Environment Group, together with the Lagoa dos Ingleses Citizenship Program, promoted a special day in honor of the environment. It was held on August 7, 2010, and it was named PLIC Aware. On that occasion, several actions that are being developed were presented as well as the various possibilities for the community to take part in environmental preservation practices. Fundação Dom Cabral sponsored a welcome breakfast for everyone, which was followed by presentations about projects such as Ecoponto, Green Compost Center, and Tree Handling and Planting. Then adults, children and teenagers representing residents from all Alphaville gated communities planted trees along Princesa Diana avenue. Besides the local residents present at the event, there were also representatives from all the partners involved: Associação Alphaville Lagoa dos Ingleses, Fundação Dom Cabral, V&M, Nova Lima City Hall, ASCAPE, and others.
