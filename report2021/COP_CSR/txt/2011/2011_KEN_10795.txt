We strongly believe responsible tourism can contribute positively to the UN Millennium Development Goals and protect the environment, combat extreme poverty, improve education level and share the benefits of modern technologies through outstanding CSR practices. Karen Blixen Camp is a founding member camp of the Mara North Conservancy and protects 32.000 Ha of pristine wildlife area in the vital northwestern zone of the Greater Masai Mara Ecosystem. We are committed to minimize our impact on the fragile environment and use the latest green technologies. Solar panels provide all power used at camp, gas burners heats up water for the outdoor showers and a sewage system handles all waste water produced. Karen Blixen Camp observes the Working Law of Kenya 2007 and has endorsed the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) declaration on rights to work. All staff is employed on permanent contracts to ensure job security, rights in case of termination and social and medical benefits. We support the local Masai community following the principle of trade, not aid. Distribution of revenue covers; lease payment for Mara North Conservancy, bed night fee for leasing our privately owned concession area, purchasing local goods and for using local supplies. Karen Blixen Camp has been approved to receive support through Danida, Danish International Development Assistance. We wish to establish professional hospitality education for the local Maasai youth, increase IT literacy within the area and will in partnership with the Woodlands Trust plant and grow indigenous trees for the restoration of natural wildlife areas in the Masai Mara. 1|Page Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Code of conduct: • Protect the Mara North Conservancy with 32,000 of pristine wilderness area • Make use of the latest green technologies and minimize our impact on the environment • Promote environmental responsibility and find sustainable solutions on energy consumption • Fundraise for the betterment of the local Maasai community • Promote tertiary education for the Maasai youth, young men and women alike • Promote literacy and make available computers and internet technologies • Ensure full and decent employment for all staff employed • Assure proper working conditions and respect workers’ rights to join an association • Promote gender equality and equity amongst staff employed • Embark HIV/AIDS awareness for all staff employed Brief description of nature of business Karen Blixen Camp in the Masai Mara offers exclusive wildlife experiences to visitors from around the world. The camp comprises 22 large canvas tents and gives an authentic ’yesteryear’ experience for visitors wishing to gain that little extra from their safari. Set on the banks of the Mara River, the location is spectacular. Throughout the day elephants, giraffes, zebras and impalas come for a drink while a large hippo pod rests lazily in the river. Karen Blixen Camp is committed to responsible wildlife experiences. We invite our guests to explore and understand the complexity of the Masai Mara Ecosystem with its great wildlife on game drives, game walks, nature walks, balloon safaris and eco camp walks. Understanding the intricacies of how the Masai Mara Ecosystem works adds the ultimate dimension to the very unique and outstanding wildlife experience. Karen Blixen Camp conducts our business in a manner that benefits the environment, the people working at the camp and the neighboring community. Our mission is to become one of the most recognized eco friendly luxury camps in East Africa and make eco tourism a very successful business imperative in today’ tourism industry. Karen Blixen Camp is a Kenyan registered company owned by Danish shareholders. IFU, the Investment Fund for developing countries has granted us a development loan, as a part of their objective to promote economic and social growth in developing countries. Danida, Danish International Assistance to developing countries has granted us funding through its UN based IPD, International Partnership for Development Programme to establish a hospitality and forestry school for the Maasai youth, combating low education and extreme poverty. Scope of this COP Karen Blixen Camp is proud to present our second Communication on Progress for the year 2010 to the UN Global Compact. We are reporting on our CSR practices and progress within the principles of human rights, labour, environment and anti‐corruption. 2|Page Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Human rights UN Global Compact principles covered Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2: Business should ensure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Commitment Karen Blixen Camp is committed to support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure our company is not complicit in human rights abuses. We adhere to the UN Human Rights Declaration of 1966, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Constitution of Kenya of 2010 which declare protection of human rights and how they should be observed in relation to operation of companies. Karen Blixen Camp is committed to ensure equality and freedom from discrimination, freedom from well as slavery servitude and forced labour and further guarantee freedom of association and the right to fair labour practices within our business practices and sphere of influence. We are committed to contribute positively to the Children’ Act and children’ rights to education and proper healthcare for children living in our close vicinity. Brief description of our systems with activities implemented in 2007 to 2010 Freedom of discrimination Karen Blixen Camp is committed to secure that no discrimination takes place in employment related procedures and decisions based on a person’ origin, sex, religion, political or union affiliation, sexual orientations or physical challenges at the workplace. Our employment policy promotes equal opportunities for all candidates who meet the job qualification criteria. With an unemployment rate at 50 percent within the local Maasai community, Karen Blixen Camp strongly believe we have a great responsibility making sure the Maasai community benefit economically from our presence through promotion of employment opportunities. 80 percent of the staff working at the camp has been recruited from the local Maasai community and 20 percent derive from other parts in Kenya. Gender equality Promoting gender equality is crucial. Poverty is not gender‐neutral, but affects men and women in different ways. Women are more likely to be employed in vulnerable jobs – in farming, as unpaid family workers or as own‐account workers – with no or little financial security or social benefits. Karen Blixen Camp is committed to promote gender equality. Women and men are given the same employment conditions and salary is paid in accordance to qualifications. Women are also given 3 month of maternity leave. Of the 96 staff members, only 12 are women. In other words; we are still lacking far behind securing a 50 percent gender ratio amongst our staff. The reasons are partly due to barriers within the society and educational barriers. Women are therefore strongly encouraged to apply. During 2010/11 we will conduct a study to better women’ working conditions at the camp. Measurements of outcome and value added for our company Karen Blixen Camp is experiencing great support from our travel agent and tour operators who are pleased with our Eco Tourism practices. We expect to increase our occupancy rate due to travel agents and visitors’ interest in sustainable tourism. 3|Page Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Activities planned for next year Karen Blixen Camp will invite human rights activists or labour unions to come and facilitate awareness courses on human rights for all staff employed at the camp. 4|Page Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Labour rights UN Global Compact principles covered Principle 3: Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Principle 4: Business should support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5: Business should support the effective abolition of child labour Principle 6: Business should support the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Commitment Karen Blixen Camp believes that the private sector has the capacity to alleviate poverty through proper working conditions. We abbey the Working Law of Kenya 2007, the Labour Organization’s (ILO) declaration on rights to work and have endorsed the labour principles of the UN Global Compact. Being the single largest sector in the world economy, tourism plays a key role for many African countries. Tourism creates jobs and incomes for millions of people. As such tourism is capable of contributing positively to the UN Millennium Development Goals; alleviating extreme poverty and hunger through full and decent employment. Africa is highly dependent on the global economy, but the global economy is not dependent on Africa. Africa accounts for less that 1 percent of annual global capital inflows and for less than 2 percent of the world trade. The entire GDP of Africa (excluding South Africa and Nigeria) is about equal to that of a small country as Ireland. According to the World Bank an estimated 44 percent of the African population will continue to live in extreme poverty with less than 1 USD per day. In absolute terms, the number of poor people has nearly doubled, from 200 million in 1981 to 380 million in 2005. Sadly, the financial crisis has pushed another 65 million people into vulnerable employment. They and their family find themselves living in extreme poverty without a financial stable job, but reliant on casual, seasonal or own‐account labour. To beat the poverty line, 11 millions of jobs must be created every year in Africa. Research shows that nine out of ten jobs are created in the private sector; making private sector led economic growth crucial for employment generation and poverty reduction. But tourism must be conducted in a responsible manner, adhering to international accepted standards. Tourism is, unfortunately, a fiercely competitive global market, with incentives for putting short‐term earnings before long‐term environmental considerations. Protecting the environment, respecting workers’ right, ensuring full and decent employment as well as promoting gender equality is crucial should the tourism industry wish to have a sustainable impact in the developing countries; alleviating extreme poverty through job creation and economic growth. Brief description of our systems with activities implemented in 2007 to 2010 Karen Blixen Camp employs 96 staff members. 86 are working at the camp in the Mara and 10 are working at the head office in Nairobi. Permanent contract for job security All staff is employed on a permanent contract with a 3 month probation period. This ensures not only job security, rights in case of termination, but also economic, social and medical benefits. Contracts have been written by Muthoga Gaturu & Advocates in accordance with the Working Law of Kenya 2007. Karen Blixen Camp refrains from use of casual labour as this renounce job security, social rights and medical benefits. 5|Page Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Worker’s right to join an association and to bargain The International Labour Organization has endorsed workers with the universal right to freely join an association and to bargain. We respect and encourage these rights. All staff is free to join any chosen association. Five staff members have been democratically elected to form the staff committee. The committee represents the staff and act on their behalf, raising questions or matters that worry them. Staff is also able to voice any concern through the monthly staff meetings where the entire staff and the management are represented. In case of any misinterpretation between an individual staff member and the management, the company responds to the chosen labor union with attention to resolve the matter. Staff is also encouraged to formally negotiate salary and terms of employment at least once a year. Salary and leave conditions The salary consists of a base salary, travel or housing allowance as well as a service charge, where 5 percent of our total revenue is paid as a monthly bonus salary. The service charge effectively increases staff salary between 10 to 135 percent. Staff works on a monthly schedule with 21 working days, 7 days on leave and an additional 3 weeks holiday a year. Medical security and benefits Medical insurance is important in countries without welfare state funded healthcare systems. Our staff has insurance through the National Health Insurance Fund. NHIF covers the individual and his/her close family in case of in‐patient medical help (hospitalization), but not in case of out‐patient medical help. When needed, staff is able to seek medical help at the local Mararienda Health Clinic. Such out‐patient activities (consultation fee, test and medication) are paid by the company. In case of extended medical treatment, staff has the option of being referred to private or national hospitals in Nairobi. Two doctors, Dr. Ingrid Helweg Gichere and Dr. Raphael Gichere from Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, are attached for counseling and monitoring of health for all staff. The doctors also come to our camp and inform about HIV/Aids and family planning. Our staff is able to pose any questions on matters that worry them and their families. Social security Social security is provided through the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), which reimburses social benefits when a member retires from a regularly paid employment or to the dependants of a deceased member. NSSF also offers funeral grants. Living conditions at the camp for staff Working in the bush means living in the bush. Our staff accommodation comprises two stone houses; canteen, flush toilets and hot and cold water showers. All staff rooms have a bed, beddings, linen, a mosquito net and a lockable cupboard for private belongings. The canteen serves breakfasts, lunches and dinners. TV with DSTV provides news from the outside world and a DVD shows movies. Twice a year, a football tournament between the camps of the area is arranged. Measurements of outcome and value added for our company Karen Blixen Camp is experiencing great support from our travel agent and tour operators who are pleased with our Eco Tourism practices. We expect to increase our occupancy rate due to travel agents and visitors’ interest in sustainable tourism. Activities planned for next year Karen Blixen Camp will invite the labour unions to come and facilitate awareness courses on labour rights for all staff employed at the camp. 6|Page Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Environment UN Global Compact principles covered Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9: Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Commitment Karen Blixen Camp is committed to minimize our impact on the fragile environment. The camp has been constructed to run in the most environmental friendly manner using the latest green technologies. Solar panels provide all power used at camp, gas burners heats up water for the outdoor showers and a sewage system handles all waste water produced. Brief description of our systems with activities implemented in 2007 to 2010 Green technologies Solar panels provides electricity Karen Blixen Camp has 24 hour electricity, powered by an extensive solar panel system. During sunny days the solar panels follows the position of the sun and the solar energy goes into the battery bank ensuring electricity is also available at night or on rainy days. The benefit is obvious; there is no excessive use of diesel fueling noisy generators and our outlet of CO2 is kept at a minimum. The total investment in the solar system with 55 solar panels of 165 watt each with the battery bank amounted to 135,000 USD. It is estimated that, with good care, the solar system will last around 8‐10 years. The equivalent usage of power provided by a generator will cost 54,750 USD per annum or 547,500 USD for 10 years usage. The cost buying the generator exempted. In this context, investing in green technologies rather than the good old polluting ones makes financial sense. Gas used for heating water Traditional safari tourism relies on firewood and charcoals as their main source of energy. But with only 1.7% forest cover left in Kenya, usage of firewood and charcoals is not a very sustainable business practice. Karen Blixen Camp is using gas burners for heating water for the outdoor guest showers. Outside each tent, a gas cylinder has been placed with pipes connected to the main water tank. Every time the guest opens the hot water tap, water runs through and the gas fuels a flame that will heat up the water. Gas is also used for cooking meals served at the restaurant. The benefit is simple; when not using firewood and charcoals we do not contribute to the deforestation of Kenyan woodlands. Gas, however green it may seem, is transported over long distances, before it reach our camp. And gas is rather expensive; 25,000 USD is yearly allocated for payment of gas in our budget. Admittedly, expenditures we would like to cut down without compromising the comfort of our guests. Within the next two months Karen Blixen Camp will invest in solar waterheaters. The recent development of solar technology allows sufficient energy from the sun to be captured, even on cloudy days. Adding to the benefit, the solar waterheaters can be centralized into one unit, connected to our main water system, providing hot water for all 22 tents on a 24 hour base. We believe the investment in solar waterheaters will be returned within ten months. Waste water treatment Wastewater treatment is another important matter when running a camp out in the bush. Water for guest showers, washing of bed linens, and not to mention flushing toilets, creates wastewater. All 7|Page Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 wastewater produced are led into the sewage system and directed into the septic tank. From here the wastewater is mechanical treated as it runs through channels of charcoals and sand filters, ending in two huge soak pits. The surface water is collected and used for watering our bush garden. We test the grey water by sending samples to the Kenyan National Laboratory to ensure zero out let of polluting agents. Our future plan is to have our grey and black water treated separately. Recent technology allows continual treatment and recycling of toilet waste water through a closed and odorless micro wastewater cleaning tanks. Strict waste management system for recycling Karen Blixen Camp is committed to recycle all waste produced. However, we must admit it present a very challenging affair to accomplish this obligation. The western world benefit from governmental regulated waste management systems, whereas countries as Kenya still struggle to establish sufficient and effective recycling plants throughout the country. Much depend on the private sector as well as the people working in the takataka (garbage) business. We compost the organic waste and separate and transport the non‐degradable waste back to Nairobi. We liaise with a private company who collects our waste and whenever possible sell it to recycling companies. Moreover, we have stopped buying PET mineral water bottles as no proper recycling plant can be found in Kenya. Instead guests are provided with refillable water bottles. We will continuously strive to align our business practices with a sustainable purchase policy for reduced waste production. Conservation Olisuk Concession Karen Blixen Camp protects 3,400 acres (1,373 Ha) of natural wildlife area as a private concession. Eleven Maasai families have decided to lease their land to us and in return we pay them a fixed bed night fee every time a guest stays at our camp. Mara North Conservancy Karen Blixen Camp is situated in the beautiful Mara North Conservancy. We protect more than 32,000 Ha of stunning natural wilderness in close partnership with the Maasai communities. Guests are ensured a truly exclusive safari experience. Mara North Conservancy is a partnership between eleven member camps and over 800 Masai landowners. Our ambition is to create a best‐practice, world‐class conservancy with long term commitments to the environment, the wildlife and the Maasai communities. The partnership provides the Maasai communities with the economic incentives to set aside their land for wildlife conservation and guarantees our guests of a truly exclusive safari experiences in one of the world’s most stunning wildlife areas with responsible tourism and controlled vehicle density. Mara North Conservancy protects more than 32,000 Ha of pristine natural wildlife area. Community and tourism conservation Communities living in natural wildlife areas must be provided with the economic incentives to set aside their land for wildlife conservation. The eleven member camps of Mara North guarantees fixed monthly lease payments for the privilege to carry out their game drives within the beautiful area. The idea of guaranteeing a fixed lease payment is truly innovative and marks the very first time that the Masai landowners in this area have received direct, predictable and transparent income from wildlife, allowing the community members to plan ahead for the future. The lease payment is not subject to the number of conservancy tickets sold, and therefore not dependant on fluctuations in tourism. Mara North Conservancy protects more than 32,000 Ha of natural wildlife area on fixed lease agreements. 8|Page Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Mission goals • Safeguard the Masai Mara through professional wildlife management • Direct and transparent revenue distribution to the Masai landowners • Promotion of strong eco‐tourism practices and use of environmentally friendly technologies • Controlled tourism and guaranteed low vehicle density for lower environmental impact • Fundraising for the betterment of the local communities Management Mara North Conservancy is managed by a board of directors, elected by the member camps. The board works in close partnership with the Masai Landowner Committee to meet short and long term objectives for the future. The Landowner Committee reports to all landowners for their final approval. Twice a year, full community meetings are held whereby all landowners are able to voice their opinion on the way forward. Mara North Conservancy is a not‐for‐profit public company established on the 1st of January 2009. Wildlife Management Professional wildlife management is crucial. Brian Heath, Seiya Ltd. has been appointed as Mara North Conservancy’ Conservation Manager with Marc Goss as the daily Manager and Benson Ketere as Head Warden of the ranger surveillance team. Seiya Ltd. is an international recognized conservation company with over 40 years of wildlife conservation experience. Mara North Conservancy employs 30 rangers to secure the area and its wildlife. The foremost objectives are to protect the wild animals from poaching and snaring, manage grazing zones for livestock, respond to and find solutions for human/wildlife conflicts and restore natural habitat areas with maintenance of roads and tracks. Anti‐poaching enforcement Poaching has been and is a very current threat to wildlife. Elephants are still being shot in great numbers to remove and sell their tusk for ivory productions. Plain game as zebras or wildebeests is caught in snares to be sold at the growing worldwide bushmeat market. Marc Goss and his rangers will, when necessary, arrest and hand over suspects to the Kenyan Wildlife Services and the Kenyan Police. The day and night surveillance of the wilderness area most definitely prevent poachers to access and destroy wildlife within the Mara North Conservancy. Responding to human‐wildlife conflicts Human‐wildlife conflicts occur in areas where man and wild animals live side by side. The Maasai have never hunted the plain games for meat, but entirely depended on their livestock. However, traditions have prescribed for every young warrior to kill a lion to reach his manhood. This practice has unfortunately not completely ceased to exist. Young Maasai warriors will still kill the big cat predators in retaliation for attacked livestock. Marc Goss and his rangers are responding to any human‐wildlife conflicts occurring within the area to discourage retaliations and find a joint solution for future co‐ existence. Mara North Conservancy has introduced a compensation scheme in the event of predator‐ livestock conflicts. The scheme works as an insurance fund where landowners pay half and the member camps the other half. The cost to the individual landowner is on average 21 USD per year. Moreover, we are introducing predator proof enclosures (bomas) to keep livestock safe at nights as well as recommending better herding practices. Controlled grazing and zoning Controlled grazing and zoning for livestock is important to accommodate both wildlife and livestock. Mara North Conservancy keeps certain zones and hours restricted for grazing. Cattle grazing are 9|Page Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 permitted in areas, where they do not interfere with wildlife such as the big cat predators. Follow Marc Goss, Benson Ketere and their 30 ranger through www.mncreports.blogspot.com. Karen Blixen Camp’ contribution Karen Blixen Camp is founding member camp of Mara North Conservancy. We guarantee the payment of 27,500 USD per month. This makes us the single largest contributor with 330,000 USD per year in fixed lease payments. Martin Sonderby Nielsen, Managing Director of Karen Blixen Camp, is member of the Executive Board of Mara North Conservancy and acts as its Treasurer. Katrine Sonderby Nielsen, CSR Manager of Karen Blixen Camp, assist with fundraising and communication work. Holistic Forestry Kenya’s rich natural wildlife is threatened by widespread deforestation. Only 1.7 percent forest cover remains of the ones vast woodland areas. Commercial farming and wood logging diminished the larger part in the past. Today charcoaling is the biggest threat to the environmental stability of Kenya. It is estimated that 70 tons of charcoal are sold at the Nairobi market every day. This represents an annual destruction of 120 km2 of Kenyan forest. Much is consumed by the urban Kenyan households, whom for economically reasons depend on firewood or charcoal for their basic domestic cooking needs. Large quantities are also being exported for the barbeques in the Middle East. Paradoxical, safari tourism has traditionally contributed to this environmental disaster by using unsustainably harvested firewood and charcoals as an inexpensive way for heating up water for their paying clients’ showers. Maybe, oblivious of the fact, that they are destroying the very foundation their own business is relying on? Masai Mara is experiencing similar ecological challenges. Precious virgin forested areas have been destructed for commercial (tourism) and household use of charcoals and firewood during the last 20 years. The damage is beginning to become significant. In some areas, especially around the small villages, the shallow volcanic topsoil is disappearing due to deforestation. Most Maasai women now have to walk at least 5 km in search of firewood. Ambitious reforestation initiatives are vital to restore the previous acacia forest cover and renewable energy solutions must be found. Karen Blixen Forestry School Karen Blixen Camp is partnering with the Woodlands 2000 Trust. We will establish the Karen Blixen Forestry School and offer entrepreneurial and vocational forestry education for the Maasai youth. Our mission is to conserve and enhance the beautiful Masai Mara by teaching the Maasai youth how grow and sustainably manage multi‐use woodlots, providing them with a decent income for the future as well as environmental security. The Karen Blixen Forestry School will offer 18‐months courses with theoretical tuition and practical demonstrations, emphasizing on indigenous commercial woodlot farming to supply the region with sustainably grown certified forest by‐products. The first module will teach the students about Masai Mara agro‐climatic conditions, indigenous trees and their uses, the establishment of tree seedling nurseries and how to successfully plant, protect and nurture the seedlings to maturity. The second module will prepare the students on how to establish their own self‐financed woodlots through the sale of seedlings and sustainably produced wood fuels and building materials. Students will learn about basic gross margin analysis, accounting practices, value addition and efficient utilization of their woodlot crop. The majority of students are expected to establish their own commercial woodlot, while others are able to seek employment as junior foresters at camps within the area. Students will also learn how to raise awareness about the beautiful Masai Mara and reforestation by performing speeches for guests and interaction via the internet. 10 | P a g e Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Growing 25,000 trees a year Karen Blixen Camp has employed Teddy Kinanjui from the Woodlands 2000 Trust as the lead consultant for this project. Mr. Kinyanjui and his forestry team have established a tree nursery with the holding capacity of 5000 seedlings, which we aim to double by December 2010. The tree nursery is irrigated by recycling the wastewater from the carwash area utilizing a simple waterway system. Since 2006 we have planted 12,000 seedlings within the camp grounds. Our initial focus is pioneer tree species. These are trees that are primarily endemic to the lower Mara River Basin and are sturdy enough to withstand wildlife and livestock damage as well as drought. On a smaller scale, we are also focusing on rare high value endangered tree species that are difficult to germinate from seed in order to create a small‐scale botanical garden for the long‐term conservation of these selected species. Our future plans are to expand the degraded forests along the riparian zone of the Mara River to reduce erosion, increase bird and protect wildlife habitat. This will be undertaken using an integrated systematic holistic approach incorporating local community partners and stakeholders with applicable Government licensing and technical expertise. Plant trees for smaller carbon footprints We invite our travel agents and guests to sponsor a woodlot. The ambition is to increase the Masai Mara forest cover, reduce CO2 emission and alleviate extreme poverty amongst the Maasai youth. Sponsorships will run for a chosen period providing the graduated junior forester with a salary and the necessary funds to buy seeds and tools until his/her woodlot is financial self‐sustainably. Donated funds can also be forwarded to our Holistic Forestry project with growing of pioneer tree species and/or the small‐scale botanical garden with growing of rare and endangered tree species for the long‐term conservation of these selected species. The Woodlands 2000 Trust The Woodlands 2000 Trust is a Kenyan organization that offers afforestation consultancy services to private companies, farmers and landowners who are interested in commercial and environmental sustainable woodlot farming. The overall objective is to create a sustainable and profitable tree products industry that contributes towards poverty alleviation, conservation and increased bio‐diversify in semi‐ arid regions. The Woodland 2000 Trust was established in 2001 with a grant from the British Government, DFID, Department of International Development’s Business Partnership Program, in close partnership with the Tamarind Group. The Trust has facilitated the plantation of 700,000 trees in Kenya. Measurements of outcome and value added for our company Karen Blixen Camp is experiencing great support from our travel agent and tour operators who are pleased with our Eco Tourism practices. We expect to increase our occupancy rate due to travel agents and visitors’ interest in sustainable tourism. Mara North Conservancy is a partnership between eleven member camps and over 800 Masai landowners.

Brief description of our systems with activities implemented in 2009 to 2010 Karen Blixen Camp has contributed to the full stop of corruption concerning conservancy fee ad payment of lease agreement in the formerly wildlife area Koyaki‐Lemek Wildlife Trust by the establishment of Mara North Conservancy. It is estimated that the Koyiaki‐Lemek Wildlife Trust generated approximately 2,5 USD from the years 2005 to 2007, but only managed to distribute 20 percent of this revenue to the Maasai landowners. Today, the eleven Mara North member camps are obliged to pay 112,000 USD per month in fixed lease payments, which on a yearly base accounts to 1,3 million USD. 83 percent is distributed as lease payments, paid directly into the individual landowner’ bank account and 17 percent is allocated for conservation management with employment of rangers, vehicle surveillance and maintenance of infrastructure. As a result, each Maasai landowner is secured 37 USD per Ha amounting to at least 2,220 USD per year. In comparison farmers will pay 22 USD for leasing the wildlife area for cultivating. Karen Blixen Camp is founding member camp of Mara North Conservancy. The company guarantees the payment of 27,500 USD per month. This makes KBC the single largest contributor with 330,000 USD per year in fixed lease payments.

Mara North Conservancy protects more than 32,000 Ha of pristine natural wildlife area. Mare North Conservancy is one of the most densely populated wildlife areas within the Masai Mara Ecosystem. The great Oloololo Escarpments borders the conservancy to the south and attracts the rains; crucial for the red oat and spear grassland areas. Throughout the year great numbers of herbivores as elephants, giraffes, zebras, Thomson’s gazelles and impalas seek the area for water and gracing. Always accompanied closely by the big cat predators. At the foot of the Oloololo Escarpment the Mara River flows through the conservancy area with families of huge hippos and large crocodiles resting lazily in the waters. Mara North Conservancy is home to the Leopard Gorge; world famous due to its significance as birthing and maternity ground for the big cat predators. Five prides of lions amounting to 52 family members, seven cheetah and at least six leopards has made the conservancy their homeland area. In the northern corridor the scenic Lemek Hills make an important wildlife refuge, particularly to a pack of highly threatened African wild dog. 13 | P a g e Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Activities planned for next year Karen Blixen Camp will continue our engagement in Mara North Conservancy.

Karen Blixen Camp review education as a strategic social investment that effectively contributes to the betterment of the local communities as well as the private sector. Our long term development goal targets reduction of unemployment, poverty and gender disparity. We believe that the direct benefit for us and other camps is access to an international skilled local workforce that gives an outstanding service; competitive with the best restaurants and hotels in the world. Brief description of our systems with activities implemented in 2009 to 2010 Masai Mara is the most famous safari destination in the world and attracts the attention of thousands of tourists who come to see the great wildebeest migration. Tourism represents the prime foreign exchange earner in Kenya and it is crucial that the people working in the tourism industry are highly competent and experienced. For the majority of the young Maasai a full course of secondary or tertiary education is not an obtainable goal as school fees and the cost of living in the big cities are simply too high. The poorest part of the Maasai communities is in fact the youth as they do not own land or cattle. These young people will have to make a living as their parents did; herding the livestock or find themselves in constant unemployment, contributing to the cycles of poverty. Learning for Life is a community‐private sector project funded by Danida and Karen Blixen Camp. Our goal is to enable graduated chefs and waiters to seek employment at camps in the Mara. We are currently very busy building the classrooms and the boarding unit for our future students, which will be located within the camp’s premises. Only by taking education and training of the local Kenyan youth very seriously, are we continuously able to compete in the highly competitive tourist industry of today. Karen 15 | P a g e Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Blixen Camp is partnering with the Woodlands Trust 2000 to plant indigenous trees for the restoration of natural wildlife areas in the Masai Mara Karen Blixen Hospitality and Forestry School will focus on • Cooking school • Restaurant services for waiters • IT and language courses • Forestry education for junior foresters • Environmental education Hospitality Education Karen Blixen Camp wishes to establish a professional cooking school. Education will aim for the students to become confident, capable and efficient cooks suitable for working in bush kitchens throughout the Masai Mara. The Cooking School has the ambition to give students a comprehensive and practical hands‐ on understanding of fundamental cooking skills; balancing between the classical cuisine and modern recipes. The cooking school will be full time and students will be prepared for entry‐level positions such as comis‐chef, demi‐chef, chef de partie, or assistant baker and pastry chef. A cooking certificate that is recognized by the local tourism industry will be awarded to students who pass the necessary exams and assessments. Later, a food and beverages program for those who wish to become waiters as well as a short term course for room attendants will follow. IT education Karen Blixen Camp will also offer IT education. A classroom will be completed with laptops and internet connection and an IT teacher will be employed. IT courses for beginners, intermediate and advanced levels will be offered, not only for our future students, but also for our camp staff as well as the local Maasai community. Our target for 2015 is to offer IT education for all our staff and make sure that at least 20 percent of the Maasai children and youth, girls and boys alike have received IT education. Literacy and Language courses Foreign languages courses such as German, French or Spanish will be offered to our safari guides, enabling them to enhance their qualifications and in future offer professional wildlife guiding in the above languages. Adult education will be made available for those wishing to become literate in languages as Maa, Swahili and English. Holistic Forestry Karen Blixen Camp is partnering with the Woodlands 2000 Trust. We will establish the Karen Blixen Forestry School and offer entrepreneurial and vocational forestry education for the Maasai youth. Our mission is to conserve and enhance the beautiful Masai Mara by teaching the Maasai youth how grow and sustainably manage multi‐use woodlots, providing them with a decent income for the future as well as environmental security. The Karen Blixen Forestry School will offer 18‐months courses with theoretical tuition and practical demonstrations, emphasizing on indigenous commercial woodlot farming to supply the region with sustainably grown certified forest by‐products. The first module will teach the students about Masai Mara agro‐climatic conditions, indigenous trees and their uses, the establishment of tree seedling nurseries and how to successfully plant, protect and nurture the seedlings to maturity. The second module will prepare the students on how to establish their own self‐financed woodlots through the sale of seedlings and sustainably produced wood fuels and building materials. Students will learn about basic 16 | P a g e Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 gross margin analysis, accounting practices, value addition and efficient utilization of their woodlot crop. The majority of students are expected to establish their own commercial woodlot, while others are able to seek employment as junior foresters at camps within the area. Students will also learn how to raise awareness about the beautiful Masai Mara and reforestation by performing speeches for guests and interaction via the internet. Growing 25,000 trees a year Karen Blixen Camp has employed Teddy Kinanjui from the Woodlands 2000 Trust as the lead consultant for this project. Mr. Kinyanjui and his forestry team have established a tree nursery with the holding capacity of 5000 seedlings, which we aim to double by December 2010. The tree nursery is irrigated by recycling the wastewater from the carwash area utilizing a simple waterway system. Since 2006 we have planted 12,000 seedlings within the camp grounds. Our initial focus is pioneer tree species. These are trees that are primarily endemic to the lower Mara River Basin and are sturdy enough to withstand wildlife and livestock damage as well as drought. On a smaller scale, we are also focusing on rare high value endangered tree species that are difficult to germinate from seed in order to create a small‐scale botanical garden for the long‐term conservation of these selected species. Our future plans are to expand the degraded forests along the riparian zone of the Mara River to reduce erosion, increase bird and protect wildlife habitat. This will be undertaken using an integrated systematic holistic approach incorporating local community partners and stakeholders with applicable Government licensing and technical expertise. Plant trees for smaller carbon footprints We invite our travel agents and guests to sponsor a woodlot. The ambition is to increase the Masai Mara forest cover, reduce CO2 emission and alleviate extreme poverty amongst the Maasai youth. Sponsorships will run for a chosen period providing the graduated junior forester with a salary and the necessary funds to buy seeds and tools until his/her woodlot is financial self‐sustainably. Donated funds can also be forwarded to our Holistic Forestry project with growing of pioneer tree species and/or the small‐scale botanical garden with growing of rare and endangered tree species for the long‐term conservation of these selected species. Measurements of outcome and value added for our company Karen Blixen Camp is experiencing great support from our travel agent and tour operators who are pleased with our Eco Tourism practices. We expect to increase our occupancy rate due to travel agents and visitors’ interest in sustainable tourism. Activities planned for next year Karen Blixen Camp will continue the establishment of Learning for Life, our Danida financed community‐ educational project. 17 | P a g e Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Economic Trade, not aid Commitment The tourism industry is often criticized for not ensuring that enough of its revenue goes back to the host community. Karen Blixen Camp is committed to distribute our revenue in many different ways following the principle trade, not aid, making it possible for the local Maasai community to profit from our presence in their area. Brief description of our systems with activities implemented in 2007 to 2010 Olisuk Concession Karen Blixen Camp protects 3,400 acres (1,373 Ha) of natural wildlife area as a private concession. Eleven Maasai families have decided to lease their land to us and in return we pay them a fixed bed night fee every time a guest stays at our camp. The bed night fees accumulate to 80,000 USD annually. Use of locally produced goods and suppliers We support locally produced goods and use local suppliers. Free ranging and eco friendly Masai goats and lambs are sold by Masai herdsmen and served for our staff; either barbequed or used in stews. Milk for the staff’s morning chai (tea with hot milk) also comes from the local Masai cattle, grazing on the savannah. For logistic and contractual work we hire local trucks and jeeps. We spend 40,000 USD annually using local suppliers, saving us money, time and diesel not purchasing from Nairobi. Guest visits benefit the local Masai community When guests previously visited the traditional Masai village the ticket fee often did not benefit the villagers. Karen Blixen Camp has together with Tribal Voice, UK, initiated a simple ticketing system to ensure direct payment and transparency. When guests visit the local Masai village they are obliged to obtain a ticket at the camp. We keep track of all sold tickets and at the end of each month the total amount is calculated and the money paid. In this way, the villagers are ensured to receive the money they are entitled. On behalf of our guests we forwarded 5,000 USD to the traditional Maasai village in 2009. Shop for development The beautiful Maasai artifacts for sale in the gift shop are made by a local women’s group. It was the women who took the initiative to sell their beaded armbands, wedding necklaces and rungus (wooden clubs). Since we wish to promote trade, not aid, prices are negotiated and the gift shop makes a profit every time a guest buys the artifacts. Last year we bought Masai beadwork worth 3,800 USD and sold everything, making the business profitable for both parties. Better housing for the Maasai Most Maasai families reside in small huts made of cow dung, but many wish to improve their standards of living. The roof and walls made of cow dung cannot provide adequate protection against the weather, especially during the rainy season. Moreover, airborne diseases as common cold, pneumonia and tuberculosis are constant risk factors in these poorly ventilated living conditions with the constant exposure to smoke. Brucellosis, a bacterial disease affecting people in close contact with cattle, is also a hazard as it is transmitted to humans through consumption of unpasteurized milk and possible through inhalation of dry dust. 18 | P a g e Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Karen Blixen Camp has asked an architect to design three types of houses using EcoTech block boards and plastic poles. The idea is that an individual local Maasai family can come to Muskaki Enterprise’s shop in Aitong and buy their preferred model house with rain water catchment and solar panel system. We will donate the salary for the architect and cover the cost of transporting building materials from Nairobi to Masai Mara. Measurements of outcome and value added for our company Karen Blixen Camp is experiencing great support from our travel agent and tour operators who are pleased with our Eco Tourism practices. We expect to increase our occupancy rate due to travel agents and visitors’ interest in sustainable tourism. Activities planned for next year Karen Blixen Camp will continue our support and allow the local communities to benefit economically from our presence in their home area. 19 | P a g e Karen Blixen Camp Communication on Progress 2010 Partners International and local partners Commitment Karen Blixen Camp is partnering with international as well as governmental agencies.
