Telenor Group’s Codes of Conduct (CoC) is the main governing document that describes our Group wide, internal policy regarding human rights. Besides this document, Telenor Group developed the Supplier Conduct Principles to align our core principles, ethical standards and expectations towards our suppliers. Telenor has a thorough but dynamic compliance process that is designed to further ensure the continuing development and implementation of our Codes of Conduct (CoC) and related policies and procedures. Since the introduction of the CoC in 2003, the CoC has become the foundation of our company culture. The Telenor Group has been focusing on the practical implementation of the Codes of Conduct. In 2010, Telenor Group’s People Development unit has been implementing the “Telenor Way” to link the different elements of Telenor’s corporate culture and define how we do business across our Business Units, guided by Telenor’s Vision and Values, Codes of Conduct, Group Policies and Procedures. The concept of “Telenor Way” was promoted through an internal campaign in 2010. A series of workshops have been conducted by HR & leaders on all levels of the Business units to introduce and promote the content of the key governance documents to our employees.

The Group Compliance Officer and the Group Business Assurance unit is responsible for ensuring that neither Telenor Group nor its suppliers are complicit in Human Rights abuses. 2 The Group Compliance Officer (GCO) gives quality assurance that the company acts in accordance with Codes of Conduct related regulations and legally binding directions issued by public authorities, and that internal conduct in the organization does not conflict with Telenor's own regulations and guidelines. Any incidents or breaches of the Group's Codes of Conduct should be reported to the employees’ immediate superior, the Group Compliance Officer or the local Compliance Manager. The Group Compliance Officer reports functionally to the Group CEO and Group Audit Committee. The GCO, supported by Telenor's People Development (HR), works with an established network of Local Compliance Managers (LCM) in all local Business Units. This structure provides a framework for projects and activities related to prevention and awareness where employees can also inquire or report questions and concerns regarding the CoC. Reporting breaches through the “Hotline to Compliance” provides all personnel the ability to bring forward concerns that are difficult to discuss with their leaders. The Hotline to Compliance facilitates a stronger link and dialogue between the Group and Business Units. These efforts have prompted further development and improvement in the compliance system. Telenor has established Group Business Assurance as well as local Business Assurance units in the majority of its Business Units to drive continuous improvement in the supply chain in the area of responsible business conduct. These teams work to implement Telenor’s Supplier Conduct Principles and monitor suppliers. The performance of Business Units (including implementation of policies, incidents, KPIs) is reported to Group Business Assurance on a monthly basis. Group Business Assurance reports to the “HSSE Committee” which is composed of three members of the Board of Telenor Group.

Telenor Group is also engaged to combat child labour in the wider society in partnership with specialist organizations. Telenor Group`s Codes of Conduct as well as its Supplier Conduct principles states that neither Telenor nor its Suppliers shall not employ or use child labour. If any Telenor employee becomes aware of any employment situation in breach with the internal standards, the employee shall at once notify the immediate superior or any other appropriate executive. The employment situation shall straight away be remedied in the best interests of the child. In 2009 and 2010, Telenor Group`s Business Assurance has implemented a series of long-term measures to improve compliance to the Supplier Conduct Principles across the entire Group (including continuous monitoring, monthly reporting, supplier audits, risk analyses, supplier`s self assessment schemes, awareness raising, etc.). These measures secure Telenor`s continuous improvement and its efforts to eliminate child labour. In 2009, Telenor Group has entered into a five-year an agreement with UNICEF Norway to combat child labour in Bangladesh through a combination of activities targeting working children, social workers and society at large. Together, Telenor Group and UNICEF will target over 12,000 child workers each year in six cities in Bangladesh. Telenor’s funds covers more than 4000 children per year, as well as outreach to around 600 families. Taking a holistic approach, the project comprises three key elements: educating children, educating social workers, and educating society.

Telenor Group has several ongoing global as well as local initiatives to create a safe and inclusive working environment (e.g. “Open Mind” and “Open Mind Integration” programs in Norway). The “Open Mind” programme is a well-regarded trainee programme for people with physical disabilities. Since the start approximately 175 people have participated in the programme in Norway. The goal of the Open Mind programme is to provide people with physical disabilities with a lever to move into the regular labour market. In this way, Telenor contributes to bringing about change in the general attitude towards people with disabilities, as well as enabling them to integrate into working life. The Open Mind programme is also established in Telenor Sweden and Telenor Pakistan. In 2010, a new pilot project, “Open Mind Integration”, was initiated in Telenor Norway. Based on the same principles of opening up the labour market to people who meet barriers getting entry, it focuses on highly educated immigrants.
