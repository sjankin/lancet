2010 Communication on Progress Communication on Progress Year: 2010 STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT In 2011 we decided to joint the United Nations Global Compact, an important step in our efforts to evolve and meet this challenge. A year before we also subscribed the “International NGOs Commitment to Accountability”, which underline our commitment to Transparency and Excellence. With those two commitments, we want to ensure that our NGO respects and promotes the Global Compact Principals in the areas of human rights, labour standards, environment and transparency. Our focus is on environment, although the Global Compact Principals have already been implemented in our policy and culture, and we intend to make them more visible in our day-to-day operations. As a local environmental NGO our objective is to protect the wildlife but also to inform and transfer our expertise to our stakeholders, who are mainly people living in rural areas in mountainous Greece and working in agriculture and tourism. That’s why we are committed to strengthen professionalism and skills within our personnel. Furthermore, our effort is to provide equal opportunities at all levels and prevent discrimination in all its forms. Of course we aim to minimize the environmental impact at a local level to control and reduce our waste in our offices, the Environmental Centre and the Bear and Wolf Sanctuaries, to protect the ecosystems in Greece and the Balkans by controlling permanently our actions and by using new technologies to ensure stability and safety for our personnel and the local communities. All above confirm our commitment to nature and society and we promise to continue our work and to achieve the highest standards in the forthcoming years. Yannis Boutaris President 2 Communication on Progress Year: 2010 FURTHER INFORMATION ON ARCTUROS ARCTUROS was founded in 1992 and is a non-profit, non-governmental Organisation (NGO) based in Thessaloniki, Greece. The aim of the society is to promote the study, management and conservation of the natural environment and wildlife. The society’s activities initially focused on the brown bear (Ursus arctos), since conservation of this species allowed for the global management of the mountainous ecosystems of Greece, especially in the northern part of the country. Since 1997 however, the activities of ARCTUROS have been expanded to include the conservation of large carnivores and large mammals in general, as well as the conservation of mountain and forest ecosystems in Greece and the Balkans. After 19 years of continuous operation ARCTUROS can boast of important achievements in the conservation of the natural environment in Greece and the Balkans. Since 1992 ARCTUROS has: 1.

Implemented special research activities and projects to monitor wildlife in Greece and the Balkans. Species targeted include mainly mammals as the bear, wolf, lynx, otter, deer, chamois and numerous birds. Projects have been carried out with local partners in Albania, FYR Macedonia, Bulgaria and Serbia. 6. Since its establishment ARCTUROS has been exerting political pressure to solve serious environmental issues, such as:  the case of the construction of the Egnatia highway – a highway that dissects the core range of brown bears in Greece  the improvement of the compensation system of the Hellenic Agriculture Insurance Organisation  the promotion and adoption of special solutions for the more effective management of bears and wolfs in the country 7.
