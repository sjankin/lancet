Moreover, it emphasises as emphatically as possible the commitment of MOTOR OIL to create value by showing due respect for People, the Environment and Society, and to report its initiatives and achievements in these areas. The Environmental and Social Report 2010, which covers the period between 1 January and 31 December 2010, is an effort to honestly and methodically document the actions taken by the Group in tackling the material challenges we face. Building on the systematic work, begun in 2007, of aligning the contents with international standards, it has been enriched with additional quantitative data, highlighting the progress MOTOR OIL is making in applying the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility. The Report includes summary information about the Group’s consolidated financial results, comprising the results of all subsidiary and affiliated companies, about which detailed information is available in the Annual Financial Report 2010. The main sections of the Report focus on MOTOR OIL’s corporate responsibility practices and records in detail the relative issues managed by the company in the areas of Corporate Governance, Corporate Strategy, Communication with Stakeholders, Human Resources management, Health and Safety, Environmental Protection and Social Contribution. In addition, where appropriate and as indicated in the body of the report, the information presented includes data for the subsidiary Groups of AVIN OIL and CORAL, as well as for the affiliated companies CORAL GAS and OFC that are controlled by MOTOR OIL, and whose operations have a significant impact on the material issues affecting the sustainable growth of the Group. The terms “Group” and “MOTOR OIL Group” refer to the MOTOR OIL Group and its subsidiary Groups and companies AVIN OIL, CORAL, CORAL GAS and OFC, which together make up the MOTOR OIL GROUP. The term “company” refers to the parent company MOTOR OIL, the terms “other companies” or “remaining companies” refer to the abovementioned subsidiaries, while the term “marketing companies” again refers to these subsidiaries except of OFC. Global Reporting Initiative – UN Global Compact We have been systematically guided in our choice of subjects covered in the Environmental and Social Report 2010 -as we have been since the 2007 editionby the G3 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), as well as the ten principles of the UN’s Global Compact. At the end of the report, correlation tables provide cross-references between individual GRI indicators, and the Global Compact principles, and the sections or pages of this report where they are covered.

By consistently and effectively pursuing its strategy, MOTOR OIL has succeeded in continuously expanding its sales, while its profitability is unavoidably being impacted by the particular conditions prevailing in the global crude oil and petroleum products markets, the international oil refining margins, the euro/dollar parity, as well as the conditions shaping the domestic fuel market. 2008 2009 2010 Domestic Market Public Power Corporation Export Market Marine-Aviation Bunkering Q MOTOR OIL’s sales for 2010 exceeded 9 million metric tons MOTOR OIL Sales by Product Group (x103 Mt) for the third consecutive year, and its products continued to be distributed into the three markets in which it 9,510 9,742 9,321 operates (domestic, export and marine-aviation bunkering) through a robust network of sales, and long-standing relations with its customers. The quantities supplied to each of these markets are determined by the relevant demand, but also by the company’s aim of supplying its products to the markets that offer the highest margins. In volume, sales for 2010 came to 9.7 million metric tons (a new all-time high), compared to 9.5 in 2009. The sales data indicate the company’s strong export-oriented activity: export sales in 2010 (including marine-aviation bunkering) to over than 48 countries, constituted 66.7% of the total, and were 12.4% higher than in 2009.

A STATE-OF-THE-ART AND HIGHLY FLEXIBLE REFINERY New Crude Distillation Unit In May 2010, the new Crude Distillation Unit was commissioned, completing an important cycle of the company’s structural (organic) development. This unit reinforces the company’s competitive position in the market and improves its profitability. Besides, it is not to be set aside that economic strength is a substantial component of Corporate Social Responsibility, and a prerequisite for facilitating the implementation of programmes in its other aspects. The Vice Chairman of the Group, Mr. John V. Vardinoyannis, commented on the occasion of the commissioning of the unit: “We are investing in cutting-edge technology projects, adopting the strictest standards of safety and environmental protection, making MOTOR OIL one of the most advanced and competitive companies in the south-eastern Mediterranean region. The new unit is an important investment for the company, as well as for our country, as it contributes to increasing domestic production, thus improving Greece’s energy balance”. 10 ENVIRONMENTAL and SOCIAL REPORT 2010 I.

At the refinery, blood donations are organised in partnership with the Korinthos General Hospital, while at the head offices of MOTOR OIL, donations are organised in partnership with the ‘’Metaxa’’ Oncology Hospital. Blood donations by employees of MOTOR OIL has become a tradition, now with a 25-year history. The resulting blood reserves are used to cover the needs of the blood donors themselves, their families or close relatives, and other people, in the event of an emergency. One hundred and thirty four units of blood were donated during 2010 and the total number donated since 1991 is 2,695. Football and basketball teams To promote and improve the team and participation spirit in employees, we encourage their participation in sporting activities. Following an employee’s initiative, company football teams have been established for many years, taking part with great success and many distinctions in established corporate games. Moreover, the AVIN OIL basketball team was formed and played in 2010. In 2010, for the second successive year, the MOTOR OIL employees’ football team came third among 40 teams in the amateur Athens corporate games Football League. In 2008, for the 13th sequential year, it earned first place in the championship, in which it has participated for 18 consecutive years, having won eight ‘’doubles’’ (Championship and Cup), five Championships, one Cup and two Ethos Cups. Its competitive performance has been equally impressive abroad, as it won the World Corporate Championship in 2004 and the European Corporate Games Tournament in 2003 and 2005. In 2010, the equivalent AVIN OIL football team came third in the 8-a-side Corporate Championship among 14 teams, while in 2009 won the “double” (Championship and Cup), among 28 teams.

Responsibility Towards Our Employees Health and Safety Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control We continuously seek to implement best practice in the identification of hazards to health or to safety in our workplaces, and to apply practices and procedures to eliminate them or to mitigate the risk of harm. The framework for hazard identification and control is provided by Greek legislation (Presidential Decree 17/1996) and by other European and international codes of practice. Q Systematic risk assessment studies have been carried out for all jobs, all workplaces and all hazard types within the refinery site and appropriate measures to eliminate hazards -or to control risks to acceptable levelshave been taken. Whenever changes are made to workplaces or to working practices, these risk assessments are reviewed so as always to be up-to-date. In order to align practices with the requirements of OHSAS certification, these procedures underwent a further process of systematisation. Within each refinery section, occupational hazards and risks identified are classified into three categories according to the hazard level: low, medium or high. For each hazard category, a schedule for the completion of measures to eliminate hazards, or to reduce risk to as low as practicable, is determined as follows: • Low risk: measures to be put into effect within one year. • Medium risk: measures to be put into effect within six months. • High risk: measures to be put into effect within one week. Personal responsibility for completion of these actions is allocated, and compliance with these schedules is monitored by the Health, Safety and Environment Section, while senior management is accordingly kept informed. ployees and any sub-contractor personnel who may be involved in work activities on the refinery site.

Emergency Response Plans Our emergency response arrangements are based on the Emergency Response Plan, which is regularly reviewed and updated to take account of expansions and other changes to the refinery’s configuration changing legal requirements, and changes to “best practices” resulting from technical developments or experience gained by others in dealing with major or non-major accidents. We have also prepared and submitted studies to the competent authorities, in line with the requirements of the SEVESO II EU Directive, which describe significant potential accident scenarios and related prevention and confrontation measures. The Emergency Response Plan describes, with particular reference to a major accident situation, the public health protection measures -including warnings for neighbouring communities, and related advicethat would be put into effect in the event that the Major Accidents Response Plans were activated; these plans are drafted by the competent authorities and determine how the state might intervene in emergency situations. 42 ENVIRONMENTAL and SOCIAL REPORT 2010 II.

MANAGING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS – ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES MOTOR OIL, in striving to continuously improve its environmental performance, over and above consistent legal compliance, implements a programme of measures for the prevention and response to the environmental impacts that are unavoidably associated with its operations. An important tool in this endeavour is the measurement, regular evaluation of results of, and the systematic assessment of the environmental impacts at all stages of the production process. This assessment is based on a set of criteria -including legislative requirements and stakeholder viewswhich lead to the classification of impacts according to their significance and their characterisation as significant or non-significant. This classification procedure is also carried out whenever there are any changes to the refinery’s configuration, re-evaluating the classification and characterisation of the impacts.

ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENTS AND EXPENSES The company’s investment policy is oriented towards producing products that comply with European quality specifications, using technologies that minimize environmental impacts, and towards capital investments aiming at improving and enhancing the refinery’s environmental performance. Between 2000 and 2010, the Group realised a massive investment project, totalling 1,166.3 million euros (as shown in the table below), the major part of which related to the construction of the new Crude Distillation Unit with its peripheral facilities, which was commissioned in May 2010, as well as the Hydrocracker complex, and its associated facilities, which produces “clean fuels” (i.e. of low sulphur content) satisfying the EU specifications that came into force on 1.1.2009. Investments in “clean fuels” absorbed 39.2% of total capital investment, while investments for the further improvement of environmental performance absorbed an additional 14.3%. In total, environment-related investments amounted to 624.1 million euros, or 53.5% of the total investment programme. In 2010, total investments amounted to 123.2 million euros, of which 33.0 million euros (26.8% of the total) concerned projects whose main purpose was the improvement and protection of the environment.

A programme of gradual upgrades to the refinery’s furnaces involving the adoption of the forced-draft technology -which increases the efficiency by more than 6%is in place, while a similar programme applies to the replacement of existing burners with more energy-efficient units, which emit lower levels of nitrogen oxides (low-NOx burners). For example, in 2007, the upgrading of the pre-heat furnace of the Crude Distillation Unit (the largest furnace on the refinery complex), resulted in the heat efficiency to be increased from 80% to 87%, and in the subsequent fuel consumption reduction by approximately one ton per hour.

Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) A modern refinery comprises lots of different types of installed equipment, through which large quantities of crude oil and feedstock circulate, as well as intermediates and final products. In such a system, it is to be expected that there will be particular points with a higher risk of hydrocarbons being accidentally released into the atmosphere. In order to contain such fugitive emissions from equipment, a programme of periodic checks of selected equipment points is implemented for detecting fugitive emissions and immediately repairing the leaks causing these emissions. In the industry, this is known as Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) Programme, and is based on the EPA 21 method of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Fugitive emissions may arise from valves, pumps, flanges, safety valves and other related equipment installed on pipelines, pressure vessels, reactors or storage tanks on the site. In 2010, the LDAR programme at MOTOR OIL’s refinery included 5,721 predetermined control points, covering all production units, the Truck Loading Terinals, port facilities, storage tanks and oil separators. These points are regularly checked by refinery personnel, at least once a year, the frequency depending on the process being controlled, using portable volatile hydrocarbon concentration measurement equipment. In the event that concentrations are found to exceed 5,000 ppm, a repair request for the equipment checked is issued. In 2010, 14,063 checks were carried out as a result of which 65 points (1.1 %) were detected, requiring some sort of intervention. Q In 2010, in the context of the anticipated by the new environmental operational standards, a series of industrial hygiene measurements were carried out at the refinery to determine the atmospheric concentrations of the following substances: arsenic, cadmium, nickel, mercury, benzo-¿-pyrene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The results of these measurements indicated that ambient concentrations of these pollutants are well below maximum allowable concentrations specified in relevant legislation. 62 ENVIRONMENTAL and SOCIAL REPORT 2010 III.

Responsibility for the Environment 11. WATER MANAGEMENT The importance of the sustainable management of water resources is a major issue of our time, because the supply of this natural resource is constantly under threat of shortage, underlined by the more and more frequent and prolonged periods of droughts. We recognise this reality, and we take steps to reduce water consumption, and ensure its rational and responsible management at the refinery. Water used in various process operations at the refinery is sourced through the processing of sea water at desalination units. The desalination facilities have been supplemented by the addition of two units of the reverse osmosis technology -which is the optimum desalination technique both in terms of economic efficiency and environmental impactas a result of which the refinery’s requirements are almost fully covered, and the need to import fresh water has been practically eliminated. Thus, while it was necessary to import 125 thousand m3 of water in 2007, this requirement fell to below 10 thousand in each of the following two years, while in 2010, due to the refinery expansion that took place, an additional 82 thousand m3 of water had to be imported. It should be noted that following the commissioning of the Hydrocracker complex in November 2005, the quantity of water consumed per ton of raw material processed increased to 0.402 in 2006. Subsequently, this ratio reduced steadily (with an exception in 2008 when increased to 0.391, due to the extensive preparation of equipment during the large preventive maintenance programme in that year), falling noticeably in 2010 to 0.287; this extremely good result is attributable to work done to reduce energy consumption (reduced steam consumption, operational efficiencies, etc.).

Particular importance was placed on the re-building of two churches which had suffered great damage -Aghios Giorgis and Panagitsaas well as on the reconstruction of the village square. The successful and speedy completion of the project within the set time frame, was due to the constant monitoring of its progress and, to a large degree, to the continuous communication with the inhabitants and the competent local authorities, which facilitated and accelerated the reconstruction process.

It is the second shipwreck dating from the Late Copper Period to be found by HIMA in Greek seas, following systematic underwater archaeological research, and is considered to be of major importance, because it dates from a period of radical re-structuring of the Mycenaean world, the period which followed the decline and fall of Mycenaean palaces.

Corinth area In 2010, we contributed to many cultural events, assisting the work of local associations, which offer traditional dancing courses and theatre workshops, organise concerts and theatrical performances, thus having a part in promoting the cultural level of the region. Concert by the “Mikis Theodorakis” Orchestra For the eighth consecutive year, since the beautiful 1,600-seat open-air theatre was inaugurated in Examilia, Corinth, and named after the renowned Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis, the Lysippeion Cultural Centre of the Corinth Prefecture organised a large popular music concert featuring the «Mikis Theodorakis» Orchestra. The 2010 concert took place on 31 July. MOTOR OIL sponsors this event each year. The purpose of this ongoing sponsorship is to pay tribute to the invaluable musical heritage of Mikis Theodorakis, who -apart from his enormous symphonic workhas also composed ninety four song cycles originating from the roots of Greek popular tradition, that promote poetry in a simple and authentic way. In addition, the company supports this particular orchestra, which, for many years, under the composer’s supervision, has presented major productions, cooperated with renowned artists, musicians and singers, and has travelled throughout the world, promoting the power of Mikis Theodorakis’ music. The 2010 concert was dedicated to Vassilis Tsitsanis, the “patriarch” of rebetika music. Two very distinctive, yet different, musical worlds. Two artists who have worthily served Greece’s popular music, each in his own way and in his own musical style, with popular music as their meeting point, in terms of sources and influences. The distinguished singers, Vassilis Lekkas, Calliope Vetta, Doros Dimosthenous and Panayotis Petrakis, undertook to present this performance of seemingly inconsonant songs by the two great artists, presenting a superb programme, which thrilled and uplifted their audience. 82 ENVIRONMENTAL and SOCIAL REPORT 2010 IV.
