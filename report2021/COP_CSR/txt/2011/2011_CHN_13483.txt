All such changes have resulted in huge challenges to the survival and development of enterprises. How should we cope with these challenges to realize sustainable development of the enterprise? This is a problem that all enterprises must face. As a responsible enterprise, especially as an industry leader, we should act as the spearhead of the time. We should reflect: how should we make the industry more harmonious and healthy? How can we let the society and mankind share the results from the developments in the industry? Since September 22, 1982 when CIMC was put into production, through 28 years’ development, CIMC has already become a multi-dimensional Group with global operation, and has become leading and even No. 1 in the world in several sectors, thus laying a solid foundation for achieving Group’s vision of “becoming a world-class enterprise”. Amidst its rapid development, CIMC has deeply realized that fulfilling CSR and taking the path of intensive development are necessary conditions for following the scientific outlook on development, participating in international competition and realizing the goal of CIMC to become a world class enterprise. In 2010, the container sector, as one of the core businesses of the Group, came out of the gloom of global industry depression in 2009, and realized a major reversion in operation performance. At the same time, rapid development has been realized in related businesses of the Group in vehicles and energy and chemistry so that historic breakthroughs have been made in overall operation performance of the Group. Meanwhile, the Group has done proactive exploration in bearing corporate social responsibilities and realizing sustainable development: innovating the business model by combining industry and finance, to better serve clients; build a “Dream Work” and seek breakthrough in energy conservation, environmental protection and labor use of the industry by upgrading of manufacturing technology; deepen and implement the “people-centered” idea and seek co-development of enterprises and employees; vigorously promote the activity on the theme of “safe and lean production” to ensure employees’ personal safety, among others. There is a kind of mutualism among enterprise, environment and society. While creating better economic performance, the enterprise must be responsible to stakeholders, society and environment. Looking forward to the future, the CIMC will continue to follow the guideline of “continuous improvement and leading the sustainable development of the industry”, conscientiously fulfill the promises of a responsible industry leader, serve the society wholeheartedly and make progress together with the society. 6 CIMC 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report Chapter One CIMC Overview I.

VIII. Analysis of risks and opportunities 1. Risks: Though growth has re-appeared in global economy, the path to economic recovery was not even, and obvious disequilibrium has appeared in the recovery of major economies. The recovery of developed economies is still subject to the risk of downturn, and the slow speed of growth is inadequate to reduce the high unemployment rate. Economies in the emerging market and developing economies are confronted with increasing pressure of inflation, and the problem of how to prevent economy becoming overheated and manage capital inflow. As far as Chinese economy is 9 CIMC 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report concerned, domestically, it will be confronted with rising inflation pressure and long-term challenges such as industrial structure adjustment and upgrading, energy conservation and emission reduction, and improving income distribution layout; overseas it will be confronted with many challenges such as drop of overseas demand, appreciation of RMB and more complicated international and geopolitical gaming. Following the footsteps of strategic adjustment of the Chinese economic structure, the manufacturing industry where CIMC is in is confronted with a series of issues such as how to improve productivity, improve working conditions, save resources and protect the environment. The fluctuation and rise of price of energy and materials may also erode the company’s profit. In terms of container business segment, the uncertainty of global economic recovery and the rebalancing of the global trade structure may affect the global trade volume, thus reducing the demand for containers. The shipping industry is confronted with the following risks: 1) new ships are delivered in a concentrated manner, and the speed of increase of cargo volume cannot catch up with the increase of transporting capacity, thus affecting the freightage; 2) the rising tendency of oil price under inflation and geopolitical fluctuation; 3) rise of rental and port charges of container ships and containers; these are also risks giving rise to the fluctuation of container demand. In terms of energy, chemical and food equipment segment, the instability of related state industrial policies exerts huge influence on business development, as the development of chemical equipment is closely related to macroeconomic cycles. With the increase of competitors, competition is fiercer than before, and market shares are exposed to the risk of being squeezed. Exported products are also exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuation. In terms of road transportation vehicle business, as economic recovery in the mainstream developed economies is still at the preliminary state in 2011, it is estimated that the probability of substantial growth of demand is not big. In the domestic market, on the basis of high-speed growth last year, the growth speed may decline with the gradual withdrawal of the state policies for economic stimulation. Besides, the constraints on the development of the auto industry by resources, environment and transportation are gradually intensifying, and the impact of railway construction on freight transport of main highways will also bring risk to demand for transportation vehicles. In terms of offshore equipment segment, offshore equipments are products of high input and high risks, with high requirements on construction facilities and experience, fund and R & D strength. There is still a gap between the manufacturing level of offshore equipments in China and that of Singapore and South Korea with more mature manufacturing technologies and that of the United States and Europe with stronger R & D and engineering capabilities. With the incorporation of offshore engineering into the “strategic emerging industries” and winning policy support, more traditional ship building enterprises at the downturn cycle will be transformed to offshore equipment manufacturing, which will intensify industry competition. 2. Opportunities: Global economic recovery will continue in 2011. According to the estimation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the actual growth rate of global GDP is expected to reach 3.7% 10 CIMC 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report in 2010. According to the estimation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the growth of global trade volume in 2011 will reach 8.3%. In terms of the growth prospect of emerging and developing economies, the economies headed by China will continue to grow rapidly with the double support of recovery of internal demand market and external demand market. The growing economic recovery also gives more market opportunities to the development of CIMC. At the same time, the risk of downturn of world economy, and adjustment of China’s economic structure have raised requirements on CIMC’s continuing industry upgrading, optimization of contents, upgrading ability and marching towards a world class enterprise. In terms of container business segment, against the backdrop of continuous stable recovery of global economy and trade, it is estimated that the container demand will continue to improve in 2011. According to the forecast of the authoritative agency Clarkson, it is estimated that the growth rate of global container trade volume will be 9.7% in 2011. From this it is estimated that the global container demand in 2011 will increase as compared to that in 2010. In terms of road transportation vehicle business, overseas market demand is expected to continue to recover. Driven by popularization and implementation of European IV Standard, largescale construction of and investment in downstream high-speed rails, water conservancy facilities and subsidized housing and policy factors, the Chinese market demand is expected to continue the positive growth trend in 2010. In terms of energy, chemical and food equipment business, the low-carbon trend in the world and the requirements of the Chinese government on energy conservation and emission reduction provide large space of demand for energy-conserving and environmentally friendly equipment in the Chinese market. With the further acceleration of industrialization and urbanization in China, there will be substantial growth in energy demand, especially natural gas demand, which will in turn drive the substantial growth in demand of natural gas storage and transportation equipment and engineering service business. During the period of the “Twelfth Five-Year Plan”, China will reconstruct a group of large-scale refineries and fertilizer plants and construct several ethane and aromatic hydrocarbon production bases. Besides, the start of new technologies such as CTL, coal gasification combined cycle generation and COREX and hydrogen energy will bring new demand growth to the chemical equipment industry. China attaches importance to the economic growth mode of driving growth by consumption, which will bring opportunities of growth to the food equipment segment. In terms of offshore equipment business, driven by factors such as recovery of global crude oil demand and rising of oil price, all countries stepping up efforts in offshore oil exploration and development, Mexico Gulf Leak and upgrading, investment in the offshore equipment field will enter a new round of boom in the world. It is estimated that the market demand of global offshore platform will continue to improve in 2011. The “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” for offshore equipment to be launched by the Chinese government and the reinvigorating planning for strategic emerging industries will bring unprecedented opportunities to the offshore equipment manufacturing industry in China. 11 CIMC 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report Chapter Two Fulfill Social Responsibilities to Promote Comprehensive, Coordinated and Sustainable Development of Economy, Society and Environment Section One Economic responsibilities I.

Section Three Environment Responsibilities XI. Concern about global environmental protection and resource saving, and construct a beautiful and harmonious society As an industry leader supplying products to the global market with global resource allocation, the Company always places the social responsibility for environmental protection and resources conservation on an important position of corporate development. To lead the industry’s sustainable development, we have been making great efforts to achieve harmonious co-existence between economic growth and ecological environment. (i) Implement the environment management system, improve the environment management regulations, and improve the environment assessment system With reference to the ISO14000 environment management system, CIMC has gradually set up environment management organization from 2005 to 2010, constructing and improving the environmental target performance assessment system and environmental management regulations. By issuing the “Group Environmental Management Planning” and the “Organic Waste gas Processing Guidance”, and introducing the “Index Assessment System of Environmental Management of CIMC Manufacturing Enterprises” and the “Index Assessment System of Energy Saving and Consumption Reduction of CIMC Manufacturing Enterprises” to the assessment system of the enterprise, CIMC has gradually increased the proportion of these two index systems. 42 CIMC 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report Appropriate environmental protection assessment system has been adopted to evaluate enterprises’ environmental performance and to improve their environmental management. By 2010, 18 enterprises had passed the assessment of “three simultaneous” environmental protection and five enterprises have passed the ISO14001 environmental management system certification. (ii) Increase investment in environmental protection and treatment CIMC had invested more than RMB 300 million by the end of 2010. From 2005 to 2010, investment had amounted to RMB 180.38 million in processing waste gas and waste water, and RMB 41.88 million in purchasing equipments for welding smoke and dust treatment and noise control. The investment in environmental protection in 2010 was about RMB 58 million. (iii) Use innovative technological means, develop new environmentally friendly and energy conserving products, and realize environmental protection and energy saving in manufacturing process 1. Develop new environmentally friendly and energy conserving products (1) Reefer container with zero damage to ozonosphere CIMC has incorporated the most advanced container technology and environmental protection concept. In 2006, it successfully developed environment-friendly containers with the cyclopentane foaming technology, which does not cause damage to the ozone layer; also cyclopentane material, which is less costly, but with better bubble forming and insulation, is a dual environment friendly material In 2010, according to the centralized deployment of the national and industrial 141B elimination plan, CIMC decided to carry out cyclopentane foaming production line reconstruction on the reefer container plant in Shanghai. At present, the Group has completed the related technical scheme and approved of the feasibility analysis, and the equipment model selection and project bidding will follow. (2) High-strength light-weight container and light-weight vehicles CIMC has taken the lead to adopt high-strength steel in container and vehicle products by working together with iron and steel enterprises, starting with the design and research. The company has also promoted the design of light structure and application of new materials. Lightweight containers and special vehicles have been developed, which have not only decreased in dead weight but also saved many raw materials. In particular, the dead weight of high-strength light-weight dry cargo containers decreases by 5% and material cost reduces by 5%, while the requirement on strength is met. Such containers are also conducive to resource conservation and load capacity expansion. With the advanced technique of reinforcement stainless steel, for a 50m3 liquid storage tank, steel consumption is saved by 30%. With the advantages of high standardization, light dead weight, large load capacity, excellent safety performance and low energy consumption, the ultra-light vehicles can reduce steel consumption by over 100,000 tons and increase transportation of 24 billion ton kilometers cargoes each year, which equals to reducing CO2 emissions by 920 thousand tons. (Note: the calculation is based on The Handbook on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Conserving Energy). In its whole cycle life, 43 CIMC 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report the vehicle can save fuel by 32 thousand tons and reduce the CO2 emission by 11.9 tons each year (3) Container modular buildings Container modular building refers to a new kind of building pre-built (including household electrical appliances, furnishings, etc.) with special-sized container steel-structure in the plant and then transported and assembled on site. The modular building is based on the steel structure in design, and the modules can be dismantled and recycled. The steel material in the module also can be utilized again after tens of years’ usage. Every module is produced from the assembly line in a plant and all materials are under collective control to minimize consumption. The energy required during transportation is less than that in traditional construction methods. Also, such building features short construction period and noise and dust reduction. The walls and floor after assembly are of double layers, which result in better heat insulation and energy saving than those of traditional buildings. To sum up, the design, manufacturing and assembling on site of the modular building reflect the new concept of environmental protection, which has been accredited by Reuter's News Agency as a great innovation in the history of construction of the recent century, representing one of the developmental trends of future housing. In May 2010, CIMC successfully won an exclusive strategic supply contract for five-year camp housing of the BHPB Western Australian Iron Ore Project Department, and CIMC is to supply residential housing and related supporting public facilities for about 10 thousand people of the BHPB Western Australian Iron Ore Project, which is a new milestone of CIMC’s modular housing business, symbolizing that CIMC has formally become a mainstream supplier of the Australian camp housing market. (4) The environment friendly container project in World Expo 2010 Shanghai CIMC Nantong has been involved in the project of environmental friendly containers since 2006. The Company has independently developed the environmental friendly container, with autodoor and high water-tightness requirement, which effectively reduces secondary pollution during transportation. Nantong CIMC was listed in the first group of major suppliers of environment friendly containers for World Expo Shanghai. 2. Develop environment friendly coating, to solve a key problem of sustainable development of the industry In 2003, CIMC set up the first laboratory of waterborne paint in the industry. Together with the suppliers, CIMC has successfully developed waterborne paint containers. By 2009, the trial production of waterborne paint containers was carried out successfully on a small scale, making a breakthrough in the field. The waterborne paint replaces the traditional organic solvent (such as lacquer thinner, containing hazardous materials such as formaldehyde and benzene). It has the advantages of safety and environmental protection. The development and application of waterborne paint is a technical breakthrough in the industry of container manufacturing, which can greatly reduce the emission of VOC and thoroughly solve the problem of waste gas pollution of paint. In January 2010, the first reconstruction of waterborne paint spray production line was carried out in CIMC Taicang. A small experiment of 100 containers was carried out, probing into a large amount of experimental data, which laid a solid foundation for the manufacturing of waterborne 44 CIMC 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report paint containers in the next step. On this basis, the CIMC Dalian Plant started the waterborne paint container production line reconstruction project in May, and the project design scheme was completed within the year, including two sets of technical schemes, double-layer and triple-layer; at the end of July 2010, the project technical scheme review meeting was completed; at the end of September, the cooperation design institute completed the production line reconstruction design scheme; in November, the project reconstruction project was formally started, and the project is now under construction; it is estimated that batch trial production of waterborne paint containers can be realized in March 2011. This project symbolizes that the environment friendly product that CIMC has been developing for 8 years will be launched to the market. 3. Environmental protection and energy saving in manufacturing process (1) Container “Dream Work” The approval and preliminary implementation of the CIMC Container “Dream Work” adumbrated the birth of a brand new, advanced and automatic container manufacturing plant, and also signified a solid and forceful step forward in the upgrading of the CIMC Group manufacturing technologies. In the design scheme of the “Dream Work”, on the basis of summarizing many years’ advanced container manufacturing technologies, the advanced technologies and experiences of auto manufacturing plants have been extensively introduced, which have been digested and improved. Not only has the part automatic processing center been further optimized, the automatic elements of the whole production line will be substantially increased. The goal of the “Dream Work” is to created a “five-best” enterprise in the industry, that is: S: best safe operating environment in the industry (safety); E: best energy conservation and consumption reduction in the industry (environmental protection); Q: best process equipment quality in the industry (quality); R best delivery response efficiency in the industry (response); C: best assets profitability in the industry (cost). (2) Reducing the emission of waste gas and dust CIMC has invested to build an automatic paint spraying system, which transforms the paint production line from high pollution, high consumption and low efficiency to high efficiency, energy conversation, and low emission of waste gas. This system can reduce the total amount of waste gas emission by 300 thousand m3/h and paint consumption by 25 thousand tons each year. In 2007, CIMC invested nearly RMB 100 million Yuan to develop the patented technology of treating organic waste gas by adsorption, desorption and catalytic combustion purification, making the waste gas treatment in container manufacturing companies meet national environmental standards, with a reduction of 12,000 tons emissions of organic waste. In 2010, CIMC successfully adopted the technology of organic waste paint solvent recovery, which can recycle the waste gas of painting in production process. For container manufacturing enterprises alone, over 7,000 tons of organic solvent can be recycled each year. CIMC also cooperates with domestic experts in the smoke and soot control field and has launched the project of comprehensive welding soot treatment. By adopting the high-tech ventilation and air conditioning system and air-purifying system, the problem of welding soot has been solved thoroughly. 45 CIMC 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report (3) Recycling treatment of wastewater Advanced wastewater treatment process has been adopted, which has not only controlled the discharge of industrial wastewater, but also made good use of the treated water for cleaning and greening, realizing recycling of water resources (4) Noise control Noise control at work site has been greatly improved by using sound-absorbing materials, improving component processing accuracy, and changing the means of workpiece transmission. In 2010, CIMC set up a major project in research on noise control, and noises outside workshops and within plants were studied. The method of sound insulation is adopted for outside workshops, sound reverberation cancellation supplemented by sound insulation is adopted for inside workshops, to reach the purpose of reducing noise and controlling noise. (iii) Future outlook CIMC has been making unremitting and conscientious efforts to fulfill its commitment as a responsible industry leader, taking initiative in terms of environmental protection and energy saving, with success. CIMC will continue to follow the principle of “being based on reality, taking initiative, sustained improving, leading the sustainable development of the industry and building a harmonious and beautiful home”, continue to improve the ISO14001 environmental management system within the whole Group, implement the environmental performance assessing system; upgrade the enterprise environmental management level; and further increase investment in environmental protection, control the pollution sources within the standards, further improve the enterprise production environment; strive to realize the renewable forest tree replacing of the container flooring board, application of waterborne paint on over 30% containers and lightweight of all container and vehicle products, and environmental friendly application on all reefer containers and building containerization in some special fields. With a view to CIMC’s industry and product features, we will continue to introduce and develop more advanced environmentfriendly and energy-saving techniques and products, spearheading the sustainable development of the industry We have only one earth. In face of the global environmental deterioration and resource shortage, CIMC is firmly convinced that mankind is able and obliged to solve these problems. Let us join hands and take action to build a beautiful and harmonious home, and to create a better future together. China International Marine Containers (Group) Ltd. March 2011 46
