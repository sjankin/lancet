Imagine the result Leadership BALANCE growth Annual report 2010 Imagine the result Our mission is to improve quality of life around the world by creating places of distinction and providing sustainable solutions that enhance the built and natural environments. In doing so, we produce exceptional value for our clients, employees, shareholders and society. Leadership, Balance, Growth Our updated strategy bears the title: Leadership, Balance, Growth. Leadership represents our goal to be recognized as a leading company “in each of our markets”; Balance reflects our commitment to leaving the environments, the places and the lives we touch better than we found them; and Growth not only signals our aspiration to increase the size of our business and market share, but also the development of our people. ARCADIS differentiates itself from competitors in two main ways. The first is our unswerving focus on solving our clients’ challenges. The second is our commitment to making the world a better place. This first differentiator helps us in our day-to-day professional lives, and the second motivates to a higher purpose. We believe in both. The work we do helps to put the world in balance. In striving to improve quality of life we seek to strike a balance between the built and natural environments, the creative and the functional, the innovative and the proven, and between imagination and results. We achieve balance by taking a long-term view of our activities, while providing value to our clients in the short-term. This means we conduct our business on a client basis rather than on a project basis as we foster long-term relationships with select multinational, and key national and local clients who appreciate the value-added services we provide.

In the United States, the economic recovery resulted in an increasing demand for environmental services, while in Chile and particularly Brazil, the strong economy pushed demand in the mining and energy sectors. The resulting growth was offset by Europe, where all countries except Germany saw a revenue decline, mainly due to lower demand from local governments. RTKL recovered strongly with growth in the second half, benefiting from attractive healthcare and commercial property markets in Asia and the Middle East. Growth in net revenue was somewhat ahead of growth in gross revenue, caused by the completion at the end of 2009 of a hydropower project in Brazil with substantial subcontracting. The growth from acquisitions came mainly from Malcolm Pirnie. The currency impact of 4% resulted from a weaker euro against most other currencies. Geographical mix and portfolio The geographical mix shifted towards the United States, caused by the consolidation of Malcolm Pirnie for a full year and by a stronger U.S. dollar. In addition, gross revenues in the United States and Rest of the World grew Annual Report 2010 Report by the Executive Board 21 organically, while Europe saw organic declines, with gross € 114.4 million).

In 2010, amortization was the 10.2% that was achieved in 2009. Excluding the impact from at € 6.3 million, somewhat lower than in 2009 (€ 7.2 million). the Brazilian energy projects and the sale of carbon credits, the underlying margin came out at 10.0%, in line with our target.

As Recurring the water market is affected by delays in government programs and lower local spending, we are expanding services to industrial clients. In environment, the decline in local work was partly offset by more private sector work and by a € 10 million contract for project management services for the remediation of asbestos roads at 1,000 different locations. The buildings market was impacted by less spending from governments and institutions, including education and health care. With several recently added clients, the outlook for facility management services is positive. Margin remains at good level At 9.8%, margins remained at a good level. The reduced profitability compared to last year was caused by project losses in Water and price pressure due to increased competition.

In the United Kingdom, the buildings market stabilized, with revenues 08 28.3 still declining, but less than in 2009. Environment also saw declining revenues, 07 22.6 as several large projects which were finished could not be replaced by new 06 18.8 contracts in time. The U.K.-based activities of RTKL recovered strongly, mostly Recurring because of work coming from the Middle East. In France and Belgium we suffered from reduced spending in local markets and lower demand for building services, but it is expected that PPP initiatives will generate work as of 2011. In Belgium the market for industrial services recovered in the second half of the year, while we benefitted in the French environmental market from increased private sector demand. Pressure on government budgets led to unexpected delays in major road projects in Poland. The rail infrastructure market held up. In the Czech Republic, infrastructure growth was offset by declines in buildings and environment. Margins under pressure The more challenging market conditions also impacted profitability. Margins declined to 3.7%, mainly caused by reduced profitability in Belgium, Poland and the United Kingdom. In each of these countries measures were taken to adjust the organization, reduce overheads and increase efficiency. Whilst in the U.K. the buildings business recovered from the loss in 2009, the downturn in environment negatively impacted profitability.

This was driven by the 10 1,070 recovering economy which positively impacted private sector spending and 09 868 accelerated growth of environment during the year. Overall revenues increased as 08 791 a result of the merger with Malcolm Pirnie. 07 656 06 518 Integration with Malcolm Pirnie on track The first focus after the merger with Malcolm Pirnie in 2009 was on revenue synergies. This paid off as meanwhile more than $100 million in additional Ebita United States revenue was booked by combined team efforts. These synergies were realised in in € million the United States, Chile, England and the Middle East. The Malcolm Pirnie 10 80.9 integration is on track with the new combined organization being introduced by 09 68.4 the end of 2010, based on a divisional structure consistent with the global 08 56.0 business lines. The corporate functions will be integrated by mid-2011. 07 44.6 06 34.8 Environment drives growth The infrastructure market remained weak in 2010, with little impact from Recurring stimulus programs. In the water market, the New Orleans project is nearing completion, which started to impact revenues. Despite pressure on municipal budgets, Malcolm Pirnie compensated declines in the sunbelt states, by work on upgrades and expansions of existing facilities, mainly in the northeast of the country. The environmental market improved, fueled by increased private sector spending, which, combined with the start up of major projects won in 2009, generated organic growth as of the second half of the year. As these projects included significant amounts of remediation work, gross revenue growth was particularly strong. In the buildings market, project management activities declined somewhat, due to government budget pressure. With the acquisition in late 2010, of Rise International, a high level project management consultancy, we strengthened our capabilities in this field. RTKL recovering U.S. markets remained challenging for architectural businesses. The commercial market stabilized at low levels, while the healthcare market is facing delays due to ongoing uncertainty on reforms. Nevertheless, RTKL’s activities in the United States recovered, on the back of strong markets in Asia, particularly China. Overall strong performance The strong increase in EBITA resulted from the merger with Malcolm Pirnie, a positive currency impact and continued focus on cost controls. At 11.4%, the margin remained high. The strong performance in environment was offset by lower margins in other segments.

Gross revenue growth lagged behind as a 10 202 major hydropower project in Brazil with substantial subcontracting was finished 09 164 by the end of 2009. The contribution from acquisitions came from the expansion 08 167 of our interest in several companies in Brazil and the acquisition of AHS, a small 07 138 architectural practice in China, specialized in medical facilities. 06 113 Mining and energy as growth drivers Growth in Brazil was largely driven by investments in mining and energy that Ebita rest of the World pushed infrastructure activities. Environment also showed substantial growth as in € million private clients increased spending on the back of a strong economy. Chile 10 17.6 showed strong growth in infrastructure and water, partly resulting from high 09 7.6 demand in mining, partly related to reconstruction efforts. In Asia, RTKL 08 23.0 benefitted from strong demand for high level architectural design, both in 07 12.5 commercial property and healthcare. 06 7.8 More focus in Brazil Recurring Based on a strategy review it was decided to bring more focus in our Brazilian operations. This means that the investment projects, developed and partly owned by ARCADIS Logos, will be divested. This concerns the portfolio of small hydropower projects and the Biogas business. The proceeds from these divestments will be used to further expand the core project management and consulting engineering activities to capitalize on the many market opportunities in Brazil. Profitability strongly improved The strong increase in EBITA came partly from a positive currency effect, but mostly from growth and improved profitability in Brazil.

Annual Report 2010 Report by the Executive Board 47 Outlook 2011 The first signs of economic recovery are visible, especially in the United States. However, the recovery is still fragile and there is still significant uncertainty as to when and to what extent this will influence the different markets in which ARCADIS is active. The economy in the U.S. and Europe is gradually recovering, driving increased private sector investments. In the public sector the crisis until now mainly affected local governments. In the meantime central governments in Europe have announced measures to balance their budgets. The same is happening in the United States. As yet it is unclear what the effect thereof will be on the economy and the markets relevant to us. Market conditions in Brazil and Chile are very favorable, while also Asia and the Middle East offer opportunities for further growth. In the infrastructure market ARCADIS works on large projects, Contracting of new GRiP® projects was delayed, but the pipeline based on multiyear programs for which financing is secured. is well filled.

Continued on next page Annual Report 2010 48 Report by the Executive Board Our order book has grown again in the fourth quarter and is now 9% above the level at the beginning of 2010. Our revised strategy provides an excellent touch stone to capitalize on the many opportunities in the market and for further expansion of activities through acquisitions. The integration with Malcolm Pirnie is on schedule. Maintaining margins remains an important priority, also in markets with price pressure. Although government austerity programs are causing uncertainty, especially in the European infrastructure market, the economic recovery has a positive impact on the environmental and buildings market, while emerging markets offer a lot of potential. That is why, on balance, we are cautiously positive about the outlook for 2011 and expect an increase of revenue and profits. This is barring unforeseen circumstances and currency effects.

This is in line with the preambles to the Code when it was first introduced, which indicates that existing contracts may be respected. II.2.8: For Executive Board members to be (re)appointed after the Code became first effective, in principle a maximum severance payment consistent with the Code is or will be included in their contracts. This applies to the members appointed to the Executive Board in 2006 and 2010. The contract of the Executive Board member appointed prior to the introduction of the Code does not contain (maximum) severance pay provisions. Consequently, in the event of involuntary dismissal, the severance payment will be determined by taking into account the relevant factors such as applicable laws and regulations, the grounds for dismissal, the level of remuneration and the legal position of the individual as determined, inter alia, by length of service at the Company. The Executive Board member appointed in November 2009 is, in case of a “not-for-cause” termination of his contract, eligible to a severance payment of eighteen months fixed (base) salary, which is in line with his employment contract at that time and justified by his longstanding tenure with ARCADIS.

If the estimated future tax deduction exceeds the amount of the related Equity cumulative share-based payment expense, the excess of the Share capital associated income tax is recognized directly in equity. Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of options are recognized as a deduction of equity, net of any tax dividends are recognized at the same time that the liability to effects. pay the related dividend is recognized. Inventories Priority shares and preference shares are classified as equity since these are non-redeemable, or only redeemable at the Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable Company’s option.

Litigation ARCADIS has global professional liability insurance coverage and in addition, has local insurance in a number of countries. In general, these insurance policies have a self-insured retention and a maximum payout level. Clients sometimes claim, justified or not, that they are not satisfied with the services provided by ARCADIS. Estimates by management and external advisors lead to an indication of the potential financial risk and whether or not that risk is covered by the insurance policies. This, in turn, determines the amount ARCADIS provides for. Other provisions In some cases, ARCADIS may extend warranties after the completion of activities. In such cases, a provision is recognized, based on estimated cash out flows. Because settlement in these cases generally takes place within a short time frame and because the amounts are relatively limited, no discounting takes place.

Capital risk management ARCADIS’ objectives when managing capital are to safeguard ARCADIS’ ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure that optimizes its cost of capital. ARCADIS sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. ARCADIS manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it based on changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. The capital structure can be altered by adjusting the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to capital providers, or issue new debt or shares. From time to time, ARCADIS purchases its own shares, which are used for issuing shares under the ARCADIS’ share option program. Consistent with the debt covenants agreed with the banks, ARCADIS monitors capital on the basis of the net debt to EBITDA ratio. This ratio is calculated as interest bearing debt minus cash and cash equivalents divided by EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the term and maturity of the contract, using market interest rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on bank valuations. These valuations are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at measurement date. For loans and receivables fair value is determined for disclosure purposes based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the company specific market rate of interest at reporting date. For financial leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at reporting date. Due to the short-term character of the receivables, the fair value equals the carrying value. ARCADIS has not applied the fair value option allowed under IFRS and does not have financial instruments which were held for trading. The only financial instruments accounted for at fair value through profit and loss are derivative financial instruments.
