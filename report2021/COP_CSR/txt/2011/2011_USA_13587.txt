Pomeroy’s Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan Committed to fulfilling our social responsibilities and striking the right balance between development and preservation to sustain our environment! 2 Introduction This Corporate Responsibility and Environmental Sustainability Plan (“Plan”) has been developed by Pomeroy for purposes of articulating the company’s commitment to fulfilling its responsibilities as a corporate citizen in the global marketplace. More specifically, with regard to the domestic and international markets that the company transacts business in, Pomeroy recognizes the importance of more formally identifying its specific corporate responsibilities, establishing initiatives to control corporate operations that intersect with these responsibilities, and, if or as appropriate, implementing a voluntary management system to measuring the company’s progress accordingly. Therefore, this Plan: 1) identifies and defines Pomeroy’s social and environmental responsibilities; 2) describes the controls, goals, standards or objectives that the company has established in furtherance of meeting such responsibilities; and, 3) documents the voluntary management system the company has implemented to measures its progress and/or achievement of positive results against the controls, goals or objectives.

Pomeroy will, at a minimum, comply with all applicable wage and hour laws and regulations, including those relating to minimum wages, overtime hours, piece rates and other elements of compensation, and provide legally mandated benefits. Working Hours. Pomeroy will not exceed prevailing local work hours and will appropriately compensate overtime. Pomeroy will not require its employees to work more than sixty (60) hours per week, including overtime, except in extraordinary business circumstances with their consent.

Consistent with these obligations, supplier must have and implement effective programs that encompass life safety, incident investigation, chemical safety, ergonomics, etc., and provide the same standard of health and safety in any housing that is provided to employees.

At a minimum, Pomeroy will comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and standards, such as requirements regarding chemical and waste management and disposal, recycling, industrial wastewater treatment and discharge, air emissions controls, environmental permits and environmental reporting. Pomeroy will also comply with any additional environmental requirements specific to the products or services that Pomeroy provides to its clients in accordance with the specifications for the applicable engagement. Pomeroy is committed to advocating, implementing and advancing environmentally friendly business initiatives. This Plan documents Pomeroy’s approach to environmental sustainability, which is aligned with the following Environmental Protection Agency guidelines: •PLAN: planning, including identifying environmental aspects and establishing goals •DO: implementing, including training and operational controls •CHECK: checking, including monitoring and corrective action •ACT: reviewing, including progress reviews and acting to make needed changes to the company’s plan concerning environmental sustainability.

POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan Confidential & Proprietary Information 2011 6 Waste Management & Recycling Pomeroy uses post-consumer recycled content products, including paper and plastic products, in its business operations. Pomeroy also recycles cardboard boxes, paper products, plastics and aluminum cans. Pomeroy established a baseline for its recycling program results in 2009 and has since implemented additional programs and practices to increase recycling activity on the company’s corporate campus. In 2010, Pomeroy added three (3) cardboard compactors to its recycling program, which increased the tonnage of cardboard boxes being recycled on Pomeroy’s corporate campus and helped Pomeroy achieve its voluntary goals accordingly. Pomeroy also facilitates the collection of plastic, aluminum cans and glass throughout its corporate campus. These recyclable products are processed for reuse by a contracted third party. The results yielded from Pomeroy’s self-assessment of its recycling initiatives are provided in the graphs on the right side of this page. POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan Confidential & Proprietary Information 2011 7 Energy Consumption In 2009, Pomeroy established a baseline for the energy consumption on its campus. Thereafter, the company implemented initiatives to reduce consumption rates. More specifically, in 2010, began upgrading the lighting on its corporate campus to improve overall energy efficiency. The upgrade project, which included Pomeroy’s 170,000 square feet Logistics Center, effectively replaced 400w high bay fixtures with 250 T-8 lights and directly reduced the company’s recurrent energy usage and associated expenses. Pomeroy similarly upgraded its 50,000+ square feet corporate office by replacing all T-12 lighting with T-8 lighting. According to generally accepted lighting industry statistics, T-8 lighting uses one-third of the energy that T-12 lighting uses, which served as the basis for Pomeroy to undertake this environmentally friendly and fiscally responsible initiative. Pomeroy put motion sensors on lighting throughout the company’s corporate campus, which allowed Pomeroy to conserve energy usage in unoccupied or underutilized spaces throughout its corporate campus. Pomeroy also installed certain new and improved thermostats, equipment, and other controls for its HVAC systems on the corporate campus in 2010, which resulted in more efficiencies and an overall reduction in energy consumption. The results yielded from Pomeroy’s self-assessment of its energy efficiency initiatives are provided in the graphs on the right side of this page. POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan Confidential & Proprietary Information 2011 8 Energy Consumption Pomeroy has voluntarily identified future efficiency upgrades for the high energy consumption equipment and systems on the company’s corporate headquarters, along with the estimated or targeted date for such upgrades, in order to ensure that Pomeroy is continuously pursuing opportunities to reduce the company’s energy consumption. An outline of the plan is provided below and is continued on the next three (3) pages.

The average age of the vehicles, which were comprised of various makes and models, was 8-10 years. Over the course of the last three (3) years, Pomeroy has effectively reduced and updated its fleet of vehicles. Pomeroy currently owns and operates approximately 12 motor vehicles – five (5) of which are less than two (2) years old – in the ordinary course of its business. As a result of the overall reduction in the size and age of Pomeroy’s motor vehicles, the company has effectively reduced its Scope 1 GHG emissions. The graph on the right depicts the marked improvement in Pomeroy’s Scope 1 GHG The higher the Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas Score the scores from 2009 through 2011. better! Pomeroy’s score improved by 2.0 points over a 24 months period, which means that the company’s motor vehicle fleet is now more environmentally friendly. POMEROY  Corporate Responsibility & Environmental Sustainability Plan Confidential & Proprietary Information 2011 12 Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Greenhouse gas emissions are emitted when fossil fuels are combusted to generate electricity. Therefore, any greenhouse gas emissions, which result from Pomeroy’s procurement of electricity to operate its business, are indirect in nature. Pomeroy’s has calculated certain of its’ electricity usage data in order to quantify and measure the equivalent indirect GHG emissions. Overall, the data collected reflects a downward trend in electricity consumption and associated CO2 equivalent emissions. The company has employed consistent efforts to be more energy conscious and efficient. Some conservation actions include the installation of more efficient lighting and upgrading some HVAC systems. Plans for future improvements include implementing more advanced HVAC controls and more efficient HVAC systems. Additional reductions in energy consumption – and resulting Scope 2 GHG emissions – may come from continued efforts to educate employees on energy conservation measures. The graph below depicts the company’s reduction in the company’s total CO2 equivalent emissions. The CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions used in this calculation are estimated using methodology provided in Climate Leaders Greenhouse Gas Inventory Protocol.
