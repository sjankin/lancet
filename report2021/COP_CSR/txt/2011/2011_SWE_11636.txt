The compilation includes investments (excluding the liquidity portfolio), derivative contracts and repo contracts. The limit is set by the Finance Committee within the scope of the rating-related framework established by the Board. Utilised limits are calculated as the market value of derivative financial instruments, repo contracts and investments. For counterparties who are also loan customers, the limit shall be coordinated with the credit limit. A limit per counterparty can be established for a period of time of at most a year before a new consideration must be made. The decisions of the Finance Committee are to be reported to the Board at the next Board meeting. All of SBAB’s counterparties have a rating. Individual limits for investment and counterparty exposure may, as a main rule, be at most 15% of SBAB’s capital base.

Fringe benefits (subsidised interest rate and sickness benefit) to these executives amounted to SEK 0.1 million (0.1). Salary and other benefits to senior executives who report directly to the CEO were paid in the following amounts: Chief Credit Officer SEK 1.3 million (1.5), Chief Legal Counsel SEK 1.2 million (1.2), Chief Information Officer SEK 1.4 million (1.4), Head of Accounting and Controlling Department SEK 1.4 million (1.4), Chief Communication Officer SEK 1.7 million (1.7), Chief Financial Officer SEK 1.6 million (1.6), Head of Corporate Clients SEK 1.8 million (1.8), Human Resources Manager SEK 1.4 million (1.3), Head of Consumer Department SEK 1.6 million (1.6) and Head of Internal Audit SEK 1.1 million (1.1). In view of SBAB’s participation in the Swedish Government’s guarantee programme, the five senior executives with the highest combined remuneration in October 2008, did not have their remuneration revised in 2009 or 2010. During 2009, the Government adopted new guidelines for employment terms and conditions of senior executives in state-owned companies. Among other consequences, the guidelines entail that variable remuneration should not be paid to senior executives. As an adaptation to these guidelines, the Remuneration Committee has decided to remunerate other senior executives, who are no longer covered by the incentive programme, with a pay supple52 SBAB Annual Report 2010 • NOTES Cont.

The Remuneration Committee’s composition and authorities are described on pages 79-80. Remuneration to the Board The level of remuneration paid to the Board is resolved at the Annual General Meeting.

A fee of SEK 0.3 million (0.4) was paid to the Chairman of the Board and of SEK 0.1 million (0.1) each to the elected Board Members. No fee is payable to the owners’ representative and the employee representatives who sit on the Board. Board Members serving on a committee or executive committee received SEK 3,500 per meeting attended. Pensions Pension costs for the entire company, including special employers’ contributions, totalled SEK 46.8 million (40.0). Pension costs, including special employers’ contributions, for the CEO amounted to SEK 0.8 million (0.9). Pension costs, including special employers’ contributions, of SEK 5.1 million (5.1) were paid to senior executives who report directly to the CEO. Pension costs, including special employers’ contributions were paid to these executives in the following amounts: Chief Credit Officer SEK 0.6 million (0.8), Chief Legal Counsel SEK 0.4 million (0.3), Chief Information Officer SEK 0.5 million (0.4), Head of Accounting and Controlling Department SEK 0.5 million (0.5), Chief Communication Officer SEK 0.6 million (0.6), Chief Financial Officer SEK 0.6 million (0.6), Head of Corporate Clients SEK 0.5 million (0.5), Human Resources Manager SEK 0.5 million (0.5), Head of Consumer Department SEK 0.5 million (0.5) and Head of Internal Audit SEK 0.4 million (0.4). SBAB employees are covered by a pension plan that includes illness pension, survivor’s coverage, retirement pension, supplementary pension and, in some cases, family pension. The pension plan also covers those on high incomes, whereby the recipient can choose an alternative investment for a portion of the premium. SBAB applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits. SBAB has defined-contribution pension plans and defined-benefit pension plans. The defined-benefit plans are collective employer plans (BTP), secured through insurance with SPP. These are defined-benefit multi-employer plans. SBAB’s pension costs amounted to SEK 37.6 million (32.1) excluding payroll tax. See Note 29, Provisions, for additional information. The Board’s proposed guidelines for remuneration of senior executives During 2010, the Board’s preparation of matters relating to remuneration of the company’s senior executives occurred in the Remuneration Committee, which also decided on remuneration to the CEO and senior executives. For further information on the Remuneration Committee, see pages 79-80. The Board’s motion concerning principles for the remuneration and other employment terms of senior executives, which is resolved by the Annual General Meeting, entails in brief that remuneration shall consist of a fixed basic salary without any variable remuneration. Agreements on severance pay and pension With respect to pension conditions, periods of notice and severance pay for senior executives, the principles stipulated in the Government’s guidelines for senior executives (April 2009) apply, with the exception of the CEO, for whom no deductions will be made from pay during periods of notice/severance pay in connection with new employment. SBAB and the CEO are subject to a mutual period of notice of six months. If the company gives notice terminating the contract and the CEO leaves her post, the company shall in addition to salary during the period of notice – pay severance pay corresponding to 18 monthly salaries without deduction of new salary. An agreement has been entered into with the CEO on a mutual right to demand pen­sion no earlier than when the CEO turns 62. The company pays for a defined-contribution pension insurance plan corresponding to 25% of the CEO’s pensionable salary, although no longer than until age 62. An agreement has been entered into with the Head of the Corporate Clients concerning a defined-contribution plan corresponding to 22% of pensionable salary. There are no other pension agreements that deviate from the general rules of the collective agreement for the bank area. In cases where individual agreements on severance pay exist, these comply with the Government’s guidelines for state-owned companies. In the event of notice being served by the company, compensation of up to two years’ salary is paid including the period of notice. Deductions will be made from the compensation should new employment or income from other activity be received during the two-year period. The accumulated total amount plus the expensed total amount for severance pay and guaranteed variable remuneration pledged during the year was SEK 0. Disbursed severance pay during the year amounted to SEK 0.0 million (1.1). Loans to senior executives Loans to senior executives are presented in Note 36, Information about related parties. Incentive programme Following preparation by SBAB’s Remuneration Committee and a decision by the Board of Directors, the incentive programme for 2010 has been approved in compliance with the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority’s new regulations and general guidance on the remuneration policy of credit institutions, investment firms and fund management companies (FFFS 2009:6). The overall principles and conditions for SBAB’s incentive programme are established by the Board for a year at a time. The incentive programme is aimed at encouraging employees to contribute to increasing SBAB’s value. The incentive programme covers all employees (subject to a certain period of employment and on condition that they have been employed for a full quarter and remained employed on 31 December 2010). Those exempted from the incentive programme are the CEO and ten senior executives who report directly to the CEO as well as internal auditors. The maximum payment is two monthly salaries. All payment from the incentive programme consists of cash. The incentive programme for 2010 is based on two parts: 50% is based on company-wide goals, calculated on the basis of earnings targets for the year after costs for the incentive programme have been taken into account and 50% on unit goals. A prerequisite for pay-outs for any of the programme’s components is the achievement of target requirements. The company-wide goals were not exceeded, while the results of the unit goals vary from 0% fulfilment to 100% fulfilment. Payment based on unit goals is pensionable in the BTP scheme. During 2010, SBAB paid remuneration pertaining to the 2009 incentive programme corresponding to SEK 20.7 million. In 2010, SBAB expensed SEK 11.4 million1), within the framework of the incentive programme for 2010. Accordingly variable remuneration accounted for 3.6% of total payroll costs1). The programme’s 366 recipients include 14 employees who can influence the company’s risk level as well as certain control functions. Their portion of remuneration from the incentive programme corresponds to SEK 1.0 million1) and accounted for 5.5% of their total payroll costs1). In order not to disclose information about the individual employees’ financial situation, no further breakdown of remuneration from the incentive programme per business area or equivalent has been performed. 60% of SEK 1.0 million is accounted for by deferred remuneration and will be disbursed during the spring of 2014 after indexing in relation to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Prior to disbursement, a risk adjustment will be performed by the Board of Directors deciding, on the basis of documentation from the Remuneration Committee, whether all or parts of the deferred incentive remuneration will be disbursed, a decision that the Board has unrestricted rights to make. The previously deferred incentive remuneration for 14 employees who in 2009 were deemed to be able to influence the company’s risk level amounts to SEK 1.3 million and will be disbursed not earlier than 2013. 1) Total of salary, pensions and social fees.

In case of early redemption between interest-rate adjustment dates, SBAB has the right to receive interest-rate compensation. The size of the compensation in the case of retail market loans is based on the interest rate on the loan compared with the interest rate on government bonds/treasury bills with a comparable remaining term up to the interest adjustment date +1 percentage point. For other loans, the reinvestment interest rate for comparable government securities is, in most cases, the applicable interest rate. In other cases, the comparable interest rate is specified in the current loan conditions. In addition to mortgage deeds in pledged property, SBAB has, in certain cases, received government or municipal guarantees as collateral for the borrower’s commitments. The proportion of loans covered by this type of guarantee is shown in the table above. SEK 50,233 million (41,642) of SBAB’s portfolio was provided by business partners and it is possible for certain partners, in the event of a change of ownership of SBAB, to acquire loans provided.

Fair value hedges SBAB mainly uses fair value hedges to protect against changes in the fair value of lending and funding at fixed interest rates and to hedge currency exposure of funding in foreign currency. The hedge instruments primarily used are interest-rate swaps and interest/ currency swaps. Group As at 31 December 2010, the nominal amount of derivatives held for fair value hedging was SEK 356.0 billion (309.3). The fair value of these derivatives was SEK 1,866 million (6,652) and the year’s change in value was a decline of SEK 661 million (decline: 325). The change in value of the hedged items with respect to hedged risk amounted to income of SEK 869 million (1,147) and the realised result from repurchased debt amounted to an expense of SEK 770 million (expense: 949). Accordingly, the effect on the year’s earnings of the Group’s hedge accounting for fair value as well as completed repurchases was an expense of SEK 562 million (expense: 127). Parent Company As at 31 December 2010, the nominal amount of derivatives held for fair value hedging was SEK 44.9 billion (58.0). The fair value of these derivatives was SEK 1,825 million (240) and the year’s change in value was a decline of SEK 399 million (decline: 144). The change in fair value of the hedged items with respect to hedged risk amounted to income of SEK 198 million (income: 357) and the realised result from repurchased debt amounted to an expense of SEK 236 million (expense: 121). Accordingly, the effect on the year’s earnings of the Parent Company’s hedge accounting for fair value and completed repurchases was an expense of SEK 437 million (income: 92). Cash flow hedges SBAB also hedges uncertainty associated with future cash flows. Uncertainty associated with future cash flows arises when funding takes place at floating interest rates. These interest rates have a fixed-interest term of between one and six months. However, the maturity horizon is considerably longer, up to 15 years. Interest/currency swaps are used to hedge the future interest-rate payments for a desired maturity. Interest rate swaps with a future value date are used for future cash flows that are to be reinvested or refinanced to guarantee a known reinvestment or a refinancing rate. There is a high degree of probability that the hedged future cash flows will be received, since they are contracted. Group and Parent Company As at 31 December 2010, the nominal amount of derivatives held for cash flow hedging was SEK 0.4 billion (0.5). The fair value of these derivatives was SEK 29 million (2). To the extent that the hedge is effective, the change in value of derivative contracts is recognised in equity. The change in value is recognised in profit or loss at the same rate as the cash flows of the hedged item affect earnings. At the end of the year, the hedge reserve after tax amounted to a negative SEK 1 million (negative: 4). These hedges showed no ineffectiveness.

The average effective interest rate used in reclassification was 6.3%. At the same date, the fair value reserve attributable to these assets had a negative value of SEK 200 million, net after tax. At 31 December 2010, the fair value of the assets would have amounted to SEK 14.3 billion had the assets continued to be recognised as “Financial assets available for sale.” The carrying amount at 31 December 2010 was SEK 14.9 billion. At the same date, the fair value reserve attributable to the reclassified assets would have amounted to a negative SEK 0.7 billion, net after tax, had the assets continued to be recognised as “Financial assets available for sale”. The reserve amounted to a negative SEK 80 million, net after tax, at 31 December 2010. After the reclassification date, SEK 158 million of the reserve before tax has been reversed and exchange rate fluctuations had a negative impact of SEK 11 million before tax on the value of the reserve.

The measurement method is mainly used for holdings of interest-bearing securities issued by Swedish banks, Swedish mortgage institution and the Kingdom of Sweden, plus publicly quoted derivative instruments, primarily interest-rate futures. Measurement based on other observable data (Level 2) Measurement aided by external market information other than quoted prices, such as those included in Level 1; for example, interest rates or prices for closely related instruments. This group includes all non-quoted derivative instruments, as well as holdings of European covered bonds. Measurement based in part on non-observable data (Level 3) Measurement whereby a material component of the model is based on estimates or assumptions that did not originate directly from the market. This method is currently not used for any assets or liabilities. 70 SBAB Annual Report 2010 • NOTES Note 36 Information about related parties SBAB is a 100% state-owned Swedish public limited company.

The Board and the CEO certify that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standard IFRS as adopted by the EU and provide a true and fair view of the Group’s position and earnings. The Annual Report was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies and provides a true and fair view of the Parent Company’s position and earnings. The administration report for the Group and Parent Company provides a true and fair view of the development of the Group and Parent Company’s operations, position and earnings, and describes the significant risks and uncertainty factors faced by the Parent Company and the companies included in the Group. In accordance with Chapter 6, Section 2, second subsection of the Annual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies, the Board considers that the company’s equity is sufficiently large in relation to the extent and risks of the operations. The Board and the CEO propose that the funds which, according to the balance sheet of the Parent Company, are at the disposal of the Annual General Meeting, namely SEK 5,371,255,939, of which the profit for the year amounts to SEK 91,282,306, be carried forward.

The Annual Report and the consolidated accounts are included in the printed version of the report on pages 13-74. These accounts and the administration of the Company are the responsibility of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer. They are also responsible for ensuring compliance with the Annual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies when preparing this report and for compliance with the international financial reporting standards IFRS as adopted by the EU and the Annual Accounts for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies when preparing the consolidated accounts. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the annual accounts, the consolidated accounts and the administration based on our audit. We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. This entails that we planned and performed the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts were free of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the accounts. An audit also includes assessing the accounting policies used and their application by the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, as well as evaluating the important estimates made by the Board and Chief Executive Officer when drawing up the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and evaluating the overall presentation of information in the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts. As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liability, we examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances of the Company to enable us to determine the liability, if any, to the Company of any Board Member or the Chief Executive Officer. We also examined whether any Board Member or the Chief Executive Officer had, in any other way, acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Banking and Financing Business Act, the Annual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies or the Articles of Association. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion set out below. The annual accounts were prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies and, accordingly, provide a true and fair view of the Company’s earnings and financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Sweden. The consolidated accounts were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standard IFRS as adopted by the EU and the Annual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies and provide a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position and results. The administration report is in accordance with other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We recommend to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders that the income statements and balance sheets of the Parent Company and the Group be adopted, that the profit for the Parent Company be dealt with in accordance with the proposal in the administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer be discharged from liability for the financial year. Stockholm, 16 March 2011 Öhrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers AB Ulf Westerberg Authorised Public Accountant SBAB ANNUAL REPORT 2010 • AUDIT REPORT 75 Corporate Governance Report Chairman’s Statement In 2010, the Board’s work included matters pertaining to the strategic efforts required to develop SBAB’s business to enable an expansion of the customer offering. In late 2010, SBAB obtained a license from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority to conduct banking operations – an activity that SBAB will commence in 2011. To date, SBAB has primarily been associated with housing financing while banking operations will provide a broader platform from which SBAB can offer additional products and services to customers. Through the addition of banking services, SBAB will be able to offer its customers simple and modern products and services. In developing its banking operations, SBAB will capitalise on its principal assets in the form of the customer base, the technical platform and SBAB’s distribution model. Matters concerning liquidity, capitalisation and regulatory framework developments in these areas were also recurring items on the Board’s agenda in 2010. The regulations that arose in the wake of the financial crisis have led to an increasingly complex situation for financial companies, thus imposing strict requirements on solid corporate governance. The Board has also, particularly through the work of its committees, focused on issues involving SBAB’s granting of credit, funding operations, auditing and internal controls, as well as remuneration. In addition, reviews of the operation’s earnings and volume trend were conducted on a regular basis during the year. Three new members, Arne Liljedahl, Jakob Grinbaum and Hanna Lagercrantz, were elected to the Board Stockholm, 15 March 2011 through a resolution by the Annual General Meeting in April, while three members stepped down from the Board: Claes Kjellander, Lars Linder-Aronson and Michael Thorén.
