From O ur C hairman Our Nalco employees around the world often tell me that their greatest satisfaction each day at work comes from the difference we are making for our customers and our world. This annual Sustainability Report documents our actions and progress in 2010 toward our vision to earn customers for life and enhance the lives of our employees while protecting the planet. I reiterate our ongoing commitment to the United Nations Global Compact and the CEO Water Mandate. They align completely with our corporate values of Safety, Integrity, Expertise, Innovation, Collaboration and Accountability. They also match our daily efforts to help our industrial and commercial customers operate more efficiently, making them perform better environmentally and economically. Having every employee arrive home safely at the end of each day remains our top priority. Our sustainability solutions for industrial water, energy and air applications deliver what we describe We take our corporate social responsibility very as an environmental return on investment, or eROI, for seriously. Nalco employees constantly demonstrate our customers by both shrinking their environmental their willingness to help others, whether it is answering footprint and their total cost of operations.

The amount the use of natural resources. of wastewater produced by the hotel was cut by NALCO 2010 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 07 The Nalco team identified the combination of a new retention, drainage and formation program with patented PARETO Mixing Technology to improve the wet-end of the papermaking process, where high amounts of water and fiber are formed into the paper sheet before it is dried. Central to the Nalco solution is the PARETO Optimizer. Its unique design works in combination with custom computational fluid dynamics calculations and a deep understanding of chemistry and process conditions to ensure that injection of chemical treatments is efficient and effective. By integrating PARETO Mixing Technology into the wet-end program, sustainability performance was improved, in particular through reduced demand for both chemical use and fresh water resources. PARETO Mixing Technology yielded 80 million gallons (nearly 303,000 cubic meters) of total water savings. A 25 percent reduction in direct chemical costs and water savings of more than 10 million gallons per year were achieved on just one of the paper machines that the company has in the industrial unit located in Suzano, São Paulo – Brazil. The combined operating and sustainability benefits provide Suzano an environmental return on investment (eROI). The success on the initial use for one papermaking machine led the customer to declare the solution a best practice within its operations and present Nalco with a supplier innovation award. PARETO technology has been expanded to a total of five machines at two of Suzano’s mills, yielding total water savings of 80 million gallons per year. 08 NALCO 2010 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Power Plant in Poland Petrochemical Plant in China As in many parts of the world, CSPC (the CNOOC and Shell European Union (EU) air emissions Petrochemicals Company Limited) regulations are challenging coal-fired is one of the largest Sino-foreign • and biomass power plants to comply joint venture projects in China with strict limits for priority pollutants. • operating a giant petrochemical For example, tighter EU standards for NOx (oxides complex in Guangdong province of nitrogen, a component of ground level ozone that in southern China. causes a variety of health impacts) must be met by At the heart of the complex is a “cracker” which 2016. uses intense heat to break down petroleum prodThe PGE Elektrownia Opole power plant in Poland ucts into various commodity chemicals.

Waste Global waste generation (EN22) also increased (8.4 percent) but at a slower pace than our production (19 percent). The five-year trend for waste generation was positive, with a 2.8 percent reduction in total waste since 2006. The amount of waste generated compared to production also improved, down more than 8 percent from .0227 metric tons of waste to metric ton produced in 2009 to .0207 in 2010. Process improvement teams at our largest manufacturing site, in Garyville La., identified several waste reduction opportunities, winning an Environmental Leader Program award from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. One change allowed 900,000 pounds of a major raw material to be reclaimed annually and a second change cut used waste oil disposal by 225,000 pounds. Changes in the plant’s wastewater system reduced the amount of nitrate compounds being released into the Mississippi River. Excess nitrogen in the river water causes hypoxia (oxygen depleted zones) in the Gulf of Mexico, harming sea life and impacting commercial fishing.
