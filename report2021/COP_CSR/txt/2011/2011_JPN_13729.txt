He also diversified into the field of organic chemistry, based on chemistry, contributing to life March 11 caused enormous damage in the eastern region of Japan. There are still many people who are living in very difficult conditions, unable to derivatives from coal distillates. This technological pedigree for industrial chemistry remains at the heart of who we are today. and living for people around return to their homes. I express my most heartfelt sympathies. Noguchi’s ambitious vision was to create world-leading factory complexes using Japanese technology. He knew that this would require a the world Shirakawa: I was scheduled to give a demonstration class at the Miraikan (National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation) diverse array of technologies, and would give rise to innovations and integrations of different fields. He believed that this would ultimately contribute on March 12, but it was canceled because of to the advancement of Japan’s overall technological The Asahi Kasei Group has launched “For Tomorrow 2015” as a new five-year management earthquake damage. Repairs were completed three position and industrial development. The creation initiative from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2015. Operations throughout our four business sectors of months later, and the facilities finally reopened in of a new technology or product opens the way for Chemicals & Fibers, Homes & Construction Materials, Electronics, and Health Care are being June. These unprecedented circumstances made further improvements and modifications, which me realize that we need to think again about lead to even more possibilities and new applications. reinforced. We are considering future businesses from a broad perspective, including further energy usage and conservation of electricity. This positive cycle is what creates new value and development from our core in chemistry. makes the world a richer place. Asahi Kasei has a President Taketsugu Fujiwara invited Dr. Hideki Shirakawa, laureate of the 2000 Nobel Prize Fujiwara: This disaster brought many things into long heritage of innovating and creating in this in Chemistry, to discuss the role of chemistry and the proper approach for a company to take in a sharp relief, including how to sustain essential way, and we continue to pass it on from generation utilities, and what kind of security we should to generation. changing society. expect in homes and communities. We have had Dr. Shirakawa, you discovered polyacetylene, but extensive discussions in the Asahi Kasei Group you identified its properties by combining various about our role as a business entity, and I strongly substances and trying all sorts of things. feel that this disaster has only reconfirmed and reinforced the validity of our Group Mission of Shirakawa: That’s right. At first, people thought contributing to life and living for people around the experiment had failed. But ultimately it the world. became clear that even a plastic, which would not be expected to have any conductivity, could Shirakawa: Another way to say it would be, “What conduct electricity after all. Hideki can chemistry do to help save lives? What can it do to help make life better?” Of course I don’t mean In specialist terminology, polyacetylene is a conjugated polymer, that is to say, it is a plastic that Taketsugu Shirakawa just pure chemistry, but think of all the things that are derived from chemistry. It has enabled has alternating single and double bonds. Broadly speaking, there are two types of conjugated Fujiwara Chemist Professor Emeritus, University remarkable progress in healthcare, in inorganic materials, and in construction materials. One of systems—one is aromatic compounds, which contain benzene rings, and the other one is of Tsukuba President of Asahi Kasei the greatest contributions that chemistry has aliphatic compounds such as polyacetylene. With Nobel Prize Laureate in Corporation made to humankind is the Haber-Bosch process an aliphatic compound, addition reactions occur Chemistry in 2000 for reacting nitrogen from the air with hydrogen very readily. In other words, various radicals easily to synthesize ammonia, which is used to make attach at one of the double bonds, changing it to a things like fertilizers and pharmaceuticals. This is single bond. If that happens, electrical conductivity the basic foundation for all nitrogen-containing is lost. The characteristics of polyacetylene are compounds, and it has long been a cornerstone of extremely good as long as no addition reactions the chemical industry. Asahi Kasei was an early occur. That is why when it was first found, pioneer in improving this process, weren’t you? researchers at universities and corporations around the world studied it eagerly in the hope Fujiwara: Our founder Shitagau Noguchi that it could be used in rechargeable batteries. planted the roots of our enterprise by building Although outstanding performance could be hydroelectric plants which supplied power for obtained, durability turned out to be a problem electrolysis to obtain hydrogen from water, when trying to develop a practical product. This is and then synthesizing ammonia as the basis why everyone switched to aromatic compounds. for development of a wide range of chemical Dr. Yoshino, who developed the lithium-ion businesses. Very early on, he built enormous battery at Asahi Kasei, was the first to realize this, 3 Asahi Kasei Group CSR Report 2011 Asahi Kasei Group CSR Report 2011 4 Interview with the President and his improvements with carbonaceous material as well as our filtration systems for plasma Pioneering the future by were the key to the successful development. derivatives, can be applied to the problem of AIDS. Although human intuition can be very keen We consider it our corporate mission to make a creating new value sometimes, there are also times when you just can’t contribution to social systems that provide peace figure out what will work. Sometimes you just have of mind worldwide. Fujiwara: In order to create new value by to try all kinds of things, and once you find what integrating different technologies and different works you say “Oh, now I understand!” products, I believe that, above all else, it is Incidentally, what is the thinking behind the necessary to nurture human resources and to have Asahi Kasei Group Slogan, Creating for Tomorrow? Teaching children to learn interchange between people. We have programs to from nature support independent study and to provide overseas Fujiwara: We have projects underway studying assignments as part of the process of personnel what specific things development, which that enables them to develop we will doing for the Shirakawa: Asahi Kasei also seems to strongly on their own initiative. In terms of personnel future. For example, support science education for children. You interchange, we have a system to enable people to in health care, one provide materials for my demonstration classes apply for available positions in different business focus is on the at the Miraikan, of which you are also a major units, in addition to the ordinary job rotations. circulatory system. sponsor. Whenever I interact with children, I Hideki Shirakawa We can use filtration emphasize hands-on study and learning from Shirakawa: Specialization is critical in chemistry Born in Tokyo in 1936. Graduated with a Ph.D. in Engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in to remove unwanted nature. research, as this is where new possibilities are 1966. After studying at the University of Pennsylvania in the substances from the blood, and then return the Children learn best when they see things with found. But just pursuing specialization alone United States, he took up a post at the University of Tsukuba. Awarded the Order of Cultural Merit and the Nobel Prize filtered blood to the patient. Although filtration their own eyes and experience things in person. I would certainly not be enough. To fulfill your in Chemistry in 2000 for his achievements in the discovery won’t completely remove the unwanted substances, think the best way to teach them is to help them slogan Creating for Tomorrow, a whole spectrum and research of the conductive plastics polyacetylene. Dr. decreasing the amount of such substances can discover different things and realize different ideas of knowledge is required. I believe what you Shirakawa is presently a member of the Japanese government’s Council for Science and Technology Policy and serves as an provide effective therapy. And in addition to themselves. By “learning from nature,” I mean describe about personnel interchange is extremely instructor of demonstration classes at the National Museum filtration, we can also use adsorbents to remove that children can actually learn a lot on their own important, even as you reinforce the fundamentals of Emerging Science and Innovation (Miraikan). various proteins, pathogens, and viruses. simply by being surrounded by nature. as a company at the same time. We use many convenient devices and systems I have been involved in research at the University of for us to create new value for society by combining Shirakawa: It sounds like you’re aiming for these days, but it’s not easy to grasp how they work. Tsukuba for a long time. In the Third College Cluster various technologies. We are advancing new filtration/adsorption systems that will do even Now that there are fewer opportunities to make where I used to work, we had instructors with many business projects that gather together specialists more than ordinary kidney functions. In Japan things by ourselves, I think we really need to give different backgrounds. In addition to researchers in different fields. Your comments will be a great and worldwide, I think the question of how to children the chance to experience things in person. like myself who specialized in chemistry, some source of inspiration as we move forward. In tackle cancer is extremely important. In addition, It would be great if more corporations and scientists were researchers in social engineering, structural closing, is there anything else you believe the global initiatives are essential to address the three would help support this kind of thing. engineering, materials engineering, and even Asahi Kasei Group should aspire to? major problems of tuberculosis, AIDS and malaria. international studies. In the laboratory next Fujiwara: In Nobeoka, Miyazaki Prefecture, one to mine, they were doing physics experiments Shirakawa: First of all, I think you could make the Fujiwara: I believe that our filtration and of our major manufacturing locations, we have long and researching lithium-ion rechargeable battery a more complete adsorption systems for therapeutic apheresis, had a program for our engineers to visit local schools electronics. Such an product. I don’t mean as individual components, to give science and technology demonstrations, and environment that but as a large-scale system. Another area of great we invite groups of students for tours of various allows different people promise would be to produce chemical substances factories. We also support a program by retired to come into contact by combining sunlight collection technology with engineers to visit local schools to help with science with one another is catalyst technology. It would be possible to produce lessons. Throughout these efforts, we truly hope extremely valuable for useful substances like methanol and ethanol. Also, and believe that it doesn’t just end when the lecture the development of a some people believe that we will face a food crisis is over, but that what we’re doing is just as you broad outlook. in the not too distant future. It should be possible described—providing children with opportunities The Asahi Kasei Group is involved in such to develop another new field of business based to experience discovery and excitement. a wide range of fields. You’re in health care as on growing plants under completely controlled The world today is awash with information. One well as construction materials and fibers. When conditions of temperature, humidity, and light. The can find out almost anything by searching the developing new fields of business, it must be power of chemistry holds the key to each of these. internet. But the most important thing is to realize crucial to have good personnel interchange and things on one’s own. You speak of learning to technological integration. Fujiwara: Initiatives that combine technologies observe people and nature from the perspective to discover new value are directly linked to the of chemistry. I think we should keep a similar Fujiwara: I’m glad you mentioned that. Right now, fulfillment of our corporate social responsibility. perspective as a corporate enterprise as we consider the fields we’re looking at include environment We will continue with a strong sense of mission the future for people and for nature.
