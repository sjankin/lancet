WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 ESSENTIALS MESSAGE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS Message to the shareholders Dear Shareholders, For Wärtsilä, 2010 was a year of recovery. At the same time it was a year of further consolidation and restructuring of activities. We entered the year with a rapidly decreased order book, and it was hard to predict when a recovery could actually be expected. As a result of the severe financial crisis, world trade had deteriorated sharply in 2009 and there was a lot of surplus shipping capacity available. Although the power plants market did not suffer as such from overcapacity, financing conditions caused the postponement of projects that otherwise would have proceeded well. It also became apparent that the post crisis industrial structure would be even more competitive than before. Asian shipyards now claim an even bigger share of the world's shipbuilding markets. Component and systems suppliers need to adapt to that. The boom years preceding the crisis had seen capacity additions that now may be redundant. Adapting to these conditions, and maintaining competitiveness and profitability, is our top priority. We therefore decided in the beginning of 2010 to further align our engine and propulsor production. These decisions mean that production is moved closer to the markets in China, while our European production footprint is being consolidated. The Service business, with sales remaining at last year's levels, has undertaken restructuring measures to adapt capacity to market needs. Furthermore, our administration resources had to be reviewed, and towards the end of the year redundancy programmes were introduced in this sector. Reducing capacity through temporary and permanent lay-off programmes is, of course, not an objective in itself. Nor is it even a desirable solution. However, I am pleased to note that Wärtsilä's personnel has fully understood the seriousness of the situation and the necessity of the measures taken. In a survey conducted at the end of 2010, the vast majority of Wärtsilä's employees expressed their commitment to Wärtsilä, and to the company's goals. Group personnel decreased to 17,528 (18,541) by the end of the year. The ordering of new ships started already in the spring of 2010, far earlier than expected. The total number of ships ordered has almost doubled compared to the year before. A number of bulk carriers were ordered in the spring and, towards the end of the year, shipping companies started again to order container vessels. Activity in the offshore sector has continued to be high. Wärtsilä's Ship Power order intake slowly started to recover in line with the turn in the market. Our concentration on ship design, total solutions, and operational support has proven to be a success. We are able to serve our customers, both ship owners and yards alike, in the continuous efforts towards more efficient and sustainable shipping. The world's need for sustainable and reliable power did not vanish with the financial crisis, and activity in our Power Plants division has remained high. Power plant solutions based on our new, bigger gas engines are meeting with good customer demand. Customers appreciate the high efficiency even at variable load of This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report. Page numbers can differ in other self generated documents. 1 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 ESSENTIALS MESSAGE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS these engines, as well as their superior load management capabilities, and modularised design that allows for easy capacity additions as demand increases. More than 50 percent of the new power plant capacity installed by Wärtsilä in 2010 was accompanied by long-term operational agreements. Long-term operations and management agreements, which earlier were virtually non-existent in the shipping industry, are today widely discussed. I am pleased to note that some of the world's undisputed leaders in shipping have signed such agreements with our Services division. This division, which accounted for 40 percent of group sales in 2010, has proven to be resilient to the financial crisis. Of our net sales, 23 percent last year came from the so called BRIC countries. These will continue to be at the centre of our activities in the future. Brazil, with its large energy resources, is broadening its industrial capabilities, and Wärtsilä will be part of that. In Russia, we signed a joint venture agreement last year to produce Wärtsilä designed locomotive engines, and the first such engine began test runs in late 2010. India has been a focus of our activities since the early 1980's, and our footprint in China will continue to grow. Today, we operate three joint ventures and a sizable wholly owned operation in China, with approximately 1,800 employees. In terms of sales for Wärtsilä, China again ranked number one. Wärtsilä is committed to developing its modern product and services portfolio. In 2010, our R&D expenditure equalled 3 percent of sales. In 2011 this will be at least at the same level. Our products and activities play a central role in ensuring the future for sustainable global shipping and electricity generation. High ethical standards in our operations are non-negotiable. In this context, we are committed to supporting the UN Global Compact and its ten principles with respect to human rights, labour, the environment, and anticorruption. Due to the fall in new contracting activity in 2009, our net sales in 2010 fell by 13 percent to 4.6 billion euro following a period of strong growth. In 2011 we will again see some growth in sales. We are also pleased to note that profitability remained at a good level, 10.7 percent, and is expected to improve again slightly in 2011. For the longer term, we believe that the new more lean structure, our good position in the markets, and our efficient services organisation should enable us to reach operating margins of up to 14 percent. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for your confidence in our company, our customers for your trust in our products and services, and last but not least, the entire staff of Wärtsilä for your commitment towards our common goals.

Group net sales, EUR 4,553 million, declined by 13% compared to the year 2009. Operating profit remained at a high level and amounted to EUR 487 million (638) and the operating margin stood at 10.7% (12.1). Cash flow from operating activities was record high at EUR 663 million (349). New vessel contracting activity stronger than expected The number of vessels contracted in 2010 represented an increase of 75% compared to the previous year. This was a much faster and more significant recovery than expected. While the first half of the year was characterised by high contracting activity for bulk carriers, the second half saw a similar increase in contracting activity for container vessels and more specialised vessel types. The offshore segment continued strong throughout the year and demand was good especially for floating production units. As a consequence of this development Wärtsilä Ship Power's order intake for 2010 more than doubled and totalled EUR 657 million (317). Power Plant markets remained solid The financial crisis which led to the postponement of investments for power generation in 2009, eased during 2010 and market activity was at a good level during the year. Industrial output is increasing in most emerging markets which, in combination with population growth and enhanced standards of living, is driving the need for more power generation. The installed base of wind power generation has also increased, which is creating a need for flexible power generation. For the review period January-December 2010, the Power Plants order intake totalled EUR 1,413 million (1,048), a 35% increase compared to last year. Marine service customers were affected by slow market During 2010, the global economic downturn had its effect on the marine service market which focused strongly on cost savings. Marine customers, especially in the merchant segment continued to limit their maintenance and modernisation investments. A large number of ships were slow steaming which reduces maintenance and repair expenditures. At the end of the year, the amount of idled vessels had decreased to 6% from its peak of 10% at the beginning of 2010. The power plants service business was less affected by the downturn. Wärtsilä Services' order intake and net sales remained at last year's good level. Restructuring measures initiated to meet lower demand In January 2010, Wärtsilä started the adaptation of manufacturing capacity to both the structural changes in the market and to a lower demand environment. Some of the manufacturing capacity has been moved to China and two factories in the Netherlands are in the process of being closed. New and more efficient ways to operate have been introduced, thus enabling the closure of smaller units and the consolidation of operations to larger entities in various countries, as well as the consolidation of manufacturing close to growing markets. Wärtsilä also initiated processes to reduce approximately 400 jobs globally in its support functions during the fourth quarter. Through all of these measures initiated in different phases, Wärtsilä is reducing the number of personnel by approximately 1,800 employees.

In Ship Power, the scope of delivery varies from individual equipment components to full system integration, whereas in Power Plants the scope varies from engine supplies to turn-key project deliveries. The role of Services is significant in the main customer industries. The marine industry The main vessel segments covered by Ship Power are Merchant, Offshore, Cruise&Ferry, Navy and Special vessels. Ship Power customers comprise both shipyards and ship owners. General shipbuilding and shipping market drivers Demand in the shipbuilding and shipping industries is basically driven by the development of the global economy and its impact on trade and needed transport capacity. The global economy also influences the level of fuel prices, which in turn has both a direct and an indirect impact on the shipping and offshore industries. Other factors, such as shipyard capacity, new build prices, decommissioning and scrapping, interest and freight rates, and environmental considerations, also affect these industries. The main market driver for our Ship Power business is the global demand for new vessels, in particular regarding ships built for seaborne cargo transportation, offshore oil exploration and support, cruise and ferry services, and for naval contracting. Main drivers for Wärtsilä's Ship Power business • Developments in the global economy • Development of world trade and needed transport capacity • Development of oil and gas prices Competitors and market position Wärtsilä Ship Power has continuously broadened its portfolio, which today ranges from engines and propulsion equipment to electrical equipment, automation and ship design. Our competitive advantage lies in having the broadest offering in the industry. This offering is backed by the capability to build environmentally sound solutions, and by the best service support throughout the lifecycle of the product.

The main customer groups within these markets are utilities, Independent Power Producers (IPP's) and industrial manufacturers in industries such as the cement, mining and textile industries. Wärtsilä's power plant projects are financed by the customer's own cash flow or through debt financing, typically from local financial markets. As a result, Wärtsilä power plants are funded in many geographical markets. Wärtsilä does not provide funding to its customers, but provides support in finding funding solutions for them. General market drivers in Power Plants Demand for power generation is driven primarily by economic development. As energy consumption grows, the demand for both new power generation equipment and replacement equipment for older capacity increases correspondingly. Looking ahead, growth is expected to be higher in non-OECD countries, due to increasing industrialisation and improving living standards. The majority of Wärtsilä's Power Plants business comes from the emerging markets. In emerging markets, as well as in remote areas, demand for flexible baseload power plants burning heavy fuel oil (HFO) is driven by growth in electricity consumption, and by developments in the price of oil. Demand for gas driven plants increases along with the introduction of gas networks to the emerging markets.

In terms of Services’ revenues, approximately 60% derives from the marine industry. General market drivers for Services The ultimate market driver in the marine service business is the activity levels of the vessel fleet. The amount of idled and anchored vessels has a direct impact on the Services business. The speed at which vessels are operated also has a certain impact on the business. The marine service business is strongly driven by the existing, as well as new, environmental regulations. Lifecycle efficiency, for which the availability, reliability and economic viability of the equipment are all very important, drives the Services business in both end markets. Other drivers that are highly emphasised are the need to lower operating costs, and the need for enhanced safety. Today an important driver for the power plants after market is the trend towards outsourcing the operations and management of power plants. In the future, we believe this will become a more important driver also for the marine markets. Wärtsilä offers efficiency and monitoring solutions for these needs. Competition and market position There is no single competitor with the ability to supply such a broad offering, on a 24/7 basis, from one single source, globally. Each service product has, therefore, its own set of competitors and challenges. There are only a few global players to talk of, thus competition is mainly local.

This was a much faster and more significant recovery than expected. The improvement was backed by a recovery in trade and ship owner earnings, as well as by attractive new building prices. A more positive outlook for ship financing, together with low interest rates, also contributed to the development. While the first half of the year was characterised by high contracting activity for bulk carriers, the second half saw a similar increase in contracting activity for container vessels and more specialised vessel types. The offshore segment continued strong throughout the year and demand was good especially for floating production units. In the fourth quarter demand for more specialised vessels was good. Ship power geographical markets China the biggest market As expected, the Asian shipbuilding market, and especially China emerged stronger than earlier after the downturn. In 2010, China secured the majority of global new building orders, followed by Korea. Both Japan and Europe lost market share in 2010. Growing shipbuilding nations, such as Brazil, were active throughout the year and secured a good share of orders. In 2010, Chinese ship owners were the most active, ordering more than 20% of all vessels ordered. German owners, traditionally strong in shipping, were slow in ordering whereas Greek owners continued to be active. Ship Power market shares Wärtsilä's market share in medium speed main engines increased from 32% at the end of the previous quarter to 42%. The company's market share in low speed main engines increased slightly to 13% (12). In auxiliary engines the market shares increased slightly to 4% (3).

Wärtsilä Ship Power's strategy is to be the most valuable business partner in each lifecycle phase. Operational flexibility For vessel types requiring considerable operational mode variations, flexible machinery arrangements have been specified for decennia. Vessel speed is increasingly used as a mean of adapting fleet capacity and is replacing constant speed operating, which in turn means that more vessel types have a need for flexible operating arrangements. Machinery solutions have traditionally focused mainly on achieving the best performance at a specified design point. However, enhanced flexibility requires good performance from the installation over a much wider operating range. Electric and hybrid solutions provide a flatter vessel efficiency curve at the expense of more complex solutions. Each ship is built for a dedicated purpose making it unique and as such the prototype of itself. To limit risk, yards and owners tend to be very conservative in introducing new concepts. Wartsila is stepping into this opportunity by offering integrated solutions for which performance guarantees can be given, thereby lowering the threshold for yards and operators to implement more sustainable solutions. The electronically controlled RT-flex engines offer merchant vessels maximum flexibility within mechanical propulsion solutions. RT-flex engines can be operated at 10% of the nominal speed, and the electronic control enables the engine efficiency curve to be easily adapted to operational requirements. Continuously rising energy consumption is driving fuel prices up. Prior to the first maritime emissions legislation entering into force, seaborne transportation typically used the lowest remaining residue from crude oil distillation. Fuel composition has a direct impact on some emission types, and several emissions reduction technologies place requirements on the fuel. However, increased requirements on liquid fuels result in higher fuel costs and the increased cost of traditional fuels has decreased the price gap between these and alternative energy sources. Already today, natural gas can result in a lower total cost of ownership, depending on the emission limits that have to be achieved. Bio-fuels and high viscosity fuels may also become economically attractive solutions. Energy efficiency Many Wärtsilä products offer the highest efficiency in the market. Full scale measurements of the electrical losses from Wärtsilä's electrical power distribution system have shown values that exceed even our own expectations. In order to minimise electrical distribution losses for larger installations, Wärtsilä is currently scaling up its low loss concept by creating a variant for medium voltage as well. The power range of this solution will cover the demands of the largest cruise vessels. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report. Page numbers can differ in other self generated documents. 27 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 BUSINESS SHIP POWER AND SUSTAINABILITY The Wärtsilä Energopac is another example of a market leading component. Energopac is a rudder solution, which minimises the drag of the rudder by streamlining the water flow from the propeller to the rudder. Full scale measurements for this project have also exceeded expectations. Wärtsilä Energopac If quantum leaps in operational efficiency are to be made, improving the performance of individual products is not enough. In order to minimise safety margins between components, and to match the performance characteristics of the different components in the power train, an integrated approach is necessary. But it all starts with the propulsive power demand, which comes from the design of the vessel. Here again, Wärtsilä's involvement in ship design enables the achievement of truly optimised solutions. Having a properly designed installation does not guarantee the vessel having the most efficient operation. The complexity of installations has increased the number of parameters that influence performance, making it more difficult to achieve optimal operation of the vessel. Therefore, Wärtsilä has introduced the Wärtsilä Econometer, which measures actual performance and provides the crew with real time advice on how to operate the machinery more efficiently. Further steps are under development in this direction with Wärtsilä 3C, the Wärtsilä control and command centre. To make sustainable shipping a more achievable goal, Wärtsilä continues to challenge the industry with innovative conceptual designs that provide operators and owners with a vision for the specifications of more efficient vessels in the future. A large number of these suggestions have been collected and published in Wärtsilä's energy efficiency catalogue.

Page numbers can differ in other self generated documents. 28 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 BUSINESS SHIP POWER AND SUSTAINABILITY An innovative conceptual design combining several efficiency optimisers Emissions reduction Sea-born transportation competes with road, rail and air freighters. Because shipping is by far the most efficient form of transportation, the number of ships in operation worldwide has a significant impact on global emissions. The existing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission requirements set by the IMO will be tightened as of January 2011, a change known as IMO TIER II. Tier III, which comes into force in 2016, will require an 80% reduction in NOx emissions from current levels. Unlike TIERs I and II, the TIER III requirements for NO x emissions will only be applicable in designated areas (NECA). All Wärtsilä engines are IMO Tier II compliant and feature competitive fuel consumption performance. As the Tier III emission restrictions will be different inside and outside the designated areas, and because lowering NOx emissions has a negative impact on fuel efficiency, a switch on switch off solution is favoured. This allows vessels to meet emission requirements in the most efficient way, depending on where they are actually sailing. A number of similarly flexible concepts have been defined. The selection of the best concept is a project specific evaluation, and one that depends on the time the ship is operated inside and outside the emission control areas, and on the types of fuel available. Mathematical models that provide support for comparing alternative solutions based on the project specific mission profile are available. To meet sulphur dioxide (SOx) emission requirements, operators have a choice between primary and secondary methods. Wärtsilä engines are designed to operate on any fuel sulphur content. Exhaust gas scrubbing is an alternative solution for reducing SOx emissions. The Wärtsilä sulphur oxides (SOx) scrubber is the first of its kind to be granted the Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA) Compliance Certificate by the classification societies Det Norske Veritas and Germanischer Lloyd.

Page numbers can differ in other self generated documents. 29 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 BUSINESS SHIP POWER AND SUSTAINABILITY Secondary Nitrogen Oxides Reducer (NOR) equipment, fulfilling the most demanding NOx emission requirements, has been successfully applied for over a decade. Wärtsilä has added NOR equipment to its own portfolio, thereby ensuring optimal integration of the engine and NOR. The precise tuning of the engine and NOR results in better performance and lower cost, as well as minimises the need for additional measurements and improving dynamic behaviour. Because the engine and catalyst characteristics are tuned to work as an integrated system rather than being loose components installed in series and because the control system is based on the same platform, proper communication between engine and NOR is ensured. In addition to the existing legislation for NOx and SOx emissions, the IMO MEPC is developing legislation to control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships. The maximum allowable GHG emission levels will be defined according to the vessel's transportational performance (capacity * speed). Wärtsilä's lean burn gas engines emit 20 to 30% less GHG compared to diesel engines, thus enabling the design of vessels which would not be possible with diesel engines. Wärtsilä has developed a number of concepts, which improve total ship efficiency and enable the use of natural gas for powering ships. Our aim is to be at the forefront of all environmental and sustainability initiatives. The main drivers for the development of Wärtsilä solutions are future emissions legislation, fuel availability and price fluctuations, as well as increasing customer needs for more complete solutions rather than separate products. Our technology development is focused, therefore, on improving efficiency across a wide front that incorporates multifuel solutions and systems integration. Compliance with regulations is a natural starting point for all our product development. To reduce emissions to the water, our sealing systems offer environmentally sound alternatives that prevent the spilling of oil from ships into the environment. We also offer efficient treatment systems for sludge and bilge water. The Wärtsilä ballast water treatment system is based on the ultra violet principle to avoid the use of chemicals that end up in the sea. This intelligent design not only has minimal internal power consumption, but also has a very low pressure drop. This minimises the additional energy consumption from the ballast water pumps.

The orders were predominantly for small and medium size projects. Industrial output is increasing in most emerging markets which, in combination with population growth and enhanced standard of living, is driving the need for more power generation. The installed base of wind power generation has also increased, which is creating a need for flexible power generation. The financial crisis led to the postponement of investments for power generation in 2009, and this is now creating demand in several markets. Power generation market overview As energy consumption grows, the need for both new power generation equipment increases, as does demand for replacement equipment for older capacity. Today, the global installed power generation capacity totals approximately 4,700 GW, out of which over half is in OECD-countries. Going forward, growth is expected to be stronger in non-OECD countries, due to increasing industrialisation and higher living standards. The majority of Wärtsilä's Power Plants business derives from these emerging markets. Heavy fuel oil (HFO) has traditionally been the dominant fuel for power generation in emerging markets but demand for gas driven plants increases along with the introduction of gas networks. OECD-countries have focused on the development of wind power and increasing the share of natural gas power generation with the target to ramp down old coal based installations. In the USA, the introduction of shale gas has been rapid, and has made the natural gas prices very competitive. Wärtsilä is the only player in the market with such a broad gas engine portfolio within its power range. Power Plants market position The size of Wärtsilä's target markets is approximately 15,000 MW and Wärtsilä's yearly delivery volumes are 2,500-3,000 MW. The development of the heavy fuel oil driven power plants market, where Wärtsilä has a market share of over 50%, is rather stable whereas the market for gas driven power plants is growing.

This development is driven by climate policies, energy security and economics. Carbon intensive energy sources are being replaced by low carbon fuels, such as natural gas and renewable solutions. Energy savings and efficiency improvements are being encouraged, and even legally enforced, at every level. Wärtsilä's energy solutions offer a unique combination of flexibility, high efficiency, and low emissions. Many different fuels, including bio-fuels, can be used efficiently, which helps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The flexibility of Wärtsilä's solutions enables the development of a reliable energy infrastructure, wherein most of the sustainable characteristics are already known. Efficiency development We continuously seek improvements in the present engine portfolio, and are developing new engine concepts for the future. As a power plant contractor, we develop our power plants in parallel with the engines. This enables us to optimise both the performance and the reliability of our power plant offering. We offer high efficiency, single cycle solutions and focus on improving efficiency even further through the use of e.g. combined cycle solutions. Power plant net efficiency can be further improved by plant design and by optimising internal power consumption. Such solutions minimise not only fuel and water consumption, but also the emissions per unit of energy, thereby providing major environmental benefits. Flexibility Flexibility is one of the main features of Wärtsilä's power plant solutions. The high modularity of our products makes it easy for our customers to construct an optimally sized plant, and to later expand its size to meet future needs. Fuel flexibility has many advantages for our customers, notably the lowering of energy production costs by using low cost fuels, minimising CO2 emissions, and the ability to convert from one fuel to another based on fuel availability. The unique operational flexibility of our products comprises: • Very fast plant starts and stops • High ramp rates • High part-load efficiency • A broad load range Frequent starting and stopping does not affect the operational costs of the plant. This is unique, no other competing technology offers the same. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

Such capacity is non-dispatchable and variable, which creates potential for other power units to balance the system. Wärtsilä is in a good position to meet this need, as the operational flexibility of our products makes them easily adaptable to the needs of the grid. Reducing emissions Wärtsilä places high priority on developing diverse and flexible emission reduction techniques. Since emission requirements and the fuels used differ widely, a comprehensive range of products is required in order to offer competitive solutions. Mitigating the effects of climate change calls for substantial reductions in greenhouse gases (GHG). We believe that the importance of natural gas will increase in the future. Consequently, the multi-fuel capability of our power plant solutions becomes an increasingly significant competitive advantage, as it enables the utilisation of all liquid and gaseous bio-fuels that may become available on a wider scale. Wärtsilä focuses on developing decentralised energy solutions that emit fewer GHG emissions.

In order to promote the long-term interests of Wärtsilä and its stakeholders, the company strives to maintain the highest legal and ethical standards in all its business practices. Each employee is expected to act responsibly and with integrity and honesty, and to comply with this code and its underlying policies and instructions. Compliance with laws All business and other activities of Wärtsilä shall be carried out strictly in compliance with all applicable laws, and under the principles of good corporate citizenship in each country where such activities take place. Each employee is expected to comply with the requirements of those laws and regulations that apply to Wärtsilä's operations and to his/her job, and with the Wärtsilä principles of good corporate citizenship. Openness Wärtsilä promotes openness and transparency, as well as continuous dialogue with its stakeholders, including customers and other business partners, shareholders, personnel, authorities, local communities and the media. Stock exchange rules and competitive considerations may, however, in some cases restrict such openness and transparency. Wärtsilä strives to be honest and accurate when communicating with its stakeholders, and Wärtsilä employees shall make their statements in accordance with this principle. Respect for human and labour rights Wärtsilä supports and respects the protection of human rights as defined in the United Nation's Universal Declaration on Human Rights. No employee is allowed to take any action that violates these human rights principles, either directly or indirectly. Wärtsilä supports basic labour rights as defined by the International Labour Organization. In this respect, Wärtsilä upholds the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.

Anti-corruption No Wärtsilä company or any of its employees may, directly or indirectly, promise, offer, pay, solicit, or accept bribes or kickbacks of any kind, including money, benefits, services or anything of value. Such payments and favours may be considered bribery, which violates local legislation and internationally recognised principles for combating corruption and bribery. Environment Wärtsilä's target is to develop and produce for its customers environmentally advanced solutions and services that fulfil essential requirements, such as low emissions and high efficiency. Efforts are made to achieve sustainable development by means of raw material selection, processes, products, wastes, and emissions through the use of the latest technical advances. Each employee shall comply with the policies and instructions regarding environmental protection. Relationship with authorities and local communities Wärtsilä maintains constructive co-operation with authorities and regulatory bodies, at both local and international levels.

Through dialogue in various forums and direct relationships with stakeholders, a deeper understanding of the key issues and expectations related to sustainable development can be attained. In June, Wärtsilä joined the World Bank-led Global Gas Flaring Reduction organisation, which strives to reduce the flaring or burning of natural gas associated with oil production. The aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Also in June, Wärtsilä joined the Global Compact Nordic Network, which is a local network under the umbrella of the United Nations Global Compact. The purpose of the network is to promote the Global Compact, provide a learning forum, showcase best practices, and inspire and assist other companies in implementing the ten principles. Wärtsilä is participating in developing the best practices for sustainability reporting, and joined in October the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) global network of organisational stakeholders. This group promotes transparency, responsibility, and sustainable development. Wärtsilä and the Baltic Sea Action Group organised a joint conference on future shipping solutions for the Baltic Sea, held in June in Helsinki, Finland. The conference included various stakeholders, including customers, authorities, and universities, and was aimed at finding practical solutions for the protection of the Baltic Sea environment. Efforts were made to identify future needs in developing more environmental solutions that help the shipping industry to fulfil its responsibilities towards the environment and society in general. Wärtsilä also joined the Sustainable Shipping Initiative (SSI), a programme initiated by Forum for the Future. This initiative brings together the industry's leading organisations to show what can and must be done in order for shipping to contribute to, and benefit from, a sustainable future. This global taskforce gives leading industry players, and their supply chain stakeholders, a framework for assessing the extent of their sustainability challenges. By understanding their role in a sustainable future, companies can gain a competitive advantage and support the development of good policy in the process. SSI was founded earlier this year by Forum for the Future in collaboration with WWF, Maersk Line, BP Shipping, Lloyd's Register, Gearbulk, and ABN Amro.

The analysis is based on international norms on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues in accordance with the UN Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI). It evaluates both the companies' present status and readiness for the future. The analysis model is easy to implement, and gives an immediate overview over a company's sustainability status, which can reduce the investment risk.

Since 90 per cent of global trade is carried by sea, shipping obviously has a huge daily impact on people's lives. Shipping is also the most efficient and cleanest way of transporting goods over long distances, and must continue to be so in the future. The future of shipping will be determined by economics, technological development, geopolitical trends, energy resources, social values, and environmental aspects, as well as by the shipping industry itself. The effects of these factors on companies, governments, and people's everyday lives will be significant. Scenarios represent one means of making sense of a complex environment, and are widely used to understand different ways that future events might unfold. They help companies, governments and organisations with long-term strategic thinking in a fast changing world. Wärtsilä's Shipping Scenarios 2030 were produced by combining extensive expert input, quality research, hard work, dedication, and some imagination, and were published in 2010. Complex world condensed into three scenarios The analysis of a massive amount of information yielded three plausible scenarios. Rough Seas In the world of Rough Seas, a scarcity of resources is predominant. Wealth is divided unequally among nations, resulting in tension. Climate change adds further stress. New trade routes have emerged as a result of two key developments: an increase in bilateral agreements, and industries moving to resource-rich areas. The entire logistics chain is optimised regionally and national governments control ports. The volumes of water and agricultural products being transported have increased significantly. Global tensions have increased the need for armed escorts, also at sea. Yellow River In Yellow River, China dominates the global arena economically, geopolitically, and in shipping. China is no longer the world's cheapest manufacturer. Instead, labour and resource-intensive manufacturing has moved to Africa and to other Asian countries. Economic growth is significantly slower in the West, and climate change is tackled only on a regional level. Most of the big shipping companies are Chinese-owned, and trade routes have shifted according to Chinese trade interests. New ports are being built in Africa, Eastern Russia and India, and Chinese ports have grown into sophisticated, integrated logistics centres.

Global mega-corporations and mega-cities have gained power over the nation states. Governments co-operate on the governance of climate issues and free trade protocols. Climate change is perceived as an opportunity, and innovating green solutions has become a lifestyle. In this world, logistics is king. Most goods are transported between the mega-cities, and areas rich in resources such as clean water, food and energy. Environmental challenges have led to the development of new types of vessels; desalination, waste management, and recycling ships are anchored outside megacities. Sustainable cruise vacations are a growing trend.

This requires efficient, profitable and competitive company operations. Good economic performance establishes a platform for the other aspects of sustainability environmental and social responsibility. Creating economic added value Wärtsilä's purpose is to create value for its various stakeholders. The focus is on profitability and raising shareholder value. Achieving this depends on our ability to satisfy the expectations of our other stakeholders as well. These include providing customers with high-quality and environmentally sound products, solutions and services, building long-term partnerships with suppliers, offering employees competitive compensation and working conditions, and contributing to the well-being of the local communities in which we operate. Despite the uncertain market conditions, our success supported our strategy of profitable growth. Our target has been to grow 6-7% over the cycle and our profitability target (EBIT%) has been 8-10% of net sales over the cycle with a range of +/2%. In 2010, Wärtsilä's net sales fell 13% and totalled EUR 4,553 million. Europe's share of net sales was 28%, Asia's 39%, Americas' 23% and others' 11%. Profitability remained at a good level and totalled EUR 487 million (10.7%). After the review period Wärtsilä redefined its financial targets. Our target is to grow faster than global GDP. Our operating profit margin (EBIT%) target is 14% at the peak of the cycle. Even at the trough of the cycle, our target is to keep the operating profit margin above 10%.

We aim to have deep partnerships with our key suppliers in order to ensure that both parties mutually understand and are able to respond to our strict process and product requirements. Apart from financial benefits, partnerships create added value for suppliers through the knowledge and development support we offer them and at the same time Wärtsilä gains from the supplier competence. Successful partnerships can also assist a local supplier in expanding internationally by becoming a part of our global supply chain. In 2010, the value of goods, materials and services purchased by Wärtsilä was EUR 2,927 million. Wärtsilä has more than 3,700 active suppliers, most of whom are located in Europe where we have our main production units. We are also continuously investing in developing a strong supply chain network in Asia. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

We also employed thousands of people indirectly through our supply chain. In order to be able to recruit competent and motivated people, we endeavour to offer employees competitive salaries, opportunities for continuous personal development and a good working environment. Developing employee skills and competences is of critical importance both for our business performance and for the development of the employees. Wages and salaries totalled EUR 773 million in 2010. This figure includes basic salaries as well as payments based on various profit sharing and incentive schemes, which cover some 60% of the total workforce. Pension Cover The pension cover is based on the legislation and agreements in force in each country. In Finland most of the pension obligations are covered by the Employee Pensions system (TyEL). The largest defined benefit plans are used in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Most of these defined benefit pension plans are managed by pension funds, and their assets are not included in the Group's assets. Wärtsilä's subsidiaries make their payments to pension funds in accordance with the local legislation and practice in each country. Authorised actuaries in each country have performed the actuarial calculations required for the defined benefit plans. More information on the Group's pension obligations can be found in the Financial Review, Note 21. Pension obligations. Wage levels Wärtsilä applies and follows in all countries the local employment legislation and respects the local collective labour agreements, which often define the minimum wage levels. In addition to that, entry level salaries are benchmarked against the market references by function and educational qualification. Laws and regulations give the minimum level, but often the actual salaries exceed these levels. A total compensation package is tailored for each country aligned with both corporate rewarding guidelines and local market practices. The base salary is set to meet market conditions, the demands of the job and individual competence and performance.

Wärtsilä has executed sustainability programmes all over the world to the benefit of the local populations. Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti, Wärtsilä provided free technical assistance, manpower, and spare parts to the local power authority, Electricité de Haiti, to help rebuild the power infrastructure. Wärtsilä sent a team of experts to Port-au-Prince within three weeks of the disaster, which destroyed large parts of the city. The team assessed the damage to the Varreux power plant, and helped local operators to re-start the undamaged engines and to generate electricity to the local community. Wärtsilä has decided to donate 1.5 million euro to support science, research and teaching in Finnish Universities. Universities are important partners to Wärtsilä in its research and product development. The aim of this donation is to support the continued future success and high quality of Finnish higher education. Wärtsilä supported a charity project in the village of Guiyan, Guanghan City, China. A primary school for 250 students was built here following the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, which destroyed nearly 7.000 schools. The project was supported by the China Children and Teenagers' Fund, and by the local government. It received donations from close to 30 corporations, as well as from 100 individuals, the Embassy of Finland, and numerous volunteer workers. Constructing school buildings, developing educational possibilities, and enhancing vocational training are objectives of the humanitarian projects carried out by Finn Church Aid in Southern Sudan, Africa. This work is supported by Wärtsilä within the framework of a multi-year partnership programme. The first school building is ready and the second is being finalised. In Brazil, Wärtsilä employees have been active in helping to establish a volunteer group, known as Grupo Grãos. The group was formed in 2003, and volunteer work is carried out in all locations where Wärtsilä has offices or long term projects and contracts. In 2010, a special Doers Day was held in ten cities with 496 volunteers, 186 of them Wärtsilä employees. Institutions receiving support included orphanages, daycare centres, and shelters for the mentally and physically challenged. The volunteers entertained children and gave company to the elderly. They also carried out building and painting work, donated blood, and registered as bone marrow donors. The work of these volunteers, together with Wärtsilä´s donations and support, has led to huge improvements in those institutions receiving support. Local communities have greatly benefited as a result. Six of Wärtsilä's customers and several suppliers were our partners in the Doers Day activities.

For us environmental responsibility has two dimensions: products and operations. Most of our efforts to improve our environmental performance, including within our operations, are conducted as part of product development and improvement. This work is supported by operational measures, which are based on achieving high environmental standards and continuous improvement. To continually improve environmental performance within the company's operations requires the organisation to constantly work in a systematic way. This work is guided by our strategy and its environmental targets, the Code of Conduct, and the company's policies relating to Quality, Occupational Health and Safety and the Environment, and is co-ordinated and monitored by the Environmental Forum, the Quality and Operational Development Board and the EHS management team. In developing our operations, processes and products, we endeavour to use the latest technologies available for improving efficiency in areas such as material and energy consumption, and for reducing and managing emissions and waste. Wärtsilä has defined a process for the development of a product environmental strategy and its targets. The process includes the identification of aspects and impacts of the products, the means to influence these impacts, as well as the identification of enabling and restricting boundary conditions and the analyses of the information, and preparation and implementation of the strategy and the targets. Wärtsilä continuously develops and improves its operations and products with the help of certified environmental management systems. Our principle is to apply certified EHS (Environmental, Health and Safety) management systems based on ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 in all Group companies, excluding those companies focusing purely on sales. These units are required to apply Wärtsilä's internal EHS model. Our EHS management systems cover all the operations of our subsidiaries, which means that we are able to promote environmental protection and reduce adverse impacts on a wide front.

As a result of our long-span development work, we have managed to develop a range of engines that feature both high efficiency and low emissions. Wärtsilä's technologies and solutions provide various alternatives to reduce the climate change impact. Engine efficiency improvement High efficiency is important in the control of climate change, and with low emissions our products meet the various environmental regulations. The efficiency of Wärtsilä diesel and gas engines ranges between 42-52%, depending on the engine type. Gas and multifuel engines The Wärtsilä dual-fuel (DF) engine is another innovation having a significant effect on controlling climate change. Thanks to the technology developed by Wärtsilä, our customers can flexibly employ the same engine using various fuels. This also makes it possible to reduce the impact on the environment. DF-engines are used in power plants and for powering LNG-carriers and also for other types of vessels. This single solution means that the total CO2 emissions from all our current customers' LNG carrier applications will be reduced by several millions of tons, when compared to traditional gas transportation. At the same time, the availability of gas will be improved and the environmental impacts of gas transportation will be reduced. CO2 emissions can be reduced even more effectively with renewable energy sources, such as liquid bio-fuels.

Wärtsilä‘s development process is geared to ensuring the reliability and safety features of the end product, and extensive validation and testing programmes are undertaken before the product is fully released. By focusing on the initial stages of the development process the development time for new solutions can be reduced without compromising the emphasis on reliability and safety. Individual components are validated during their design by using advanced calculations and simulation tools. This method enables Wärtsilä to identify areas of improvement at an early stage in the process, thereby reducing the amount of component testing needed. The actual component and technology testing allows a speedy validation of the systems, which results in faster development and market introduction for new products. In always seeking newer and better solutions, Wärtsilä is able to perform validation testing on existing installations in co-operation with its customers. The customer benefits by getting the first insight into new technologies while Wärtsilä gains long-term experience under controlled conditions. A typical field installation operates for 6,000 hours per year. When the product has successfully passed all the process steps and the performance meets Wärtsilä's high standards, it can be brought to the market.

For example, a peaking efficiency of 52% for the best engines is one of the highest efficiency ratings among existing prime movers. However, improving the efficiency of a single component does not necessarily guarantee the best overall outcome. For instance, more can be achieved through comprehensive ship design, systems integration and machinery optimisation. Similarly, in power plants, by combining various technologies an overall efficiency rating of 90% is possible. Total efficiency for ships Improving total ship efficiency reduces life-cycle costs and emissions. By combining our knowledge of automation, machinery, propulsion and ship design into a single integrated solution, a truly efficient ship operation can be achieved. From a longer viewpoint, the potential for improving energy efficiency has been estimated to be 30-50%. This will be achieved by optimising component performance, ship design, waste heat recovery and the recovery of other losses, weather and voyage routing and taking advantage of potential new technologies. The efficiency of the ship can be improved also by using concepts such as • the Low Loss concept, which reduces the losses in the electrical power train by 30-50% • counter-rotating propulsion • optimisation of the hull design. Several joint development programmes with customers are currently on-going and are aimed at significantly reducing their operating costs. System integration enables efficiency improvements while at the same time customers benefit from having proven solutions from a single supplier. Yards can better optimise their building schedules and owners get proven solutions, with lifecycle support, that are easier to manage. Engine efficiency Engine efficiency has always been high on our agenda. However, the improvement of efficiency is becoming challenging by the day as the emissions requirements become increasingly stringent. Amongst the reasons for our success in this field, integrated engine functionalities that enable low emissions and high engine efficiency have been a major factor. Air and fuel admissions are controlled by an automated system that provides optimal combustion under all operative conditions. Wärtsilä‘s extensive experience in component design has led to the development of combustion chambers capable of withstanding higher cylinder pressures and temperatures. This contributes to engine efficiency directly and positively. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report. Page numbers can differ in other self generated documents. 96 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 SUSTAINABILITY IMPROVING EFFICIENCY Wärtsilä have several on-going programmes aimed at ensuring the high efficiency of its engines, while at the same time significantly reducing their emissions. Innovative technologies, including two-stage turbocharging, variable inlet and exhaust valve timing and electronically controlled fuel injection such as common-rail, are important contributors in this task. During 2010 Wärtsilä has announced its first product with 2-stage turbocharging. Heat recovery and energy conversion improvements The utilisation of fuel energy can be further improved by using heat recovery concepts and secondary cycles. Steam-based combined cycles are applied widely in diesel engine applications, and are expected to gain a foothold also in bigger gas engine plants. Organic rankine cycle products are being brought to the marine market and its use in stationary side is being considered. Further improvements can be expected by designing engines for secondary cycles. Propeller efficiency upgrades Successful conversions to achieve propeller efficiency increases up to 10% can be established in different vessel markets, such as the dredging industry, ferries, fishing vessels and tankers. This improvement is made possible by exchanging the open type propeller for one operating in a nozzle. Wärtsilä continued exploring project specific knowledge regarding the interaction between the propulsor and the ship‘s hull in order to avoid added resistance. The propeller's efficiency, amongst other parameters, is an important consideration for achieving economic sailing. Fouling, surface roughening, and leading edge damage to the propeller, when in service, can lead to efficiency losses of 3-7%. For ships such as oil tankers and container vessels with annual fuel costs exceeding 5 million euro, such propulsion degradation can easily cost several hundred thousands of euro a year. The deliverable of on-going projects investigating the Efficiency loss of Propellers in Service, will be the performance based maintenance of a ship's propeller and will thus increase the vessel's overall efficiency throughout its lifecycle.

A recent example of Wärtsilä's ability to meet these criteria is the Fri-El Acerra combined cycle plant, located in Naples, Italy. The Fri-El Acerra plant is equipped with four Wärtsilä 18V46 diesel engines running on liquid bio fuel (LBF). All four engines are equipped with separate waste heat recovery steam generators (WHRSG) for maximum production of superheated steam. The steam is then fed to a common condensing steam turbine for additional electricity production. A water cooled condenser is used, with the water being cooled by cooling towers. The combined cycle plant has been in operation since November 2009, with the first measurements being taken the following month at a 14°C ambient temperature. The second performance measurements were taken six months later at 28°C ambient temperature. Main process parameters of the combined cycle system: Design Measured Measured 2.12.2009 4-6.6.2010 Ambient temperature 25 14 28 °C Engine gross power, 1 engine average 17 190 17 218 17 171 kWe (total 4 engines) Exhaust gas temperature to WHRSG 374 367 396 °C Exhaust gas temperature from WHRSG 195 177 189 °C Exhaust gas mass flow to WHRSG 30.5 29.9 30.5 kg/s Steam pressure 12 11.7 11.8 bar(a) Steam temperature 344 353 346 °C Steam mass flow to turbine 8.2 8.7 9.2 kg/s Turbine back pressure 0.08 0.06 0.09 bar(a) Condensate temperature after condenser 41.5 42 43 °C Condensate/make-up temperature to feed water tank 77 77 77 °C Steam turbine gross power (1 steam turbine) 5 200 5 550 5 822 kWe Additional gross electricity 7.6 8.1 8.5 % This additional power, generated from the waste heat, directly improves the electrical efficiency of the power plant. At the same time, it correspondingly reduces CO2 emissions to the same extent, or even more so if the electricity is produced in a less efficient manner.

On the marine side, scrubbers can be found economically very attractive in meeting the future IMO sulphur requirements. Wärtsilä's on-going development and commercialisation project regarding a fresh water marine scrubber is successfully proceeding. The technology developed by Wärtsilä was approved during summer 2009 by two major classification societies, and is thus the first such certified solution in the world. Wärtsilä will deliver a marine scrubber to a containership in August 2011. This is the first commercial marine scrubber project for a main engine. As a next stage, the development project for a novel hybrid scrubber capable of being operated both with fresh and sea water is ongoing. Low sulphur fuels The coming regulations limiting the sulphur content in marine fuels will inevitably create some new challenges for customers. Low sulphur fuels have, in most cases, lower viscosity than ordinary fuels, and this will affect the behaviour of the fuel injection systems in diesel engines. Therefore, modifications are often recommended, not only to the engine but also possibly to boilers. Wärtsilä will be able to offer its customers support in adapting to future low sulphur fuel qualities. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

The Wärtsilä SOx reducer scrubber system is an efficient and cost-effective alternative to the use of low sulphur fuel for reducing SO x emissions. Wärtsilä is the first manufacturer to have been awarded a marine SOx scrubber certificate issued by Det Norske Veritas and Germanischer Lloyd. Performance As a default, the scrubber system is designed for fuel having a maximum sulphur content of 3.5%. The SO x reduction efficiency is 97.15%, corresponding to a reduction of fuel sulphur content from 3.5% to 0.1%. This is the typical guaranteed performance of the system. Configurations The SOx scrubber system is available in two different configurations: • Main stream scrubber • Integrated scrubber The main stream scrubber is designed to be installed in the main exhaust gas stream of an individual diesel engine. The exhaust gas pressure loss over the main stream scrubber at full gas flow is typically approximately 800 Pa. The integrated scrubber is designed to clean the exhaust gases of several main and auxiliary engines, as well as onboard oil-fired boilers, with a single scrubber unit. The integrated scrubber system does not increase the exhaust gas back pressure, thus making it particularly suitable also for oil-fired boilers and all diesel engines. Test and testing results onboard MT Suula A Wärtsilä fresh water testing unit was installed onboard the Neste oil tanker MT Suula . Testing of the unit was started in 2008 and completed in 2010. The MT Suula sailed mainly around the Baltic Sea, but also visited North Sea harbours. Normal ship operations were not interrupted or limited during the tests. Test data was recorded in many ways, including a tamper-proof recording device. Gas and liquid samples were taken. Classification societies surveyed the certification process. The test results were very positive. The measured sulphur reduction was excellent, and well within the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) most stringent limits. Furthermore, other measured exhaust and effluent parameters were favourable. The effluent was very clean, and the sludge produced by the water cleaning unit was found suitable for normal disposal at port reception facilities. The scrubber and its auxiliary systems worked with a good level of reliability. Sea conditions did not affect or limit the scrubber's use.

Measurement equipment from a 3rd party accredited company has an accuracy of ±2 ppm. For reference 0.1 % sulphur corresponds to 20...30 ppm. As a part of the certification test, the effluent quality was demonstrated to classification societies. The Wärtsilä scrubber fulfils all the effluent quality requirements thanks to the efficiency of the Wärtsilä water treatment unit. The IMO resolution MEPC.184 (59) defines limits for pH, turbidity, PAHphe and nitrate content. Metals in the effluent were also measured. The tests showed that after the water treatment unit, PAHphe concentration and turbidity are clearly below the IMO limits. The pH of the effluent was over 6.5, which is the IMO limit for effluent pH. Certification tests also proved that nitrate concentration in the effluent is below the IMO limits. Reduction in concentration of chemical components in the bleed-off treatment unit with a fuel sulphur content of 3.4% m/m. More information can be found in Wärtsilä's public test report.

The new NOx limit is 20% below the 2010 emission levels. All Wärtsilä portfolio products are today IMO NOx Tier II compliant. In addition, a global restriction of sulphur content in fuel will be limited from 2012 to 3.5%. In restricted SECA areas, a maximum sulphur content of 1% is in force from 2010. The next emissions level, IMO Tier III, will be valid from 2016 onwards. This is expected to demand a reduction in NOx levels of 80% from Tier I levels. An 80% NOx reduction requires a step change in terms of engine technology and product offerings. Wärtsilä is looking into different solutions involving: • Engine internal technologies • After treatment technologies • Fuel (Gas) related technologies Development of all these technologies will be needed, as will the integration between them. A driving factor in this work is the lifecycle cost of the solution. Since lifecycle costs in 2016 are difficult to predict today, Wärtsilä is working on multiple solutions for meeting these future emission levels. Regardless of the technology preferred by our customers, Wärtsilä intends to have a competitive product in line with our status of being the preferred supplier. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) will play an important role in the future, and it is essential to ensure that combinations of SCR and scrubbers can be applied. Wärtsilä has experience in SCR systems with wide range of fuels. Wärtsilä is able to deliver also SCR solutions for high sulphur application with or without scrubbers. However, further development and commercialisation work will be carried out to optimise the system for a wider scope of applications, and will take into consideration various side effects and boundary conditions.

In addition to the environmental benefits, savings in a ship's operating costs can also be gained from using LNG as fuel. During 2010, Wärtsilä signed a turnkey contract with Tarbit Shipping of Sweden to convert a chemical tanker, the ‘Bit Viking', to LNG propulsion, and to supply the ship with a Wärtsilä LNGPac system for the safe and convenient storage of LNG onboard. This is the first order for a Wärtsilä LNGPac system. The 25,000 dwt ‘Bit Viking' is operated by Statoil along the Norwegian coastline, and the conversion will enable the vessel to qualify for lower NOx emission taxes under the Norwegian government's NOx fund scheme. As a result of the conversion, the ship's emissions will be significantly reduced. Wärtsilä is currently developing solutions that will enable the use of LNG while the ship is in port. The focus of the development is on the storage system, and is aimed at minimising the negative space impact and structural modifications needed for existing ships.

For gas engines Wärtsilä is evaluating a set of methods that reduce the THC levels 30-90%. Complementing the pure engine development work, efforts are underway to design, test and validate a combined catalyst-based methane reduction system for the engine.

Wärtsilä has developed systems for the treatment of oily water for both land-based and onboard installations. Recent developments include treating oily water in combination with Bio-Sys technology. This reduces the concentration of chemical and biological oxygen demand (COD/BOD) from the outlet water of the plant from 300-400mg/l to less than 15 mg/l, which is below the World Bank standards. Both COD and BOD contribute to the depletion of oxygen in the water course. Wärtsilä's oily water treatment technology enables the oil content of discharge water to be reduced to a level of 5 ppm, which is also type approved by classification societies. In practice these systems typically achieve a level of 1 to 2 ppm, while the IMO regulations allow a discharge level of 15 ppm. In addition, the treatment system reduces heavy metal emissions of discharge water by 90 percent. Wärtsilä, together with Technology provider Trojan Marinex, has introduced during 2010 an advanced ballast water treatment system that protects local biodiversity from non-indigenous invasive species. These may cause a negative economic impact on society, reduced output from fisheries, and added costs for control and clean up measures. It is estimated that around USD 1.4 trillion per year is spent on clean ups, economic losses, and environmental damage related to ballast water transportation from one ecological zone to another. Our technology is free of any harmful residual products, has high biological efficacy, and is considered safe for personnel, for vessels, and for the environment. The system features a compact design that allows for easy installation onboard, whether it is for a new build or a conversion project, while its low power consumption contributes towards reduced energy costs.

Advanced engine technology, together with two-stage turbocharging, offers significant advantages in fuel consumption and engine emissions. The application of two-stage turbocharging technology on Wärtsilä diesel engines has been developed through close co-operation between Wärtsilä and ABB Turbo Systems. In this programme, Wärtsilä is focusing on developing advanced engine technology, which with the turbocharger, is able to reach the highest possible performance and become a cost-effective commercial solution for its customers. ABB Turbo Systems is delivering the turbocharging technology with defined performance in terms of airflow, pressure ratios and efficiency. Development of fuel cell technology A fuel cell is a clean, efficient and reliable method of producing energy making it a highly attractive option for distributed power generation. Wärtsilä has been developing fuel cell technology for decentralised power generation and marine applications since the year 2000. The company's fuel cell development team is focusing on developing, designing and manufacturing a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system. In this work Wärtsilä is taking advantage of its extensive know-how in combined heat and power generation, and the company's in-depth knowledge of its marine customers' needs. Part of the R&D programme covers the development of the WFC20 and WFC50 units, 20 kW and 50 kW SOFC units. Wärtsilä has continued operation of the first demonstration unit in Vaasa, where the fuel cell is driven by biogas collected from a landfill. A methanol based unit has been demonstrated within the METHAPU project, which was successfully concluded during 2010. Development of larger units have progressed through the manufacturing of two 50 kW units within the frames of DemoSOFC and Large SOFC projects, both of which are partially funded by the EU. Commercialisation of fuel cell units for onshore and offshore power plant applications is proceeding in parallel with the development program. Enabling gas operations in ships Multifuel operation using Wärtsilä's Dual Fuel (DF) technology offers environmental advantages of gas engines. It allows low CO2, NOx, SOx and particulate emissions, while having redundancy in terms of liquid fuel in case gas is not available. DF technology also allows a choice of fuel based on the cost and availability of gas vs. liquid fuel. The use of DF technology with gas as the fuel is an optimum solution for vessels that spend a lot of time in ECA zones, and for vessels that carry gas with them, i.e LNG carriers. Wärtsilä is developing a complete portfolio of medium-speed gas engines and related fuel handling equipment in order to be able to deliver solutions for LNG tankers and gas-fuelled ships in general.

Wärtsilä studies different fuel sources, such as vegetable oils, animal fats and emulsions, in its fuel laboratory. During this year, we have tested engines running on jatropha oil, fish oil, chicken oil, traditional animal fats and different kinds of synthetic bio-oils. Enabling global transition to a more sustainable electricity infrastructure Wärtsilä develops its products and market approach to offer high value solutions for a more modern and more sustainable energy infrastructure. Wärtsilä's dynamic grid stability solutions make it possible to install much larger quantities of variable, non-dispatchable wind power capacity to the electrical grids without losing system stability. The same dynamic power plant solutions offer unique value in grid contingency situations where dynamic features such as extremely fast starting (5 minutes to full load), loading and stopping, are of paramount importance. Additional benefits are high energy efficiency over a wide load range, multifuel operation, no water usage, and the ability to locate the power generation facility in the load pockets, i.e. inside cities, even in California with the most stringent emission requirements. The combination of wind power and Wärtsilä dynamic power plants offers high potential for dramatically reducing CO2 worldwide.

The first WFC20 fuel cell unit was installed onboard the Wallenius car carrier ‘M/S Undine'. The Wärtsilä FC20 power unit is fuelled by methanol, and has an output of 20kW. Furthermore, its' SOx, NOx and particulate emissions are close to zero. A demonstration of the fuel cell technology in a marine application was carried out within the framework of the METHAPU project, in co-operation with Wallenius Marine, Lloyds Register, Det Norske Veritas, and the University of Genova. Product development in Wärtsilä aims to be proactive and well ahead of impending regulations. The aim is to offer equipment and solutions that not only meet customer needs, but which also satisfy regulatory requirements in the years to come. In addition to the development and shipboard demonstration of the fuel cell technology, the project has played an important role in the formulation of rules and regulations for marine fuel cell applications, and the use of methanol as a fuel in commercial shipping. This partially EU funded research project was successfully concluded in October 2010 after more than 1,000 hours of global operation in a marine environment.

This 36-month and EUR 26 million project is steered by two leading engine designers and manufacturers, Wärtsilä and MAN Diesel and Turbo, and it brings together 32 partners across Europe. Continuation of research under this framework will ensure the exploitation of the created know-how and partnerships within the first HERCULES project, and will penetrate into new areas. One aim of the project is to develop new technologies to reduce gaseous and particulate emissions from marine engines. A second objective is to increase engine efficiency and reliability, which in turn will reduce specific fuel consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and lifecycle costs. Reductions of more than 70% in NOx emissions (compared to 2000 levels) and 10% in fuel consumption is sought by the year 2020. The technological themes of the HERCULES initiative have, since its inception in 2002, been higher efficiency, reduced emissions, and increased reliability for marine engines. However, for taking marine engine technology a step further towards improved sustainability in energy production and total energy economy, an extensive integration of the multitude of identified new technologies is required. Following the original vision, leading parties have decided to apply a third phase in 2012 called HERCULES-C, as a continuation of the very successful HERCULES programmes. The HERCULES-C Project is planned to run over a three-year period and has a targeted budget of EUR 19 million, bringing the total combined budget of the HERCULES programmes (2004-2015) to EUR 79 million. Cleen The Future Combustion Engine Power Plant (FCEP) research programme was started on January 1st, 2010. The program focuses on research topics and development efforts in the area of reciprocating engine technologies and related power plant technologies. The key areas of research include improvements in the combustion process, energy efficiency, emissions reduction methods, heat recovery systems, and power conversion technologies. In addition, fuel flexibility and the use of renewable fuels in combustion engines are central research areas. The programme objectives and scope have been set by the industry together with the research institutions, thereby enabling deep co-operation in jointly executing the programme and promoting breakthrough innovations across broad interfaces. The total cost of the FCEP programme is EUR 38 million. It will be covered by the participating companies (EUR 12.8 million) and research institutes (EUR 5.1 million). The remaining EUR 20 million has been applied for from the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes). The first period of the program has been successfully accomplished and activities for the second period have started. The program duration has been prolonged from three to four years with planned ending by December 31st, 2013. The consortium consists of the leading combustion engine and power equipment manufacturers, supported by local research institutes and universities. The seventeen consortium partners represent a very high level in technical and scientific excellence. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

Based on the results of lifecycle assessments, the majority of the environmental impacts of a diesel engine arise during the operation of the engine. These derive from the exhaust emissions and from the fuel supply chain relating to its operation. Wärtsilä manages the lifecycle of its products through product design, careful selection of suppliers, production methods, optimising transportation, maintenance and repair during the products' operational lifetime, and by training and advising customers.

The main environmental aspects of manufacturing relate to the use of energy and natural resources, and thus also to the emissions that are produced by the manufacturing processes. Product development also requires the testing of products and individual components which, alongside manufacturing, also loads the environment. However, the positive impacts of product improvements on the environment far outweigh the negative impacts of testing when taking the product's entire lifecycle into account. The main reasons for significant fluctuations in certain reported environmental performance indicators from year to year are: • Changes in production volumes • Changes in R&D testing programmes • Changes in the reporting scope and coverage. The environmental indexes used in connection with performance indicators are linked to the development of net sales. Therefore, increased investments in R&D during any particular year do not impact net sales, but do increase the absolute value of the indicator. Monitoring environmental impacts Within Wärtsilä, environmental impacts caused by operational activities are monitored as follows: • Participation in the monitoring of air quality with other local stakeholders • Measurement of air emissions • Charting of noise levels • Periodical effluent analysis • Soil analysis • Dispersion analyses and bio-indicator surveys.

Recycled material content of these metals vary depending on the material and supplier in question. E.g. recycled material, such as end-of-life coins and bronze propellers, is used in the casting of new propellers. In 2010 the total material usage was 100,896 tons (129,320). The major material groups were various metals 69% (66), sand 21% (21) and various chemicals 8% (10). This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

The fuels are used mainly in engine testing. The other purposes of use include heating, production and transportation. Electricity Wärtsilä uses electricity in its manufacturing operations for example, in machining components and in service workshops and offices. Both the electrical and the heat energy generated during engine test runs can be utilised. Wärtsilä's aim is to use the electrical energy for its own purposes while also selling part of this electrical energy to a local power company. Due to the nature of engine test runs, the production of electricity and the company's electricity demand are not equivalent; this allows the surplus energy to be sold to a local power company.

In several factories the heat generated in engine test runs is used for heating. Some factories and offices are connected to a local district heating network, some have their own heating plant, and some use electricity for heating. Water The water consumed by Wärtsilä can be divided into two categories: domestic use and cooling use. Domestic water is used mainly for sanitary purposes and by industrial equipment such as machine tools and washing machines. Some factories also use domestic water to produce moulds. Heat emissions into water systems arise from engine cooling and process cooling water. Wärtsilä companies use water from the local watercourse for their engine and process cooling needs. In such cases, the cooling water system is kept separate so that only heat is released into the natural water system. Wastewater is sewered and piped to the local wastewater treatment plant. If effluent is not suitable for sewage treatment, it is taken away for appropriate processing, for example to a special treatment plant for hazardous wastes.

This noise is mostly low frequency and is therefore not easily detected by the human ear. Wärtsilä has specifically addressed the issue of noise protection using technical means and has succeeded in lowering noise levels considerably. However, noise abatement is a continuous need and requires regular monitoring. Air emissions are mainly caused by test runs and the painting of completed engines or other Wärtsilä products. Test run emissions consist of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxides (CO2) and particles, as well as small amounts of other emission components. The painting of engines and other Wärtsilä products generates VOC (volatile organic compounds) emissions. Engine emissions are reduced through research and development, as well as product development and testing. These measures also generate emissions, but their results reduce the future emissions of manufactured engines. In addition to direct CO2 emissions, Wärtsilä's operations generate indirect CO2 emissions. In 2010, the calculated secondary CO2 emissions were 58,002 tons (62,211) (from purchased electricity and heat) and CO2 emissions from flights totalled 35,060 tons (37,882). Wärtsilä has taken several measures to reduce its indirect CO2 emissions; the energy efficiency commitment aims to reduce energy consumption and emissions. In addition, Wärtsilä's focus lies on reducing travelling by implementing a strict travel policy and by using three main virtual meeting concepts: Office Communicator, which enables live chats between two persons or more; Live meetings allowing multi-person meetings from personal computers in which presentation material can be shared; and the Telepresence videoconferencing system. Wärtsilä Live and Telepresence are in everyday use. Approximately 400 Live-meetings are arranged daily and there are 25 Telepresence rooms established in Wärtsilä premises in 16 countries. Waste management Manufacturing activities cause various wastes. These are divided into two main categories: hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes include cutting fluids, various types of waste oil, paints and solvents, oily wastes and solid wastes etc. Hazardous wastes are taken to a hazardous waste disposal facility for appropriate treatment. All Wärtsilä companies sort their waste according to local municipal regulations. Generally speaking the main sorting categories are: waste to be incinerated, crude waste for landfills, clean cardboard and waste paper. Waste wood, scrap metal and metal swarf are collected separately. Only coarse waste and in some cases waste wood are removed for landfill disposal. Other wastes are used either as raw materials or for energy. Waste management in Wärtsilä has four aims: • To reduce the amount of waste generated in processes • To use waste as a material • To use waste as energy • To dispose of waste in an environmentally sound way.

The operations of Wärtsilä's manufacturing companies require a valid environmental permit. Wärtsilä companies have the required environmental permits, the terms of which are generally met. Incidents of non-compliance are described in the following chapters. Environmental disturbances and complaints The number of disturbances, complaints and incidents of noncompliance are presented in the figure below. Reported disturbances cover incidents in which the Wärtsilä company concerned has usually been obliged to report the disturbance to the authorities. The following main environmental disturbances occurred in Wärtsilä's business locations in 2010: • 4 fires • 2 fuel oil leakages • 1 gas leakage • 1 unconventional operating mode All the above disturbances were investigated and appropriate corrective actions was taken in each case. The complaints made by occupants of neighbouring sites were mainly related to noise and odours. All complaints were investigated and an appropriate corrective action was taken wherever necessary. Cases of non-compliance Wärtsilä India Ltd. had 2 non-compliance cases related to height of chimneys and exceeded hazardous waste quantities against permit conditions. Chimneys with the required heights are being installed and the revision of permit conditions are currently being processed with the authorities. Wärtsilä Singapore Pte Ltd. had one non-compliance case related to stagnant water and mosquito breeding found on the area of the real estate. This incident caused a fine of 100 EUR. The corrective actions have been taken. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

Wärtsilä real estate and environmental responsibilities The real estate that Wärtsilä owns or leases is mainly located in urban areas. The company is not aware of any properties that are situated in areas where biodiversity could be endangered. Environmental risks and liabilities are identified and reviewed as a part of overall risk management. In Wärtsilä's operations, potential liabilities are primarily related to the company's real estate.

The majority of the propeller production and auxiliary engine production will be located in China, close to the main marine markets. The propeller manufacturing site in Drunen, the Netherlands will be closed. The Wärtsilä 20 generating set production in Vaasa, Finland will be moved to China in order to stay competitive in this commodity market. In addition to reductions in its global manufacturing staff, Wärtsilä continued to reduce jobs in the Ship Power business as a continuation of the restructuring programme already started in 2009. The new Services organisational set up, the centralisation of all Supply Management into a single organisation, as well as the re-design of support functions globally, were planned and implemented during the course of 2010 in order to adjust to the changed global market situation. The re-organisation process in the Services business, named ‘Managing for the Future', was announced already in November 2009 and carried out during spring 2010. The new organisational matrix has all customer operations on one axis, and the global product management and support functions on the other. Wärtsilä merged all strategic sourcing resources into one organisation, Wärtsilä Supply Management, with the aim of targeting further efficiency improvements and securing future demand. A global project concerning support functions was kicked off in March 2010. The evaluation of every support function globally was carried out in the spring, and implementation plans were drawn up during the autumn. The aim was to create a new organisational design for the support functions. The main principle was centralisation of the support organisations in order to improve the implementation of global initiatives, to harmonize processes across the Group's companies and businesses, and to reduce overlapping work. By these actions, consistent world class services can be provided globally by our support functions and Information Management. The functional country by country analysis, prepared during the autumn, indicated that there were overlapping activities and a need to adjust organisations to the new way of working, as well as to lower volumes. The formal consultation processes were initiated in the respective Wärtsilä units involved, with the aim of reducing approximately 1,400 jobs during 2010. Personnel In addition to direct employment, Wärtsilä also indirectly employed an external workforce totalling 2,254 man-years in sub-contracting at its factories and units. The units located in Finland had a total personnel of 3,326 employees. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

Wärtsilä had 17,528 employees at the end of 2010 (18,541). People management in 2010 The main goal of Wärtsilä's human resources strategy is to support the corporate strategy, and to bring it alive by developing Wärtsilä's organisation and competencies to meet the business needs. This is done by translating business strategies to people management actions, strengthening leadership and management competencies, as well as performance management and development throughout the organisation, by promoting true employee engagement through a culture of open communication, integrity and innovation, and finally, by ensuring that the businesses have the requisite resources and skilled and motivated people at their disposal. This means supporting organisational design and changes, continuous competence development, and stronger performance management processes with target setting, proper feedback, evaluation of overall performance, and recognition of strong performance.

Wärtsilä continued to invest in technologies and tools that enable virtual collaboration and conferencing. These measures have brought clear cost savings, and more importantly, they have increased efficiency and enhanced the balance between work and home life by reducing the time needed for travelling. Performance management The Performance Management process supports Wärtsilä in reaching its business targets by translating business strategies to individual and team objectives. Each Wärtsilä employee needs to know and understand Wärtsilä's business strategy and its goals. More importantly, they need to know the targets set for their own units, and the main target areas related to their own work. All these items are part of the annual development discussion agenda. Wärtsilä´s employee satisfaction survey, MyVoice 2010, demonstrated a promising and positive development in this area. Learning and development Wärtsilä continued its leadership development activities in many areas. An annual executive development programme was held in November, and six global leadership development programmes for senior managers were carried out during 2010. The number of managerial training days is also followed regularly as one of the HR KPIs. Learning at work, self learning, mentoring, coaching, and job assignments designed to enable the transfer of competence and skills from experienced to younger employees, are integral parts of the development of learning and competence within the company. Employees are given formal training at all organisational levels: from induction training for new employees, to training courses for the company's top executives. Wärtsilä employees attend a total of 54,791 training days a year, averaging 3.1 days per employee. This indicates the broad scope of this function. Many of the training events are tailored to the specific needs of the businesses. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

The response rate was an all time high, 74.2 %. Organising Work and Teamwork both received high ratings. The results concerning Competence and Development were also good. Wärtsilä employees feel that they can achieve personal development, while also using their skills and knowledge in their job. The biggest improvements since the MyVoice 2008 survey in individual items were in feedback from the immediate superior, discussions about Wärtsilä values, participation in training, and satisfaction with Compass, Wärtsilä's intranet service. The positive trend in development discussion compliance also continued. As an overall trend throughout Wärtsilä, the results concerning rewarding and job security have declined. The willingness to work hard in order to advance Wärtsilä's success has remained strong. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

The policy creates a common framework for employee practices in all Wärtsilä companies and contains the following sections: Equal opportunities, Human and labour rights, Well-being at work, No harassment accepted, Remuneration, Implementation and Violations. Equal opportunities Wärtsilä is committed to fostering equal employment opportunities, in which individuals are selected and treated on the basis of their job relevant merits and abilities and are given equal opportunities within Wärtsilä. Wärtsilä's policy is to treat all employees equally on the basis of their merits, without discriminating them on the basis of their race, ethnic or national origin, colour, gender, family status, sexual orientation, creed, disability, age or political beliefs. Employee benefits and remuneration The basic principle for remuneration in the company is to pay the same wage for the same job and the same performance. The salary is meant to be just, fair and encouraging. Differences in individual salaries are based on how demanding the job is, on differences between competence and performance, and not on gender. In general, temporary and part time employees are offered the same benefits as permanent employees. In some countries eligibility is linked to months or years of service such differences being typically based on collective agreements according to local legislation. Individual salaries are reviewed once a year in connection with the performance review and in the framework of annual salary increase guidance. The company may pay employees an annual bonus in accordance with company rules and based on separate bonus agreements. Based on financial and individual performance bonus outcome is determined once a year. Employees may be paid a spot bonus based on exceptional performance. Benefits, such as a company car, service year awards and wellbeing, fitness and health services are planned and implemented locally taking into account both company guidelines and national practices. Minimum notice period Wärtsilä applies European Union directives, local acts of co-operation in the companies and corporations, collective agreements, and equivalent regulations concerning consultation and local bargaining. Concerning termination of employment, Wärtsilä respects national labour union agreements and employment legislation.

The objective is to inform at the time of planning any significant operational change. Competence Management Wärtsilä's Competence Management process is an effective and structured way to carry out long-term competence development plans within our businesses and functions. Wärtsilä has defined fifteen global job families consisting of generic job descriptions for seven different demand levels. In the job descriptions the most critical competencies are defined and used as a basis for individual position competence requirements. Typically in the connection of annual development discussion, individual competencies are assessed against the job and position profile. Competence assessment of our employees and comparison with competence targets allow us to analyse competence gaps and create development plans accordingly. All training and development activities in Wärtsilä strive to develop, maintain and renew the skills and competencies required to fulfil our strategy. Having the right competencies available at the right time, and being able to continuously adapt to a changing business environment, are critical success factors for Wärtsilä. Consultation and information procedures in Group companies Wärtsilä's procedures for consultation and information within the Group are arranged in each country according to local legislation. Wärtsilä's Code of Conduct calls for ongoing and open dialogue between the company's management and employee representatives through co-determination bodies, and employees are kept informed of both the Group's situation and that of their particular company. Company management and personnel engage in open discussion also in those countries where there are no formal co-determination bodies as such. Regular briefings for personnel are an integral part of the operating procedures of Wärtsilä companies. Employee participation in decision-making also extends to occupational health and safety (OHS). Most Wärtsilä units have an OHS committee with representatives from all personnel groups. In addition to Wärtsilä's procedures for consultation and information for employees at the local level, the European Works Council (EWC) handles issues that affect at least two companies located in the EU and the Group as a whole. The EWC and its working committee play an active role in considering and pursuing corporate level issues. Dialogue at the individual level is conducted through development discussions, which are held annually. The subjects dealt with in these discussions range from the Group's and business unit's targets, to the individual's job description, competence development, career alternatives, personal targets and feedback. Development discussions are by definition held with all employees. Employees are able to have a direct impact on the company's operations and their development by making suggestions. Each Wärtsilä employee can offer suggestions for improvement in operations through either the continuous improvement process (CIP) or by submitting private initiatives. CIP-proposals are discussed jointly and need a common decision to be put into effect. Private initiatives are evaluated by experts within the company and, if found to be feasible, are put into effect.

Company intranet Compass and employee magazines Wattsup are the common global channels for internal communication. Recognition of excellent performance Wärtsilä encourages its employees to be innovative by granting an annual Technology and Innovation Award either to an individual or to a team for the best technical innovation of the year. The award criteria are that the invention must be innovative, environmentally sound, represent leading technology, improve a product or process, and offer potential for cost savings. Wärtsilä also grants annually a Customer Care Award for a team or individual who actively participated in the initiatives leading to development of business operations, quality improvements in how we serve and partner with customers, customer satisfaction or Wärtsilä values demonstration.

Wärtsilä's subsidiaries are required to have a management system in use that conforms to the QHSE policy and EHS directive. The main aspects of the management system relate to compliance with legislation, identifying and minimising occupational health and safety risks, personnel training, providing written instructions, the use of protective equipment, and the continuous improvement of occupational health and safety performance. At the end of 2010, 29 Wärtsilä companies had operated with a certified occupational health and safety management system. These certified occupational health and safety management systems cover roughly 73% of Wärtsilä's total workforce. The objective of Wärtsilä's QHSE policy is to prevent and manage health and safety risks to personnel and stakeholders. In addition to the management system, Wärtsilä companies apply occupational health and safety programmes as required by local legislation, which are normally implemented by occupational health and safety committees consisting of representatives of the companies' management and personnel. Accidents are recorded and investigated in the manner required by local legislation. Altogether 67% of Wärtsilä companies have an occupational health and safety committee. The indicators used to measure occupational health and safety performance include the number of accidents, the amount of absence due to sickness, and the frequency of accidents. There was one fatal incident during the review period. An employee of a Wärtsilä subcontractor had a fatal accident in our customer's premises in Pakistan. Wärtsilä has set a corporate level target of achieving zero lost time injuries. This target is a long-term commitment from the company to strengthen safety culture, and requires actions from all Wärtsilä companies and employees. The safety performance of the companies is followed on a monthly basis. In 2010, Wärtsilä continued strong efforts to improve, consolidate and spread the safety culture. Wärtsilä has created a Safety Handbook and an E-learning training module for safety, which have been pilot tested in 2010. The positive trend in reducing lost time injuries continued, and Wärtsilä achieved a good result in 2010 with a lost time frequency index of more than 30% below that of the previous year.

Our culture and values require us to have a hazard-free workplace by applying high standards of occupational health and safety. A Safety Handbook and a Safety E-learning Training have been developed by the Zero Injury Project to emphasise the importance of safety while performing work at the job site, in factories or workshops, or in the office. The Safety Handbook will be available in several language versions to support global deployment and operations. E-Learning Training is composed of six e-learning modules and a one-day case scenario study on job safety and risk assessment. This training is now piloted and the full implementation will start in the beginning of 2011. This training programme is certified by DNV. Participants who have successfully completed the ELearning module and passed the evaluation exams will be issued a Wärtsilä Safety Card.

Wärtsilä also supports the Ten Principles of UN Global Compact, of which six principles are related to Human and Labour rights. Wärtsilä's employees represent 109 different nationalities. The company supports fair and equal treatment of all its employees. Wärtsilä supports the work-related rights defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Therefore the company works to ensure there is freedom of association and right to collective bargaining in the company. In those countries where local legislation does not recognise these rights, Wärtsilä endeavours to give employees other channels for expressing their opinions. Wärtsilä does not accept the use of forced labour or child labour in any form. Wärtsilä is unaware of any cases of breach of human rights, discrimination, infringements of rights at work, or the use of forced or child labour. Wärtsilä Korea Ltd. was charged a penalty fee of EUR 26,157 for not fulfilling its legal obligation to hire disabled persons covering 5% of the total headcount. The company has mainly hired blue collar employees, which limits the suitable job offerings to disabled persons. In Wärtsilä Pakistan Ltd. the employment of one person was terminated for violation of company principles and the local law for harassment. Since Wärtsilä expects its partners and suppliers to act in compliance with its Code of Conduct, similar measures will also apply to them. The company sets common requirements for its suppliers and regularly monitors conformance with these requirements through numerous performance indicators and audits. All the company's main suppliers are required to comply with Wärtsilä's requirements, in order to gain approved supplier status. Wärtsilä assesses all companies in conjunction with mergers and acquisitions. The integral part of these due diligence assessments is compliance with relevant legislation.

Wärtsilä complies with all relevant guidelines of the OECD and the International Chamber of Commerce, and with the sanctions set by the United Nations and the European Union, by supporting their implementation. In addition, the Wärtsilä Code of Conduct applies to all Wärtsilä employees. Wärtsilä supports its solutions globally during their entire lifecycle, often spanning up to 30 years. Thus, Wärtsilä can at times be present in countries facing various uprisings, ethnic conflicts, area disputes, or violations of human rights. Conducting business locally emphasises the importance of responsible business practices. Governments and the international community define the proper framework for companies to conduct their business. Wärtsilä complies with relevant legislation and international conventions.

This can be reached e.g. by creating employment, by paying taxes and social dues, by providing training and education to employees, by co-operating with local stakeholders and by supporting local development. The guiding principle of Wärtsilä's Code of Conduct is to promote openness and good interaction with its stakeholders locally. This applies as much to the families of personnel, our neighbours, educational institutions and the media, as to local authorities and officials. The methods used towards this end include Open Door days, press briefings, and different modes of communication for different target groups. Wärtsilä's impact on employment, on the public sector and the company's activities for charitable purposes are described in the Economic Performance section of this report.

Wärtsilä offers its suppliers a partnership that strengthens the competitiveness of both parties. A precondition of this partnership is open and continuous dialogue. Partnership thinking is also applied in Wärtsilä's research and development activities, where the company often collaborates with universities and key suppliers. Wärtsilä assesses and manages its suppliers through its Supplier Management System. Wärtsilä regularly conducts supplier evaluations. These are divided into three categories: pre-assessment, auditing, and performance review. A pre-assessment is made of potential new suppliers before the supplier relationship begins. Audits are conducted on new suppliers and on suppliers whose performance does not meet Wärtsilä's requirements. Performance reviews are performed to solve a single deviation from requirements. In the assessment of a supplier, Wärtsilä focuses on several critical indicators, where Wärtsilä expect the supplier to have high standards and performance: compliance with relevant legislation; environmental, occupational health and safety and quality management; process mapping and quality plans and social performance. In 2010, Wärtsilä rated more than 200 of its key suppliers and conducted dozens of supplier evaluations. Wärtsilä Supplier Development activities are continuously implemented globally. Through the utilisation of the Supplier Development Toolbox, we will improve our suppliers´ quality and delivery reliability level to all our business units. The most important tool in the Supplier Development Toolbox is the utilisation of the Part Quality Assurance Plan. The purpose of the part quality assurance is to make sure that the supplier is able to produce the intended parts in a rational and efficient way. All strategic purchasing functions within the Wärtsilä businesses, Industrial Operations and Corporate Supply Management will be merged and streamlined to further achieve economies of scale in purchasing activities within Wärtsilä. Wärtsilä Supply Management (WSM) will have one governance model, one team, one target and one voice to our suppliers. This eliminates overlapping work and provides better control over all spending and suppliers. The Supplier Development and Quality team supports Wärtsilä's targets, enabling customer satisfaction by securing the right quality, on time deliveries and optimised cost performance from our suppliers.

Because of this, only business gifts of nominal value may be given or accepted. The instructions make it compulsory not only to comply with local anti-bribery provisions but also internationally recognised anti-corruption and anti-bribery principles, and to report any cases of bribery. The company renders extensive training for its personnel on anti-corruption principles and the relevant instructions. The company had one case of alleged bribery during the review period related to a 2001 project in Kenya. In May 2009, the public prosecutor in Finland brought charges against a former senior manager of Wärtsilä Finland Oy for aggravated bribery. In October 2009, the public prosecutor further filed a demand for a corporate fine from Wärtsilä Finland as a result of the charges against the former senior manager. It is to be noted that the demand for a corporate fine was only ancillary to the charges brought against the former senior manager. Both the senior manager and Wärtsilä Finland regarded the charges as unfounded. The charges related to a consulting agreement, which was made in conjunction with the project in Kenya. The case was heard before the Pohjanmaa District Court (aka the Mustasaari District Court) in November 2009. By its decision on December 18, 2009, the District Court dismissed all the charges against the individual and the demands against Wärtsilä Finland Oy. In February 2010, the public prosecutor filed an appeal with the Vaasa Court of Appeal. By its decision on September 21, 2010, the Vaasa Court of Appeal referred the case back to the District Court for reasons of procedural law. In November 2010, the former senior manager and Wärtsilä Finland Oy submitted a petition for leave to appeal the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court in Finland.

Wärtsilä supports its customers in the design, start up and operation of the equipment and systems it delivers, as the requirements of each customer dictate. Dialogue with customers is vital when developing operations, products and services. In its most important market areas, Wärtsilä arranges Customer Days for existing and potential customers. These days are used to review subjects of topical interest and to discuss existing and future needs and challenges. In 2010, the Ship Power and Power Plants businesses arranged and participated in close to 200 maritime and energy-related events, international and national seminars, exhibitions and conferences worldwide. These events were visited by thousands of customers, potential customers and other stakeholders such as consultants, suppliers, students, etc. Wärtsilä uses a Customer Relationship On-Line (CROL®) process for measuring customer satisfaction of the company's sales, delivery and service performance in individual projects and customer relationships. The system requires Wärtsilä to make a self-assessment with the same questions as given to customers, thereby enabling a comparison with feedback from customers. This highlights actions necessary to rectify any issues during the customer relationship lifecycle. Low scores in customer feedback triggers automatic requests for corrective actions. The customer responsible persons are responsible for documenting and carrying out corrective actions, as well as for communicating these to the customers. In addition, the production units, the support functions and various other stakeholders are responsible for taking action regarding feedback that is directly related to their activities. The status and effects of the corrective actions is followed up by upper management on a quarterly basis. During 2010 the system was updated to also track customer needs better and identify opportunities for providing added value to the customers. The customer opinions collected during 2010 has triggered approximately 500 project/customer specific action plans, which Wärtsilä representatives are working with. The action plans vary from simply agreeing with customers upon a communication plan, to more complex technical problem solving cases. The goal for each action plan is to react on specific customer feedback and to improve customer perception of Wärtsilä. Wärtsilä measures its performance using a questionnaire, in which customers are asked to comment on statements related to the quality of Wärtsilä products and solutions, the organisation and the professional competence of Wärtsilä employees. The assessment has a scale of 1-10, the highest grade being 10. The overall index of customer satisfaction is used as a Key Performance Indicator for the company.

Donations: the data of this indicator included in 2010 15 major Wärtsilä subsidiaries and the parent company. Subsidies: the data of this indicator included in 2010 15 major Wärtsilä subsidiaries and the parent company. Environmental performance data Total energy consumption includes both direct and indirect energy usage. The direct energy usage includes the fuels used by Wärtsilä subsidiaries. The indirect energy usage includes the purchased electricity and heat. Since the efficiency of purchased electricity and heat generation is not known, the energy conversion is done directly from the purchased values. Heat and electricity data is based on either invoices or measured values. Water consumption the reported figures are based on either measured values or invoices. The cooling water usage might also be calculated from the heat load in some units. Emissions the reported figures are mainly based on measured values, based on which specific emission factors are determined. The specific emission factors are determined for various fuels and engine types. The emissions of the heating boilers are either measured or calculated. The emissions of vehicles are calculated by using VTT Lipasto database emission factors. The indirect CO2 emissions (scope 2) are calculated by using the emission factors from GHG Protocol. The CO2 emissions of air travel are based on calculation of travel agency and are based on DEFRA defined factors. Environmental hazards are considered major incidents, which basically require communication to local authorities. Social performance data Injuries the reported figures include all types of reported cases other than Lost time injuries. Lost time injuries the reported figures include all the reported lost time injuries resulting in absence from work of at least one day. LTI rate is expressed as reported lost injuries per million working hours. The working hours are actual paid working hours. The lost time injury rate does not include the commuting injuries.

The information subject to the limited assurance engagement (hereafter: the Sustainability Information) includes the data and assertions presented in the Sustainability -section and its sub-sections in the Report, as well as the following sub-sections of the Business section: Ship Power and Sustainability , Power Plants and Sustainability , and Services and Sustainability . The Sustainability Information also includes data and assertions on product sustainability performance presented on selected and marked pages at www.wartsila.com. The Board of Management of Wärtsilä is responsible for the presented Sustainability Information as well as for preparing and presenting the Sustainability Information in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 3.0 (G3). The Board of Management of Wärtsilä has approved the presented Sustainability Information. Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement and to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Information subject to the assurance based on the work performed. We have conducted the engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000): Assurance engagements other than audits or review of historical financial information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Amongst others, this standard requires that the assuring party possesses the specific knowledge, skills and professional competence needed to understand and review the information to be assured, and that the assuring party complies with the requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants to ensure their independence. The evaluation criteria used for our assurance are the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 3.0 (G3). Limitations of the engagement Sustainability related data and information are subject to inherent limitations applying to data accuracy and completeness, which are to be taken into account when reading our assurance report. The presented Sustainability Information is to be considered in connection with the explanatory information on data collection, consolidation and assessments provided by Wärtsilä. Our assurance report is not intended for use in evaluating Wärtsilä's performance in executing the sustainability principles Wärtsilä has defined. To assess the financial state and performance of Wärtsilä, the Wärtsilä audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 is to be consulted.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of the sustainability information presented, and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. The evidence gathering procedures mentioned above are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. In our engagement we have performed the following procedures: • Interviews with two members of senior management to reassert our understanding of the connection between Wärtsilä's sustainability procedures and Wärtsilä's business strategy and operations as well as sustainability objectives; • An assessment of data management processes, information systems and working methods used to gather and consolidate the presented Sustainability Information, and a review of Wärtsilä's related internal documents; • Comparison of Sustainability Information to underlying rules of procedure, management and reporting systems as well as documentation; • An assessment of the presented Sustainability Information against the GRI reporting principles; • A review of the presented Sustainability Information, including the performance data and assertions, subject to the engagement, and an assessment of information quality and reporting boundary definitions; • Testing of data accuracy and completeness through samples from the Group's information systems and original numerical information received from Wärtsilä's subsidiaries; • Visits to three Wärtsilä sites selected on the basis of a risk analysis taking into account both qualitative and quantitative information, and a video conference to one additional site. Conclusions Based on the assurance procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information subject to the assurance engagement is not presented in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative 3.0 (G3) in all material respects.

Wärtsilä's permanent insiders comprise the statutory insiders, i.e. the Board of Directors, the President and CEO, the Executive Vice President and the Principal Auditor, as well as the members of the Board of Management. Certain members of the Corporate Management and other employees, as required by their duties, also belong to the company's own non-public insider register. When significant projects are at the preparation stage, the company also draws up insider registers for the projects concerned. Insiders are given written notification of their status as insiders as well as instructions on the obligations that apply to insiders. The company's insiders are not permitted to trade in the company's shares for 14 days (however Wärtsilä recommends 30 days) prior to publication of the interim reports or the annual financial statements bulletin. Wärtsilä's insider register is maintained by the parent company's legal affairs function, which is responsible for keeping the information updated. Information on the interests and holdings of the company's permanent insiders and related parties is available from the SIRE system of the Finnish Central Securities Depository Ltd. The same information is also available on Wärtsilä's homepage. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

The purpose of the Internal Audit is to analyse the company's operations and processes, and the effectiveness and quality of its supervision mechanisms. The internal auditor also participates, if necessary, in audits undertaken in conjunction with acquisitions, and carries out special tasks assigned by the Board of Management. The internal audit function covers all of the company's organisational levels and subsidiaries. An internal audit is undertaken in the main subsidiaries on an annual basis and in network companies with 3-year intervals. The internal audit prepares an annual plan under which they independently audit different parts of the company, but it is also empowered to carry out special audits. The annual plan is approved by the Audit Committee, to which the internal audit also reports at regular intervals. If required, the auditors also have the possibility to take direct contact with the Audit Committee or members of the Board of Directors. External The company has one auditor which shall be an auditing firm authorised by the Central Chamber of Commerce. The auditor is elected by the Annual General Meeting to audit the accounts for the ongoing financial year and its duties cease at the close of the subsequent Annual General Meeting. The auditor is responsible for auditing the consolidated and parent company's financial statements and accounting records, and the administration of the parent company. On closing of the annual accounts, the external auditor submits the statutory auditor's report to the company's shareholders, and it also regularly reports the findings to the Board of Directors' Audit Committee. An auditor, in addition to fulfilling general competency requirements, must also comply with certain legal independence requirements guaranteeing the execution of an independent and reliable audit. Auditor in 2010 In 2010, the AGM appointed the firm of public auditors KPMG Oy Ab as Wärtsilä Corporation's auditor. Auditing fees paid to all the auditors of the Group companies amounted to EUR 2.3 million in 2010. Consultancy fees unrelated to auditing duties paid to the auditors totalled EUR 1.5 million. These latter fees mainly concerned consultation on taxation matters. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

According to Wärtsilä's definition, internal control is a process taken part by Wärtsilä's Board of Directors, management, the Boards of Directors of Group companies and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives. Internal control covers all the policies, processes, procedures and organisational structures in Wärtsilä that help management and ultimately the Board to ensure that Wärtsilä is achieving its objectives, that the business conduct is ethical and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and that the company's assets, including its brand, are safeguarded and that financial reporting is correct. Internal control is not a separate process or set of activities, but it is embedded in the operations of Wärtsilä. The system of internal control operates at all levels of Wärtsilä. Wärtsilä maintains and develops its internal control system with the ultimate aim of improving its business performance, and at the same time to comply with laws and regulations in countries where it operates. Performance management Planning and target setting, an integral part of performance management in Wärtsilä, are a regular management activity and not part of Wärtsilä's internal control system. The establishment of objectives, however, is an important prerequisite for internal control. Through the performance management process, financial and non-financial targets are set for Wärtsilä annually on the Group level. Group level targets are then translated into targets for Businesses and WIO, Group Companies, and eventually individuals.

Page numbers can differ in other self generated documents. 195 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INTERNAL CONTROL The achievement of the annual targets is followed up through monthly management reporting. The performance of the Businesses and WIO and achievement of the annual targets are reviewed on a monthly basis in the respective Management Team meetings. The performance and the achievement of the targets of the Group and of the different Businesses and WIO are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Board of Management. The respective Management Teams and the Board of Management also address the reliability of Wärtsilä's financial reporting. Financial reporting in Wärtsilä is carried out in a harmonised way in all major Group Companies, using single instance ERP system and a common chart of accounts. The international financial reporting standards (IFRS) are applied in the whole Group. Wärtsilä's finance and control process is essential for the functioning of internal control. Adequate controls in the financial management and accounting processes are needed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting. The Board of Directors regularly assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of Wärtsilä's internal controls and risk management. It is also responsible for ensuring that internal control over accounting and financial administration is arranged appropriately. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Wärtsilä Corporation is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process. The Group Finance & Control function is responsible for notifying relevant levels of management of deviations from plans, for analysing the underlying reasons, and for suggesting corrective actions. The Group Finance and Control supports the Businesses and WIO in decision-making and analysis to ensure attaining financial targets. It is also responsible for maintaining and developing the company's performance management processes so that the management at different levels of the organisation is able to receive timely, reliable and adequate information regarding the achievement of the organisation's objectives, and also for developing the financial reporting processes and respective controls. Legal and compliance management Legal and compliance management practices and processes are also central in Wärtsilä's system of internal control. It is Wärtsilä's policy to act in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations in all countries where it operates. Legal and compliance management act predominantly in a proactive manner. A key activity is to strengthen and ensure the culture of appropriate conduct and behaviour both internally and in external business transactions. Company-wide control mechanisms and processes are a part of the overall internal control system. HR management Human resource management practices and processes have a fundamental role in Wärtsilä's system of internal control. Wärtsilä's key human resource management processes with respect to internal control are compensation and benefits, HR development, recruitment and resourcing management and individual performance management, as well as processes for collecting feedback from the employees. These processes for their part help ensure the effectiveness of internal control in Wärtsilä. The HR function is responsible for maintaining and developing Wärtsilä's HR processes to enable effective internal control also on the individual level.

The Wärtsilä management system covers all global processes and management procedures in Wärtsilä related to fulfilling customer requirements. The proper functioning of the aspects of the management system highlighted below ensure for their part attaining Wärtsilä's internal control objectives. Quality The quality of Wärtsilä's solutions, and thus quality management, is a top priority in Wärtsilä. Compliance with Wärtsilä's Quality Management System ISO 9001:2000 is compulsory throughout the Group and compliance with the system is rigorously monitored. Sustainability Wärtsilä is strongly committed to sustainability. Wärtsilä's vision, mission and values together with a solid financial performance form the basis for sustainable development in Wärtsilä. Furthermore, significant attention is paid to social and environmental sustainability of Wärtsilä's operations. Risk management Internal control in Wärtsilä is designed to support the company in achieving its targets. The risks related to the achievement of the targets need to be identified and evaluated in order to be able to manage them. Thus, identification and assessment of risks is a prerequisite for internal control in Wärtsilä. Wärtsilä's internal control mechanisms and procedures provide management assurance that the risk management actions are carried out as planned. Wärtsilä has defined and implemented entity level and process level control activities as well as information systems controls. Control activities at different levels are needed to directly mitigate risks at the respective levels. Wärtsilä's risk management processes consist of a Group-wide risk assessment and management processes, as well as project-specific risk assessments and project risk management. The Group-wide risk assessment process results in the creation of action plans for the identified and prioritised risks. Each Business and WIO reports its main risks to the Board of Management of Wärtsilä which also follows up the execution of the defined risk management action plans on a regular basis. The Board of Directors of Wärtsilä Corporation is responsible for defining the Group's overall level of risk tolerance and for ensuring that Wärtsilä has adequate tools and resources for managing risks. The President & CEO, with the assistance of the Board of Management, is responsible for organising and ensuring risk management in all Wärtsilä's operations. Business and WIO management is responsible for defining action plans for managing the most important risks. Wärtsilä's most important strategic, operative and financial risks can be found in the Risks and risk management section.

Wärtsilä's values are reflected in its day-to-day relations with its suppliers, customers and investors and also in Wärtsilä's internal guidelines, policies, manuals, processes and practices. The control environment sets the tone of internal control in Wärtsilä, influencing the control awareness of its people. It provides discipline and structure for all the other components of internal control. The elements of Wärtsilä's control environment include the corporate culture: the integrity, ethical values and competence of Wärtsilä's personnel, as well as the attention and direction provided to the personnel by the Board of Directors of Wärtsilä. Wärtsilä's values and control environment provide Wärtsilä's Board of Directors and management the basis for the reasonable assurance regarding Wärtsilä achieving the objectives for internal control. The President & CEO and the Board of Management define Wärtsilä's values and ethical principles (reflected in the Code of Conduct) and set the example for the corporate culture, which create the basis for the control environment. The same parties, together with Ship Power, Power Plants and Services (hereafter Businesses) and Wärtsilä Industrial Operations (hereafter WIO) management, are responsible for communicating Wärtsilä's values to the organisation.

Business and WIO management is responsible for ensuring that in their area of responsibility the defined Group level processes and controls are implemented and complied with.

The key Group level policies and guidelines are collected in Wärtsilä's Corporate Manual. Wärtsilä's Group level Accounting Manual contains instructions and guidance on accounting and financial reporting to be applied in all Wärtsilä Group companies. The manual supports the achievement of the objectives regarding the reliability of financial reporting in Wärtsilä. The Board of Management of Wärtsilä Corporation approves Wärtsilä's Group level policies and any changes to them. In addition to the Group level guidelines and manuals, the Businesses and WIO have issued related guidelines and instructions for their own, specific purposes. The Business and WIO level guidelines and manuals are aligned with and do not contradict the Group level guidelines and manuals. Information and communication An effective internal control system needs sufficient, timely and reliable information to enable the management to follow up the achievement of the company's objectives. Both financial and non-financial information is needed, relating to both internal and external events and activities. Informal ways for employees to give feedback to management and to communicate suspected misconducts (for example directly to the Legal Affairs or Internal Audit function) are used. All external communication is carried out in accordance with the Group Communications Policy. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

The management in Wärtsilä in turn performs monitoring as part of the regular supervisory activities.

The bonus is based on the Group's profitability and agreed personal targets. Close to 1,800 directors and managers are covered by this bonus scheme. The Group's whiteand blue-collar employees are covered by various bonus or profit-based incentive schemes. These are applied in each country according to that country's legislation, or to agreements concerning profit-sharing schemes. All in all, some 60% of the company's employees are covered by the Group's bonus scheme and various other profit-related incentive schemes. Long-term incentive scheme The Board of Directors has decided on a long-term bonus scheme for senior management tied to the stock development of the company's share. The size of the bonus is based on share price development during a predetermined timeframe and an upper limit is set for the bonus. The bonus scheme takes into account a 50% dividend payout. The yearly bonus scheme applies to approximately 80 directors. The 2007 bonus scheme comprises 687,500 bonus rights. The bonus payment is based on the share price development during a two-year and nine months period on the basis of a share price of EUR 22.63. The bonus cannot exceed EUR 9 per bonus right.

The basis for risk management is the lifecycle quality of Wärtsilä's operations and products, and the continuous, systematic, loss-prevention work at all levels of the Group on the principle that everybody is responsible . In the long term this is the only way to reduce the total risk costs. The Board of Directors and the Board of Management decide and give guidelines on strategic matters. The Businesses are responsible for achieving their set strategic goals and for mitigating and managing all their risks. The risk management function is part of Group Treasury, which reports to the CFO. It reviews the business risk profile, prepares the risk management policy, co-operates with the businesses in the implementation of risk mitigation work, and develops global and local insurance schemes with insurance companies and brokers. The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of risk management. The risk management policy is endorsed by the Board of Directors. Risk reporting Wärtsilä continued to strengthen its risk reporting during 2010. The Board of Management in its meetings carries out annual Management Reviews on each Business, including their risks and risk mitigation. The risk map of the Group and all Businesses is then presented in the Finance Management Review in the autumn This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report. Page numbers can differ in other self generated documents. 207 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT before the budgeting round. The risks are identified as either internal or external, quantified in euro and their probabilities are estimated. The results of this work are summarised in the Wärtsilä Risk Radar. Risk mitigation actions, including potential investments, are decided in the normal course of business. The Group Risk report is then presented to the Board of Directors. The Business Management Teams have risk management as a separate item on their agenda. The Businesses are responsible for organising, follow-up actions, and reporting on risk management from underlying Business units. During 2010 separate risk assessments were performed for each business resulting in the creation of business specific risk radars. In addition to divisional risk reporting, Wärtsilä has four cross-business risk groups. The manufacturing, supply chain, and liability groups have been active for the past two years, and a strategic risk group, as the latest addition to the cross-business risk identification and mitigation work, was established in 2010. These forums concentrate on risk identification and mitigation from the corporate view. The groups have approximately four meetings annually. The Corporate Risk Management function co-ordinates risk management activities and reporting within the Group. The Internal Auditing is responsible for reviewing the Risk Management process on an annual basis. Risk Categories The relevant risks for Wärtsilä have been classified in four sections; strategic, operational, hazard and financial risks. Risk is defined as the outcome of the probability and the loss exposure of the occurrence. The outcome or potential loss expectancy is highest with strategic and operational risks, and lowest with hazard and financial risks.

Business environment risks Business cycles in the global economy and in our customers' industries influence the demand for our products, as well as our financial condition and operating result. Our flexible multiproduct manufacturing model based on capacity outsourcing, plus a stable business mix with a large share of sales deriving from Services, brings Wärtsilä a certain measure of stability in a cyclical market. The turmoil experienced in the financial markets, and the subsequent slump in the world economy, continued to have an effect on Wärtsilä during 2010. Important economic matters that indirectly affect Wärtsilä, its clients and suppliers, include inter alia, the liquidity and solvency of the financial institutions and thus not only their capability but also willingness to extend credit, the counter cyclical stimulus programmes adopted by governments especially in the power and infrastructure sectors, the enhanced activities of multilateral institutions such as the IFC, the availability of export credit schemes and guarantees, and other such factors. However, a relatively large order book gives Wärtsilä some time to adapt to the market conditions. Market and customer risk Having given the first indications of revival already at the end of the previous year, the recovery of the shipping industry continued during 2010. However, there are big differences between the various shipping segments. As anticipated, the Asian and especially Chinese shipbuilding industry has emerged as the world's strongest. In 2010, Chinese shipyards were awarded almost half of new ship orders (both in terms of tonnage as well as in number of ships). Wärtsilä is well prepared for this development by having delivery centres and joint ventures with local players in China, Korea and Japan, and by having located its top management in its Ship Power business in Shanghai. Wärtsilä is well represented in all the major shipbuilding areas and is active in all major vessel segments. This mitigates both single customer related and geography related risks. The merchant vessel segment remains an area with problems of overcapacity. This has kept ordering volumes low, even though the recovery, for example in bulkers, has been much more rapid and strong than estimated just a year ago. The market continues to bear the consequences of the recent crisis, and the financing for new projects is currently one of the major obstacles to a complete recovery. Some cancellations are still to be expected, but order postponements and rescheduling are the main effects of the still somewhat unstable market. In the Power Plants business, there was a clear improvement in ordering activity and several large power plant orders were closed during 2010. The risks related to the availability of financing decreased as a result of the improvements in the financial sector. The number of projects under bidding also remained at a good level. Geographically, the most active markets were Asia, Central America and South America. Wärtsilä Power Plants has four types of customers: Industrial customers, IPPs, utilities, and oil & gas sector customers. All customer types were well represented in the order intake profile, and the strongest growth in order intake was with IPP's and Utility customers. Power Plants' strategic objective is to support its This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report. Page numbers can differ in other self generated documents. 209 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC RISKS customers by offering energy efficient, fuel flexible, and operationally flexible solutions that offer optimal means for managing the varying grid load profiles. Wärtsilä's solutions also enable the introduction of a higher share of renewable energy sources, which need backup generation availability in order to ensure capacity at all times. The volume level for the Services business remained stable, and long-term volumes are still expected to grow faster than new equipment sales. Wärtsilä has over 14,000 customers and an active engine base of nearly 180,000 MW, which means that its dependency on any single customer or customer segment is insignificant. Wärtsilä will continue to develop its service portfolio in close co-operation with its customers. New opportunities are created by the fact that customers are continuously looking for new means of cost reduction and efficiency improvement. Competitive situation and price risk Price competition has intensified during the year as a result of there being only a limited number of new projects as compared to available capacity. Ship Power's largest competitors in main engines are MAN Diesel and Caterpillar (MAK). No significant changes took place in the competitive situation and market shares during 2010. In propulsion equipment, the competition is more fragmented and varies by product segment. The concept of selling packaged solutions rather than merely single products reduces price volatility. Being a systems integrator with automation and ship design capability will prove to be even more important in the future. In the power plant market based on liquid fuels, Wärtsilä's main competitors are the same engine manufacturers as for Ship Power. In natural gas based power generation the main competitors are gas turbine manufacturers, such as GE, Siemens, Rolls Royce and Ansaldo. In the Services business, Wärtsilä has no direct competitors and none that offer a similar portfolio of services from a single source. Each service has therefore its own identified set of competitors. Excluding the service networks of other engine manufacturers, there are few global players in the service market. Consolidation within the customer industries and increased cost consciousness will enhance Wärtsilä's possibilities for offering a wider scope of service solutions, especially to ship owners.

Political developments and changes in legislation can have a significant impact on Wärtsilä's business. Wärtsilä actively monitors political and legal developments in its markets, and engages in dialogue with various official bodies in projects of importance to Wärtsilä's operations. Much of this engagement takes place through interest groups and trade organisations. The company monitors political and legislative changes at both corporate and subsidiary levels. Climate change and sustainability risks Wärtsilä has assessed sustainability risks, including climate change risks, in both its strategic and operative risk assessments. However, these were not found to be significant. The potential business risks related to sustainability, climate change and Wärtsilä's products, are in the areas of regulatory emission restrictions, and in changes in customer attitudes to using combustion engines and fossil fuels. The risks in changes to environmental legislation are related to the complexity of the overall field of different emissions, the balance between commercially available fuels and resulting emissions, available abatement technologies, the impact on overall energy efficiency, and the resulting financial feasibility. Being at the forefront of technological developments gives Wärtsilä many opportunities arising from tightening environmental regulations. Wärtsilä has for decades improved the efficiencies of its products while at the same time reducing emissions. The fuel flexibility of Wärtsilä's products enables the utilisation of various fuels, including renewables, and their operational flexibility enables the installation of large capacity based renewable energy sources without hampering the reliability of the electricity grid. Wärtsilä's technology also enables the generation of energy with a minimum use of water. A lack of fresh water is one of the major challenges that the world is expected to face in the future. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) regulates the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from marine engines, as well as the sulphur content of the fuel used. Stricter requirements will enter into force in various phases during the years 2010-2020. Regarding NOx emissions, Wärtsilä has already introduced solutions that comply with these requirements. Wärtsilä engines are designed for operation on any fuel sulphur content. As a response to the tightening sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions, Wärtsilä has developed technology that allows exhaust gases to be cleaned to meet the tight regulations. Additionally, Wärtsilä has a multifaceted gas engine strategy and can provide gas engines for vessels. The Thermal Power Plants EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) Guidelines, published by the World Bank/IFC (International Finance Corporation), are technical reference documents with general and industryspecific examples of Good International Industry Practices (GIIP). Leading international banks have reached an agreement with the IFC to follow guidelines based on the IFC's environmental and social standards, and have thus adopted the Equator Principles. Many other financial institutions, such as Export Credit Agencies, are also using the World Bank Group Guidelines, in addition to national norms in their projects. Consequently, the World Bank/IFC EHS Guidelines are today the minimum environmental standard in global power plant projects. It is estimated that more than 70% of finance activities for projects in emerging markets, are now carried out in accordance with the Equator Principles. The EU Industrial Emissions Directive has been approved by the European Parliament and has entered into force at the beginning of 2011. UNECE Gothenburg Protocol revision work is on-going, and is expected to be finalised during 2011. An intensive interaction between the various stakeholders is currently taking place.

Wärtsilä's strong focus on R&D and solutions development gives us many opportunities in the field of sustainability. In shipping, Wärtsilä can reduce the carbon footprint of ships through ship design, efficient engines, and optimal propulsion solutions. In Power Plants, Wärtsilä can offer further improvements, such as more efficient engines, fuel flexibility (such as bio-fuels and natural gas) and CHP (combined heat and power) applications with very high overall efficiency. In Services, Wärtsilä can offer several retrofit solutions in the after sales market to reduce emissions and increase efficiency. Wärtsilä can also offer environmentally sound solutions for a number of applications, including bilge and ballast water treatment. Wärtsilä's Product Center Ecotech focuses on environmental technologies that are related to products other than engines in order to quickly respond to market and customer needs with fully integrated and validated solutions. For more information, please see the separate Sustainability report included in this annual report. Technology risks As a technology leader Wärtsilä needs to maintain its cost competitiveness and places high emphasis on engine efficiency and emissions control. New products are developed based on Wärtsilä's strategy viewpoint of offering lifecycle service and efficiency through, for example, utilising ship design, electrical & automation, and environmental technologies. Wärtsilä aims to increase the competitiveness of its solutions through solid R&D work and innovation. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report.

Apart from normal risk management work, the specific Operational Risk Groups that include members from each Business aim at establishing a continuous process of operational improvements. Manufacturing risk Risk assessments have been made, and significant safety and risk mitigation investments completed, in the main delivery centres. Wärtsilä uses management systems for quality, environmental, occupational health and safety, and other systems to improve productivity and safety. Wärtsilä has implemented business continuity plans (BCP) in its key delivery centres. As the majority of ship construction has already shifted to Asia, Wärtsilä needs to constantly analyse its manufacturing footprint and capacity costs, including within the supply chain. A significant step in the adjustment of the manufacturing footprint was taken in January 2010 when Wärtsilä announced its plan to close the delivery centre in Drunen, the Netherlands, and to move the production primarily to China. This was seen as being necessary in order to meet market demand in Asia, as well as to address over capacity by concentrating production within fewer units. The flexibility and agility needs of the market are also being met by introducing multiproduct factory concepts. Supplier and subcontractor risk The centralised Wärtsilä Supply Management (WSM) function is responsible for all strategic sourcing activities. Within that responsibility, WSM manages and controls Wärtsilä's supplier network to make sure that the supplier performance is in line with Wärtsilä's expectations. Supplier performance is, therefore, continuously measured. A continuous assessment of business interruption risks in co-operation with our suppliers is one means of managing business continuity planning. Several supplier risk audits have been completed jointly with the insurer as another means of mitigating risks. These audits are now part of the regular work for the WSM and Risk Management functions. To further mitigate risks, a comprehensive follow-up of suppliers' creditworthiness has been established. This pdf document is self generated and it may not contain all content from the annual report. Page numbers can differ in other self generated documents. 213 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OPERATIONAL RISKS Wärtsilä Supply Management has developed its activities by creating close collaboration and long-term relationships with its main suppliers. By having these close relationships, WSM secures a common view with its suppliers on values and goals. These shared values and goals support Wärtsilä's management of strategic risks. In addition, WSM continues its supplier structuring programme in order to create and maintain a sustainable supplier base. As part of that programme, WSM further develops its global sourcing activities. Furthermore, supplier related risks are also addressed by having double sourcing on key components. Lifecycle quality of products and product liability risk Launching new products always involves risks. In the R&D process several risk management techniques are applied, including FMEA, a risk elimination tool, a single issue list, and in-house validation testing. Furthermore, Wärtsilä seeks to control quality risks by controlling the incoming quality from the supply chain, and by designing and manufacturing products with all due care. Wärtsilä applies a GATE model in order to control the product development process. First, only a limited release of new products is allowed. Using the gate approach, only after testing and further validation has been completed is the full release given to the sales organisations. The 5S (meaning sort, shine, set, standardise and sustain) philosophy is being implemented in all production sites to increase quality and to support lean operations. Services is responsible for all warranty issues, and offers a feedback loop from the field to production and R&D, while taking care of customers' installations throughout their lifecycle. The company makes warranty provisions to cover any warranty costs that may arise after product delivery. Product liability insurance covers unexpected damages. Contractual risks Wärtsilä's non-Service sales consist of project deliveries of various sizes. The most substantial orders concern turnkey power plants, the biggest of which during 2010 was a 380 MW plant in Brazil. However, the risks from individual projects do not reach significant levels considering the total volume of business. The lifecycle quality of the products and work, initiating from the design and extending throughout all stages of the production process as well as the field service work, plus the use of standard sales contracts including the establishment of a contract review process, reduce the risk of product liability claims. Commodity price risk Oil The direct effect of oil price changes on Wärtsilä's production is very limited. The indirect effects of oil price volatility on customers are outweighed in importance by the long economic life of the investments, fuelefficient technologies, and the availability of alternative fuels. Metals Metal prices have an indirect effect on engine component costs. This exposure is not hedged but annual agreements are in place to balance the short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, some key components are sourced with long-term contracts and thus raw material price volatility is limited.

Appropriate insurances are in place for the personnel, and to emphasise the importance of employee safety, Wärtsilä's Board of Management has decided on a corporate level target of zero lost time injuries. A specific project has been established for this purpose, and the target is a part of the company's sustainability programme. Environmental management systems are in place to mitigate environmental hazard risks. Wärtsilä's Real Estate unit maintains a register of all properties used and gives guidelines for the purchase, sale, rental and security of premises, and uses external advisors for environmental audits. None of Wärtsilä's major production plants are situated within Natural Catastrophe areas. Catastrophic peril related scenarios are identified, and where necessary exposures are mitigated by, for example, elevating sites above the flood risk level or by constructing flood dikes. For Wärtsilä's main production sites, business impact analyses have been conducted and continuity plans created, regarding both property and business interruption risks. Risks that Wärtsilä is unable to influence through its own efforts are transferred where possible to insurance companies. Wärtsilä uses appropriate insurance policies to cover indemnity risks related to its personnel, assets, business interruption, and third-party and product liability. Wärtsilä has established its own reinsurance company, Vulcan Insurance PCC Ltd, as a risk management tool for this purpose.

Segment information The business of Wärtsilä consists of one business area, the Power Businesses. The Power Businesses are subdivided into two mutually supportive market areas, Ship Power and Power Plants. These offer customers the same product concept modified for specific applications. The main products for both these markets are gas and diesel engines and related services. The market segments are highly dependent on each other. In the Power Businesses, the design-related research and development and manufacturing required for the engines sold to both markets take place in the same R&D centres and factories. The manufacturing process is the same for each market. Similarly, the same Group companies are responsible for the distribution of these products and the services related to them. Capacity costs cannot be reliably allocated to the two different markets. These costs are significant and vary between the two units in different years. Customers in both markets are capital-intensive corporations with global operations. Development of the two market areas is strongly linked to global economic trends.

Business area information Internal management reporting is used to monitor the development of operations on the basis of market based business areas. Reporting serves goal setting and budget control and is thus a management tool rather than an actual external economic indicator. Wärtsilä’s highest operative decision maker (CODM, Chief Operating Decision Maker according to IFRS 8) is the Group President with the support of the Board of Management and, in some cases, the Board of Directors. The Group President assesses the Group’s financial position and its development as a whole, not based on the results of the business areas. As the Group’s level of integration is high, the reported indicators from business areas do not give a true picture of the business areas’ financial position and development. It is also considered that they are of limited value to an external reader due to poor comparability, for example. Against this background, Wärtsilä’s business cannot be divided into separate operative segments with individual reporting. During the financial year 1 January-31 December 2010 and 1 January-31 December 2009, Wärtsilä did not have individual significant customers or lands according to the definition of IFRS 8.

The terminal growth rate used is 2%. there are separately identifiable cash flows. Currently Wärtsilä The key driver for the valuation is the growth in the global identifies two (2009: 3) separate independent cash inflow CGUs economy and in particular the development of the global power to which goodwill can directly be linked as per the below table.

The applied discount rate is the weighted average pre-tax cost Cash-Generating Units (CGU) of capital (WACC) as defined by Wärtsilä. The components of the Goodwill WACC are risk-free rate, market risk premium, industry specific beta, MEUR 2010 2009 cost of debt and debt equity ratio. When defining the WACC for Automation 36 2010 it has been considered that the general interest rate is currently Ship design 116 110 on a lower level.

Wärtsilä online annual report: www.annualreport2010.wartsila.com 256 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 Financials According to the performed sensitivity analyses, none of the downside scenarios would change the long term key assumptions for which Wärtsilä’s recoverable amounts are based, and would also not cause their respective values to fall short of their carrying amounts. As a result of performed impairment tests, there is no need for write-downs of the goodwill in a particular cash generating unit. In management’s opinion, changes in the basic assumptions provided in these theoretical downside scenarios shall not be seen as an indication that these factors are likely to materialise. The sensitivity analyses are hypothetical and should therefore be treated with caution. 2010 Construction in progress and Other intangible MEUR Intangible rights advances paid assets Goodwill Total Acquisition cost at 1 January 2010 74 27 395 562 1 058 Changes in exchange rates 3 17 21 Additions 2 8 7 17 Disposals and reclassifications 5 -17 8 -4 Acquisition cost at 31 December 2010 81 18 414 579 1 091 Accumulated amortisation and impairments 1 January 2010 -43 -231 -4 -279 Changes in exchange rates -2 -2 Accumulated amortisation on disposals 2 9 11 Amortisation during the financial year -5 -37 -42 Accumulated amortisation and impairments 31 December 2010 -46 -261 -4 -311 Book value at 31 December 2010 35 18 153 574 780 Developing costs for internally produced assets amounting to EUR 6 million (7) were activated during the financial period and the asset value was EUR 38 million (36). 2009 Construction in progress and Other intangible MEUR Intangible rights advances paid assets Goodwill Total Acquisition cost at 1 January 2009 73 19 368 549 1 009 Changes in exchange rates 1 8 18 27 Acquisitions 4 8 12 Additions 17 7 24 Disposals and reclassifications -8 8 -14 -14 Acquisition cost at 31 December 2009 74 27 395 562 1 058 Accumulated amortisation at 1 January 2009 -37 -179 -216 Changes in exchange rates -1 -1 Amortisation during the financial year -6 -52 -58 Impairments -4 -4 Accumulated amortisation and impairments at 31 December 2009 -43 -231 -4 -279 Book value at 31 December 2009 31 27 164 558 779 Wärtsilä online annual report: www.annualreport2010.wartsila.com 257 WÄRTSILÄ ANNUAL REPORT 2010 Financials 13.
