One effect of surface sizing our Pulp and Paper Chemicals business, Eka Chemicals. chemicals is to ensure that printing ink stays on the surface and dries there, rather than being absorbed into the paper itself.

Which is why we have signed a landmark agreement with the Forest Stewardship Council. The agreement makes AkzoNobel the FSC’s first global partner outside of products that are FSC certified. Both parties are cooperating to increase understanding of the organization’s work in promoting responsible forest management, and to boost awareness of FSC certification being a label for wood and paper from wellmanaged forests. Many of our businesses – particularly our woodcare brands – are already committed to the responsible sourcing of forest products. But under the terms of the agreement, AkzoNobel’s woodcare brands, Cuprinol, Pinotex, Xyladecor, CetaBever, Sparlack, Flood and Sadolin, will now work more closely with the FSC to further promote forest stewardship and drive demand for responsible products. The agreement includes setting up a global partnership fund with the FSC to support agreed social policy projects; educating customers about the FSC and its objectives; and helping to drive demand for FSC certified products. A new partnership logo has also been developed which will be used extensively on all branded material, including packaging. Developing partnerships such as the one we have agreed with the FSC is a clear illustration of our willingness to achieve transformational change, take positive action and help to protect the source of wood for future generations.

The tax rate is low because of several adjustments to previous years, partly related to settlements with tax authorities. Furthermore, there were tax-exempt gains related to acquisitions and divestments and part of a not recognized capital loss was used. In 2009, the tax rate was impacted by several adjustments on previous years, tax exempt income items and nondeductible expenses. The worldwide trend of decreasing tax rates has a diminishing impact on the long-term tax burden. Decreases in tax rates, however, also have a direct impact on the tax burden, because of a change in the measurement of the deferred tax positions. The relevant changes in this respect included the decrease of the tax rate in several countries as of 2011 and/or later. In addition, changes in the geographical mix of taxable income affected the tax burden. 100 Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Financial statements | AkzoNobel Report 2010 Tax in the balance sheet Breakdown of deferred tax assets and liabilities Current tax assets of €108 million (2009: €102 million) repreIn € millions Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities sent the amount of income taxes recoverable in respect of current and prior periods.

The main change in 2010 related to our pension and other post-retirement obligations was the divestment of National Starch, which is included within the acquisition/divestment/ transfers line of the table on the next page. The figures included in relation to National Starch divestment were a €179 million reduction in the pension defined benefit obligation, a €90 million reduction in pension plan assets and an €11 million reduction in the other post-retirement benefit defined benefit obligation. Together with €40 million of unrecognized actuarial losses that were recognized as part of the divestment, the net balance sheet liability reduction for pensions and other post-retirement benefits was therefore €60 million. 112 Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Financial statements | AkzoNobel Report 2010 Movements in defined benefit obligation and plan assets of pensions and other post-retirement benefits In € millions Pensions Other postretirement benefits 2009 2010 2009 2010 Defined benefit obligation Balance at beginning of year (11,468) (13,688) (441) (393) Acquisitions/divestments/transfers (32) 192 – 16 Curtailments 25 6 – – Settlements 197 15 – – Past service costs (28) (8) 48 3 Current service costs (50) (52) (7) (7) Contribution by employees (5) (3) (3) (3) Interest costs (746) (773) (24) (20) Benefits paid 943 936 40 34 Actuarial gains/(losses) (1,703) (250) (7) 4 Changes in exchange rates (821) (546) 1 (28) Defined benefit obligation at year-end (13,688) (14,171) (393) (394) Plan assets Balance at beginning of year 10,480 11,821 – – Acquisitions/divestments/transfers 31 (105) – – Settlements (217) (14) – – Contribution by employer 414 524 37 31 Contribution by employees 5 3 3 3 Benefits paid (943) (936) (40) (34) Expected return on plan assets 596 691 – – Actuarial gains/(losses) 614 652 – – Changes in exchange rates 841 486 – – Plan assets at year-end 11,821 13,122 – – Funded status (1,867) (1,049) (393) (394) Unrecognized net loss/(gain) 1,065 637 (4) (6) Unrecognized past service costs 4 4 (20) (19) Restriction on asset recognition – – – – Medicare receivable – – (5) (6) Net balance sheet provision (798) (408) (422) (425) Recorded under: Provisions for pensions and other (1,017) (856) (422) (425) post-retirement benefits Other financial non-current assets 219 448 – – Total (798) (408) (422) (425) AkzoNobel Report 2010 | Financial statements | Notes to the consolidated financial statements 113 Funded and unfunded pension plans In € millions 2009 2010 Wholly or partly funded plans 13,347 13,792 Unfunded plans 341 379 Total 13,688 14,171 Funded status in earlier years at December 31 In € millions Pensions Other post-retirement benefits 2006 2007 2008 2006 2007 2008 Defined benefit obligation (5,760) (4,628) (11,468) (292) (286) (441) Plan assets 3,942 3,502 10,480 – – – Funded status (1,818) (1,126) (988) (292) (286) (441) The actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit obligation and plan assets over the period 2006 – 2010 break down as follows: Actuarial gains and losses In € millions Pensions Other post-retirement benefits 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Defined benefit obligations: Due to experience 2 90 (147) 331 (92) 74 (3) (5) 5 23 Due to change in assumptions (199) 166 1,624 (2,034) (158) 19 6 5 (12) (19) Plan assets: Due to experience 214 (29) (1,445) 614 652 – – – – – Total 17 227 32 (1,089) 402 93 3 – (7) 4 Net periodic cost The remaining plans primarily represent defined contribution In € millions Pensions Other post-retirement benefits plans.

Credit risk management Credit risk arises from financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value, deposits with banks and financial institutions, and trade receivables. We have a credit risk management policy in place to limit credit losses due to non-performance of financial counterparties and customers. We monitor our exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis at various levels. We only deal with counterparties that have a sufficiently high credit rating. Generally, we do not require collateral in respect of financial assets. 126 Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Financial statements | AkzoNobel Report 2010 Liquidity risk management Maturity of liabilities and cash outflows The primary objective of liquidity management is to provide for In € millions Less than Between Over 5 years sufficient cash and cash equivalents at all times and any place 1 year 1 and 5 years in the world to e ­ nable ­us to meet our payment obligations.

NPEs are already banned completely in Europe, while in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced that it will be banning NPEs in industrial laundry and cleaning products. The good news for customers seeking an eco-premium alternative is that our Surface Chemistry business has already developed one. Berol 609 is AkzoNobel’s next generation nonylphenol ethoxylate replacement which exceeds the degreasing power of leading NPE replacements. Completely water soluble and biodegradable, there’s also no need for customers to reformulate. It can simply be used as a direct drop-in for NP9 or NP10. Produced in large volumes and widely used in detergents and cleaning products, NPEs are thought to be toxic to aquatic organisms. Initiatives to encourage companies to voluntarily phase out their use (which we did some time ago) have been gathering momentum in recent months, with the world’s high growth markets expected to follow suit sooner rather than later. Berol 609 is therefore well placed to position itself as the most attractive alternative. Invent Integrate sustainable value propositions Eco-premium solutions portfolio.

We continue AkzoNobel Report 2010 | Sustainability | Invent 145 Akzonobel and inventive thinking It’s usually the major, pioneering product innovations that grab all the glory. And there’s nothing wrong with that. But most of the time, it’s the less high profile breakthroughs that give our customers the most satisfaction. Applying putty to repair large wooden substrates is a classic example. Imperfections and defects that occur naturally in wood are normally repaired by hand, using putty. The putty then needs to be dried before the huge panels of wood can be turned into flooring, furniture, doors and so on. This process is slow, not always accurate and the technology used is not particularly durable. So our Wood Finishes and Adhesives business – working together with leading manufacturers Swedwood (an IKEA company) and Tarkett – developed a new concept known as the Automatic Putty System (APS). It’s an automated system which uses scanners/ cameras to detect imperfections, robots for application and a special APS machine to push down, smooth out and cure the putty, which is supplied by AkzoNobel. This new patented process brings major benefits to the customer as it requires fewer people, offers increased quality due to the use of our UV curing putty, results in higher productivity and efficiency and is more accurate and consistent. Tarkett is running one line in Hanaskog in Sweden, while Swedwood is using the system to produce spruce and pine furniture for IKEA. The putty system also provides benefits in terms of sustainability.

AkzoNobel Report 2010 | Sustainability | Improve 157 Akzonobel and cool coatings Many of us instantly recognize the familiar Heineken beer can. But what a lot of people may not be aware of is the fact that the new tactile packaging appearing in stores across Europe was achieved using technology developed by AkzoNobel. The newly designed can features a stylish, embossed effect which uses tactile ink to form a series of tiny raised dots on the surface. When held, the improved grip becomes noticeable, while the texture gives the impression of condensation and the contents appear to be ice cold. These unique visual and sensory elements boost brand recognition and help the can to become even more instantly recognizable. The technology behind the new can was supplied by our Industrial Coatings business, whose Aquaprime 186 product makes the so-called differential texturing possible. It offers a better alternative to current techniques as traditional embossing slows down the production. Heineken initially approached the can makers in 2008, requesting ideas for how to change the specialty finish of cans that were embossed for the European market. The texturing proposal then surfaced, which is when AkzoNobel became involved, because we had the product which made it possible. Trials were conducted with can makers and, following a few modifications, the appearance and formulation were finalized and production was scaled up. Heineken is now promoting the textured can globally. 158 Regulatory actions Based on major changes in substance classification, we Distribution We have defined three categories of regulatory action, from have updated the mechanism for defining substances of high We are also increasing our attention on the distribution aspect self-reported issues (Level 1) to formal legal notifications with concern within the portfolio.

But when an enterprising global market sector manager showed it to IKEA, the seeds of a new opportunity for our Powder Coatings business were planted. The technology in question was initially developed for use on laptop covers. Customers were looking for eco-efficient solutions that offered new textures, effects and patterns. So a soft touch topcoat was developed which met all the demanding specifications. However, one of Powder Coatings’ furniture sector managers thought the new range might be of interest to IKEA and before long a new business opportunity was born. IKEA will now produce 1.5 million flower pots during 2011 in Vietnam and Germany, all coated with our soft touch powder technology. Not only is it far more eco-efficient in terms of energy consumption when compared with traditional glaze, but the overall cost is lower as well.

AkzoNobel Report 2010 | Sustainability | Improve 163 akzonobel and cutting out carbon Saying that you’re going to become more sustainable is one thing, but actually embracing the whole concept of being more eco-efficient and less reliant on fossil fuels requires positive action. One of the most active and successful businesses in AkzoNobel’s concerted drive to lower its environmental footprint is Industrial Chemicals. Already honored externally for its Carbon Policy, it is one of our most energy intensive businesses, but it has also adopted an integrated approach to sustainability and is constantly implementing new and innovative ways of improving its carbon and ecological footprint. For example, much of the steam Industrial Chemicals uses in its various manufacturing processes comes from waste or renewables, with four plants in Europe now using energy being created from these sources. Initiatives involving wind energy are also being investigated, while the business already operates so-called green barges and runs trucks on bio-diesel, ensuring that its transportation of products is also sustainable and that its efforts stretch across the value chain. In addition, as part of the overall plan to reduce its carbon footprint, the business is currently engaged in a site modernization program, which will further optimize the drive towards more sustainable manufacturing. 164 Page title | Sustainability | AkzoNobel Report 2010 Soil and groundwater remediation Chemical oxygen demand in kilotons • Reductions in COD in effluent are being achieved across There are substantial costs associated with the assessment the company.
