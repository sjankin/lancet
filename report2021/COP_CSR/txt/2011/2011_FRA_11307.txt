I 2010 Registration Document CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 4 Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued in French. It is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information required specifically by French law in such reports, whether qualified or not. This information presents below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated financial statements. This report should be read and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. Year ended December 31, 2010 To the shareholders: In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your General Meeting of Shareholders, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2010 on:  the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Crédit Agricole S.A.;  the justification of our assessments;  the specific verification required by law. The consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. 3 I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2010, as well as of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Without qualifying our opinion expressed above, we draw your attention to the matter set out in the Note 1.1 to the consolidated financial statements, which describes the change in accounting method for the recognition of actuarial gains or losses of post-employment defined benefit plans and new standards and interpretations applied particularly the amendments to IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” and IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. Crédit Agricole S.A. I 2010 Registration Document I 367 4 CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2010 Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements 3 II. Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:  Your Group accounts for impairment reserves to cover identified credit risk, which are inherent to its business activities. We have reviewed the procedures implemented by the management to identify and assess these risks and to determine the amount of impairment it considers necessary, and we have verified that these accounting estimates were based on documented methods that comply with the principles described in Note 1.3 to the consolidated financial statements.  As stated in Notes 1.3 and 10.2 to the consolidated financial statements, your Group uses internal models to assess the fair value of certain financial instruments that are not traded on an active market. We have reviewed the control procedures around these models, the assumptions used and the way the risks associated with such instruments are taken into consideration.  As stated in Note 1.3 to the consolidated financial statements, your Group has made estimates in order to factor in changes in its own credit risk into the valuation of issued securities accounted for at fair value through profit and loss. We have assessed the appropriateness of the parameters used for this purpose.  As stated in Notes 1.3, 2.3 and 2.6 to the consolidated financial statements, your Group has performed impairment tests on goodwills and investments in equity affiliates. We have reviewed the terms and conditions related to these tests, the main parameters and assumptions used, and have verified that the presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements was appropriate.  As part of its process of preparation of the consolidated financial statements, your Group has made other accounting estimates, as explained in Note 1.3 to the consolidated financial statements, in particular regarding the valuation and impairment of non-consolidated equity securities, the pension and future employee benefits engagements, reserves for operational risks, reserves for legal risks, deferred taxes assets and the recognition of the deferred profit sharing reserve and the justification of the recoverable nature of that asset. We have reviewed the methods and assumptions used and ensured that the accounting estimates are appropriately documented in conformity with the principles described in Note 1.3 of the consolidated financial statements. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. 3 III. Specific verification As required by law, we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information on the Group presented in the management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

It is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information required specifically by French law in such reports, whether qualified or not. This information presents below the opinion on the separate financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the separate financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the separate financial statements. This report should be read and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. Year ended December 31, 2010 To the shareholders: In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your General Meeting of Shareholders, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2010, on:  the audit of the accompanying financial statements of Crédit Agricole S.A.;  the justification of our assessments;  the specific verifications and information required by law. These financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 3 I. Opinion on the financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sample techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and of the results of its operations for the year ended in accordance with French generally accepted accounting principles. Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matter set out in the Note 2 to the financial statements which describes changes in accounting policies and financial statements presentation due to new standards and interpretations applied as of the year 2010. 418 I Crédit Agricole S.A.

We have reviewed the assumptions used and verified that these accounting estimates are based on documented methods that comply with the principles set forth in Note 2 to the financial statements. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the separate financial statements, taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. 3 III. Specific verifications and information We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law. We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information provided in the management report of the Board of Directors, and in the documents addressed to the shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. Concerning the information provided in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) related to compensations and benefits received by the Directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from companies controlling your Company or controlled by it. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the main shareholders has been properly disclosed in the management report.
