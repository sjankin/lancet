Such calamities create major challenges for the affected nations, and necessitate a collective response from humanity as a whole. In Pakistan, the flood catastrophe in 2010 took a heavy toll on the infrastructure and economy, whereby the after effects are adding to the suffering of the common people, especially in rural Pakistan. Being a socially embedded enterprise, Mobilink has launched a broad-based rehabilitation program and is consistently engaged in meeting these challenges and enabling robust recovery, with increased focus on sustainable growth. Over the time, Mobilink has donated prefabricated sheets worth Rs. 140 million to WHO to be used as Health Units across Pakistan. Additionally, Mobilink with the support of Orascom Telecom Holding has committed a comprehensive relief-package worth Rs. 85 million for those affected by the floods. Mobilink remains committed to leadership in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, throughout Pakistan. Volunteerism remains an integral part of the company's philosophy and culture. As we serve a growing subscriber-base of over 32 million people, we continue to share our success with the common man, through flood-relief, rehabilitation, internally displaced person support, promotion of literacy, environment protection and health drives. Through the implementation of CSR bestpractices, we aim to promote the spirit of humanity and national development amongst our employees. We are working with a long-term vision, whereby the scope of our CSR activities expands with each passing year. Mobilink recognizes the importance of catering to the social needs of the masses while ensuring healthy growth. The respect and success enjoyed by Mobilink today, is nurtured through our operational excellence and revolutionary humanitarian initiatives. To reiterate this commitment, we continue to invest in sustainable social projects that are beneficial for the masses and our company’s future. Being a part of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) has helped Mobilink in re-aligning the CSR focus with UNGC’s highly evolved principles.
