VLA VILHELM LAURITZEN ARCHITECTS STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Copenhagen June 2011 To whom it may concern I hereby express our continued support for the Global Compact initiative. Since VLA’s latest communication on progress in june 2010 the implementation of environmentally sustainable measures in our various building projects has become even more present. Many of our projects are now designed with energy optimized features like high insulating glass, integration of solar cells and efficient climate shells. Most notably is our part in the development of a low energy housing concept wich will offer affordable ‘green’ homes to all levels of income. For actions taken and outcomes achieved I kindly refer to the following pages.

VLA Communication On Progress #2 2011 Element 2: Actions VLA VILHELM LAURITZEN ARCHITECTS OUTCOMES ‘Energy Zero Home’ Since the first communication on progress in june 2010, VLA has continued the development of a housing concept with focus on low energy consumption, affordability and flexibility. Continued collaboration with different business partners on this project provides VLA valuable challenges, feedback and inspiration for working with both environmental and social sustainability. The concept’s flexibility means that the houses are now being realized on several locations across Denmark. Some as family homes and some as homes for disabled. The project is designed with inspiration from the nordic townhouse tradition of modern and liveable houses. Human scale and vibrant facades make it an attractive type of housing. Affordable quality housing requires a build system with a high degree of repetition and prefabrication. The building elements are prefabricated as room-size elements at a factory and erected and installed on foundations on site. The low energy consumption is possible with the integration of measures like solar arrays and solar traps, extra insulation, ventilation plant with heat recycling and heat pumps. The units are light constructions in recyclable materials such as timber, aluminium, galvanized steel and zinc.
