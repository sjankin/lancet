Review of Operations International Passenger Operations Overview of the Fiscal Year Ended March 2011 The expansion of airports in the Tokyo area has created opportunities for growth. Air transport demand on international routes grew steadily, as the expansion of international service at Haneda Airport and a broadly based recovery in business demand more than compensated for factors including the decline in tourist travel on China routes due to the Senkaku Islands dispute and the impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake.

Earthquake-related information website Third-Party Comment After the Great East Japan Earthquake, food manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies were highly praised for the swift action they took in providing their products to the affected area. When this kind of major disaster occurs, companies not only have to restore their own operations but are expected to take actions from a CSR perspective. Now and in the future, expectations will be high for the non-scheduled flights for transportation of passengers and relief supplies that the ANA Group provides to affected areas. The ANA Group’s response to disaster has become increasingly sophisticated with each passing year, as it accumulates experience with earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions in various Motoki Sawada locations. However, the ANA Group has to make careful preparations against the predicted Senior Manager, Business Advisory Division, KPMG AZSA LLC earthquake in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, as the operation of its aircrafts is centrally managed from the Haneda area.

The IATA audits are conducted under the IOSA Training in Communication for Emergencies July is the ANA Group’s aviation safety promotion month, during which it conducts various safety-related training sessions. Training in communication for emergencies is aimed at enabling employees who support operations during an emergency to convey accurate information in order to facilitate swift responses. Maintenance staff, cabin crew, and ground operations control and support staff from Group companies board a flight simulator where the flight crew simulate various scenarios anticipated in emergency situations, such as an aborted takeoff or emergency descent. The participants physically feel conditions in a malfunctioning aircraft and get to discuss questions specific to the operations they support, such as how to provide assistance from the ground to the flight and cabin crew, and what and when to communicate from the airplane to the ground staff. The training involves highly specialized staff members from each division who elaborate on the most appropriate communication methods to follow in an emergency. The training offers a place for representatives from each division to review case studies from around the world and the actual experiences of the participants and to discuss what should be done to support safer flight operation. The participants take back the experiences from the training to their respective workplaces, while the Safety Promotion Committee compiles these experiences and reflects them in the safety promotion activities of the each Group division and company. 60 All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd.

Environmental Management System The ANA Group has achieved significant results Groupwide from the Fuel Efficiency Project, which has been conducted as a global warming countermeasure. Steps have included inspecting and visualizing existing measures and studying or undertaking new measures. The overall system that operates continuously across all departments to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft is guided by the Eco-First Subcommittee within the Environmental Management Committee. Moreover, the Group has established the Office Environment & Energy Subcommittee within the same committee to deal with the April 2010 enforcement of revisions to the Law Concerning the Rational Use of Energy and Tokyo Metropolitan Government ordinances, and to promote environmental activities at the office level. ◆ Environmental Management Promotion System Relationship with Stakeholders CSR Promotion Committee Environmental Management Committee (Office: CSR Promotion Division) Eco-First Subcommittee Office Environment & Energy Subcommittee Flight Environment Operation Environment Aircraft Maintenance Passenger & Product Service Working Group Working Group Working Group Environment Working Group Environmental Conservation Activities Unique to ANA As a leading eco-friendly airline, the ANA Group has established the ANA Group Ecology Plan (2008-2011) and is committed to environmental activities with each individual employee working as part of a team in pursuit of its objectives. In November 2008, the ANA Group became the airline and transport industry’s first certified Eco-First company. With the cooperation of customers, stakeholders and people around the world, we will pursue forward-looking initiatives unique to ANA. In addition to measures against global warming, initiatives include the ANA Carbon Offset Program, e-flights, “3R” (reduce, reuse and recycle) activities, activities under the slogan of “Spreading the Chain of ‘Planet Mindfulness’” as part of the Aozora project and participation in research and development of biofuels.
