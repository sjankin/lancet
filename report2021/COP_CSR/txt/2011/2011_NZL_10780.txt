Tridonic NZ is committed to working with and encouraging our sub-contractors to uphold the principles in this Policy and to adopt similar policies within their businesses. The Policy includes the following components: • Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining The Company respects our employees’ right to join, form or not to join a labour union without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. Where employees are represented by a legally recognized union, we are committed to establishing a constructive dialogue with their freely chosen representatives. Tridonic NZ is committed to bargaining in good faith with such representatives. • Forced Labor Tridonic NZ prohibits the use of all forms of forced labour, including prison labour, indentured labour, bonded labour, military labour or slave labour. • Discrimination at work place Tridonic NZ values all employees and the contributions they make and has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity and intolerance of discrimination. We are dedicated to maintaining workplaces that are free from discrimination or physical or verbal harassment on the basis of race, sex, colour, national or social origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, political opinion or any other status protected by applicable law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, placement, training, compensation and advancement at the work place is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. • Work Hours and Wages Tridonic NZ compensates employees competitively relative to the industry and local labour market. We operate in full compliance with applicable wage, work hours, overtime and benefits laws. We offer employees opportunities to develop their skills and capabilities and provide advancement opportunities where possible. • Workplace Security Tridonic NZ is committed to maintaining a workplace that is free from violence, harassment, intimidation and other unsafe or disruptive conditions due to internal and external threats. Security safeguards for employees are provided as needed and will be maintained with respect for employee privacy and dignity. Corporate Social Responsibility 16TH February 2011 • Child Labor Tridonic NZ adheres to minimum age provisions of applicable laws and regulations. Tridonic NZ prohibits the hiring of individuals that are under 18 years of age for positions in which hazardous work is required. Tridonic NZ’s prohibition of child labour is very strict with International Labour Organization standards. The Zumtobel Group, of which Tridonic NZ is a member of, has a code of conduct which everyone in the Zumtobel Group adheres to. A snap shot of the Zumtobel Group’s code of conduct is shown in Attachment B which can be seen on the following page. This includes: • the cover page • the table of contents • the social responsibility and environmental protection section It can be seen that the social responsibility and environmental protection section in the code of conduct addresses basic labour principles and employee working conditions which the whole Zumtobel Group abides by. A breakdown of the age bands of the employees in Tridonic NZ has been provided in the table below: No of Employees No of Employees Age 2009/10 2010/11 18 -20 4 2 21-30 15 23 31-40 11 9 41-50 11 11 51-60 10 12 Above 60 0 2 This clearly establishes that Tridonic NZ does not discriminate against age & does not tolerate child labour.

The Zumtobel Group offers all its employees equal employment opportunities. All personnel decisions are based on performance, qualifications and similar criteria, whether the decisions involved relate to recruitment, training, remuneration or promotion. 6.2 WORKING CONDITIONS The Zumtobel Group is committed to providing employment and working conditions in line with the recommendations issued by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) – which means that it will not tolerate child labour and undertakes, for example, to provide safe and hygienic working conditions for its employees. The Zumtobel Group will not tolerate any working conditions which contravene international legislation and regulations.The same standards are expected of the Zumtobel Group’s business partners. 6.3 MISUSE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS Alcohol and other drugs can severely impair employees’ ability to think clearly and carry out their tasks effectively and efficiently. They reduce productivity, and – more important still – they can endanger Zumtobel Group employees and their working environment. All Zumtobel Group employees are therefore strictly prohibited from misusing drugs, alcohol and other intoxicating substances during working hours. 22 23 6.4 SEXUAL HARASSMENT This principle applies equally to all business relationships with external third parties, for example customers, suppliers, consultants, dealers and other business partners of the Zumtobel Group, Sexual harassment can take a wide variety of forms, including for example explicit sexual including its competitors. advances, humiliating comments, jokes, offensive language or lewd gestures. Such behaviour may be interpreted as sexual harassment even when it was not intended as such. The Zumtobel Group forbids sexual harassment in any form. 6.6 ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY Employees who feel they are being subjected to sexual harassment can contact the relevant The Zumtobel Group is committed to the sensitive and sustainable treatment of resources, person or department within the Zumtobel Group (see Section 11) at any time.

The Zumtobel Group Corporate Culture acknowledges and celebrates the fact that every human being is unique and valuable and should be respected for their individual abilities. The Zumtobel Group will therefore not tolerate any kind of discrimination, whether it relates to: • age • disability • marital status • gender • culture • national or ethnic origin • political opinion (in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights) • race • religion • sexual orientation, or • social class. 24 25 Corporate Social Responsibility 16TH February 2011 Global Compact Area – Environment Principle 7 Businesses are asked to support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Support to environmental challenges: Tridonic NZ recognises the New Zealand government efforts to provide a clean healthy environment for both the present and future generations of New Zealanders. The National Environmental Standards enforced throughout the country helps to ensure that everyone in New Zealand has clear air to breathe, clean water to drink and clean land to live on. Tridonic NZ is committed to maintaining and protecting New Zealand’s clean green image because we believe this is an essential value adding process which we can benefit from. Initiatives to promote environmental responsibility: Global changes, dwindling resources and the effects of climate change – every individual has to assume responsibility. Tridonic takes its social responsibility to society and its employees just as seriously as it takes its responsibility for ensuring sustainable environmental protection and manufacturing energy-efficient products. Far-sighted ecological and social actions enable us to contribute towards protecting the environment and society at large. There is a concept for our contribution towards treating the environment, its resources and society responsibly: “ECOLUTION”. The development of environmentally friendly technologies: The Zumtobel Group’s vision of sustainability – “Through light, we care” – expresses its absolute commitment to corporate responsibility. In its core business the Group develops sustainable lighting solutions that set new standards in promoting human well-being – particularly in terms of energy efficiency and light quality. This means that through its products, the company’s economic interests are intrinsically linked with both social and ecological responsibility. Tridonic NZ is committed to the development of environmentally sound new products and reducing waste materials produced during manufacturing processes. The Zumtobel Group as a whole take environmental concerns very seriously. This can be seen from: • Attachment C.1 – Our Environment Health and Safety Policy • Attachment C.2 – Our Ecolution Projects Corporate Social Responsibility 16TH February 2011 ECOLUTION is the integrated sustainability strategy which links all the divisions of our company. We assume responsibility for the environment, society and, above all, our customers. Our ecolution strategy sets new sustainability standards that go far beyond just environmental protection. TRIDONIC helps its customers identify the ideal solution for greater sustainability and efficiency. Energy savings of up to 80 percent can be achieved with lighting management systems and digital dimmable ballasts. Control of the luminaries is demand-led, governed by presence sensors and daylight levels. As part of TRIDONIC’s “ecolution” sustainability strategy, the “ecosim” simulation toll compares different lighting technologies based on life cycle costs, energy profiles and life cycle assessments. This way, the cumulative costs of various solutions can be mapped over several years, helping to define amortization periods and environmental impacts.

Our businesses are against all forms of Corruption: New Zealand does not have any one single agency tasked with fighting corruption. Unlike many other countries it has not seen the need to create an Independent Commission against Corruption. Rather it has a number of agencies that focus on the different elements in the fight against corruption. Some of these agencies have their focus on the more positive task of reinforcing values to ensure that New Zealand maintains a corruption free environment; others focus on the enforcement of the laws and the rules. Background: Tridonic NZ defines corruption as ‘the abuse of a position of trust in order to achieve improper financial or other advantage’. We are aware that corporate corruption can take many forms such as: • bribery, price-fixing agreements, facilitation payments • money laundering • inappropriate favours, hospitality or gifts Tridonic NZ is part of a the Zumtobel Group’s Code of Conduct which contains detailed regulations on corruption (refer to Attachment D) which all employees must observe as well as other sensitive issues such as: • sponsorship • political and charitable donations • and relations with the authorities Objective: Tridonic NZ will not condone any form of corruption. Briefly, the giving or accepting of undue advantage and other forms of corruption, along with the damage caused by such misconduct worldwide, are a serious issue in today’s legal, economic and political environment. For this reason, in September 2004 the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, made a clear commitment to introducing anti-corruption regulations for all business dealings, transactions and processes in all Zumtobel Group companies worldwide of which Tridonic NZ is a member. As an active participant in the World Economic Forum’s “Partnering against Corruption Initiative” (PACI) the goal of the Zumtobel Group of which Tridonic NZ is a member, is to actively combat the various forms of corruption in international and national business dealings. Corporate Social Responsibility 16TH February 2011 Target: Do note, as an international company, we currently have an independent 3rd party audit carried out on a yearly basis. Fraud and corruption is an important component of this audit. Nevertheless, we will try and further improve by identifying key areas which might be susceptible to fraud and corruption in our business and rectify it. In the Zumtobel Group we will not tolerate any form of corruption; regardless of the value or nature of the advantage this involves (cash, benefits in kind, etc.).

For this reason, in September 2004 the Zumtobel Group made a clear commitment to introducing anti-corruption regulations for all business dealings, transactions and processes in all Zumtobel Group companies worldwide. As an active participant in the World Economic Forum’s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) the Zumtobel Group’s goal and duty is to actively combat the various forms of corruption in international and national business dealings. The following provisions govern transactions or situations involving Zumtobel Group employees or external third parties acting on behalf of the Zumtobel Group. The Zumtobel Group cannot, however, accept any responsibility or liability whatsoever for corrupt conduct on the part of external third parties (e.g. suppliers, customers, etc.). 4.2 BRIBERY For the purposes of this Code of Conduct, the Zumtobel Group understands as bribery the • offering • promising • giving • demanding, or • accepting of financial or other advantage to or from • public officials • politicians, political parties and/or their representatives, or • other external third parties in order to obtain or retain business or to secure any other improper advantage in the conduct of business. The Zumtobel Group expressly prohibits its employees from engaging any form of bribery, regardless of the value or type of benefit involved (cash, benefits in kind, etc.). Employees who fail to observe this prohibition will face strict disciplinary measures and/or civil/criminal proceedings. If Zumtobel Group employees are subjected to attempted bribery or suspect an attempt at securing inappropriate influence by an external third party, they should contact their supervisor or the Ethics Officer immediately. 13 4.3 FACILITATION PAYMENTS 4.5 CHARITY DONATIONS In contrast to bribery, “facilitation payments” are made in order to expedite the performance Donations to charitable institutions must be approved by the Zumtobel Group Executive Board of legal and routine activities by public officials (e.g. customs procedures, the routine issuing of entry if any of the following apply: documents at airports, etc.).The sums involved are generally very small (a few Euro). • the sum donated is greater than EUR 5,000 • the donation is made to globally active organisations, e.g. UNICEF, Amnesty International, In some countries such facilitation payments to officials are standard practice. Nonetheless they Médecins Sans Frontières, etc. are generally illegal – and in any case they contravene the ethical principles by which the Zumtobel • the donation relates to major (global) disasters (e.g. earthquakes, floods or similar) or other Group’s activities are governed.

All other charitable donations should be handled within the framework of the relevant budIf Zumtobel Group employees are requested to make facilitation payments, they should in all get and the relevant policies and regulations. cases inform their supervisor or the Ethics Officer – after the fact, if no other option is available.The aim in this case is to make such practices transparent and verifiable. 4.6 SPONSORSHIP 4.4 GIFTS, HOSPITALITY, The Zumtobel Group pursues a very active policy of arts sponsorship which is to be impleESTABLISHING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS mented within the framework of Group strategy, the relevant policies and regulations, and approved marketing and communications budgets.The following points should always be observed: The Zumtobel Group prohibits the offering or receipt of gifts, hospitality or other benefits, if • the sponsorship contribution should not exercise any influence over future decisions taken by the the aim of these offerings is to influence business transactions in an improper and unethical way, or recipient (e.g. the awarding of contracts) even if they could merely create an impression of such improper influence. • all sponsorship contributions should be verifiable and fully documented.

The principles outlined in this paragraph also apply when establishing new business relationships. 14 15 4.7 POLITICAL DONATIONS 4.9 RELATIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES Donations or other payments to political parties, whether they are made directly or indirectIn most countries around the world there is strict legislation governing the acceptance of gifts ly, are prohibited. or bribes by the authorities.

In most countries of the world money laundering is prohibited by law. The Zumtobel Group is committed to full compliance with all applicable legislation against money laundering. For this reason, the Zumtobel Group only enters into business relationships with reputable customers or other business partners who are exclusively engaged in legitimate businesses and whose funds derive from legal sources. Consequently, all Zumtobel Group Divisions must ensure that they do not accept any revenues which have any connection with money laundering activities. In cases of doubt, a careful investigation must be conducted (in accordance with the principles of due diligence – see Glossary) in order to gather as much information as possible about the relevant business partner. If there is any suspicion or indication that a business partner is engaged in money laundering or other illegal activities, the Ethics Officer must be contacted immediately. 16 17
