COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT WWW.TRANSURBAN.COM Transurban signed the United Nations Global Compact in 2009. The Compact is a voluntary framework which encourages companies to align their operations to ten universal principles on human rights, labour practices, the environment and anti-corruption. Since signing the document, Transurban has been applying these principles across our business, and in FY12 we will continue this work. For information on our progress, please refer to our 2011 Sustainability Report on the Transurban website. Chris Lynch Chief Executive Officer VISIT OUR ONLINE REPORT WWW.TRANSURBAN.COM/SR11
