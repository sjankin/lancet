Equity changes with the result for the individual period, equity transactions with the owners and items recognised in the total comprehensive income. Share capital, the share premium fund and other equity is evaluated and managed together. The share premium fund may be used to cover a loss, and other equity may be used in accordance with the provisions of the Public Limited Liabilities Company Act. The own shares column shows the nominal values of the holding of own shares. The amount paid in excess of the equity’s nominal value is booked as a reduction in other equity, such that the entire cost price for own shares is deducted from the Group’s equity. A positive amount on the “own shares” line is due to own shares being used in the shares scheme for employees. Storebrand pays particular attention to the active management of equity in the Group. This management is tailored to the business-related financial risk and capital requirements in which the composition of its business areas and their growth will be an important driver for the Group’s capital requirements. The goal of the capital management is to ensure an effective capital structure and reserve an appropriate balance between internal goals in relation to regulatory and the rating companies’ requirements. If there is a need for new equity, this is procured by the holding company Storebrand ASA, which is listed on the stock exchange and the Group’s parent company. Storebrand is a financial group subject to statutory requirements regarding primary capital under both the capital adequacy regulations and the solvency margin regulations. Primary capital encompasses both equity and subordinated loan capital. For Storebrand, these legal requirements carry the greatest ­significance in its capital management. The Group’s goals are to achieve a core (tier 1) capital ratio in the bank of more than 10 per cent and a solvency margin in life and pensions of more than 150 per cent over time. In general, the equity of the Group can be managed without material restrictions if the capital requirements are met and the ­respective legal entities have adequate solidity. Capital can be transferred from foreign legal entities with the consent of local supervisory authorities. For further information on the Group’s fulfilment of the capital requirements, see note 53. 58 annual report storebrand asa Cash flow analysis Storebrand Group 1 January – 31 December NOK million 2010 2009 Cash flow from operational activities Net receipts insurance 20,918 13,609 Net payments claims and insurance benefits -18,092 -15,179 Net receipts/payments premium reserve transferred 1,007 -589 Receipts interest, commission and fees from customers 1,719 2,031 Payments interest, commission and fees to customers -474 -593 Payment of income tax -5 Payments relating to operations -2,997 -3,176 Net receipts/payments other operational activities 721 -3,700 Net cash flow from operations before financial assets and banking customers 2,798 -7,597 Net receipts/payments lending to customers 2,092 2,942 Net receipts/payments deposits bank customers 473 31 Net receipts/payments financial investments 1,027 421 Net receipts/payments real estate investments -1,468 253 Net change in bank deposits insurance customers 562 7,306 Net cash flow from financial assets and banking customers 2,685 10,953 Net cash flow from operational activities 5,483 3,356 Cash flow from investment activities Net payments sale/capitalisation of group companies -113 -234 Net receipts/payments sale/purchase of property and fixed assets -122 -127 Net cash flow from investment activities -235 -361 Cash flow from financing activities Payments repayments of loans -4,612 -7,785 Receipts new loans 2,709 1,757 Payments interest on loans -769 -836 Receipts subordinated loan capital 981 Payments repayment of subordinated loan capital -175 -3,408 Payments interest on subordinated loan capital -558 -642 Net receipts/payments deposits from Norges Bank and other financial institutions -2,163 3,790 Receipts issuing of share capital 9 Payments repayment of share capital 10 Net cash flow from financing activities -5,559 -6,134 Net cash flow for the period -311 -3,139 of which net cash flow in the period before financial assets and banking customers -2,997 -14,092 Net movement in cash and cash equivalents -311 -3,139 Cash and cash equivalents at start of the period for new companies 4 Cash and cash equivalents sale/discontinued operations of companies -126 Cash and cash equivalents at start of the period 3,609 6,744 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 1 3,172 3,609 1 Consist of: Lending to financial institutions 701 425 Bank deposits 2,472 3,184 Total 3,172 3,609 annual report storebrand asa 59 Cash flow analysis Storebrand Group The cash flow analysis shows the Group’s cash flows for operational, investment and financial activities pursuant to the direct method. The cash flows show the overall change in means of payment over the year. Operational activities A substantial part of the activities in a financial group will be classified as operational. All receipts and payments from insurance activities are included from the life insurance companies, and these cash flows are invested in financial assets that are also defined as operational activities. One subtotal is generated in the statement that shows the net cash flow from operations before financial assets and banking customers, and one subtotal that shows the cash flows from financial assets and banking customers. This shows that the composition of net cash flows from operational activities for a financial group includes cash flows from both operations and investments in financial assets. The life insurance companies’ balance sheets include substantial items linked to the insurance customers that are included on the individual lines in the cash flow analysis. Since the cash flow analysis is intended to show the change in cash flow for the company, the change in bank deposits for insurance customers is included on an own line in operating activities to neutralise the cash flows associated with the customer portfolio in life insurance. Investment activities Includes cash flows for holdings in group companies and tangible fixed assets. Financing activities Financing activities include cash flows for equity, subordinated loans and other borrowing that helps fund the Group’s activities. Payments of interest on ­ orrowing and payments of share dividends to shareholders are financial activities. b Cash/cash equivalents Cash/cash equivalents are defined as claims on central banks and claims on financial institutions without notice periods for the company portfolio. The amount does not include claims on financial institutions linked to the insurance customers portfolio, since these are liquid assets not available for use by the Group. 60 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group 01 Accounting policies The accounting policies used for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described below.

The statement of financial position also includes activated intangible assets, which primarily consist of excess values linked to acquired insurance contracts. These excess values are stated at cost price less an annual amortisation. The liabilities side of the Group’s statement of financial position primarily consists of financial instruments (liabilities) and technical insurance reserves. With the exception of derivatives that are stated at fair value, the majority of the financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost. The technical insurance reserves are intended to cover liabilities linked to issued insurance contracts. It is a requirement that the reserves must be adequate. Various methods and principles are applied to establish the reserves for various insurance contracts. A significant proportion of the insurance liabilities are related to insurance contracts with an interest guarantee. Recognised liabilities linked to Norwegian insurance contracts with an interest guarantee are discounted using the premium calculation rate. Recognised liabilities linked to Swedish insurance contracts with an interest guarantee are discounted using a market interest rate. The reserve for the savings elements of pension insurance contracts will correspond with the pertinent asset portfolios. The accounting policies are described in more detail below. Consolidation The consolidated financial statements combine Storebrand ASA and companies where Storebrand ASA has the power to exercise a controlling influence. A controlling influence is normally achieved where the Group owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 per cent of the shares in a company and the Group has the power to exercise control over the company. Minority interests are included in the Group’s equity. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the purchase of subsidiaries. Investments in associated companies (normally investments of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the associated companies’ equity) where the company exercises significant influence are consolidated in accordance with the equity method. Interests in joint ventures are consolidated in accordance with the proportional consolidation method, i.e. by including the proportion of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities in the appropriate lines in the financial statements. Presentation currency and currency conversion for foreign companies The Group’s presentation currency is the Norwegian krone (NOK). Foreign companies included in the Group that use a different functional currency are translated to NOK by converting the profit and loss account at the average exchange rate for the accounting year and converting the statement of financial position at the exchange rate at close of the accounting year. Any revaluation differences are booked directly against equity. Elimination of internal transactions Internal receivables and payables, internal profits and losses, interest and dividends, etc. between Group companies are eliminated in the consolidated ­financial statements. Transactions between customer portfolios and the company portfolio in life and pensions and between the customer portfolios in life and pensions and other units in the Group are not eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Integration of business The acquisition method is used when business is acquired. The acquisition cost is measured at its fair value after taking into account any equity instruments as well as direct expenses with respect to the acquisition. Any share issue expenses are not included in the acquisition cost, but are charged to equity. Identified material and intangible assets and liabilities that have been taken over are stated at their fair value at the time of acquisition. If the acquisition cost exceeds the value of the identified assets and liabilities, the difference is recognised in the financial statements as goodwill. If the acquisition cost is less than the identified assets and liabilities, the difference is recognised in the profit and loss account at the time of the transaction. In the event of acquisitions of less than a 100 per cent of a company, 100 per cent of the extra value or shortfall in market value is recognised in statement of financial position, with the exception of goodwill of which only Storebrand’s share is recognised. annual report storebrand asa 61 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Goodwill Excess value arising from the acquisition of business activities that cannot be allocated to specific asset or liability items at the date of acquisition is classified as goodwill in the balance sheet. Goodwill is stated at its acquisition cost at the time of acquisition. Goodwill acquired by acquiring subsidiaries is classified as intangible assets. Goodwill acquired through interests in associated companies is included in the investment in the associated company and is tested for impairment as part of the value of the write-down recognised in statement of financial position. Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment. If the relevant discounted cash flow is lower than the book value, goodwill is written down to fair value. Write-downs of goodwill are never reversed, even if there is information in future periods that the impairment no longer exists or is of a lesser amount. Gains or losses on the sales of companies in the Group include the goodwill related to the company in question. Goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash flow generating units that are expected to benefit from the acquisition so that it can subsequently be tested for impairment. Cash flow generating units are identified in relation to operational segments. Intangible assets Intangible assets with limited usable lifetimes are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and any write-downs. The depreciation period and the method of depreciation are reviewed annually. New intangible assets are only capitalised if it can be demonstrated that it is likely that the Group will gain future commercial benefit that is directly applicable to the asset in question. In addition, it must be possible to estimate the cost price of the asset reliably. The value of an intangible asset is tested for impairment if there are indications of a fall in its value; otherwise intangible assets are subject to write-downs and reversals of write-downs in the same manner described for tangible fixed assets. When insurance contracts are purchased as part of the integration of an enterprise, the insurance obligations are recognised on the basis of the underlying company’s accounting policies. Extra value linked to these obligations, which is often referred to as the value of business in force (VIF), is recognised as an asset. A sufficiency test must be conducted of the insurance obligation, including VIF, pursuant to IFRS 4 every time the financial statements are presented. The test conducted looks at the calculated present values of cash flow to the contract issuer, often called embedded value. Any write-down of VIF will be reversed if the basis for the write-down no longer exists. Straight-line depreciation is applied over the following periods: • Contractual customer relationships 5-7 years • Value of business in force – VIF 20 years • IT systems 3-8 years Intangible assets with unspecified usable lifetimes are not written down, but are tested for impairment annually and at other times if there are indications of a fall in their value with a consequent need for a write-down. Investment properties Investment properties are stated at fair value. Fair value is the amount an asset could be sold for in a transaction at arm’s length between well informed, voluntary parties. Investment properties primarily consist of centrally located office buildings and shopping centres. Properties leased to tenants outside the Group are c­ lassified as investment properties. In the case of properties occupied partly by the Group for its own use and partly let out to tenants, the identifiable tenanted ­portion is treated as an investment property. See note 37 for more information about investment properties. Financial instruments General policies and definitions Recognition and derecognition Financial assets and liabilities are included in the statement of financial position from such time Storebrand becomes party to the instrument’s contractual terms and ­conditions. Normal purchases and sales of financial instruments are booked on the transaction date. When a financial asset or a financial liability is first ­recognised in the financial statements, it is stated at fair value. First time recognition includes transaction costs directly related to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset/financial liability, if it is not a financial asset/financial liability at fair value in the profit and loss account. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash flow from the financial asset expires, or when the company transfers the financial ­asset to another party in a transaction by which all, or virtually all, the risk and reward associated with ownership of the asset is transferred. Financial liabilities are derecognised in the balance sheet when they cease to exist, i.e. once the contractual liability has been fulfilled, cancelled or has expired. Definition of amortised cost Subsequent to inception, hold-to-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables as well as financial liabilities not at fair value in the profit and loss a ­ ccount, are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The calculation of the effective interest rate involves estimating all cash flows and all ­contractual terms of the financial instruments (for example early repayment, call options and equivalent options). The calculation includes all fees and m ­ argins paid or received between the parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or ­discounts. Definition of fair value Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, voluntary parties in an arm’s length ­transaction. The fair value of financial assets listed on a stock exchange or in another regulated market place in which regular trading takes place is 62 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group ­ etermined as the bid price on the last trading day up to and including the statement of financial position date, and in the case of an asset that is to be d acquired or a liability that is held, the offer price. If a market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is determined by using valuation techniques. Such valuation techniques make use of recent arm’s length market transactions between knowledgeable and independent parties where available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and options pricing models. If a valuation technique is in common use by participants in the market and this method has proved to provide reliable estimates of prices actually achieved in market transactions, this method is used. The fair value of loans, which is recognised at amortised cost, is estimated on the basis of the current market rate of interest on similar lending. Write-downs of loans are taken into account both in the amortised cost and when estimating fair value. When estimating the fair value of a loan, consideration is also given to the development of the associated credit risk in general. Impairment of financial assets In the case of financial assets that are not recognised at fair value, consideration is given on each statement of financial position date to whether there is objective evidence that the value of a financial asset or a Group of financial assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence that impairment has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s book value and the present value of estimated cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not occurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (effective interest rate calculated at the time of inception). The amount of the loss is recognised in the profit and loss account. Losses that are expected to occur as a result of future events are not included in the financial statements; regardless of how likely it is that the loss will occur. Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are classified into one of the following categories: • held-for-sale • at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with the fair value option (FVO) • hold-to-maturity investments • loans and receivables • available-for-sale Held for sale A financial asset is classified as held-for-sale if it is: • acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term, is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking, or • it is a derivative except for a derivative that is a designated as an effective hedging instrument. With the exception of derivatives, only a limited proportion of Storebrand’s financial assets fall into this category. Held-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value on the statement of financial position date. Changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss account. At fair value through profit or loss in accordance with the fair value option (FVO) A significant proportion of Storebrand’s financial instruments are classified as at fair value through profit and loss because: • such classification reduces a mismatch that would otherwise have occurred in measurement or recognition as a result of different rules for measurement of assets and liabilities, or because • the financial assets form part of a portfolio that is managed and reported on a fair value basis. The accounting treatment is equivalent to that for held-for-sale assets. Hold-to-maturity investments Hold-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the company has the intention and ability to hold-to-maturity, with the exclusion of: • assets that are designated at inception as assets at fair value in the profit and loss account, and • assets that are defined as loans and receivables. Hold-to-maturity investments are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. In 2008, all the financial instruments included in the ­hold-to-maturity category were reclassified and the residual holding was as per 31 December 2010 all included in the available-for-sale category. The ­hold-to-maturity category can again be used in Storebrand’s consolidated financial statements from 1 January 2011. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, with the e ­ xception of such assets that the company intends to sell immediately or in the short term that are classified as held-for-sale and such assets that the company ­designates at inception as assets at fair value in the profit and loss account. Loans and receivables are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Loans and receivables that are designated as hedged items are subject to measurement in accordance with the requirements of hedge accounting. annual report storebrand asa 63 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Available-for-sale Financial assets are classified as available-for-sale if they are non-derivative financial assets that are classified as available-for-sale or are not classified as a) loans and receivables, b) hold-to-maturity investments, or c) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Share lending A stock loan involves a transfer of shares from the company to a borrower in return for the borrower pledging security in the form of cash or securities. At the maturity of the stock loan, the identical securities are returned to Storebrand. The borrower is required to compensate the lender for various events ­related to the shares lent, such as distributions of subscription rights, dividends etc. The borrower is entitled to exercise the voting rights of the shares d ­ uring the period of the stock loan. Shares lent out by Storebrand are not removed from the statement of financial position, and fees earned on stock lending are recognised as income as they are received. Received cash collateral and any reinvested collateral are recognised at their gross value. Reinvested collateral is recognised at its gross value in the statement of financial position under the individual asset. Derivatives Derivatives are defined as follows: A derivative is a financial instrument or other contract within the scope of IAS 39 and which has all three of the following characteristics: • its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable (sometimes called the ‘underlying’) • it requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors • it will be settled at a future date Accounting treatment of derivatives that are not hedging Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are treated as available for sale financial instruments. The fair value of such derivatives is ­classified as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value in the profit and loss account. The major part of derivatives used routinely for asset m ­ anagement fall into this category. Accounting treatment of derivatives that are hedging Fair value hedging Storebrand uses fair value hedging, where the items hedged are financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are ­recognised at fair value over the profit and loss account (FVO). Changes in the value of the hedged item that relate to the hedged risk are applied to the ­carrying amount of the item and are recognised in the profit and loss account. Hedging of net investments Hedging of net investments in foreign businesses is recognised in the accounts in the same way as cash flow hedging. Gains and losses with respect to the hedging instrument that relates to the effective part of the hedging is recognised directly against equity, while gains and losses that relate to the ineffective part are recognised in the accounts in the profit and loss account immediately. The total loss or gain in equity is recognised in the profit and loss account when the foreign business is sold or run-off. Storebrand utilises the rules concerning the hedging of net investments with respect to the investments in the subsidiary SPP. Financial liabilities Subsequent to inception, all financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using an effective interest method or at fair value. Interest income and interest expense banking Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the profit and loss account at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest method includes set-up charges. Accounting for the insurance business The accounting standard IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts addresses the accounting treatment of insurance contracts. The Storebrand Group’s insurance c­ ontracts fall within the scope of the standard. IFRS 4 is meant to be a temporary standard and it allows the use of non-uniform principles for the treatment of ­insurance contracts in consolidated financial statements. In the consolidated accounts the technical insurance reserves in the respective subsidiaries, ­calculated on the basis of the individual countries’ particular laws, are carried forward. This also applies to insurance contracts acquired via the integration of companies. In such cases, positive excess values, cf. IFRS 4 no. 31b), are activated as intangible assets. Pursuant to IFRS 4 the technical insurance reserves must be adequate. When assessing the adequacy associated with recognised acquired insurance contracts including pertinent activated intangible assets, reference must also be made to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, and so-called embedded value calculations. The accounting policies for the most important technical insurance reserves are explained below. General life insurance Profit allocated to insurance policyholders The guaranteed yield on the premium reserve and on the premium fund, as well as the other return for customers is recognised in the profit and loss account as part of the item ‘guaranteed yield and allocation to insurance policyholders’. 64 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Premium reserve Premium reserve represents the present value of the company’s total insurance obligations including administration costs in accordance with the individual insurance contracts, after deducting the present value of future premiums. In the case of individual account policies with flexible premium payments, the total policy value is included in the premium reserve. The premium reserve is equivalent to 100 per cent of the guaranteed surrender/transfer value of insurance contracts prior to any charges for early surrender/transfer and the policies’ share of the market value adjustment reserve. The premium reserve is calculated using the same assumptions as those used to calculate premiums for individual insurance contracts, i.e. assumptions about mortality and disability rates, interest rates and costs. Premium tariffs are based on the observed level of mortality and disability in the population with the addition of security margins that take into account, inter alia, expected future developments in this respect. The premium reserve includes reserve amounts for future administration costs for all lines of insurance including settlement costs (administration reserve). In the case of paid-up policies, the present value of all future administration costs is provided in full in the premium reserve. In the case of policies with future premium payments, deduction is made for the proportion of future administration costs expected to be financed by future premium receipts. A substantial proportion of the Norwegian insurance contracts have a 1 year interest guarantee meaning that the guaranteed return must be achieved every year. Meanwhile, a substantial proportion of the Swedish insurance contracts have a guaranteed return up to the time of the pension payments. Insurance obligations special investments portfolio The insurance reserves allocated to cover obligations associated with the value of the special investments portfolio must always equal the value of the investments portfolio assigned to the contract. The proportion of profit in the risk result is included. The company is not exposed to investment risk versus customer assets since the customers are not guaranteed a minimum return. The only exception is in the event of death when the beneficiaries are paid back the amount originally paid-in for annuity insurance. Claims reserve Amounts reserved for claims either not yet reported or not yet settled (IBNR and RBNS). The reserve only covers amounts which might have been paid in the accounting year had the claim been settled. Premium income Net premium income comprises premium amounts that fall due (including savings elements) during the year, transfers of premium reserve and premiums on reinsurance ceded. Upfront pricing of guaranteed interest and the risk profit element are included in premium income. Accrual of premiums earned is made through allocations to the premium reserve in insurance reserves. Claims paid Claims for own account comprise claims settlements paid out less reinsurance received, premium reserves transferred to other companies, reinsurance ceded and changes in claims reserves. Claims not settled or paid out are provided for by allocation to the claims reserve as part of allocations to technical insurance reserves. Transfers of premium reserves, etc (transfers) Transfers of premium reserves resulting from transfers of policies between insurance companies are booked to profit and loss as premiums for own account in the case of reserves received and claims for own account in the case of reserves paid out. The recognition of cost/income takes place at the date the insured risk is transferred. The premium reserve in the insurance reserves is reduced/increased on the same date. The premium reserve transferred includes the ­policy’s share in additional statutory reserves, the market value adjustment reserve and the year’s profit. Transferred additional statutory reserves are not shown as part of premium income but are reported separately as changes in insurance reserves. Transfer amounts are classified as current receivables/­ liabilities until such time as the transfer takes place. Selling expenses Selling expenses in the Norwegian life insurance business are recognised as costs, while in the Swedish subsidiaries selling expenses are recognised in the statement of financial position and amortised. Life insurance Norway Additional statutory reserves The company is allowed to make additional statutory allocations to the insurance fund in order to ensure the solvency of its life insurance business. The ­maximum additional statutory reserve is set as the difference between the premium reserve calculated on the basis of a guaranteed return on policies ­outstanding, and the premium reserve calculated on the basis of the actual guaranteed return in the policies. The Norwegian FSA has specified a limit for the ­additional statutory reserves that apply to each policy. This is defined as the premium reserve for the policy multiplied by twice the guaranteed rate for the policy. The company is allowed to apply a higher multiple of the basic interest rate than that defined by The Norwegian FSA. The allocation to additional statutory ­reserves is a conditional allocation to policyholders that is recognised in the profit and loss account as a statutory reserve and accordingly reduces net profit. ­Additional statutory reserves can be used to meet a shortfall in the individual customer’s guaranteed return. This is shown in the profit and loss account in the item ‘to/ from additional statutory reserves’. The amount released cannot exceed the equivalent of one year’s interest rate guarantee. Premium fund, deposit reserve and pensioners’ surplus fund The premium fund contains premiums prepaid by policyholders as a result of taxation regulations for individual and group pension insurance and allocated profit share. Credits and withdrawals are not booked through the profit and loss account but are taken directly to the statement of financial position. annual report storebrand asa 65 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group The pensioners’ surplus fund contains surplus premium reserve amounts allocated in respect of pensions in payment that are part of group pension policies. The fund is applied each year as a single premium payment to secure additional benefits for pensioners. Insurance obligations special investments portfolio If a return guarantee is linked to a special investments portfolio, a supplementary provision is made to cover the guarantee obligation. The supplementary provision to cover the company’s obligation pursuant to section 11-1, fourth paragraph, of the Companies Pension Act shall equal the difference between the capitalised value of the company’s obligations vis-à-vis the insured, calculated pursuant to section 9-16 of the Insurance Act and the value of the ­investments portfolio. Market value adjustment reserve Net unrealised gains/losses for the current year on financial assets at fair value in the group portfolio in Storebrand Livsforsikring AS are allocated to/reversed from the market value adjustment reserve in the statement of financial position assuming the portfolio has a net unrealised extra value. That part of the net unrealised gains/ losses for the current year on financial current assets denominated in foreign currencies that can be attributed to movements in exchange rates are not t­ ransferred to the market value adjustment reserve. Similarly, the change in the value of the hedging instrument is not transferred to the market value a ­ djustment reserve, but is charged directly to profit and loss. The foreign exchange risk associated with investments denominated in foreign currencies is to a very large extent hedged through foreign exchange contracts on a portfolio basis. In accordance with the accounting standard for insurance contracts (IFRS 4) the market value adjustment reserve is shown as a liability. Risk equalisation fund Up to 50 per cent of the risk result for group pensions and paid up policies can be set aside in the risk equalisation fund to cover any future negative risk result. The risk equalisation fund is included as part of equity. Life insurance Sweden Life insurance reserves In 2009, SPP introduced a cash flow model for use when discounting life insurance reserves. The model employs a swap curve (monthly) for the term to maturity in those cases where it is assessed that there is sufficient liquidity in the Swedish market. A normal rate is fixed for other cash flows. This is the sum of the long-term inflation assumptions, real interest rate and risk premium. Reserves for unfixed insurance instances The reserves for claims that have been incurred consist of reserves for disability pensions, established claims, unestablished claims and claims processing reserves. When assessing the reserves for disability pensions a risk free market interest rate is used, which takes into account future index adjustment of the payments. In addition provisions are made for calculated claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). Conditional bonus The conditional bonus arises when the value of customer assets is higher than the present value of the liabilities and it thus covers that part of the i­nsurance capital that is not guaranteed. In the case of contracts where the customer assets are lower than the liabilities, the owners’ result is charged via deferred capital contribution allocations. The conditional bonus and deferred capital contribution are recognised on the same line in the statement of financial ­position. P&C insurance Insurance premiums are recognised as income in pace with the period of insurance. Costs related to claims are recognised when the claims occur. The company maintains the following reserves: Reserve for unearned premium for own account concerns ongoing policies that are in force at the time the financial statements were closed and is intended to cover the contracts’ remaining risk period. The claims reserve is a reserve for expected claims that have been notified but not settled. The reserve also covers expected claims for losses that have been incurred, but have not been reported at the expiry of the accounting period. The reserve includes the full amount of claims reported but not completed. A calculated provision is made in the reserve for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) and claims reported but not settled (RBNS). The insurance companies in the Group are subject to their own specific legal requirements for technical insurance reserves, including administration reserves, security reserves, and guarantee reserves. In Storebrand’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS, security reserves with high security margin, natural disaster fund, administration reserves, and guarantee reserves are not treated as liabilities and are thus recognised in the Group’s equity. Income recognition for asset management activities Management fees are recognised when the income is reliable and earned, fixed fees are recognised as income in line with the delivery of the service, and performance fees are recognised as income once the success criteria have been met. Pension liabilities for own employees Storebrand’s pension scheme for its own employees as per 31 December 2010 is a defined benefit pension scheme. The defined benefit scheme in Norway was closed to new employees from and including 1 January 2011, and as per 31 December 2010 employees could freely choose a defined contribution scheme. Pension costs and pension liabilities for defined benefit pension schemes are calculated using a linear accrual of entitlement to pension and expected final salary, based on assumptions for discount rate, future salary increases, pensions and benefits from the national insurance fund, the future return on pension 66 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group assets and actuarial assumptions on mortality, disability and early leavers. The discount rate is equivalent to the risk-free interest rate taking into account the average remaining period for accrual of pension entitlement. The net pension cost for the period is made up of the sum of pension entitlement accrued in the period, interest cost on the calculated pension liability and the expected return on pension assets. The effect of differences between assumptions and actual experience (experience adjustments) and changes in assumptions are recognised against total comprehensive income in the statement of recognised income, expenses and value changes in the period they arose. The effects of changes to the pension scheme are recognised in the profit and loss account as they are incurred, unless the change is conditional on future accrual of pension entitlement. In such a case, the effect is amortised linearly over the time until the entitlement is fully earned. Employer’s social security contributions are included in the pension liability and in experience adjustments shown in total comprehensive income. Storebrand has both insured and uninsured pension arrangements. The insured scheme in Norway is insured with Storebrand Livsforsikring AS (Storebrand Life Insurance), which is a company in the Storebrand Group. Premiums paid on behalf of Storebrand employees in Norway are eliminated from consolidated premium income. Tangible fixed assets The Group’s tangible fixed assets comprise of equipment, fixtures and fittings, vehicles, IT systems and properties used by the Group for its own activities. Equipment, fixtures and fittings, and vehicles are stated at acquisition cost reduced by accumulated depreciation and any write-downs. Properties used for the Group’s own activities are stated at written up value less accumulated depreciation and write-downs. The fair value of these ­properties is tested annually in the same way as described for investment properties. Increases in the value of properties used for the Group’s own a ­ ctivities are not recognised in the profit and loss account but are recognised as a change in the revaluation reserve that forms part of equity. Any write-down of the value of such a property is first applied to the revaluation reserve for increases in the value of the property in question. If the write-down exceeds the ­revaluation reserve for the property, the excess is recognised in the profit and loss account. The depreciation period and the method of depreciation are reviewed annually to ensure that the method and period used correspond with the financial ­lifetime of the asset in question. This also applies to the disposal value. Properties are split into components if different parts have different periods of ­expected commercial life. The depreciation period and method of depreciation are evaluated separately for each component. Assets are assessed for impairment if there are indications of a fall in its value. Any write-downs are recognised as the difference between the value ­recognised in the balance sheet and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the highest of fair value less deductions for selling expenses and the value in use. Whether or not any previous write-downs of non-financial assets can be reversed must be assessed on every reporting date. Tax The tax cost in the profit and loss account consists of tax payable for the accounting year and changes in deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items that are recognised directly against equity. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of ­differences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position to the extent it is considered likely that the companies in the Group will have sufficient taxable profit in the future to make use of the tax asset. Allocated dividend Pursuant to IAS 10, which deals with events after the balance sheet date, the proposed dividend/group contribution shall be classified as equity until such time as it is approved by the general meeting. 02 Profit sharing and result allocated to owners life insurance The generation of the result in a life insurance company is not easy to discern from the profit and loss account. This note provides a description of the ­content of the various elements of the generated result and an overview of the results allocated to owners and customers. The result available for profit sharing between owners and customers can be divided up into the following elements: • Administration result The administration result is the difference between the premiums paid by customers pursuant to the tariff and the company’s actual operating costs. The income consists of fees based on the size of customer assets, premium volumes or number in the form of unit price. Operating costs consist of, among other things, personnel costs, marketing, commissions and IT costs. • Risk result The risk result consists of premiums the company charges to cover insurance risks less the actual costs in the form of insurance reserves and payments for insured events such as death, pensions, disability and accidents. • Financial result The financial result consists of the net financial income from financial assets for the group portfolio less the guaranteed return. annual report storebrand asa 67 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Owners’ result generation Descriptions of the result allocated to owners in the Norwegian and Swedish business are provided below.

Administration result The administration result line includes all products apart from traditional individual products with profit sharing. Administration and management costs must be charged upfront each year, and represent the final cost for the customer. The insurance company must then meet any deficit in the administration and management result, and similarly any profit is retained by the company. Where a policy’s assets are managed in the investment choice portfolio, the premium charged for asset management must be shown as a separate element of the overall charge. Risk result The risk result from risk products is paid to the company. In the case of group defined benefit pensions and newly established guaranteed individual products the profit from insurance risk goes to customers, while any deficit in the risk result must basically be covered by the insurance company. However, up to half of any risk profit on a particular line of insurance may be held in a risk equalisation fund. A deficit due to risk elements can be covered by the risk equalisation fund. The risk equalisation fund can as a maximum amount to 150 per cent of the total risk premium. The risk equalisation fund is classified as equity. Financial result The net return on share capital is paid to the company. Share capital consists of equity and subordinated loans. Any negative returns in customer portfolios and returns lower than the interest guarantee that cannot be covered by additional statutory reserves must be covered by the company’s equity and will be included in the financial result line. The return from risk products is paid to the company and included in the financial result. Profit sharing Profit sharing is also included in the financial result line. A modified profit sharing regime was introduced for old and new individual policies that have left group pension insurance policies (paid-up policies) that allows the company to retain up to 20 per cent of the profit from returns after any allocations to ­additional statutory reserves. The modified profit sharing model means that any negative risk result can be deducted from the customers’ interest profit ­before sharing if it is not covered by the risk equalisation fund. Individual endowment insurance and pensions in the company prior to 1 January 2008 will continue to apply the profit rules that applied prior to 2008. New contracts may not be established in this portfolio. The company can retain up to 35 per cent of the total result after allocations to additional statutory reserves. Price of return guarantee and profit risk The return guarantees in group pension insurance with a return guarantee must be priced upfront. The level of the return guarantee, size of the buffer capital (additional statutory reserves and unrealised gains), and the investment risk of the portfolio in which the pensions assets are invested determines the price the customer pays for his or her return guarantee. Return guarantees are priced on the basis of the risk the equity is exposed to. Group pension c­ ustomers can choose an investment profile with a low proportion of equities, which normally results in a lower risk of losses and lower expected return. A larger proportion of equities will normally result in a higher expected return, but also a higher price for the return guarantee. Higher returns will over time reduce the customer’s pension costs. The additional statutory reserves can only be used to cover deficient returns between zero and the guaranteed return for own contract. The insurance activities act stipulates the maximum size of additional statutory reserves. The insurance company bears all the downside risk, and must carry reserves against the policy if the buffer reserves are insufficient or unavailable. 68 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Group pension customers can choose to invest their assets in a particular investment portfolio. The customers have freedom of choice in that they can choose between standardised risk profiles, or choose almost any investment option within the constraints set by the law and regulations at any given time. Customers can define their investment policies almost as if the management was taking place through a pension fund. Customers can choose long-term contracts with guarantee periods of up to 5 years. Prices for multi-year return guarantees will be lower than for an annual return guarantee over the same period. However, it is a requirement that the liabilities to the insured must at all times be covered by sufficient technical insurance reserves, and that, if necessary, equity can also be used to ensure adequate reserves during the agreement period. Greater room for agreement exists between the customer and the company in the regulations pertaining to multi-year return guarantees. For example, customers can pledge their own buffer capital as collateral for returns under the calculated interest rate applied to the insurance. Such an increase in the customer’s risk also reduces the total price of the return guarantee charged to the customer. Other result Consists of the result for subsidiaries and changes in the security and administration reserves for P&C insurance. Customers’ result generation In the case of group with investment choice and unit linked based products the customers receive the returns on the invested assets. Individual products receive 65 per cent of the total positive administration, risk and financial results. Paid-up policies receive 80 per cent of the positive financial result as well as a minimum of 50 per cent of the positive risk result (up to 50 per cent of the risk result can be allocated to the risk equalisation fund). Group defined benefit fee-based receive the positive financial result as well as a minimum of 50 per cent of the positive risk result (up to 50 per cent of the risk result can be a­ llocated to the risk equalisation fund).

Income and costs related to SPP’s consultant and service activities are also included in the administration result. Risk result The risk result is paid to the owners in full for all products Financial result In the case of insurance products with guaranteed interest, the financial result is primarily affected by three components: • profit sharing • indexing fee • changes in deferred capital contribution to cover guaranteed capital If the total return on assets in one calendar year for a premium-specific insurance (DC portfolio) exceeds the guaranteed interest, profit sharing will be ­triggered. When profit sharing is triggered, 90 per cent of the total return on assets is paid to the policyholder and 10 per cent to the company. The ­company’s proportion of the total return on assets is included in the financial result. In the case of defined benefit contracts (DB portfolio), the company is entitled to charge an indexing fee if the group profit allows the indexing of the ­insurance, up to a maximum equalling the change in the consumer price index (CPI). The indexing is based on the return between 1 October to 30 ­September. Half of the fee is charged if the pensions can be indexed by the entire change in the CPI. The entire fee can be drawn if the paid-up policies can also be indexed by the entire change in the CPI. A 100 per cent fee equals 0.8 per cent of the insurance capital. The guaranteed liability is continuously monitored. If the guaranteed liability is higher than the value of assets, an allocation must be made in the form of a deferred capital contribution. If the assets are lower than the guaranteed liability when the insurance payments start, the company supplies capital up to the guaranteed value in the form of a realised capital contribution. Changes in the deferred capital contribution are included in the financial result. The financial result also includes the result of the hedging programme, which the company uses to protect itself against effects in deferred capital contribution. The return on risk products is recognised in the financial result. annual report storebrand asa 69 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group In the case of unit linked insurance the technical insurance reserves are changed by the market return, regardless of whether it is positive or negative. This means the company has no financial result from unit linked insurance business. Other result The other result consists of the return on assets not managed at policyholders’ expense, equity and depreciation on intangible assets and interest expenses on subordinated loans. 03 Important accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated on the basis of historical experience and anticipated future events. In the future, actual experience may deviate from these accounting estimates, but the estimates are based on best judgement at the time the financial statements are produced. Changes to estimates linked to insurance reserves, financial instruments, and investment properties associated with life customers in the life business in Storebrand will not necessarily affect the owners’ result, though changes to estimates and judgements can affect the owners’ result. One key factor will be whether the life customers’ assets, including the year’s return, exceed the guaranteed liabilities. A substantial proportion of the insurance contracts in the Norwegian life insurance business include an annual interest guarantee. Changes to estimates and judgements may result in changed returns in customer portfolios. Depending on the size of any fall in value, such a fall in value could be countered, wholly or partly, by a reduction in the market value adjustment reserve and additional statutory reserves such that the effect on the result allocated to owners can be limited. There are no contracts with an annual interest guarantee in the Swedish business (SPP). However, there are insurance contracts with a final value ­guarantee. These contracts are discounted by a market interest rate. If the relevant customer assets have a higher value than the recognised values of these ­insurance-related liabilities, the difference will constitute a conditional customer allocated fund conditional bonus (buffer capital). Changes to estimates and judgements may result in changed returns in customer portfolios. Depending on the size of any fall in value, such a fall in value could be countered, wholly or partly, by a reduction in the conditional bonus such that the effect on the result allocated to owners can be limited. If the value of the individual insurance contract is higher than the relevant customer assets, the owners will have to cover the deficient capital. There are also insurance contracts without an interest guarantee in the life insurance business in which customers bear the return guarantee. Changes to estimates and judgements may result in changed returns in relevant customer portfolios. The recognition of such value changes does not directly affect the owners’ result. The profit sharing rules in life insurance are also discussed in more detail in note 2. In general the following factors will often be key in the generation of the result for customers and/or the owners: • Development of interest rate and equity markets, as well as commercial property • Composition of assets and risk management, and changes to the assets’ composition over the year • Buffer capital level for various products • Buffer capital related to the individual insurance contract • Development of life expectancy, mortality and illness • Development of costs Important estimates and assumptions that can result in material adjustments to the recognised values are discussed below. Investment properties Investment properties are stated at fair value. The commercial real estate market in Norway is not very liquid or transparent. Some uncertainty will be linked to the valuations and these require the exercising of judgement. Key elements included in valuations and which require the exercising of judgement are: • Market rent and vacancy trends • The quality and duration of rent incomes • Owners’ costs • Technical standards and any need for upgrading • Discounting interest rates for both certain and uncertain cash flow, as well as residual value External valuations are obtained throughout the year for a representative selection of the company’s properties to support its own valuations. See note 37 for further information about valuations and sensitivities linked to real estate investments. Financial instruments There will be some uncertainty associated with the pricing of financial instruments not priced in an active market. This is particularly true for the types of s­ ecurities priced on the basis of non-observable assumptions. Any changes to the assumptions could affect the recognised values. The majority of such ­financial instruments are included in the customer portfolio. Please also refer to note 9 in which the valuation of financial instruments is described in more detail. 70 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Financial instruments stated at amortised cost are assessed on the statement of financial position date to see whether or not there are objective indications that the financial asset or a group of financial assets have fallen in value. Changes in the debtors’ ability to pay, collateral/loan-to-asset value ratio and other business-related risk factors can affect the recognised write-downs. Technical insurance reserves Technical insurance reserves in life insurance are based on assumptions concerning life expectancy, mortality, disability, interest rate levels, and future costs, etc. Changes in such assumptions will affect the size of the liabilities, which in turn can affect the owners’ result. In the Norwegian life insurance business the majority of the calculated payments are discounted by the appropriate guaranteed interest rate. In the Swedish business (SPP) the insurance liabilities are largely discounted using a yield curve in which parts of the yield curve are not liquid. Any changes in the discounting rate will affect the size of the liabilities. See note 5 for further information about insurance risk. Intangible assets Goodwill and intangible assets with undefined usable lifetimes are tested for impairment annually. Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash flow generating units identified by the relevant country in which one is carrying out activities. The test’s valuation involves estimating the cash flows that arise in the relevant cash flow generating units and applying a relevant discount rate. Fixed assets and other intangible assets are assessed annually to ensure the method and period being used correspond with economic realities. The majority of the intangible assets recognised from the acquisition of SPP were linked to the existing life insurance contracts at the time of the acquisition. These recognised intangible assets are, together with the pertinent recognised insurance liabilities, tested for impairment using a sufficiency test pursuant to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. A key element of this assessment involves calculating future profit margins using embedded value calculations. Embedded value calculations are affected by, among other things, volatility in the financial markets, interest rate expectations and the amount of buffer capital in SPP. Pensions own employees The discounted current value of pension liabilities depends on the economic and demographic assumptions used in the calculation. The assumptions used must be realistic, mutually consistent and kept up to date in the sense that they should be based on uniform expectations of future economic conditions. The pension liabilities as per 31 December 2010 were calculated by actuaries. Any changes associated with the expected growth in pay and the discount rate, etc, could have a significant effect on the recognised pension obligations relating to our own employees. These pension liabilities are stated pursuant to IAS 19. 04 Risk management and internal control Storebrand’s income, both short-term and long-term, depends on external factors with which some uncertainty is associated. The most important external risk factors are the development of the capital markets and changes in life expectancy in the Norwegian and Swedish populations. Certain internal operational factors can also result in losses, e.g. errors in the management of the customers’ assets. Continuous monitoring and active risk management are therefore core areas of the Group’s activities and organisation. The subsidiaries in the Group have their own departments that continuously monitor and manage the risk in various product groups, and at the same time the Group has a separate department with responsibility for risk management across the Group. Managing operational risk forms an integral part of management responsibility in the organisation and the executive management team annually assesses risk which results in a risk summary and improvement measures. The risk assessment is presented to and considered by the Board. Compliance The compliance function is tasked with advising the board and CEO on relevant laws, rules and standards, keeping them informed about developments within these areas, and assessing the potential consequences changes to legislation may have for business. The compliance function also checks that the company has guidelines and procedures for uncovering any risk that the company is not fulfilling its obligations pursuant to the current regulations. The compliance officer in the individual company produces written reports on the company’s compliance with the regulations for the board of directors and executive management in the company. This is done on a regular basis and at least once a year. The reports shall, among other things, state whether or not preventive measures have been implemented to remedy any shortcomings. Compliance reporting is seen as being on a par with the Group companies’ internal control reporting, operation risk reporting and event reporting. Compliance officers must also brief the board of directors and executive management when the board and executive management want relevant information or this is deemed necessary by the compliance officer. Operational risk Assessments of operational risks are linked to a unit’s ability to achieve goals and implement plans. The process covers both the risk of incurring losses and failing profitability linked to, among other things, economic downturns, changed general conditions, changed customer behaviour and the risk of incurring losses due to inadequate or failing internal processes, systems, human error or external events. The Group’s CFO is responsible for the Group’s control functions for risk management and internal control. Given the importance of financial market risk in relation to the Group’s activities, a central risk management function has been established. This has been tasked with supporting the Board and Group’s annual report storebrand asa 71 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group ­ xecutive management team in drawing up a risk strategy and operationalising the setting of limits and risk monitoring across the Group’s activities. A e ­corporate control function has also been established which is tasked with administering the value-based management system, coordinating planning and budget ­processes, the management’s risk assessments and internal control reporting, as well as Board and management reporting. Internal audit Storebrand has concluded an agreement with KPMG concerning the internal audit function. The responsible partner in KPMG reports directly to the Board of Storebrand ASA, which stipulates the instructions for the internal audit and approves the audit’s annual plan. A primary contact person has been nominated for the internal audit in the Group Control department. Contact people have also been nominated in all subsidiaries who report to the CEO or head of the company’s executive management staff. The internal audit function’s audit plan includes an independent assessment of Group Control and the compliance function’s procedures and control systems. Below follows a description of the special situation concerning risk management and life insurance in relation to the relationship between customers and owners. As far as the risk associated with the business in the Group is concerned this is, apart from life insurance, risk that essentially impacts owners. ­Market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk are described in more detail in notes 6-8. Life and Pensions Norway A significant proportion of savings products in the Norwegian life insurance business incorporate a guaranteed minimum annual return. Financial risk ­principally relates to the ability to meet the customers’ guaranteed return, which for the majority of the products applies for one year at a time. Therefore, risk management in this business is designed to reduce the probability of the return falling below the annual guaranteed return for the various product groups in any single year. The composition of the financial assets is determined by the company’s investment strategy. The investment strategy establishes guidelines and limits for the company’s risk management, credit exposure, counterparty exposure, currency risk, and use of derivative instruments, and criteria regarding the liquidity in the asset portfolio. The objectives of this dynamic risk management are to maintain good risk bearing capacity and to continuously adapt the financial risk to the company’s financial strength. By exercising this type of risk management, the company expects to create good returns both for individual years and over time. Given the current investment portfolio and dynamic risk management strategy, the annual return for the majority of the portfolio will normally fluctuate between 2 per cent and 8 per cent. Smaller portions of the portfolio are invested in profiles with somewhat lower and somewhat higher market risk. Dynamic risk management and hedging transactions reduce the likelihood of a low investment return. If investment return is not sufficient to meet the guaranteed interest rate, the shortfall will be met by using risk capital built up from previous surpluses. Risk capital primarily consists of additional statutory reserves and unrealised gains. Owners are responsible for meeting any shortfall that cannot be covered from risk capital. The average interest guarantee is expected to sink in the years ahead and from 2012 all new earnings will be linked to an annual guarantee of 2.5 per cent. The share capital is invested such that it is exposed to a low level of risk. It is the insured person who bears the financial risk related to contracts in the unit linked and defined contribution pension product categories. The company’s total risk picture is monitored continuously using tools such as The Norwegian FSA’s risk based-supervision and self-developed risk goals. Life and Pensions Sweden In SPP the portfolios are divided into defined benefit pensions, defined contribution pensions and unit linked contracts, and both defined benefit pensions and defined contribution pensions have associated guaranteed returns. In portfolios with a guaranteed return, the differences in the investments’ and the insurance liabilities’ interest rate sensitivity is minimised and the short-term interest risk is therefore substantially reduced. However, financial risks are taken in order to achieve returns in excess of the guarantee, primarily via equities, credit bonds and alternative investments. The proportions of equities in the ­portfolios are dynamically adjusted based on their risk bearing capacity in order to dampen the effect of falls and at the same time participate in rises. Due to the somewhat more complex financial risk picture in SPP than in the Norwegian life insurance business, the risk to equity represented by the customer portfolio is also managed through derivative transactions in SPP’s company portfolio. The investment strategy and risk management in SPP comprises of four main pillars: • the assets’ interest rate sensitivity is continuously adjusted to the insurance liabilities • asset allocation that results in a good return over time • the continuous implementation of risk management measures in the customer portfolios through dynamic risk management • adjusted hedging in the company portfolio of parts of the financial risk the customer portfolios expose the equity to In traditional insurance with an interest guarantee, SPP bears the risk of a return equal to the guaranteed interest being achieved on the policyholders’ ­assets and that the magnitude of the contracts’ assets are greater than the present value of the insurance liabilities. Profit sharing becomes relevant in SPP if the total return exceeds the guaranteed yield. In the case of some products a certain degree of consolidation, i.e. the assets are greater than the present value of the liabilities by a certain percentage, is required in order for owners to collect earnings. If the assets in an insurance contract in the company are smaller than the market value of the liability, an equity contribution is allocated that reflects this deficit. This is called the deferred capital contribution (DCC) and changes in its size are recognised in the profit and loss account immediately. The contracts’ buffer capital must be intact in order for profit s­ haring to ­represent a net income for owners. When the contracts’ assets exceed the present value of the obligations, a buffer called the conditional bonus is ­established. Changes in this customer buffer are not recognised in the profit and loss account immediately. It is the policyholder who bears the financial risk in unit linked insurance contracts. Various risk goals are used to monitor and manage the risk in the company, including its own Value at Risk goal and the Swedish Financial Supervisory ­Authority’s traffic light model. In order to ensure that insurance companies have adequate capital to meet their insurance obligations, Finansinspektionen (Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) requires that the sector stress test all of its insurance business using the so-called traffic light calculations. The ­elements tested are the premium income side and the insurance liabilities. In 2007, it was announced that companies would also be required to stress 72 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group changes with respect to insurance liabilities in risk policies. This also applies to so-called cancellation risk, which is the risk that a policyholder will terminate the policy and thus stop paying premiums. The level of stress testing generally follows the guidelines issued by CEIOPS (Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors) and their work on Solvency II. 05 Insurance risk Insurance is about protecting oneself against financial loss when events occur. These could be anything from damage to a car or theft in P&C insurance to disability, death or long life in life insurance. Simply put, insurance involves a sharing of risk between many policyholders in which the risk reflects the probability and consequences. Life insurance Products: Life, pension and unit linked insurance contracts are offered as both group and individual contracts. Group contracts: • Group defined benefit pensions are guaranteed pension payments from a specified age for as long as the insured person lives. Alternatively it can be agreed that the pension will end at a specified age. The product is offered in both the private and the public sectors. The cover includes retirement, ­disability and survivor pensions. • Group defined contribution pensions are group defined contribution pensions the premium is stated as a percentage of pay, while the payments are ­unknown. The customer bears all the financial risk during the saving period. • Group one-year risk cover are guaranteed payments upon death or disability, and a waiver of premiums in the event of disability. • Paid-up policies (defined benefit) and pension capital policy (defined contribution) are contracts with earned rights that are issued upon withdrawal from or the termination of pension contracts. • Group life are one-time payments upon death or disability. Individual contracts: • Individual allocated annuity or pension insurance are guaranteed payments for as long as the insured person lives. Alternatively it can be agreed that the pension will end at a specified age. • Individual endowment insurance are single payments in the event of attaining a specified age, death or disability. • Individual unit linked insurance are endowment insurance or allocated annuity in which the customer bears the financial risk. Risk areas: Life insurance is the dominant area within insurance for Storebrand and covers the following three risk areas: • Death – payment to the policyholder’s surviving relatives. • Long life – payments when a specified age is attained and until a specified age or for the rest of the person’s life. • Disability – payment in the event of illness or occupational disability. annual report storebrand asa 73 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Mortality risk Long life risk Disability risk Current situation Decreasing mortality.

With reference to the table above, it is the risk linked to “Long life” that is the most challenging. Problems associated with long life • Age and gender are not sufficient as explanatory variables, since other factors such as education, pay, civil status and place of residence also affect ­mortality. • Mortality is falling faster than expected. • Medical “quantum leaps” that mean that people will live significantly longer than today. Risk premiums and tariffs Life and Pensions Norway Tariffs for group life insurance and certain risk insurances within group pensions also depend on industry/occupation in addition to age and gender. Group life insurance also applies tariffs based on claims experience. For individual insurance, the premiums for life and long life cover are based on tariffs produced by insurance companies on the basis of their shared ­experience: namely T1984 for endowment insurance and R1963 for pensions insurance. Disability premiums are based on the company’s own experience, and were last amended in 2002. The company’s standard tariff for group life insurance, both for life and disability cover, is based on the company’s own experience and was last amended in 2003. In the case of group pension insurance the premiums for traditional retirement and survivor cover follow the new industry tariff K2005 with security margins that take into account the reduction in mortality among policyholders observed in recent years. Premiums for disability pensions are based on the company’s own experience. Expense premiums are determined annually with a view to securing full cover for the next year’s expected costs. The company’s tariffs do not involve any assumptions about inflation or voluntary termination/transfers. Death and disability Net annual risk premium for a sum insured of NOK 100,000 For disability pensions, the premium for an annual disability pension of NOK 10,000 paid until the person turns 67 years old. 74 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Men Women 30 years 45 years 60 years 30 years 45 years 60 years Risk of death, individual endowment insurance 122 324 1,416 61 162 711 Lump sum disability, individual 273 590 352 1,367 Disability pension, individual 248 639 1,975 371 1,577 2,490 Critical illness, non-smoker, individual 171 515 1,804 171 515 1,804 Risk of death, group life insurance 55 146 821 33 88 493 Risk of death, group pension insurance 48 146 743 23 77 403 Disability pension, group pension 511 734 642 1,029 1,386 878 Life and Pensions Sweden The risk premium for group contracts is an equalised premium, based on the group’s age and gender composition. Individual contracts ideally have individual risk premiums based on age and gender. SPP’s tariffs contain no assumptions about inflation or transfer as is true for Storebrand Life Norway. Life expectancy in Sweden is increasing sequentially (mortality is sinking). This is positive for life cover. On the other hand it may become a financial burden in the case of pension insurance (accident cover). The Swedish Insurance Research Council (FTN), which is a sector organisation, conducted an analysis of ­mortality in 2006 that makes it possible to look at mortality forecasts that take account of changes in the level of change trends. Such a forecast is crucial when it comes to setting prices for both life cover and pension insurance. Insurance products are usually designed in such a way that the premium c­ alculation for the entire period of cover is based on mortality/life expectancy at the time the policy issued. The future is unpredictable as far as disability insurance is concerned. Changes in new incidences of disability are taking place much faster than changes in mortality/life expectancy. One of the reasons for this is the problems involved with determining the causes of and the degree of disability on the ground. The quickly increasing level of disability in the first few years of 2000 resulted in premium increases within the sector. Many insurance companies were d ­ oubtful about offering voluntary disability cover in the future. However, since 2005 the number of disability incidences has fallen in a more balanced trend that resulted in SPP reducing the risk premiums for disability cover. Nonetheless, disability has been significantly lower than assumed in the tariff, which resulted in a strongly positive risk result for 2009. The majority of SPP risk policies are annual. In other words, the company can change the premium every year. Errors in the estimate of the premium for life and disability cover can therefore be corrected, which has a rapid effect on the company’s risk result. Risk management • Evaluation of insurance risk (underwriting) When writing individual risk cover, the customer is subject to a health check. The result of the health check is reflected in the level of premium quoted. When arranging group policies with risk cover, all employees of small companies are subject to a health check, while for companies with many employees Storebrand requires declarations of fitness for work. Underwriting also takes into account the company’s industrial category, sector and sickness record. • Control and monitoring of insurance risk Insurance risk is separately monitored for every line of insurance in the current insurance portfolio. The risk result for each product group is broken down into the elements of mortality, long life and disability risks. The development of risk result is followed throughout the year. For each type of risk, the ­ordinary risk result for a period represents the difference between the risk premiums the company has collected for the period and the sum of provisions and payments that must be made for insured events that occur in the period. The risk result takes into account insured events that have not yet been reported but which the company, on the basis of its experience, assumes have occurred. • Reinsurance The company also manages its insurance risk through a variety of reinsurance programs. Through catastrophe reinsurance (excess of loss) the company covers losses (single claims and reserves provision) where a single event causes more than 3 deaths or disability. This cover is also subject to an upper limit. Surplus reinsurance on life policies covers death and disability risk that exceeds the maximum risk amount for own account the company utilises. The company’s maximum risk amount for own account is relatively high, and the risk reassured is therefore relatively modest. In 2010, the company will replace the current surplus agreement with internal insurance cover of the risk such that only those risks that might exceed the company’s actual maximum risk amounts for own account will be reinsured. • Pooling The company also manages its insurance risk through international pooling. This means that multinational corporate customers can equalise the results between the various units internationally. The pooling applies to group life and risk cover within group defined benefit and defined contribution pensions. annual report storebrand asa 75 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group • Traffic light (SPP only) In order to ensure that insurance companies have adequate capital to meet their insurance obligations, Finansinspektionen (Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) requires the sector to stress test all of its insurance business using so-called traffic light calculations. The elements tested are the premium income side and the insurance liabilities. In 2007, it was announced that companies would also be required to stress changes with respect to insurance liabilities in risk policies. This also applies to so-called cancellation risk, which is the risk that a policyholder will terminate the policy and thus stop paying premiums. The level of stress testing generally follows the guidelines issued by CEIOPS (Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors) and their work on Solvency II. A 20 per cent fall in mortality results in an annual risk result for SPP that is approximately SEK 124 million lower. If the probability of reactivation in the event of disability sinks by 20 per cent, this would entail an annual risk result that was approximately. SEK 46 million lower. SPP’s cancellation risk is very small since the majority of the policy portfolio cannot be repurchased. The insurance risk constitutes a significant proportion of the total capital requirement that results from the stress test. In total the stress test affects the risk result in the amount of SEK 170 million. With an expected risk result of around SEK 346 million, this means that the majority of the risk result will disappear if the basis for the stress test should become a reality. The stress tests are based on a 1:200 scenario, or a confidence level of 99.5 per cent. Risk result The tables below specify the risk result in the various risk areas and also state the effect of reinsurance and pooling on the result.

IFRS permits two alternative methods for the sufficiency test. Where a company has an established form of analysis that ­demonstrate the margins in the various constituent elements, Section 16 of the standard allows this analysis to continue to be used to demonstrate that the test is satisfied. If such routines have not been established, the company is required to discount future cash flows in accordance with IAS 37. In 2010, Storebrand continued its prior practice and conducted the test pursuant to Section 16. The required analysis is carried out on the basis of Norwegian principles for premium reserves and applies conservative calculation elements. The established form of analysis is based on the assumptions used for the calculation of embedded value in which the company uses the best estimates for the future base elements based on current experience. The sufficiency test is carried out by the company analysing the current margins between the assumptions used for setting reserves and the assumptions in the embedded value analysis. Based on the mortality surveys conducted using lower mortality assumptions for the future, a need to build up reserves for individual pension insurance has generally been identified in this line. As per 31 December 2010 there was a need to build up reserves in Storebrand Life Norway by about NOK 520 ­million, which is expected to be allocated linearly. The plan is to build up the reserve by 31 December 2012 and this is primarily expected to be covered by the ­financial result. Storebrand satisfies the sufficiency test for 2010 and consequently has no effect on the result in the financial statements for 2010. 76 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group In the case of Storebrand Holding AB and Storebrand Life Group the test is conducted pursuant to “IFRS 4 Basic for conclusions (BC 94 – 104)” and “IFRS 4 Basic for conclusions (BC no. 151)”, which represent the preliminary work on the standard. The test is satisfied if the obligations booked in the financial statements are greater or equal to the net obligations stated at market value. Here net obligations will mean the technical insurance obligations of Storebrand Holding AB and Storebrand Life Group stated at market value less the present value of the owners’ share of the profit for these insurance contracts. The preliminary work mentions that one can use embedded value-like techniques. As per 31 December 2010, the calculated market value of the insurance contracts for SPP and Euroben is lower than the book value. This means that the buffers in the net obligation and the test are satisfied. Therefore the test has no effects on the result in the annual financial statements for 2010. Transfer right A transfer right exists that involves transferring insurance liabilities linked to group and individual pension insurance contracts to or from other insurance ­companies. The settlement deadline is two months for contracts where the transfer value exceeds NOK 300 million. The transfer right can constitute a ­liquidity risk. Guaranteed rate (discounting rate) Life and Pensions Norway The Norwegian FSA sets the highest basic interest rate permitted for new policies and for new members/new accrual of benefits in group pension insurance. The highest basic interest rate for new policies was set at 3 per cent in 1993 and subsequently reduced in 2005 to 2.75 per cent for policies entered into after 1 January 2006. The highest basic interest rate for new members/new accrual of benefits in group pension insurance was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent with effect from renewals in 2004. The guaranteed rate has been set at 2.5 per cent for new contracts from 1 January 2011. The guaranteed rate is used both as the guaranteed interest and for discounting future payments. The following table shows the proportions of insurance fund reserves at 31 December 2010 relating to policies with various basic annual interest rates: Interest rate guarantee 2010 2009 6% 0.3% 0.3% 5% 0.5% 0.6% 4% 54.2% 56.4% 3.4% 4.1% 4.4% 3% 35.5% 32.8% 2.75% 1.7% 1.8% 0% 3.7% 3.7% The above table includes the premium reserve, deposit reserve and pensioners’ surplus reserve with 3 per cent and additional statutory reserves with 0 per cent. The total average guaranteed interest rate for all lines of insurance comprised 3.46 per cent in 2010. The guaranteed interest rate must be delivered on an annual basis. If the company’s investment return in a year is lower than the guaranteed interest rate, current legislation permits the equivalent of up to one year’s guaranteed return for the individual policy to be covered by transfers from the policy’s additional statutory reserves. Average interest rate guarantee 2010 2009 Individual endowment insurance 3.3% 3.3% Individual pension insurance 3.7% 3.7% Group pension insurance 3.5% 3.5% Group life insurance 0.3% 0.4% Total 3.46% 3.52% New business written in 2010 is subject to a 2.75 per cent basic interest rate. In the case of policies transferred to the company, the basic interest rate is determined by the rate applied to the policy by the insurance company from which the business is transferred, subject to a maximum of 4 per cent. Premiums and reserves for pension entitlements earned in 2010 in group pension insurance are calculated on the basis of a 3 per cent guaranteed rate for contracts established before 1 January 2006. New insurance contracts established after this date will be calculated at a guaranteed rate of 2.75 per cent. Life and Pensions Sweden The table below shows the proportions of insurance liabilities as per 31 December 2010 with the following different final value guarantees: Interest rate guarantee 2010 2009 3.0% (DB) 43% 43% 1.25 2.5% (P250) 14% 12% 2.75 4.0% (P300) 22% 22% 4.5 5.2% (P520) 20% 23% annual report storebrand asa 77 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group P&C insurance The Group offers the following products: • Motor vehicle • Leisure boats • Combined products • Travel • Accident • Occupational hazard offered via Storebrand P&C Insurance and Storebrand Life Insurance • Critical illness and cancer insurance • Child insurance • Health insurance The risk in the P&C business is mostly due to the fact that it has a small portfolio with which to absorb claims. This can mean that single large claims or special events may have a disproportionate impact on profit. The largest claims will typically arise from third party insurance for motor vehicles and home and contents fire insurance. In order to offset this risk, Storebrand has covered itself with excess of loss reinsurance with a deductible of NOK 5 million per claim after the first claim which has a deductible of NOK 10 million. The cover has unlimited capacity in the case of motor vehicles. The cover has a capacity of NOK 35 million for other sectors. In addition, the risk exposure arising from travel insurance may increase sharply in the event of possible catastrophes such as the tsunami in South East Asia in 2004. Personal insurance such as travel, accident and occupational hazard insurance is therefore now also included in the Group’s catastrophe reinsurance. The risk within occupational hazard insurance is also covered by quota reinsurance and excess of loss protection, with a deductible of NOK 5 million. In the case of health insurance the company has excess of loss protection for of 80 per cent of all claims payments per person per year that exceed NOK 300,000. This means that the level of insurance risk for health insurance for own account is very low. Storebrand’s earlier P&C portfolio was transferred to If in 2000. However, Storebrand has retained fronting responsibility with respect to the customers, since the customers were not informed of the transfer of the risk from Storebrand to If. This fronting liability has now essentially been run-off and the only fronting liability that remains is for marine and energy cover, which is now placed in Gard. The total reserves for this portfolio now amount to only NOK 8.3 million. Storebrand has no commercial responsibility for the business transferred unless Gard becomes insolvent. This risk is therefore limited to a credit exposure to Gard. Gard has a Standard & Poor’s rating of ’A’, which suggests that this represents a very limited risk exposure for Storebrand. Risk exposure and insurance risk for the residual portfolio from Oslo Reinsurance Company (Oslo Re) The company’s commercial operations have concentrated on the run-off of its existing reinsurance portfolios, either by paying claims that are reported or by seeking to extricate itself from residual liability in policies by negotiating a settlement amount with the insured party (cedent). The principal source of insurance risk in the residual portfolio from Oslo Re lies in the risk of increasing liability-related sectors. The company has for some considerable time minimised this risk by entering into commutation agreements with insured parties/cedents, and this has resulted in a significant reduction in exposure to this type of claim. A “scheme of arrangements” was also implemented in 2008 and 2010 which has significantly reduced future insurance risk for the company. An agreement concerning the sale of Oslo Re UK Ltd has been signed. This means all the risk linked to Oslo Re UK Ltd will finally be run-off by 30 June 2011. Oslo Reinsurance Company was merged with Storebrand Skadeforsikring AS with accounting effect from 1 January 2010. Actual claims experience compared with earlier forecasts Storebrand Skadeforsikring AS’ active portfolio experienced a small run-off loss of NOK 1 million for previous years in 2010. In 2010, Storebrand ­Helseforsikring AS achieved a larger run-off gain from previous years amounting to NOK 11 million. This was primarily due to a change in reserve methods. The old method was a simplified method approved by The Norwegian FSA upon the company’s start-up in 1998. The new method uses statistical methods such as Bornhuetter-Ferguson to estimate claims reserves and provides a much more correct picture of claims liabilities. 06 Market risk Market risk is the risk of incurring losses on open positions in financial instruments due to changes in market variables and/or market conditions within a specified time horizon. Therefore, market risk is the risk of price changes in the financial markets, i.e. the interest rate, currency, equity, property or ­commodity markets, affecting the value of the company’s financial instruments. Storebrand continuously monitors market risk using a range of e ­ valuation methods. The potential for losses in the investment portfolio on a one-year horizon is calculated and the portfolios are stress tested pursuant to the ­statutorily defined stress tests and internal models. Life and Pensions Norway The largest contributions to short-term, result-related market risk for the Norwegian life insurance business are falls in the value of equities and real estate, increased risk for credit bonds and rapid increases in interest rates. In the longer term, low market interest rates over time are a significant market risk for the company. The current formulation of the regulations means that technical insurance reserves in Storebrand Life Insurance are not affected by changes in market interest rates. 78 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Life and Pensions Sweden SPP is largely exposed to the same market risk factors as Storebrand Life Insurance, but differences in product design, general conditions and asset a ­ llocation nonetheless result in some differences in the contributions for different types of market risk. In the short-term the market risk from equities is relatively greater in SPP than in Storebrand Life Insurance, but at the same time the company is exposed to little risk from the asset class real estate. SPP is also ­exposed to market risk from increased risk on credit bonds. However, as far as the result is concerned, the short-term risk from changes in interest rates is small in SPP because of the adjustment of the assets’ interest rate sensitivity (duration) in relation to the liabilities’ interest rate sensitivity. However, the current regulatory requirements mean the company cannot have low interest rate sensitivity in the profit and loss account and in the solvency account at the same time, and falling interest rates will have a negative effect on the solvency ratio. Lasting low interest rates also represent a substantial risk for SPP as well, both for the financial result and the solvency margin percentage. Bank activities Storebrand Bank manages its interest rate risk through interest rate swap agreements to minimise the effect of a change in interest rates on its deposits and lending. Market risk represents a minor part of the bank activities’ total risk. Other subsidiaries The other subsidiaries in the Group are not particularly exposed to market risk. Sensitivity analyses The assets and liabilities side (borrowing and insurance liabilities in Sweden) have been stress tested in order to show how much this can affect the o ­ wners’ result in relation to the expectations for 2011. An estimated normalised return is included in estimated effects throughout the year based on uncertain assumptions about future returns and other uncertain factors and uncertain assumptions. The stress tests were applied to the investment portfolio on 31 December 2010 and the outcome shows the estimated effect on profits for the year as a whole. The stresses that have been applied are equities +/20 per cent, interest +/-150 basis points and real estate +/12 per cent. With respect to currency risks, the investment portfolios are essentially fully currency hedged, and changes in exchanges rates will have little effect on the companies’ expected results for 2011. For changes in market risk that arise during the course of 1 year, the effect on the result and equity will be as presented below, based on the balance sheet as per 31.12. Change in market value NOK million 2010 2009 Equities -20% -9,300 -7,405 Equities +20% 9,299 7,405 Interest rate -1.5% 8,157 8,330 Interest rate +1.5% -6,935 -7,037 Real estate -12% -3,667 -3,440 Real estate +12% 3,667 3,440 Effects on result/equity NOK million 2010 2009 Equities -20% -855 -922 Equities +20% 527 335 Interest rate -1.5% 39 -77 Interest rate +1.5% -168 -132 Real estate -12% -430 -497 Real estate +12% 610 331 This note applies to: Storebrand Livsforsikring AS, SPP, BenCo, Storebrand Bank, Storebrand P&C Insurance and Storebrand Health Insurance and Storebrand ASA. Life and Pensions Since it is market changes that are shown in the note above, dynamic risk management will not affect the outcome. If it is assumed that the market changes will occur over a period of time, then dynamic risk management would reduce the effect of the negative outcomes and reinforce the positive. Life and Pensions Norway The stress tests have been done for all investment profiles and the effects of each stress test reduce or increase the expected return for each profile. For the negative stress tests (equities down, interest up and property down) the return in some individual profiles fall under the guarantee. The buffer situation for each contract will then determine how much equity the company will possibly have to use if the return stays at this level for 2011. Beyond the need for ­utilising equity to cover returns below the guarantee, it is changes in the profit sharing for paid-up policies and individual contracts, as well as returns and interest expenses in the company portfolio that deviate from the expected result for 2011 to the greatest extent. Compared with equivalent sensitivity a year ago, the effect of the stress tests has decreased. The most important contributions to the reduction are the fact that the difference between the expected return and the interest guarantee has increased and that additional statutory reserves have been further strengthened at the same time as the company has at the beginning of 2011 a substantial market value adjustment reserve, which serves as a very effective buffer against such stresses on assets. annual report storebrand asa 79 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group The stress tests were applied individually. If several of the negative stress tests were to occur simultaneously, the negative effect would be greater than ­simply the sum of the two individual effects alone (a larger proportion of gross stresses would be retained by owners). In addition to the negative result ­effect for owners, the expected building up of buffer capital will, to a substantial degree, fall away in the negative stress tests. In the case of the p ­ ositive stress tests, greater building up of buffer capital is also assumed in addition to the positive result effects for owners in the form of the market value ­adjustment reserve and additional statutory reserves. Life and Pensions Sweden The note that shows the effect on the result/equity shows the effect of the financial result excluding profit sharing. All changes in market value do not affect the financial result. The part of a change in market value that affects the result is the part that cannot be offset against conditional bonuses. Bank activities The table includes the accounting effect over a 12 month period of an immediate parallel change in interest rates of +1.5 percentage points and -1.5 ­percentage points respectively. Account is taken of the one-time effect such an immediate interest rate change has on the items recognised at fair value and hedging value, and on the effects the interest rate change has on the result for the remainder of the interest rate duration period before the interest rate change has income and costs-related effect. Items affected by one-time effects and which are recognised at fair value are the investment portfolio, fixed rate lending, borrowing via the government swap scheme, deposits with equity returns, and derivatives. The item affected by one-time effects and which is subject to hedge accounting is fixed rate borrowing. 07 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its payment obligations when they fall due, or that the company will not be able to sell securities at acceptable prices. Storebrand Life Insurance’s and SPP’s insurance liabilities are long-term and are usually known long before they fall due, but a solid liquidity buffer is still important for withstanding unforeseen events. Separate liquidity strategies have been drawn up for several of the subsidiaries in line with statutory requirements. These strategies specify limits and ­measures for ensuring good liquidity and a minimum allocation to assets that can be sold at short notice. The strategies define limits for allocations to ­various types of asset and mean the companies have money market investments, bonds, equities and other liquid investments that can be sold when needed. Liquidity risk is one of the most important risk factors in bank activities. The company’s risk strategy establishes general limits for how much liquidity risk the Bank Group is willing to accept. A policy has been drawn up that specifies principles for liquidity management and stress testing, minimum liquidity reserves and financing indicators for measuring liquidity risk. In addition to this an annual funding strategy and funding plan are drawn up that set out the overall limits for the bank’s funding activities. In addition to clear strategies and the risk management of liquidity reserves in each subsidiary, the Group’s holding company has established a liquidity buffer. The development of the liquidity reserves is monitored continuously at an overall level in relation to internal limits. Committed credit lines from banks have also been established that the companies can draw on if necessary. During the financial crisis in 2008, the lack of liquidity was a problem for a number of financial companies, although liquidity has now returned to a ­normalised level. The agreed remaining term provides limited information about the company‘s liquidity risk since the vast majority of investment assets can be realised more quickly in the secondary market than the agreed remaining term.

Maximum limits for credit exposure to individual debtors and for overall credit exposure to rating categories are set by the boards of the individual companies in the Group. Particular attention is paid to ensuring diversification of credit exposure to avoid concentrating credit exposure on any particular debtors or sectors. Changes in the credit standing of debtors are monitored and followed up. Storebrand Life Insurance and SPP use published credit ratings wherever possible, supplemented by the company’s own credit evaluation where there are no published ratings. The Group has framework agreements with counterparties to reduce their risk with respect to outstanding derivative transactions. These regulate how collateral against changes in market values, calculated on a daily basis, should be pledged. Credit risk and liquidity risk are the two most important forms of risk for bank activities. The bank’s risk strategy establishes overall limits for how much credit risk the bank group is willing to accept. The willingness to accept risk is adjusted to the bank’s risk appetite and target risk profile, solvency, profitability, liquidity and growth, as well as the bank’s strategy otherwise, including equity requirement for credit activities. Credit policies establish general principles for granting credit. The bank group’s routines for credit management are set forth in special credit handbooks. The most important control of credit risk is carried out and administered by the Credit Control unit.

These loans are for income generating real estate within the sale and operation of real estate. The division into customer groups is based upon Statistics Norway’s standard for sector and business groupings. The placement of the individual customer is determined by the customer’s primary enterprise. Credit exposure in lending Corporate: Lending to the corporate market is slightly above NOK 15 billion. There is also around NOK 2,400 million in unused credit facilities and about NOK 300 million in guarantees. About 80 per cent of the loans are for income generating real estate. Just under 20 per cent are for building projects. Less than 5 per cent of the corporate market’s portfolio is secured by collateral other than real estate. The portfolio’s collateral is principally investment/commercial properties. In the case of loans in the corporate market with arrears, the loan-to-collateral value ratio is lower than 80 per cent in just under 80 per cent in the lending volume. Most of the non-performing loans have a loan-to-collateral value ratio of under 100 per cent. Private: The loans in the retail market are essentially secured by residential property mortgages. There is about NOK 22 billion in lending to housing commitments with a further around NOK 2 billion in unused credit facilities. The total commitment in housing commitments is thus around NOK 24 billion. Retail customers are evaluated according to their ability and willingness to repay the loan. In addition to debt service capacity, the customers are checked in connection with policy rules and they are given scores in a scoring model. Retail customers are subject to the overall limits for loan-to-collateral value ratio and ability to pay (as defined by the bank’s credit policy for the segment) that apply to this portfolio. The portfolio’s collateral is principally housing in the retail portfolio. The average weighted loan-to-collateral value ratio in the bank group is around 54 per cent for residential mortgages: around 90 per cent of residential ­mortgages are within an 80 per cent loan-to-collateral value ratio and around 95 per cent are within a 90 per cent loan-to-collateral value ratio. Around 56 per cent of the mortgages are within a 60 per cent loan-to-collateral value ratio in the bank group. The portfolio’s credit risk is regarded as low. annual report storebrand asa 83 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Total committed amounts by remaining term 2010 2009 Lending Lending to and to and receivareceivables from Unused Total bles from Unused Total custoGuarancredit commitcustoGuarancredit commitNOK million mers tees line ments mers tees line ments Past due 1 30 days 600 5 605 2,155 21 2,177 Past due 31 60 days 165 1 2 168 139 1 139 Past due 61 90 days 21 21 29 30 Past due > 90 days 258 4 262 308 2 309 Total 1,045 1 10 1,056 2,631 24 2,654 Commitments are regarded as non-performing and loss exposed when a credit facility has been overdrawn for more than 90 days and hen a repayment loan has arrears older than 90 days and the amount is at least NOK 500.

Fund units are generally stated at the updated official NAV prices where these exist. As a general rule, bonds are valued on the basis of prices from Reuters and Bloomberg. Bonds that are not quoted regularly will normally be valued on the basis of recognised theoretical models. The latter is particularly true for bonds denominated in NOK. These sorts of valuations are based on discount rates consisting of swap interest rates plus a credit premium. The credit premium will often be issuer specific and normally based on a consensus of credit spreads quoted by a selected brokerage house. Unlisted derivatives, including primarily interest rate and currency instruments, are also valued theoretically. The money market rates, swap rates, exchange rates, and volatilities that provide the basis for valuations are obtained from Reuters, and Bloomberg. The company continuously performs checks to ensure the quality of the market data obtained from external sources. Generally such checks involve comparing multiple sources and checking and assessing the reasonableness of abnormal changes. 84 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group The Group categorises financial instruments valued at fair value on three different levels, which are described in more detail below. The levels express the ­ iffering degree of liquidity and different measuring methods. d Level 1: Financial instruments valued on the basis of quoted priced for identical assets in active markets This category encompasses listed equities that over the previous six months have experienced a daily average turnover equivalent to approximately NOK 20 million or more. Based on this, the equities are regarded as sufficiently liquid to be encompassed by this level. Bonds, certificates or equivalent i­nstruments issued by national governments are generally classified as level 1. In the case of derivatives, standardised equity-linked and interest rate futures will be ­encompassed by this level. Level 2: Financial instruments valued on the basis of observable market information not covered by level 1 This category encompasses financial instruments that are valued on the basis of market information that can be directly observable or indirectly o ­ bservable. Market information that is indirectly observable means that prices can be derived from observable, related markets. Level 2 encompasses equities or ­equivalent equity instruments for which market prices are available, but where the turnover volume is too limited to meet the criteria in level 1. Equities on this level will normally have been traded during the last month. Bonds and equivalent instruments are generally classified as level 2. Interest rate and currency swaps, non-standardised interest rate and currency derivatives, and credit default swaps are also classified as level 2. Funds are generally classified as level 2, and encompass equity, interest rate, and hedge funds. Level 3: Financial instruments valued on the basis of information that is not observable pursuant to by level 2 Equities classified as level 3 encompass investments in primarily unlisted/private companies. These include investments in forestry, real estate and ­infrastructure. Private equity is generally classified as level 3 through direct investments or investments in funds. Asset backed securities (ABS), residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) are classified as level 3 due to their generally limited liquidity and transparency in the market. The types of mutual funds classified as level 3 are discussed in more detail below with a reference to the type of mutual fund and the valuation method. Storebrand is of the opinion that the valuation method used represents a best estimate of the mutual fund’s market value. Unlisted equities/forestry Comprehensive external valuations were carried out as per 31 December 2010 and these provide a basis for the valuation of the company’s investments. The external valuations were based on models that included non-observable assumptions. Besides the external valuations that had been conducted as per 31 December 2010, the equity investments were stated on the basis of value adjusted equity reported by external sources. Private Equity The majority of Storebrand’s private equity investments are investments in private equity funds. It also has a number of direct investments. The investments in private equity funds are stated on the basis of the values reported by the funds. The private equity funds Storebrand has invested in value their own investments in accordance with pricing guidelines stipulated by, among others, EVCA (European Private Equity Venture Capital Association) in the “International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines” (September 2009 edition) or pursuant to FASB 157. Most of the private equity funds report on a quarterly basis, while a few report less often. In those cases where Storebrand has not received an updated valuation with respect to an i­nvestment from a fund by the time the annual financial statements are closed, the last valuation received is used and adjusted for cash flows and any ­significant market effects during the period from the last valuation up to the reporting date. These market effects are estimated on the basis of the type of valuations made of the companies in the underlying funds; the financial performance of relevant indexes, adjusted for estimated correlation between the relevant company and the relevant index. In the case of direct private equity investments, the valuation is based on either recently conducted transactions or a model in which a company that is in continuous operation is assessed by comparing the key figures with equivalent listed companies or groups of equivalent listed companies. In some cases the value is reduced by a liquidity discount, which can vary from investment to investment. Companies that are in a start up phase, have undergone previous expansions, or which are undergoing structural changes for some other reasons that make them harder to price in relation to a reference group will be stated at the lowest of costs and estimated value, where the estimated value is apparent from a variance analysis vis-à-vis its plans. In the case of investments in which Storebrand participates as a co-investor together with a leading investor that conducts a valuation, and no recent ­transactions exist, this value will be used by Storebrand after being quality assured. In the case of investments for which Storebrand has not received an ­up-to-date valuation as per 31 December from a leading investor by the time the annual financial statements are closed, the previous valuation is used and adjusted for any market effects during the period from the last valuation up to the reporting date. In those cases where no valuation is available from a ­leading investor in the syndicate, a separate valuation will be made, as described above. Asset backed securities This category primarily encompasses asset backed securities (ABS), residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS). These are primarily valued on the basis of quoted prices from brokers or valuations obtained from international banks. The number of brokers who quote prices is very limited and the volume of transactions in the market relatively low. annual report storebrand asa 85 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Indirect real estate investments Indirect real estate investments are primarily investments in funds with underlying real estate investments. No units in funds that confirm the market price of the units have been traded recently. Real estate funds are valued on the basis of information received from the individual fund manager. Most managers report on a quarterly basis and the commonest method used by the individual fund managers is an external quarterly valuation of the fund’s assets. This involves the manager calculating a net asset value (NAV). Funds often report NAV with a quarter’s delay in relation to the preparation of ­Storebrand’s financial statements. In order to take account of the changes in value in the last quarter, internal estimates are made of the changes in value based on developments in the market and by conferring with the respective managers. Sensitivity assessments Forestry investments are characterised by, among other things, very long cash flow periods. There can be some uncertainty associated with future cash flows due to future income and costs growth, even though these assumptions are based on recognised sources. Nonetheless, valuations of forestry investments will be particularly sensitive to the discounting rate used in the estimate. The company bases its valuation on external valuations. These utilise an estimated market-related required rate of return. As a reasonable alternative assumption to the required rate of return used, a change in the discounting rate of 0.25 per cent would result in an estimated change of around 4-6 per cent in value, depending on the maturity of the forest and other factors. Storebrand’s private equity investments are usually made through unlisted companies meaning no observable market prices are available. Large proportions of the portfolio are priced using comparable listed companies, while a smaller proportion of the portfolio is listed. The valuation of the private equity portfolio will thus be sensitive to fluctuations in the global equity markets. In the period 1997-2010, Storebrand’s private equity portfolio has had a beta against the MSCI World (Net currency hedging to NOK) of around 0.4. The annualised alpha in the same period has been around 8.9 per cent. Valuations of asset backed securities will generally be sensitive to estimated loan repayment terms, probability of losses and discounting rate requirements. Key assumptions for these factors will also be based on the mutual fund’s characteristics and quality. The specified composition of the ABS/RMBS/CMBS portfolio below is stated at fair value. The company’s valuation of asset backed securities is based on external sources. Based on experience with procured tradeable prices from brokers, the company is of the opinion that reasonable alternative assumptions entail a valuation that could be 2-3 per cent higher or lower than that indicated by fair value.

Indirect real estate investments are mortgaged structures. On average, 60 per cent of the portfolio is mortgaged. A change of 0.25 per cent in the required rate of return, where everything else remains the same, would result in a change in value in the real estate portfolio of approx. NOK 300 million. 86 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Non-­ Observable observable Quoted assumpassumpNOK million prices tions tions 2010 Assets: Equities and units Equities 28,445 989 3,168 32,602 Fund units 49,310 1,832 51,142 Private equity fund investments 2,319 4,363 6,682 Indirect real estate fund 6 2,411 2,417 Total equities and units 28,445 52,624 11,774 92,843 Lending to customers 673 673 Bonds and other fixed-income securities State and state guaranteed bonds 33,530 26,283 59,813 Financial and corporate bonds 41,137 1,042 42,179 Asset backed securities 23,935 1,114 25,049 Supranational organisations 2,833 2,833 Bond funds 26,871 26,871 Total bonds and other fixed-income securities 33,530 121,059 2,156 156,745 Derivatives: Interest rate derivatives 1,994 1,994 Currency derivatives 1,718 1,718 Credit derivatives 1 1 Total derivatives 3,712 3,712 of which derivatives with a positive market value 4,964 4,964 of which derivatives with a negative market value -1,252 -1,252 Liabilities: Liabilities to financial institutions 5,856 5,856 Deposits from and debt to customers 179 179 Non-­ Observable observable Quoted assumpassumpNOK million prices tions tions 2009 Assets Equities and units 20,701 41,767 10,359 72,827 Lending to customers 758 758 Bonds and other fixed-income securities 52,170 101,093 2,452 155,715 Derivatives -5 1,880 1,876 Liabilities Liabilities to financial institutions 6,841 6,841 Deposits from and debt to customers 173 173 Movements between quoted prices and observable assumptions From From quoted ­observable prices to assumpobservable tions to assumpquoted NOK million tions prices Equities and units 46 156 Level 1 encompasses listed equities that over the previous six months have experienced a daily average turnover equivalent to approximately NOK 20 million or more.

The ordinary retirement age is 65. Staff pensions are provided by a group pension scheme with Storebrand Livsforsikring AS. Pension payments from this scheme come into e ­ ffect from the pension age, which is 67 for employees and 65 for underwriters. Pension payments to employees between 65 and 67 and pensions linked to ­salaries of more than 12 times the national insurance basic amount (G) are paid directly by the company. A guarantee has been pledged for earned pensions for salaries of more than 12 G upon retirement before 65 years old. 12 G amounts as per 31 December 2010 to NOK 907,692. The company’s pension scheme satisfies the requirements of this act. The company is obliged to have an occupational pension scheme pursuant to the Act relating to Mandatory Occupational Pensions. The company‘s pension scheme satisfies the requirements of the Act. SPP The pension plan for employees in SPP follows the plan for bank employees in Sweden. The ordinary retirement age is 65 in accordance with the pension agreement between the Employer’s Association of the Swedish Banking Institutions (BAO) and the Union of Finance Sector Employees and between BAO and SACO (the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations). The amount is 10 percent of the annual salary up to 7.5 times the national insurance basic amount. The retirement pension is 65 per cent of the annual salary for the portion of salary between 7.5-20 times the national insurance basic amount, and 32.5 per cent of annual salary between 20-30 times the national insurance basic amount. No retirement pension is paid for the portion of salary in excess of 30 times the national insurance basic amount. annual report storebrand asa 95 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Reconciliation of pension assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position NOK million 2010 2009 Present value of insured pension benefit liabilities 3,799 3,470 Pension assets at fair value -3,066 -2,973 Net pension liability/surplus for the insured schemes 733 497 Present value of the uninsured pension liabilities 693 638 Net pension liabilities in the balance sheet 1,427 1,135 Includes employer's NI contributions on net underfunded liabilities included in gross liabilities Booked in the statement of financial position NOK million 2010 2009 Pension assets 30 44 Pension liabilities 1,456 1,179 Pension experience adjustments booked in equity NOK million 2010 2009 Year's change in experience adjustments included in equity -328 135 Accumulated experience adjustments included in equity -801 -473 Changes in the net defined benefit pension liabilities in the period NOK million 2010 2009 Net pension liabilities 01.01 4,108 4,297 Net pension cost recognised in the period 162 183 Interest on pension liabilities 172 172 Pension experience adjustments 255 -267 Pensions paid -235 -238 Changes to the pension scheme 6 Net pension liabilities additions/disposals and currency adjustments 32 -45 Reversed employer's NI contributions -2 -1 Net pension liabilities 31.12 4,492 4,108 Changes in the fair value of pension assets NOK million 2010 2009 Pension assets at fair value 01.01 2,973 2,897 Expected return 160 175 Pension experience adjustments -91 -50 Premium paid 196 164 Pensions paid -178 -194 Changes to the pension scheme -16 6 Net pension liabilities additions/disposals and currency adjustments 21 -25 Net pension assets 31.12 3,066 2,973 Expected premium payments (pension assets) in 2011 191 Pension assets are based on the financial assets held by Storebrand Life Insurance/SPP composed at 31.12: Storebrand Life Insurance SPP NOK million 2010 2009 2010 2009 Properties and real estate 16% 15% Bonds at amortised cost 26% 26% Secured and other lending 2% 2% Equities and units 21% 16% 28% 26% Bonds 30% 38% 65% 67% Commercial paper 2% 1% Other short-term financial assets 3% 2% 7% 7% Total 100% 100% 100% 100% The table shows the percentage asset allocation of pension assets at year-end managed by Storebrand Life Insurance.

Senior executives are contractually entitled to performance related bonuses related to the Group’s value-based management system. The Group’s value creation finances the overall amount of the bonus, but individual performance determines what proportion of the bonus is allocated. The bonus allocated to an individual is credited to a bonus account, and 1/3 of the balance on the bonus account is paid each year. If the total annual payments exceed the total bonuses awarded and return this will result in parts of Storebrand ’s initial contribution forming part of the annual payment. Senior employees, with the exception of the CEO, received an initial contribution when the bonus bank was established. If the employee leaves the company, the positive amount of the initial deposit will be retained by Storebrand. The balance of the bonus account is exposed 50 percent to Storebrand ’s share price and 50 percent to the best interest rate paid by Storebrand Bank. Over time the balances in the ”share bank“ and ”interest bank“ will grow separately. 4 The return on the ”share bank“ shows the annual gain in value of the individual ’s bonus account caused by the performance of the Storebrand share price in 2010 adjusted for dividend. 5 The retirement age for SPP‘s CEO is 62 years old. SPP‘s CEO is covered by a defined contribution based scheme in addition to a defined benefits scheme. Loans to employees of the Group total NOK 1,785 million. The Board of Storebrand ASA will submit a statement to the 2011 annual general meeting on the salary and other remuneration of senior employees, c­ onfere Section 6-16 a of the Public Limited Liabilities Companies Act, based on the Group’s previously adopted guidelines concerning remuneration for senior ­employees in Storebrand. STOREBRAND ASA – THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT ON THE FIXING OF THE SALARY AND OTHER REMUNERATION FOR SENIOR EMPLOYEES The Board of Storebrand ASA has had a special Remuneration Committee since 2000. The Remuneration Committee is tasked with providing recommendations to the Board concerning all matters to do with the company’s remuneration of the CEO. The Committee shall remain informed about and suggest guidelines for the fixing of remuneration for senior employees in the group. In addition the Committee is the advisory body for the CEO in relation to remuneration regimes that cover all employees in the Storebrand Group, including Storebrand’s bonus system and pension scheme. 1 Advisory guidelines for the coming financial year Storebrand aims to base remuneration on competitive and stimulating principles that help to attract, develop and retain highly qualified staff. Optimised financial remuneration helps to create a performance culture with clear goals for all employees and correct assessments by managers that ­differentiate between good and less good performances. annual report storebrand asa 99 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Financial remuneration shall be designed to: 1. Help support continuous improvement, stimulate internal cooperation and create a values-based performance culture 2. Help focus the efforts of employees 3. Ensure the Group‘s strategy and plans provide the basis for the goals and requirements set for employees‘ performance 4. Ensure it is based on long-term thinking, balanced goal-oriented management, and real value creation 5. Ensure it is based on an assessment of the individual‘s results and compliance with corporate principles 6. Facilitate a clear, transparent and team-based process for setting goals and goal structures 7. Ensure that both the development of financial remuneration and job requirements are embedded in the employee‘s role, responsibilities and influence in the Group 8. Ensure that the composition and level of the components of the financial remuneration are balanced and in line with the market The salaries of senior employees are fixed on the basis of a position’s responsibilities and complexity. Regular comparisons are made with corresponding positions in the market in order to adjust the pay level to the market. Storebrand does not wish to be a pay leader in relation to the sector. Senior employees in Storebrand can, in addition to their fixed salary, receive remuneration in the form of an annual bonus, participation in the Group’s group pension scheme, usual benefits in the form of free newspapers, telephone, company car scheme, and other personal benefits. Senior employees may also be entitled to a termination pay arrangement, which guarantees they will receive their salary less other income for a specific period of up to 24 months upon the conclusion of their employment. 2 Binding guidelines for shares, subscription rights, options, etc, for 2011 financial year 2.1 The bonus system The main elements of the bonus system will be continued The Storebrand Group‘s bonus scheme for the 2011 financial year complies with the regulations laid down by the Ministry of Finance on 1 December 2010 relating to remuneration schemes in financial institutions. Much of the Group‘s bonus scheme for senior employees in 2011 is a continuation of earlier bonus schemes. Earlier bonus schemes have been very robust with regard to ensuring the overall goals of increasing the correspondence between owners‘ and managers‘ incentives and helping to ensure the management does not take inappropriately large risks. Two categories of financial remuneration Senior employees and employees who influence the company‘s risk are divided into two categories with regard to financial remuneration. Senior employees for whom accounting and control functions make up a large part of their duties receive fixed salaries only. The other senior employees have a bonus scheme linked to value creation in the Group, in the unit and through the performances of individual employees. Overall structure of the bonus scheme The overall structure of the bonus scheme is outlined in the figure below. Funding Allotment Payment How large should the How should the pot be How should the bonus pot be? distributed among the bonus be paid? employees in the scheme? Bonuses are funded by value creation in the Group, while their awarding depends on a unit‘s value creation and the employee‘s individual performance. The bonus entitlement is credited to a bonus account. 1/3 of the bonus account balance is paid each year. Funding Specific quantitative goals for how the value creation in the company will fund bonuses are set each year. The value creation target is based on the risk ­adjusted result, which excludes market dependent results and profit sharing. Significant one-time effects must also be eliminated by adjustment. An additional requirement has been introduced that the total group result must be above a predefined level to avoid reductions in bonus entitlements based on the risk adjusted result. Negative group results result in full reduction and zero bonus. The target that determines how the risk adjusted value creation will fund the bonus is set by the Board of Storebrand ASA. Calculation of the allotment result A unit‘s value creation is measured using a scorecard that is anchored in the unit‘s strategic, financial and operation goals. Scorecards contain both ­quantitative and qualitative goals. Specific goals are also set each year with respect to the senior employees‘ performance. This is documented using a special monitoring system. Every ­employee has his or her own action plan anchored in the unit‘s goals. The action plan describes the targets an individual is responsible for and shall meet in a given year. Employees are assessed annually. Assessments are based on results in relation to an action plan, as well as an assessment of the i­ndividual‘s compliance with Storebrand‘s corporate principles. Action plan and corporate principles compliance assessments are given equal weight in the overall ­individual performance assessment. The allotment result depends on both the unit‘s result and individual target attainment. 100 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Calculation of bonus entitlement The target bonus for senior employees is intended over time to amount to between 20 per cent and 40 per cent of fixed salary. The maximum target ­attainment for funding and allotment is 150 per cent respectively. Senior employees‘ bonus entitlements are calculated using the following formula: Expected bonus level x Funding result x Allotment result The maximum possible bonus entitlement is 90 per cent of annual salary. Payment of bonus Individual bonus banks have been set up for senior employees with bonus schemes. The bonus entitlement is not paid directly, but must be credited to the bonus bank. The amount credited to the bonus bank is exposed 50 percent to the bank interest rate and 50 percent to Storebrand’s share price in the relevant qualifying year. 1/3 of the bonus account balance is paid each year. The bonus bank balance can be withheld if the bonus entitlement has been calculated on the basis of incorrect information. Compulsory purchase of shares in Storebrand ASA Senior employees must spend half of the paid bonus, after tax, on purchasing Storebrand ASA shares at market price. SPP‘s CEO must spend 60 per cent on purchasing shares. These shares are subject to a lock-in period of 3 years. The lock-in period continues to apply if the employee leaves the company. 2.2 Pension scheme The company shall arrange and pay for an ordinary group pension insurance common to all employees and which applies from the moment employment ­commences. Otherwise, the applicable pension rules at any given time apply. The current retirement age is 65 years old. 2.3 Termination pay The CEO and executive vice presidents are entitled to termination pay if their contracts are terminated by the company. Entitlement to termination pay is also triggered by resignation if this is due to substantial organisational changes or equivalent situations that make it ­unreasonable for the employee to remain in his or her position. If the employment relationship is brought to an end due to a gross breach of duty or other material non-performance of the employment contract, the ­provisions in this section do not apply. Any income gained through work, including fees for service provision, the exercising of an office, etc shall result in an equal amount being deducted from the termination pay. The termination pay amounts to the pensionable salary at the end of the employment relationship, excluding any bonus schemes. The CEO is entitled to 24 months‘ termination pay. Other executive vice presidents are entitled to 18 months‘ termination pay. 2.4 Share programme for employees Like other employees in Storebrand, senior employees have an opportunity to purchase a limited number of shares in Storebrand ASA at a discount pursuant to the share programme for employees. Storebrand has offered employees an opportunity to purchase shares in Storebrand at a 20 per cent discount since 1996. The tax-free discount is limited to NOK 1,500 per annum pursuant to the tax rules. In 2006, the investment opportunity was expanded to the maximum loan amount from the company (3/5 G) and the 20 per cent discount kept. This means that for purchases of shares that exceed NOK 7,500, the discount on the excess amount is taxed as pay. A maximum of NOK 40,000 of shares can be bought at a total discount of NOK 8,000. NOK 6,500 of this discount will be taxed as pay. A lock-in period of 1 year is practised for this scheme. 3 The senior employee remuneration policy practised in 2010 3.1 General The senior employee policy practised in 2010 was based on the statement regarding the fixing of the salary of senior employees that was dealt with by the annual general meeting in April 2010. 3.2 Paid bonus for 2009 qualifying year The targets set for funding bonuses were achieved in the 2009 qualifying year. Therefore, bonuses were awarded to senior employees based on results and performance in 2009 and which were paid out in March 2010. Payments from the bonus bank in March 2010 were made pursuant to the rules that applied in the 2009 qualifying year. 1/3 of the existing balance in the bonus bank was paid out after the awarding of the bonus for the 2009 qualifying year and after calculating the return using the bank interest rate and the development of the Storebrand share between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2009 and 31.12.2009, respectively. The number of shares bought by all members of the long-term incentive scheme in 2009 was 46,591. annual report storebrand asa 101 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group 3.3 Calculation of bonus payment for 2009 qualifying year The average bonus entitlement for a member of the executive management team is calculated using the following formula: Expected bonus level x Group‘s funding x Individual target attainment The average expected bonus level was NOK 1,075,000. Group funding was 70 per cent and the average target attainment by units and individuals was 105.9 per cent for the 2009 qualifying year. This results in an average bonus entitlement of NOK 829,224. This amount was credited to the bonus bank. In 2009, the return on the cash portion of the bonus bank was 3.68 per cent and the return on the share portion of the bonus bank was 136.20 per cent. 1/3 of the bonus account balance is paid out. The awarding and payment of bonuses complied with the applicable guidelines for 2009. 3.4 Calculation of bonus entitlement for 2010 The criteria for funding bonuses were achieved in 2010. The average expected bonus level for the executive management team was NOK 1,197,500. The funding of bonuses is linked to the internal programme for improving operations and requirements concerning the group result and solvency. The funding result was 114 per cent, calculated pursuant to the guidelines for the bonus scheme. Assuming 100 per cent target attainment by units and individuals, the average bonus entitlement would be NOK 1,365,150. The allotment for 2010 will also depend on the units‘ results and individual results. The bonus entitlement is credited to the bonus bank. In 2010, the return on the cash portion of the bonus bank was 3.04 per cent and the return on the share portion of the bonus bank was 10.3 per cent. 1/3 of the bonus account balance is paid out. The awarding and payment of bonuses will comply with the applicable guidelines for 2010. 4 Statement concerning the effects of share-based remuneration agreements for the company and shareholders In accordance with the new guidelines for bonus entitlements in 2011 half of senior employees‘ net paid out bonus in 2012 must be spent on purchasing shares in Storebrand ASA at market prices with a 3 year lock-in period. In the opinion of the Board of Directors this has no negative consequences for the company and shareholders given the orientation of the scheme and the size of the individual executive vice presidents‘ portfolio of shares in Storebrand ASA. 23 Remuneration paid to auditors 2010 NOK million Total Norway Abroad 2009 Statutory audit 10 7 3 15 Other reporting duties 3 3 8 Tax advice 2 Other non-audit services 1 1 1 1 Total remuneration to auditors 15 11 4 26 The amounts excluding VAT 102 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group 24 Other costs incl. currency bank NOK million 2010 2009 Pooling -200 -177 Interest costs, insurance -13 -42 Insurance related costs -58 -35 Borrowing expenses -13 -11 Currency gains, insurance liabilities 40 Loss on claims insurance -43 Other costs -9 -138 Total other costs -294 -407 25 Interest expenses NOK million 2010 2009 Interest expense – funding -131 -129 Interest expense – subordinated loans -517 -541 Total interest expenses 1 -648 -670 1 Interest expenses for Storebrand Bank are included in net interest income for banking enterprises. 26 Tax Tax cost in the result NOK million 2010 2009 Tax payable -67 -3 Deferred tax 367 50 Total tax charge 300 47 Reconciliation of expected and actual tax cost NOK million 2010 2009 Ordinary pre-tax profit 1,217 855 Expected tax on income at nominal rate -341 -240 Tax effect of: realised/unrealised shares/AIO 863 635 dividends received -10 181 associated companies -6 23 permanent differences 337 -142 write-down of deferred tax assets -1,174 -365 Change from earlier years 630 -46 Total tax charge 300 47 annual report storebrand asa 103 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Calculation of deferred tax assets and deferred tax on temporary differences and losses carried forward NOK million 2010 2009 Tax increasing temporary differences Securities 3,887 1,895 Real estate 4,674 4,416 Operating assets 291 298 Pre-paid pensions 786 44 Securities liabilities 51 Gains/losses account 402 503 Other 663 656 Total tax increasing temporary differences 10,753 7,811 Tax reducing temporary differences Securities -1,773 -2,331 Operating assets -43 -31 Provisions -1,699 -27 Accrued pension liabilities -1,294 -795 Securities liabilities -528 Gains/losses account -26 -32 Other -119 -129 Total tax reducing temporary differences -4,953 -3,874 Losses carried forward -10,451 -7,266 Allowances carried forward -1,057 -1,243 Total losses and allowances carried forward -11,507 -8,510 Basis for net deferred tax/tax assets -5,708 -4,572 Write-down of basis for deferred tax assets 5,839 4,685 Net basis for deferred tax/tax assets 132 113 Net deferred tax asset/liability in the balance sheet 37 32 Booked in the balance sheet Deferred tax assets 132 213 Deferred tax 169 182 Deferred tax assets have been written down as a result of uncertainty as to whether future taxable income will be sufficient for all losses carried forward to be used for business in Norway.

During 2010, the Storebrand Bank Group carried out a NOK 5 million write-down in intangible assets. The write-down was primarily linked to IT systems for credit risk that are no longer in use. Goodwill linked to Hadrian Utvikling AS was written down in its entirety as per 31 December 2010. The amount was NOK 5 million. Intangible assets linked to acquisition of SPP Storebrand Livsforsikring AS acquired SPP Livförsäkring AB and its subsidiaries in 2007. The majority of the intangible assets associated with SPP are a ­ ssets of VIF (value of business in force), for which a separate sufficiency test has been performed as per the requirements of IFRS 4. In order to determine whether goodwill and other intangible assets connected with SPP has been the subject of a drop in value, e ­ stimates are made of the recyclable amount for the relevant cash-flow generating units. Recyclable amounts are established by computing the enterprise’s utility value. SPP is regarded as a single cash flow generating unit and the development of future administration results, risk results and financial results for SPP will affect its utility value. In the ­computation of this utility value, the management have made use of Board-addressed budgets and prognoses for the coming three-year period. The prognoses for the various elements of the result are based on the development in recent years, effects of measures during the prognosis period, as well as assumptions about the normalised development of the financial markets based on the current financial strategy and applicable market interest rates. The administration result is expected to develop positively due to the cost-efficiency measures, and the growth in sales of products and services that are cost-effective to administer and have lower capital requirements. In addition to the coming three-year period, cash flows are projected for the period 2014 to 2020 based on growth in the various result elements of between 0 percent and 5 percent per annum. A stable growth rate of 2.5 per cent is also assumed in the calculation of the terminal value. Growth is generally expected in the occupational pensions market due to growth factors such as ­demography with the expected increase in the number of pensioners, higher employment rate,and regulatory conditions, including the transition from defined benefits to defined contribution pensions. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return after tax of 8 per cent. The required rate of return is computed on the basis of risk-free interest and added to a premium that reflects the risk in the enterprise. Intangible assets linked to bank activities A cash flow based valuation based on the expected pre-tax result is conducted when calculating the utility value for the banking group. The calculation is based on Board approved budgets and prognoses for the coming three-year period. The prognosis assumes an improvement in the result where the costs programme is implemented, and growth in other income based on developments and the efforts made in recent years. A stable growth rate of 2.5 per cent is assumed in the calculation of the terminal value, equal to expected inflation. The utility value is calculated u ­ sing a required rate of return after tax of 9 per cent. The required rate of return is computed on the basis of risk-free interest and added to a premium that reflects the risk in the enterprise. The executive management has assessed the recoverable amount of goodwill as per 31 December 2010 and concluded that no write-down is necessary. Sensitivity analyses are conducted with respect to the assumptions regarding the development of the result and required rate of return. The management are of the opinion that it is improbable that possible reasonable changes in the key presumptions would bring about a need for a write-down. annual report storebrand asa 105 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Specification of intangible assets Carrying Depr. meamount NOK million Lifetime Depr. rate thod 2010 Brand name SPP 10 years 10% Straight line 121 Brand name (Hadrian Eiendom) Not depreciated 31 IT systems 1-8 years 10-33.3% Straight line 154 Customer lists SPP 10 years 10% Straight line 352 Value of business in force SPP 10 years 10% Straight line 4,937 Rights to withdraw fees from SPP Fonder 2.5 years 40% Straight line 5 Total 5,600 Goodwill distributed by business acquisition Supply/ Carrying disposal/ Carrying Business Acquisition Acc. depr. amount currency Writeamount NOK million area cost 01.01 01.01 01.01 effect downs 31.12 Delphi Fondsforvaltning SB Fondene 35 -4 32 32 Hadrian Eiendom AS SB Bank 16 16 16 Storebrand Bank ASA SB Bank 563 -141 422 422 Other subsidiaries in the Storebrand Bank Group SB Bank 47 -13 34 1 -5 30 SPP SB Life 749 686 46 732 Storebrand Baltic SB Life 4 4 4 Evoco SB Life 4 4 4 Total 1,420 -158 1,199 47 -5 1,240 Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment. 28 Tangible fixed assets and properties for own use Fixtures & NOK million Equipment Vehicles fittings Real estate 2010 2009 Carrying amount 01.01 84 36 73 17 209 124 Additions 28 3 20 51 125 Disposals -1 -7 -1 -9 -6 Revaluation booked in balance sheet -1 Depreciation -24 -9 -10 -1 -44 -30 Write-downs in the period -4 Currency diffs. from converting foreign units 1 1 Other changes -22 6 -16 Carrying amount 31.12 66 23 88 16 193 209 Acquisition cost opening balance 194 54 106 42 396 294 Acquisition cost closing balance 176 45 132 43 395 396 Accumulated depreciation and write-downs opening balance -110 -17 -33 -26 -186 -165 Accumulated depreciation and write-downs closing balance -110 -21 -44 -27 -202 -186 106 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Properties for own use (fair value) NOK million 2010 2009 Carrying amount 01.01 1,718 1,968 Additions 65 944 Disposals -1,128 Revaluation booked in balance sheet 5 -6 Depreciation/revaluation Write-downs in the period -105 -24 Currency diffs. from converting foreign units -14 Other changes -37 Carrying amount 31.12 1,668 1,718 Acquisition cost opening balance 1,718 1,679 Acquisition cost closing balance 1,773 1,718 Accumulated depreciation and write-downs opening balance 290 Accumulated depreciation and write-downs closing balance -105 Properties for own use, also see note 37.

However, the fair value of lending to corporate customers with margin loans is slightly lower than book value since some loans have lower margins than they would have been taken out at year end 2010. The shortfall is calculated using a discounted difference between the agreed margin and the day‘s market price over the remaining term to maturity. Fair value is also adjusted for individual write-downs. The fair values of lending, liabilities to financial institutions and securities issued are based on valuation techniques. The valuation techniques use interest rate curves and credit spreads from external providers. The calculations are made using the QRM risk management system. Bonds at amortised cost As a general rule, the fair value of bonds is based on prices obtained from Reuters and Bloomberg. Bonds that are not quoted regularly will normally be valued on the basis of recognised theoretical models. The latter is particularly true for bonds denominated in NOK. These sorts of valuations are based on discount rates consisting of swap interest rates plus a credit premium. The credit premium will often be issuer specific and normally based on a consensus of credit spreads quoted by a selected brokerage house. 110 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Securities issued The bonds are stated on the basis of our theoretical models using the credit spread for Storebrand ASA over swap. Bonds are stated on the basis of registered sales of the bonds and quoted prices from brokers. All prices are quality assured in relation to EOM (end of month) reports from brokers. Subordinated loan capital The fair value of subordinated loan capital is determined on the basis of registered sales of the bonds and quoted prices from brokers. All prices are quality assured in relation to EOM (end of month) reports from brokers. 34 Bonds at amortised cost 2010 2009 Acquisition Carrying Carrying NOK million Nominal value cost amount Fair value amount Fair value State and state guaranteed 20,916 21,696 21,871 22,202 20,839 21,095 Financial and corporate bonds 10,583 10,508 10,689 10,755 11,181 11,109 Asset backed securities 12,178 10,700 10,673 10,759 7,879 7,658 Supranational organisations 5,166 4,791 4,961 5,210 4,819 4,996 Total bonds at amortised cost 48,843 47,695 48,194 48,926 44,718 44,858 Modified duration 4.5 4.8 Average effective yield 5.4% 4.6% 5.5% 4.9% The effective yield for each security is calculated using the carrying amount and the observed market price (fair value).

Calculation of fair value for properties Investment properties are valued at fair value. Fair value is the amount an asset could be sold for in a transaction at arm’s length between well informed, voluntary parties. Internal value calculations An internal cash flow model is used to calculate fair value based on the following assumptions: The individual required rate of return for the individual investment is used to discount future net cash flows. The required rate of return is set on the basis of expected future risk free interest and an individually set risk premium. The following, among other things, is taken into account when setting the required rate of return: • Transactions in the market • Perceptions in the market • Lease status (vacancy, tenant’s solvency) • Location • Standard • Rent level in relation to market rent • Value per m2 • All other information about property values, the market and the individual property The property’s market values is assessed on the basis of a long-term income perspective. Office buildings and shopping centres account for a significant proportion of the properties. In the case of office buildings, a future income and costs picture is estimated for the first 10 years, and a final value ­calculated at the end of that 10 year period, based on existing leases, estimated market rent and estimated normal operating costs for the property. The net income stream takes into account existing and future reductions in income resulting from vacancy, necessary investments and an assessment of the future changes in market rents. In the case of shopping centres, the property’s value is calculated based on a market yield. In cases where it is known significant changes will occur to the expected cash flow in later years, this is taken account of in the valuation. External valuations Valuations are obtained from external valuers for a representative selection of properties to verify the values calculated using the internal valuation model. As per 31 December 2010, valuations were obtained for the equivalent of 37 per cent of Storebrand’s property portfolio and which represent all the ­segments described below. The properties are valued on the basis of the following effective required rate of return (incl. 2.5 per cent inflation): Required rate of return Volume Segment 2010 2009 2010 2009 Office buildings (including parking and storage): Oslo-Vika/Filipstad Brygge 7.50 8.50 7.75 9.25 5,625 5,377 Rest of Greater Oslo 8.25 10.00 7.75 10.00 7,559 7,611 Rest of Norway 8.75 9.75 8.75 10.00 3,856 1,131 Shopping centre portfolio 8.00 9.25 8.25 9.25 10,656 11,180 Culture and conference Sweden 7.00 9.00 742 311 Other 289 268 annual report storebrand asa 113 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Sensitivities Valuations are particularly sensitive to changes in the required rate of return and assumed future cash flows. A change of 0.25 per cent in the required rate of return, where everything else remains the same, would result in a change in value in the real estate portfolio of NOK 931 million, which is equivalent to 3.36 per cent. Around 25 per cent of a property’s cash flow is linked to signed leases. This means that changes in the uncertain components of the cash flow of 1 per cent result in a change in value of 0.75 per cent. 38 Biological assets NOK million 2010 2009 Carrying amount 01.01 552 523 Additions due to purchases/new planting (forest) 36 46 Disposals -1 Translation difference -28 -70 Change in fair value less sales expenses 29 53 Carrying amount 31.12 589 552 Biological assets booked in the statement of financial statement consist of forests in the subsidiaries AS Værdalsbruket and Foran Real Estate SIA in Latvia. Biological assets owned by the company are stated at fair value, which is defined on the basis of an alternative fair value calculation or the present value of expected net cash flow (IFRS 41 “Agriculture” nos. 20 and 21). Write-ups of other assets are recognised in the profit and loss account. Ownership rights relating to other assets are recognised at the time the purchase agreement is signed.

In order to quantify a ­derivative position, reference is made to amounts described as the underlying nominal principal, nominal volume, etc. Nominal volume is arrived at differently for different classes of derivatives, and provides some indication of the size of the position and risk the derivative creates. Gross nominal volume principally indicates the size of the exposure, whilst net nominal volume provides some indication of the risk exposure. However nominal volume is not a measure which ­necessarily provides a comparison of the risk represented by different types of derivatives. Unlike gross nominal volume, the calculation of net nominal volume also takes into account which direction of market risk exposure the instrument represents by differentiating between long (asset) positions and short (liability) positions. A long position in an equity derivative produces a gain in value if the share price increases. For interest rate derivatives, a long position produces a gain if ­interest rates fall, as is the case for bonds. For currency derivatives, a long position results in a positive change in value if the relevant exchange rate strengthens against the NOK. Figures for average gross nominal volume are based on daily calculations of gross nominal volume. annual report storebrand asa 115 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group Gross nominal Average nomiNet nominal volume 1 nal volume 2 volume 2 Fair value 1 NOK million Assets Liabilities Equity derivatives 6,414 4,630 1,318 Interest rate derivatives 88,884 250,869 33,905 2,510 649 Currency derivatives 116,255 89,742 -44,567 2,433 583 Credit derivatives 880 1,063 -764 21 20 Total derivatives 2010 212,432 346,303 -10,108 4,964 1,252 Total derivatives 2009 304,476 530,461 -17,461 4,002 2,126 The above table includes net positions in indirect investments. 1 Values 31.12. 2 Average for the year. 43 Currency exposure Balance sheet items items excl. currency Currency Financial assets and liabilities in foreign currencies derivatives forwards Net position Net on balance Of which SPP NOK million sheet Net Sales in currency in NOK Group in NOK AUD 123 -141 -19 -112 94 CAD 197 -223 -27 -155 141 CHF 199 -120 79 491 679 DKK 1,745 -56 1,688 1,766 1,754 EUR 2,686 -2,888 -203 -1,577 599 GBP 300 -338 -38 -345 569 HKD 322 -218 103 77 147 ILS 14 14 23 JPY 35,444 -42,758 -7,314 -524 262 NZD 142 -144 -3 -11 7 SEK 119,208 16,488 135,695 117,321 115,812 SGD 345 -22 322 356 400 USD 4,286 -4,942 -656 -3,816 1,900 NOK 1 11,711 -62 11,649 11,649 552 LVL 1 1 6 Total short-term foreign currency 125,149 122,917 EUR 8 -8 LTL 3 3 7 SEK 16,382 -14,730 1,652 1,441 Long-term foreign currency 1,448 Insurance liabilities SPP Group in SEK -124,532 -124,532 Total long-term foreign currency -123,084 -124,532 Total net position foreign currency 2010 2,065 -1,615 Total net position foreign currency 2009 5,693 5,744 1 Equity and bond funds denominated in NOK with foreign currency exposure, including in EUR and USD, amount to NOK 11 billion. Life and Pensions Norway The company actively hedges the major part of its foreign currency risk. Currency risk arises from investments in international securities, and to a lesser ­extent from subordinated loans denominated in foreign currencies. Currency risk is hedged through forward foreign exchange contracts at the portfolio ­level, and currency positions are regularly monitored within specified total limits. Short positions are closed no later than the business day following the date on which they arise. In addition, there are separate limits for creating active currency positions. These positions are included in the note relating to short-term debt instruments and bonds. Storebrand utilises a currency hedging principle called block hedging, which makes currency hedging more ­efficient. The currency positions outstanding as per 31 December 2010 are typical of the company’s small limits for currency. Life and Pensions Sweden SPP practices currency hedging to a certain extent with respect to its international investments. In the case of equities the currency hedging will be ­between 50 per cent and 100 per cent, and for other classes it actively hedges the major part of its foreign currency risk. Bank activities Storebrand Bank ASA hedges net items in the balance sheet with forward exchange contracts. 116 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group 44 Reclassification of financial instruments 2009 NOK million From available-for-sale/to amortised cost Reclassification date: 08.05.2009 Carrying amount 9,095 Fair value 9,095 31.12 Carrying amount 8,610 Fair value 8,632 Effect on result if not reclassified -484 The principal and coupon interest are expected to be repaid for the reclassified paper.

Currency hedging of net investment in SPP In 2010, Storebrand utilised cash flow hedging for the currency risk linked to Storebrand’s net investment in SPP. 3 month rolling currency derivatives were used in which the spot element in these is used as the hedging instrument. The effective share of hedging instruments is recognised in total ­comprehensive income. The net amount recognised in total comprehensive income in 2010, i.e. the effective share of the hedging instruments and the currency effect on the hedged object was NOK 29 million. The net investment in SPP is partly hedged and therefore the expectation is that future hedge effectiveness will be around 100 per cent.

The swap agreements are entered into through auctions that are administrated by Norges Bank. In the swap arrangement, the state sells state treasury bills to the bank through a time/restricted swap for covered bonds. The bank can either keep the state treasury bill and receive payment from the state when the swap falls due for repayment, or it may sell the treasury bill in the market. When the bills become due within the term of the swap ­agreement, the bank must purchase new bills from the state at the price that is determined by the market price for treasury bills. This roll/over will be on/ going throughout the entire term of the agreement. Upon expiry of the swap agreement, the bank is obligated to purchase the covered bonds back from the state at the same price that the state purchased them for. Storebrand Bank ASA will receive the returns on the transferred covered bonds. All risk ­concerning the covered bonds continues to lie with Storebrand Bank ASA and covered bonds are therefore not excluded. annual report storebrand asa 121 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand Group 53 Capital requirements and solvency requirements The Storebrand Group is a cross-sectoral financial group subject to capital requirements pursuant to Basel I/II (capital adequacy) and the solvency rules on a consolidated basis. Pursuant to the solvency rules, solvency margin requirements are calculated for the insurance companies‘ in the Group, while for the other companies a capital requirement pursuant the capital adequacy regulations is calculated. The calculations in the tables below conform to the regulations relating to the application of the solvency rules on a consolidate basis, etc., Section 7. Primary capital consists of core (tier 1) capital and supplementary capital. Pursuant to the regulations for calculating primary capital, core (tier 1) capital is materially different to equity in the financial statements. The table below shows a reconciliation of core (tier 1) capital in relation to equity. Issued hybrid tier 1 capital can account for 15 per cent of the core (tier 1) capital, while any overshoot can be included in the tier 2 capital. A percentage of the conditional bonus is included in the core (tier 1) capital pursuant to the conditions stipulated by The Norwegian FSA and this applies to that part of the insurance capital that is not guaranteed in SPP. Tier 2 capital which consists of subordinated loans cannot exceed more than 100 per cent of the core (tier 1) capital, while dated subordinated loan capital cannot exceed more than 50 per cent of the core (tier 1) capital. Pursuant to Basel II the capital requirement for primary capital is 8 per cent of the basis for calculating the credit risk, market risk and operational risk. The insurance companies in the Group are included in capital adequacy with a capital requirement pursuant to the regulations in Basel II. In a cross-sectoral financial group the sum of the primary capital and other solvency margin capital shall cover the sum of the solvency margin requirements for the insurance activities and the requirements for primary capital of financial institutions and securities firms. In the solvency margin requirement that is used for the insurance companies, this requirement is calculated as 4 per cent of the gross insurance fund. The solvency margin capital in insurance differs slightly from primary capital which is used in capital adequacy. Primary capital includes a proportion of conditional bonuses, but this capital cannot be included in the solvency margin capital. A proportion of additional statutory reserves and the risk equalisation fund are also included in the solvency margin capital.

Storebrand ASA does not apply IFRS to the parent company’s financial statements. Use of estimates and assumptions The preparation of the annual financial statements has involved the use of estimates and assumptions that have affected assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and information on potential liabilities. Future events may cause these estimates to change. Such changes will be recognised in the financial statements when there is a sufficient basis for using new estimates. Classification and valuation policies Assets and liabilities have been valued in accordance with the general valuation rules of the Accounting Act. Assets intended for permanent ownership and use are classified as fixed assets, while assets and receivables due for payment within one year are classified as current assets. Equivalent policies have been applied to liability items. Profit and loss account and statement of financial position Storebrand ASA is a holding company with subsidiaries within insurance, banking and investments. The statement in the Regulations relating to annual ­financial statements for insurance companies has not been used. A statement that complies with the Accounting Act has been used. Dividends and group contributions In the company’s unconsolidated accounts, investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are valued at acquisition cost less any write-downs. The main income of Storebrand ASA is the return on capital invested in subsidiaries. Group contributions and dividends received in respect of these investments are therefore recorded as operating income. Proposed and approved dividends and group contributions from subsidiaries are recognised in the unconsolidated financial statements of Storebrand ASA as income in the accounting year. This treatment can only be applied to income earned by subsidiaries during Storebrand’s ownership. If the opposite occurs, it is recognised as an equity transaction. This means that the ownership interest in the subsidiary is reduced by the received dividend or group contribution. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets for own use are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. Fixed assets are written down if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable value of the asset. Pension liabilities for own employees The company uses the Norwegian standard for pensions accounting NRS 6, which permits the use of IAS 19 Employee Benefits. With effect from 1 January 2010 Storebrand ASA booked actuarial gains and losses directly against equity. The entire effect of the change was recognised in 2010. The comparable figures remain unchanged. The net pension cost for the period is made up of the sum of pension entitlement accrued in the period, interest cost on the calculated pension liability and the expected return on pension assets. Pension costs and pension liabilities for defined benefits schemes are calculated using a linear profile for the accrual of pension entitlement and expected final salary as the basis for calculating the benefit obligation, based on assumptions about discount rate, future ­increases in salary, pensions and social security pension benefits, the future return on pension assets and actuarial assumptions about mortality, staff turnover etc. The discount rate used is the risk-free interest rate appropriate for the remaining maturity. Where a scheme is funded, the pension assets are valued at fair value and deducted to show the net liability in the balance sheet. The effect of changes to the pension scheme is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred, unless the change is conditional on future accrual of ­pension entitlement. In such a case, the effect is amortised linearly over the time until the entitlement is fully earned. Employer’s social security contributions are included in pension liability and in experience adjustments included in equity. Tax The tax cost in the profit and loss account consists of tax payable for the accounting year and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of differences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recorded in the statement of financial position to the extent it is considered likely that the company will have sufficient taxable profit in the future to make use of the tax asset. Deferred tax is applied directly to equity to the extent that it relates to items that are themselves directly applied to equity. Currency Current assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Shares held as fixed assets are translated at the exchange rate on the date of acquisition. Financial instruments Equities and units Investments in shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are valued at cost price less any write-down of value. The need for any write-down is ­assessed at the end of each accounting period. Other equities and units are valued at their fair value. Where the share or interest in question is listed on a stock exchange or other regulated market, fair value is determined as the bid price on the last trading day immediately prior to or on the statement of financial position date. annual report storebrand asa 129 Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand ASA Purchases of the company’s own shares are treated as an equity transaction, and the holding of own shares is reported as a reduction in equity. Bonds and other fixed income securities Financial assets and liabilities are included in the statement of financial position from such time Storebrand becomes party to the instrument’s contractual terms and ­conditions. Normal purchases and sales of financial instruments are booked on the transaction date. When a financial asset or a financial liability is first ­recognised in the accounts, it is valued at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset or a financial liability that is not a financial asset or a financial liability at fair value in the profit and loss account, transaction costs directly related to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or the financial liability. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash flow from the financial asset expires, or when the company transfers the financial asset to another party in a transaction by which all, or virtually all, the risk and reward associated with ownership of the asset is transferred. Bonds and other fixed income securities are recognised at fair value. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. For financial assets that are listed on a stock exchange or another regulated market place, fair value is determined as the bid price on the last trading day up to and including the statement of financial position date, and in the case of an asset that is to be acquired or a liability that is held, the offer price. Financial derivatives Financial derivatives are valued at fair value. The fair value of such derivatives is classified as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value in the profit and loss account. Bond loans Bond loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective yield method. The amortised cost includes the transaction costs on the date of issue. Accounting treatment of derivatives for hedging Fair value hedging Storebrand uses fair value hedging, where the item hedged is fixed rate funding measured at amortised cost. Derivatives that fall within this category are recognised at fair value in the profit and loss account. Changes in the value of the hedged item that relate to the hedged risk are applied to the carrying amount of the item and are recognised in the profit and loss account. 02 Income from investments in subsidiaries NOK million 2010 2009 Storebrand Livsforsikring AS 850 610 Storebrand Fondene AS 80 35 Storebrand Bank ASA 1 50 35 Storebrand Kapitalforvaltning AS 178 155 Total 1,158 835 1 Group contribution booked as equity transaction. 130 03 Personnel costs NOK million 2010 2009 Ordinary wages and salaries -16 -36 Employer's social security contributions -9 -12 Pension costs 1 9 6 Other benefits -8 -11 Total -23 -54 1 See the specification in note 4. 130 annual report storebrand asa Notes to the financial statements of Storebrand ASA 04 Pensions costs and pension liabilities Employees are insured through a defined benefit pension equivalent to 70 per cent of pensionable salary at the time of retirement. The ordinary retirement age is 65. Staff pensions are provided by a group pension scheme with Storebrand Livsforsikring AS. Pension payments from this scheme come into effect from the pension age, which is 67 for employees and 65 for underwriters. Pension payments to employees between 65 and 67 and pensions linked to salaries of more than 12 times the national insurance basic amount (G) are paid directly by the company. A guarantee has been pledged for earned pensions for salaries of more than 12 G upon retirement before 65 years old. As per 31 December 2010, 12 G amounts to NOK 907,692. The company’s pension scheme satisfies the requirements of this act. Storebrand ASA has substantial pension liabilities linked to pensioners who historically speaking were employed by Storebrand ASA. The company is obliged to have an occupational pension scheme pursuant to the Act relating to Mandatory Occupational Pensions. The company’s pension scheme satisfies the requirements of the Act. Storebrand’s defined benefit scheme was closed with effect from 1 January 2011. From and including 2011, new employees will be included in Storebrand defined contribution scheme.

Idar Kreutzer is the Chief Executive Officer of Storebrand ASA and the figures provided in the notes are for total remuneration from the group. He is entitled to 24 months’ salary following the expiry of the normal notice period. All forms of work-related income from other sources including consultancy a ­ ssignments will be deducted from such payments. He is entitled to a performance-based bonus based on the group’s ordinary bonus scheme which is linked to the group’s value-based management system. The group’s value creation finances the overall amount of the bonus but individual performance determines ­allocation. The allocated bonus is credited to a bonus account and 1/3 of the balance on the bonus account is paid each year. The amount credited to the bonus bank is exposed 50 per cent to Storebrand’s share price and 50 per cent to the best interest rate paid by Storebrand Bank. The balance of the bonus bank as per 31 December 2010 was NOK 4.9 million. The CEO is a member of the Storebrand pension scheme. The discounted present value of his pension entitlement amounts to NOK 18 million.

Corporate responsibility reporting Storebrand has issued environmental reports since 1995. In addition, it has been reporting on the broader field of corporate responsibility since 1999. The Group reports according to the triple bottom line where financial, environmental and social r­esponsibility is described. The action plan for corporate responsibility (see above) is structured around the relationships to the Group’s most important stakeholders: Owners, customers, employees, suppliers, the rest of society and the international community. We use Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as a tool for our corporate responsibility reporting. In our opinion, our reporting practices generally conform to GRI’s reporting principles and qualify for level B in accordance with the guidelines. The GRI Index matrix on our website (www.storebrand.no/samfunnsansvar or www. storebrand.com) provides references to information on the indicators, whether these are completely or partly answered. The definition and boundaries of the indicators in the action plan are also described in more detail. The targets in the action plan are for a 2-year period, while the results are reported annually. The measures for achieving the targets are ­anchored in and followed up by the company’s different expert groups. The results are collected from all units in the Group using ­established reporting routines. The corporate responsibility unit also conducts separate meetings and joint meetings with indicator owners in the company. A great emphasis is placed on ensuring that the information is correct and complete, however some uncertainty may be associated with some parts of the numerical data. Storebrand wants to ensure transparency in its work on corporate responsibility work. The reported results in the action plan are therefore reviewed by Deloitte. Reviews of this kind increase the c­ redibility of the reporting and presented data. This also increases Storebrand’s confidence that the information was appropriately c­ ollected, collated and quality assured. annual report storebrand asa 147 Our corporate responsibility work targets 2011-2012 Status 2010 Target 2011 2012 Financial value creation Shareholders Solvency margin of Storebrand Life Insurance 164% 150% Dow Jones Sustainability Index 74 points ≥ 75 points Profitability of corporate responsibility 1 -Analysis Social responsibility Customers UN’s principles for responsible investments (UNPRI) In upper quartile in 1 out In upper quartile in 3 out of 7 of 7 areas areas Proportion of investments that are sustainable 2 -Develop indicator + baseline ­assessment Investments in microfinance and alternative asset classes 3 Explored Explore new o ­ pportunities new and ­increase investments if opportunities ­appropriate Customer satisfaction – retail customers 63 67 Customer satisfaction corporate customers Same level as others in Number 1 in the industry industry Customers’ awareness and support of Storebrand’s corporate responsi-Develop indicator + baseline bility work ­assessment Prevention and detection of fraud -Ensure compliance with internal guidelines and participate in ­external professional forums Processing time for complaints 43% within 3 weeks 70% within 3 weeks Employees Ethics work in the Group 4 -85% Sick leave 5 3.8% 3.5% Employees’ health and wellbeing -Develop indicator + baseline ­assessment Proportion of female managers 38% Within 40-60% Diversity Analysed measures Develop indicator + baseline ­assessment Productivity measurements LEAN -Develop indicator + baseline ­assessment Employees' awareness and support of Storebrand's corporate 79% 85% responsibility work Suppliers Environmental requirements for suppliers Implemented guidelines 50% of new agreements contain environmental requirements Environmental considerations Society CO2 emissions (metric tons) Reduced by 35% to 1,836 Reduce by 14% to 1,584 Air travel (individual flights) 7,300 individual flights Stable level Energy consumption (externally managed properties) -Assess Energy consumption (managed properties) 209 kWh/m2 Reduce by 3% to 203 kWh/m2 Energy consumption (head office) 220 kWh/m2 160 kWh/m2 Environmental certification of managed properties 6 -50% certified 1 Project to calculate present value of Storebrand’s corporate responsibility work. 2 Project to identify proportion of investments that contribute substantially to sustainable development. 3 As per 31 December 2010, Storebrand had committed NOK 198 million to microfinancing investments, NOK 149 million of which has been invested. 4 Measures employee awareness, proportion of employees who complete e-learning course (every third year), proportion who participate in dilemma training and proportion of managers who have reported on compliance with the code of ethics. 5 Target is for 2011. 6 Certification of Norwegian properties according to the Norwegian environmental standard “Miljøfyrtårn”. Corporate responsibility action plan The aim of the action plan is to help us achieve our ambition to be a corporate responsibility leader in the Nordic region and a world leader in responsible investment. Setting specific targets for the next 2-year period shows our stakeholders what areas we consider most important and give us goals to aim for in our day-to-day work. The action plan has been developed in close dialogue with key personnel in various parts of the Group The indicators and targets have been carefully selected in consultation with various expert groups in the Group and the measures to achieve the targets can be found in the scorecards and actions plans for business units. The action plan is considered and approved by Storebrand’s Board and the targets are followed up in the company’s various expert groups. 148 annual report storebrand asa Storebrand Group Companies Reg. org. number Interest Storebrand ASA 916 300 484 Storebrand Livsforsikring AS 958 995 369 100.0% Storebrand Holding AB 100.0% SPP Fonder AB 100.0% SPP Livförsäkring AB 100.0% SPP Liv Pensionstjänst AB 100.0% SPP Fastigheter AB 100.0% SPP Liv Fondförsäkring AB 100.0% Benco Insurance Holding BV 1 90.0% SPP Varumärkes AB 100.0% SPP Kundcenter AB 100.0% Storebrand Eiendom AS 972 415 731 100.0% Storebrand Pensjonstjenester AS 931 936 492 100.0% Aktuar Systemer AS 968 345 540 100.0% Storebrand Eiendom Holding AS 989 976 265 100.0% Storebrand Kontor Oslo Sentrum AS 990 653 267 100.0% Storebrand Kjøpesenter Holding AS 876 734 702 100.0% Storebrand Eiendom Norge AS 990 653 402 100.0% Storebrand Hjemmel AS 990 653 194 100.0% Storebrand Eiendom Indirekte AS 992 183 489 100.0% Storebrand Eiendom Invest AS 995 250 543 100.0% Storebrand Eiendomsfond Invest AS 995 871 424 100.0% Storebrand Finansiell Rådgivning AS 989 150 200 100.0% AS Værdalsbruket 2 920 082 165 74.9% Norsk Pensjon AS 890 050 212 25.0% SIA Foran Real Estate 3 90.1% Storebrand Baltic UAB 50.0% Evoco UAB 50.0% Storebrand Realinvesteringer AS 995 237 954 100.0% Storebrand Livsforsikring Direct Investment Ltd. 2006-2008 994 193 066 100.0% Storebrand Livsforsikring Vintage 1999 Ltd. 990 587 086 100.0% Storebrand Livsforsikring Vintage 2001 Ltd. 995 574 683 100.0% Storebrand Bank ASA 953 299 216 100.0% Storebrand Boligkreditt AS 990 645 515 100.0% Storebrand Eiendomskreditt AS 991 853 634 100.0% Filipstad Tomteselskap AS 984 133 561 100.0% Ring Eiendomsmegling AS 987 227 575 100.0% Seilduksgaten 25-31 AS 976 698 983 50.0% Storebrand Baltic UAB 50.0% Hadrian Eiendom AS 976 145 364 90.9% Hadrian Utvikling AS 975 794 784 96.1% Bjørndalen Panorama AS 991 742 565 100.0% Storebrand Fondene AS 930 208 868 100.0% Storebrand Luxembourg S.A. 99.8% Storebrand Kapitalforvaltning AS 984 331 339 100.0% Storebrand Alternative Investments AB 100.0% Storebrand Skadeforsikring AS 930 553 506 100.0% Oslo Reinsurance Company (UK) Ltd. 4 100.0% Storebrand Helseforsikring AS 980 126 196 50.0% Storebrand Leieforvaltning AS 911 236 184 100.0% 1 SPP Livförsäkring AB owns 81.1 per cent and Storebrand Livsforsikring AS owns 8.9 per cent of Benco Insurance Holding BV. 2 Storebrand ASA owns 25.1 per cent and the total stake in Storebrand is 100 per cent of AS Værdalsbruket. 3 SPP Livförsäkring AB owns 27.9 per cent and Storebrand Life Insurance owns 62.2 per cent of SIA Front Real Estate. 4 Storebrand has concluded an agreement concerning the sale of the company.
