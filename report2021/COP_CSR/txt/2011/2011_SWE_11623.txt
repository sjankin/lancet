We are firmly grounded in Roslagen – a savings bank cannot move – which is why the future of our bank is depending on the region to keep growing. At the same time, economizing is a core concept for a savings bank, and to us that is not only about saving money, but also saving our natural resources. That is why our bank works for a long-term sustainable development; ecologically, economically and socially.

The GRI Guidelines (including reporting principles for materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness and sustainability context) has been used for defining the contents of this report. Our intention has been to create a comprehensive report describing the most important economical, ecological and social areas of responsibility for our business operations. Sustainable development To Roslagens Sparbank, sustainability has to be economical, ecological and social. There is a strong connection between these concepts and our vision of an attractive, open and growing Roslagen, and they are also part of our strategic priorities. There is a natural connection to the origin of the savings bank, where economizing – with money as well as other resources – has always been a carrying concept.

Sustainability Report 2010 What Sustainability means to us 7 Economically Roslagens Sparbank’s financial management is regulated by a Risk Policy, a Policy for Internal Management with accompanying guidelines and other documents. These are the main tools for our bank’s Board of Directors to secure the quality of the operations from a client and stakeholder perspective. As a local bank we consider ourselves to be a catalyst for companies and households in the local community, by contributing to a well-developed financial infrastructure. The primary goal is to create conditions for and support a productive business climate and to promote sound household finances for our clients. In a savings bank the finances of the bank also benefit the savers and the members of the community at large, since the bank is “owned” by them.

Sustainability Report 2010 Economically 9 Ecologically Roslagens Sparbank’s success factors include economically, ecologically and socially sustainable growth. In order to strengthen the sustainability work in our business operations, our Board of Directors has laid down the following policies and guidelines with accompanying instructions. Being mostly office based, the nature of the operations makes the banks direct environmental impact relatively small. The environmental impact of banking is instead mostly indirect, via clients, businesses and suppliers. We are a local savings bank and thus a central actor in the community. That enables us to influence the environmental awareness and work of our stakeholders. Perhaps the most important activity, apart from affecting attitudes and knowledge through information, and activities such as Världsmiljödagen and Earth Hour, is increasing the use of cards and Internet banking services. That way we can reduce the environmental impact of both cash handling (involves a lot of transportation, among other things) and clients travelling to and from the offices.
