These include: the implementation guidance on the UN Global Compact, the UN Global Compact‘s Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership, and the SASAC‘s Guiding Opinions on Performance of Social Responsibility by Central Enterprises and Study on the Promotion of Corporate Social Responsibility, etc. Sextuple Framework of Corporate Social Responsibility I. Responsibility Strategies COSCO Group‘s mission is ―gr adually establishing and developing a leading position in the fields of shipping, logistics and ship building and maintenance, fostering honest relationships with customers, employees and partners, and rewarding the shareholders, environment and society to the highest extent possible. The Group‘s core values are ― global development and harmonious win-win.‖ Its development objectives include: human-oriented, market-driven, science and technology-powered, and profitability-centered development, fulfillment of responsibility as a corporate citizen, insisting upon both production operation and capital operation, contributing to the international shipping industry, expanding the logistics and port businesses, developing the ship building and maintenance businesses, exploring the resource and energy businesses, promoting the transformation from a comprehensive shipping company to a comprehensive development company and leading logistics provider, from a transnational operator to a transnational corporation and global company, building a harmonious COSCO, a centenary COSCO and materializing fast, sound and sustainability. Based on the above mission, values and development objectives, COSCO Group has formulated its social responsibility strategies, set its long, medium and short-term goals for sustainability from a strategic perspective, and divided the goals into its Five-Year plan and annual planning so as to ensure the 87/326 materialization of its sustainability goals. Starting from 2008, COSCO Group used the six sigma strategy map to analyze its development strategies, so as to ensure its realization in the medium and long term. A strategy map is an effective tool to transform corporate development strategies into actual practices. It is an innovation in corporate management in the new era. The strategy map is centered round a Balanced Scorecard of four perspectives, namely, Financial, Customer, Internal Business Processes, Learning & Growth. It is a diagram drawn after analyzing the interrelation among the four perspectives to show the causal relations in a company. The key contents of the strategy map include: the company utilizes its intangible assets, i.e. human resources, information and structural resources to innovate and establish its strategic advantages and efficiency (internal flow), and then provides the market (customers) with specific values, and finally realizes the value (financial) of the shareholders. COSCO Group‘s domestic and overseas subsidiaries have incorporated the Global Compact and social responsibility into their strategic planning and implemented the work in their daily operation. COSCO Group has been constantly improving the basic strategic model for its sustainability environment. It endeavors to protect and strengthen its existing businesses, minimize the risks involved in existing commercial activities, make full use of investment in sustainability, and establish ecological efficiency strategic transformation based on its sustainability advantages in existing commercial activities.

By reducing its risks and costs while increasing and cultivating new growth platforms, COSCO Group has increased its environmental value and commercial value to the largest extent. 88/326 Based on the international assessment standards for corporate sustainability strategic management, COSCO Group formulated six levels for its sustainability strategies: (1) conformity; (2) understanding basic requirements and taking relevant actions; (3) effectively implementing the sustainability system and benefiting from it; (4) thinking with the sustainability strategies, combining sustainability with internal operation; (5) pursuing innovation and excellence in sustainability; and (6) truly realizing sustainability. Starting 2006, DNV began to grade COSCO Group according to this standard. At that time, most international enterprises were graded between level (1) and (2), and only a few outstanding transnational enterprises were graded between level (3) and (4). In 2006, COSCO Group‘s sustainability strategy was graded level 2.5. In 2007, COSCO Group carefully studied and compared the requirements of level 3 and level 4, identified the most important indicators and formulated objectives accordingly, and finally entered the third level of sustainability. In 2008, COSCO Group established the strategies for corporate sustainability—that is, establish strategic management to improve core competitiveness over the next three years, and gradually strive towards the fourth level of sustainability. In 2011, COSCO Group identified a higher objective for social responsibility, and will work hard to achieve the fifth level of sustainability. (I) Responsibility Model COSCO Group has established a model for social responsibility, i.e. liner model. 89/326 Model structure: COSCO Group is like a huge vessel formed by different stakeholders.

Model analysis: Guided by its mission, values and development objectives, and led by the senior management teams, the huge vessel of COSCO Group is forging ahead at full speed. Thanks to effective labor division, scientific allocation of all resources, clear objectives and policies, the ship is guaranteed safe and efficient sailing.

In July 2010, to further promote the development of its legal system and to ensure the realization of the three-year goals, the COSCO Group headquarters issued a notice on how it should carry out its third year of legal work during the new three-year period. The notice provided both overall arrangements and specific requirements. Based on its current conditions, it made corresponding changes. It added 10 more companies to its list of key subsidiary companies that need to report to SASAC; it required all subsidiary companies with a legal system of their own to further improve the system; it also asked other qualified secondand third-level subsidiary companies to set up and implement a general legal counsel system. In 2010, a total number of 11 subsidiary companies established their general legal counsel system, thus greatly accelerating the promotion of legal work. II. Legal Information System Construction In a bid to make sure that the enterprise is managed in accordance with laws and regulations, and to fully integrate the existing COSCO Group legal information and human resources, COSCO Group headquarters, having set a general legal counsel post, developed and built up a legal information system as the platform for resources sharing and business exchanges in 2007. In 2010, COSCO Group adjusted its legal information system in 8 aspects so as to get rid of the constraints 138/326 the organizational structure, personnel and workflow impose on the application of the legal information system. The adjustments include: reconstructing and upgrading the webpage, providing timely updates on key legal information, adding the latest business contract templates and opening an online Q&A section. The improved system is now very timely and has high applicability, laying the foundation for a wider application of legal information during the next phase. III. Participation in Major Projects and Contract Management Adhering to the principle of ―pr evention first, control second‖, the legal managerial personnel of COSCO Group participated in the whole process of the major capital operation projects. They undertook the project lawyer‘s selection and employment, signed the non-disclosure agreement and authorization files, provided legal advice, and participated in the contract negotiation as well as the legal review of the contracts. They also participated in the business group‘s work of the enterprise‘s annuity program, such as giving advice on the legal issues in the program, examining related legal documents, joining the inspections, tending and bidding of business institutions, and the following negotiations and paper signing as well, so that the legal risks of major projects had been reduced effectively. In 2010, the major capital projects the legal affairs office of COSCO Group headquarters was mainly involved in include: Project U, Project F6, China Cargo reorganization project, Anhui Ocean Shipping Company free transfer project and Hunan Ocean Shipping Company free transfer project. Strictly following the provisions on contract management and procedures issued by COSCO Group, the contracts and agreements signed and examined by the headquarter and COSCO Group were examined legally, ensuring that the contract, while keeping both parties‘ rights and interests in 139/326 balance, could safeguard its rights and interests to the greatest extent, reduce and defuse the possible risks. In 2010, COSCO Group legal affairs office reviewed and stamped COSCO Group contract seal on 54 contracts, and reviewed and stamped COSCO Group‘s contract seal on 35 contracts. No disputes or problems occurred during the carrying-out of new contracts and contract risks were effectively avoided. IV. Legal Training 2010 is the last year for the implementation of the fifth five-year plan of law popularization and is also the year to review past achievements in law popularization. Following the requirements of SASAC office of law popularization, COSCO Group formulated and issued a review scheme on COSCO Group‘s law popularization work during the past 5 years. A comprehensive summarization of the Group‘s legal work during the fifth five-year plan of law popularization was completed and timely reported to SASAC. Since the beginning of fifth five-year plan in 2006 COSCO Group has organized many legal trainings and has made real efforts to strengthen the corporate legal system. As a result, the legal awareness of the Group‘s managerial staff and employees has been significantly increased and the level of managing the Group according to the laws has been greatly improved. COSCO Group also compiled a Q&A brochure about and organized promotion activities for Law on Guarding State Secrets. It also organized relevant events on the 12.4 Legal Publicity Day and actively trained its legal staff on maritime shipping legal affairs and general legal affairs. Its legal staffs were also active participants in special legal training sessions organized by SASAC, the International Chamber of Commerce, Association of Corporate Counsel and other relevant agencies and organizations with the purpose of further improving their legal ability. Part VI Management of Sustainability Information Management Platform I. Informationization of Corporate Social Responsibility Global Compact and social responsibility not only lead to changes in global thinking and values, but also make up a new concept of corporate management. Through fulfilling social responsibilities, enterprises can be led to discover the best business practices, change their business models, improve their level of management when faced with major global challenges, and achieve higher performance levels of sustainability. In 2010, SASAC required enterprises directly under the central government to fulfill their corporate social responsibilities by focusing on the following 8 aspects: education, organization, planning, responsibility, key points, report releases, experience sharing and building one‘s own characteristics. Enterprises should prioritize the fulfillment of social responsibilities, further improve their social responsibility management system, further integrate social responsibility into their business management, and further improve their social responsibility communication system. COSCO Group has been included in the COP notable program of Global Compact for 4 consecutive 140/326 years. With a profound understanding of UN Global Compact‘s Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership for the next decade, and with reference to ISO 26000 Guidance on Social Responsibility, the Group has completed the sorting and integration of the framework and indicators of its 2010 Sustainability Report, consolidating the foundation for the compilation of the report. In short, COSCO Group made full use of information advantage and combined management work of sustainability with information technology on the basis of deep understanding of corporate social responsibility. After 3 years of constant practice and improvement, the Group has gradually achieved the normal management of COSCO Group Sustainability Report process, established a multi-dimensional indicator system and report database. With the help of information system, the Group not only simplified preparation so as to improve efficiency, but also improved the management level of corporate social responsibility. In 2010, COSCO Group continued its cooperation with the Global Compact China Network Center, and Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Together, they discussed the dimension and scope of corporate social responsibility report, and completed the framework and indicator system of COSCO Group‘s 2010 sustainability development report by using the Sustainability Information Management System. A database with 793 indicators was set up; each indicator can be automatically aggregated, and different indicators can be settled through statistical models, thus enhancing the rigor of the data in the report. 141/326 Core procedures of COSCO Group’s Sustainability Information Management System Indicator data reporting interface in COSCO Group’s Sustainability Information Management System COSCO Group‘s Sustainability Information Management System is the first successful application of modern information technology in the Global Compact and sustainability management in China. The use of information technology not only increases the implementation efficiency of the system but also significantly improves all employees‘ awareness of social responsibilities, thus putting sustainability into real effect. II. Promotion and Cooperation of Sustainability Information System COSCO Group sustainability information system can provide service for more organizations to fulfill their global compact and social responsibility work and effectively improve the management level of sustainability of enterprises. So the headquarter of an organization will have access to collective management of the subsidiaries‘ indicators related to sustainability through information platform to promote information transparency in internal and external organization. Therefore, it can inquire, calculate and analyze the overall operation of the corporation from different aspects and levels. It can manage the process of preparing the Sustainability Report in a highly efficient and sound process, enabling enterprises to timely and accurately present their contributions to the Global Compact and social responsibilities. COSCO Group‘s rich experience and scientific management methods in fulfilling social responsibility can help other large and medium-sized enterprises at home and abroad in promoting corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Based on the success of the Sustainability Information Management System, we will continue our innovation efforts and expand our areas of services so as to provide technological support for more organizations and enterprises that aim to fulfill the Global Compact and social responsibilities. As large state-owned enterprises affiliated under SASAC, COSCO Group and China National 142/326 Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) share corporate similarities and can learn from each other on many levels, including business management model. In view of this, the two sides have entered into collaboration—COSCO Network (Beijing) Co., a subsidiary of COSCO Group, successfully customized and transplanted sustainability information management system for CNOOC, which has been in use for one year. Currently the system is helping CNOOC in compiling its annual report for the year 2010. The transfer of the corporate social responsibility information management model from COSCO to CNOOC was the first of its kind. It further deepens the close ties between the two companies and provides a good opportunity for the spread of the concept of corporate social responsibility management in the whole society. Part VII Implementation of S ASAC’s social responsibility requirements I. Actively responding to the call of SASAC and playing an exemplary role in fulfilling social responsibility At the working conference on social responsibilities of enterprises directly under the central government in 2009, SASAC put forward 8 specific tasks: Tasks Content Enhance corporate social responsibility education, build the concept Focus on education of corporate social responsibility, and improve awareness of corporate social responsibility Set up a top-bottom social responsibility system, specify the Focus on organization respective social responsibilities of all departments and subsidiary companies, and promote social responsibility in an all round way Formulate a social responsibility plan that suits the development Focus on planning strategy of the company, and specify objectives for the next 3 or 5 years or even longer term Focus on responsibilities Assign responsibilities, including decision-making responsibility, 143/326 mid-level management responsibility, major departmental responsibility and responsibilities for various functional organizations Ascertain the key points in the company‘s social responsibility work Focus on the key points based on the features of the industry that the company is in, the company‘s development strategy and its field of business Regularly release social responsibility report or sustainable report, Focus on report releases improve the quality of reports, and enhance communication with the society Use various ways to share experiences with others so as to draw on Focus on experience sharing each other's merits and raise the level together Focus on building one‘s own Explore effective ways to highlight the company‘s own characteristics characteristics based on the features of the industry that the company is in In its next five-year plan, COSCO Group would make more efforts to improve its sustainability strategies and basic environmental strategies, protecting and consolidating existing businesses, minimizing the risks of existing commercial activities with bio-dependent strategies and giving full play to the investment in sustainability. In existing commercial activities, a sustainable strategy prioritizing ecological efficiency was established and sustainability was taken as a core driving force for growth which incorporated and exceeded all existing eco-growth strategies in commercial activities. Furthermore, the Group conducted active researches and studies on vessel energy, developed renewable energy to build genuinely green shipping, and made efforts to build low-carbon economy and trace carbon footprint. By using its powerful information system, all the indicators and information were collected and analyzed, and efficiency management, risk management and strategic policy were implemented. A common sustainability management information system for central enterprise was established, and a long-term social responsibility and sustainability mechanism was set up and improved, which set a good example to other companies in the fulfillment of social responsibility. II. Taking part in SASAC’s Mechanism Research for Promoting Social Responsibilities of Enterprises Directly under the Central Government COSCO Group was actively involved in the compilation of SASAC‘s Mechanism Research for Promoting Social Responsibilities of Enterprises Directly under the Central Government. According to SASAC, the report on promotion mechanism of Corporate Social Responsibilities issued by COSCO Group offers good guidance for all types of enterprises in orderly, gradually, and scientifically promoting their performance of social responsibilities. More specifically, the report has both theoretical and practical significance: to help the leading enterprises that actively fulfill social responsibilities and release social responsibility report/Sustainability Report to further improve their social responsibility management system, to help enterprises that are just starting to fulfill their social responsibilities and release social responsibility report to further enhance their management level and to catch up, and to help those enterprises that want to fulfill their social responsibilities and 144/326 want to release social responsibility report to establish a social responsibility management system and be on the right track. III. Taking part in the compilation of SASAC’s Guidelines for Social Responsibilities of Enterprises Directly under the Central Government COSCO Group actively participated in the compilation of SASAC‘s Guidelines for Social Responsibilities of Enterprises Directly under the Central Government. The Guidelines comply with international and domestic corporate social responsibility trends and reflect the various stakeholders‘ requirements and expectations for enterprises directly under the central government to perform their social responsibilities. According to the Guidelines, to fulfill corporate social responsibilities, an enterprise must voluntarily abide by relevant laws and regulations, social norms and business ethics; while in the pursuit of economic efficiency, it should also shoulder the responsibility for shareholders, employees, consumers, suppliers, communities and the natural environment so as to achieve comprehensive, coordinated and sustainability between the enterprise, the society, and the environment. The Guidelines ask enterprises directly under the central government to enhance their sense of social responsibility, to actively fulfill their social responsibilities, to be examples of honest business, integrity, resource conservation, environmental protection, people-orientedness and harmony, and to become pillars of national economy and models for all enterprises. IV. Participating in SASAC social responsibility working conference and annual work conference Upon invitation, China COSCO representatives gave a special presentation about its sustainability management system at the social responsibility work training for enterprises directly under the central government organized by SASAC. At the conference, more than 100 questions were raised and discussed by business representatives; leaders from SASAC made a concluding speech and suggested next steps to take. The social responsibility work training is the central theme of SASAC's first social responsibility annual conference for enterprises directly under the central government. The goal of the training is to establish a platform for companies to review and plan their corporate social responsibility work, to share ideas on social responsibility systems and to promote friendship among peers. SASAC had specified the content of corporate social responsibility system: We spread a noble idea, we advocate a new way of working, and we have passion to go beyond the normal work. COSCO Group‘s presentation about its sustainability management system at the conference received favorable comments from SASAC and relevant experts. Representatives from other enterprises directly under the central government were really excited at what they heard and agreed that COSCO Group is a world-class enterprise with best practices in social responsibility and points the direction for future development of corporate social responsibility. 145/326 Part VIII Comprehensively Performing Global Compact Since 2004, COSCO responded to the ten principles regarding social responsibilities put forward by Former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Atta Annan, namely Global Compact, became the pilot project of United Nations Global Compact in China and implemented the Global Compact in China. As a pioneer in performing of Global Compact, COSCO Group has taken actions actively to support new Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to inherit and innovative on the global initiative that pursues for fairness, justice and harmony, and has tried to fulfill the Millennium Development Goals and coped with the common challenges of the world.

Some provinces limited the use of electricity one after another, thus failing to meet the heating and social production demands of the public. China COSCO responded to the State Council‘s appeal on ―en suring people‘s life and operation‖ and ―p reventing and reducing the losses caused by disastrous weathers‖, and dispatched all 25 self-owned vessels (totaling 1.215 million DWTs) of Shenzhen Ocean Shipping Co., Ltd, its coastal transportation fleet, to coal and power transportation. Since November 2009 to early 2010, COSCO Shenzhen completed 74 voyages for coal and power transportation, with a total of 3.21 million tons of coals transported, making active contribution to alleviation of intensified coal supplies in South China. (II) Influences of Climate Changes The global environment issues caused by climate changes have gradually raised concerns of all circles of the world. In particular, the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference held in December 193/326 2009 brought focuses of the world to environmental and economic issues caused by climate changes. With the opening of carbon emission trading, the influences of climate changes on financial performance of the company become more and more significant. For COSCO Group, climate changes brought following safety risks and financial risks: 1. Risks Caused by Climate Changes Climate changes affected the typhoon occurrence period, moving path and intensity changes. These, in addition with increase of weathers with poor visibility, threaten shipping safety of COSCO Group's ships in various sea areas. Increase of typhoons and bad weathers with poor visibility need more labors and materials from the bank to guide safe shipping of vessels. In the meantime, as anti-typhoons and bad visibility affect the arrangements in and out the port, increase shipping time of vessels and non-productive berthing time at port. The international community and port countries had formulated new conventions, rules and regulations to tackle with the influences of climate changes, bringing new financial risks to COSCO Group. 2. Financial Influences of Climate Changes In order to prevent and fight against the possible damages caused by typhoons, COSCO Group input more human resources and materials into the organization establishment, shore-based shifts, command and coordination. Typhoons also led to the increase in the sailing time and distance as well as the delay in the schedules. In 2010, a total of 87 tropical cyclones (including TD) were generated worldwide, effecting 433 ships (times) of COSCO Group, up 26.6% from 342 ships (times) in 2009. Restricted by poor visibility, many ports have taken entry and departure prohibition measures protect ship security during berthing at the port. This resulted in increase of non-productive berthing time of COSCO Group‘s fleet at Hong Kong. In order to alleviate global environmental pressure, reduce emissions and energy consumption, and in advocacy of Chinese government‘s appeal for energy conservation and emission reduction, COSCO Group has invested material and financial resources to enhance R&D of emission reduction technologies and improvement of related equipment and facilities, so as to save energy consumption and reduce emissions. It also invested capitals to establish management systems of operational quality, environment and occupational health & safety, and opened safety and environment web and occupational health & safety web. Moreover, it has established effective training mechanism to carry out science popularization and operational skill trainings, so as to enhance the environment consciousness and management ability of employees and increase additional costs. Since 2005, COSCO Group has invested RMB504.7823 million to reduce emissions by applying 194/326 electronic control device cylinder petrol supply system, installing homogeneous fuel equipment on vessel engines, installing waterway guide cover, airscrew clipper, Shipaneng oil-saving devices on vessels. In order to cope with climate changes, the international community had revised the international conventions, resulting in increase of management costs and equipment expenses of COSCO Group. In 2010, COSCO Group adopted 110,475 tons of low-Sulphur fuel with the sulphur content of 1.5%m/m in a bid to satisfy the requirements of MARPOL Appendix VI and reduce emission of ships. This resulted in increase of costs by RMB28.48 million and decrease of sulfur dioxide emissions by 5,648 tons. COSCO Group has responded to preventative measures taken by port countries and coastal countries to deal with climate changes, resulting in increase of its operating costs. For instance, COSCO Group has actively responded to the Green Ship Flag advocated by California in US, requiring ships to reduce the speed in advance before sailing into or departing from the ports. COSCO Group's ships sail into and depart from ports at a speed lower than 12 nautical miles per hour and use the light oil-based fuels with less sulfur content instead of heavy oil in a bid to alleviate air pollution. As the price of the light oil is 1.8 times of heavy oil, COSCO Group has to pay more when buying light oil-based fuels for ships. In order to meet the requirements that sulfur content of fuels used by vessels arriving at EU ports shall be no higher than 0.1%, all shipping companies affiliated to COSCO Group have rebuild equipment on their s hips and used low-sulfur fuels, resulting in increase of costs correspondingly.

It has taken the environmental safety and environmental protection as an important part in its business operation, and carried out energy conservation and emission reduction projects in a comprehensive manner. It has determined the key industries (shipping, ship-building/ship-repairing and logistics), key ships (container ship, asphalt carrier, bulk chemical carrier and LPG ship), key equipment (ship main engine, ship auxiliary engine and boiler) and key enterprises (shipping companies whose energy consumption accounts for more than 98% of the total energy consumption of the group) and priorities of energy conservation and emission reduction work (container vessels of COSCON whose energy consumption accounts for 65% of the total) for its energy conservation and emission reduction work. (a) Energy Conservation Management COSCO Group actively implements the national guidelines and policies regarding energy conservation and emission reduction, insists on reducing the costs and increasing the efficiency and tries to reduce energy consumption by widely applying lean management approaches to carry out energy-conservation activities. COSCO Group has set up the Leading Group for Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Work with Capt. Wei Jiafu as the president, and with general manager of related departments and second-tier companies as the members. All second-tier companies of COSCO Group have established leading groups for energy conservation and emission 212/326 reduction work with main responsible persons as the heads, and with deputy general managers in charge of safety production as the deputy heads. Moreover, they also established environmental protection and energy conservation departments, energy conservation offices and other institutes in charge of energy conservation and emission reduction work based on shipping management and features of land-based industries to implement responsibility system and formulate liaison system for work of related departments. To fulfill its commitment to the society in performing Global Compact, COSCO Group actively builds up an environmental and ocean protection, resource saving and environment-friendly enterprises and promotes its sustainability, so as to reduce oil consumption and emission reduction, fulfills its energy conservation and emission reduction responsibility and mobilize all its staff. Since 2008 when it called upon all units to promote energy conservation and emission reduction, COSCO Group and its affiliated companies have promoted energy conservation work continuously and tried to realize energy conservation through management. ▲COSCON widely applies scientific manners to carry out lean management on vessel fuel, and established various energy conservation and emission reduction activity teams to carry out energy conservation activities with cost reduction and efficiency increase and reduction of energy conservation as the objectives. In 2010, it carried out three activities, namely Enhancing Accurate Management and Reducing Fuel Consumption, Segmenting Fuel Monitoring and Deepening Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction and Reducing Energy Consumption of New Ships. All activity teams have started from management, personnel and technology to promote energy conservation and emission reduction, achieving favorable social and economic benefits and receiving high praises from Shanghai Federation of Economic Organizations and Shanghai Construction and Communications Commission. At the Exchange Conference of Pilot Work of Shanghai Energy-conservation and Emission Reduction JJ Team‖ held on July 9, 2010, COSCON was received the honorable title of Advanced Unit in Pilot Work of Shanghai Energy-conservation and Emission Reduction JJ Team by the Shanghai JJ Activity Team Guiding Committee. ▲In the Special Action for Low-carbon Traffic and Transportation of 1,000 Enterprises in Auto, Ship, Road and Port Industries organized by the Ministry of Transport in 2010, COSCON affiliated to COSCO Group won the ―Advanced U nit Award‖. (b) Fuel Consumption and Conservation In 2010, total fuel consumption of 799 vessels owned and controlled by COSCO Group reached 4.5966 million tons. Ship fuel consumption is an important energy consumption of COSCO Group. Therefore, insisting on fuel conservation of ships has significant meaning. Companies affiliated to 213/326 COSCO Group has applied lean management approach to manage the fuel consumption of ships, timely calculated ship fuel consumption, and guided ships to reduce fuel consumption. It assigned specific persons in charge of fuel consumption work, and listed the fuel consumption in the performance evaluation indicators. They have formulated relatively complete management measures and developed ship fuel consumption information management platform. By analyzing fuel consumption in ship operation process with the information system, it traced and compared the fuel and lubricant oil consumptions of various ships, so as to set up the quota for fuel and lubricant consumption of ships in a scientific and reasonable manner and effective control the fuel consumption of ships. They have started from source control, targets segmentation, enhancement of maintenance, dynamic tracing, process control and key focuses to control all sectors consuming fuels through management approaches, thus fulfilling the management of energy conservation. In 2010, all companies affiliated to COSCO Group designed and implemented slow-steaming programs, adjusted the schedule of vessels on some routes, and reduced vessel speed step by step, so as to save fuel consumption to the maximum extents. In the meantime, all companies enhanced the daily fuel management to further reduce the fuel consumption. Fuel Consumption of Various Ship Types Per 1000 Ton· S ea Mile: Indicator/Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Container vessel 9.13 8.94 8.95 8.58 8.15 8.44 7.3 Kg/1000ton·sea mile Bulk vessel 2.66 2.70 2.44 2.53 2.46 2.54 2.47 Kg/1000ton·sea mile Oil carrier 5.28 3.36 2.80 2.12 2.06 2.11 2.07 Kg/1000ton·sea mile General cargo vessel 7.14 6.88 6.65 6.23 5.74 6.46 5.63 Kg/1000ton·sea mile ▲In 2010, COSCON controlled its fuel consumption from three aspects, i.e. management, operation and technologies. It managed energy conservation measures and emphasized that shipping line coordinators are first responsible persons of energy conservation and emission reduction of ships. It established dynamic indicators for fuel oil consumption to ensure weekly update of the indicators to ensure they are more reasonable and scientific, and used data of information system to automatically connect and timely and accurately adjust the quota for oil consumption of ships. Moreover, it continued to use ―CO SCON weekly statistical table on ship fuel consumption‖, promoted the utilization of ―dai ly monitoring table for extra fuel consumption of ships above 4000 TEU‖, made full use of ―shi p coordinating system‖ and ― COSCO online fuel trading platform‖, which are organically integrated with ―CO SCON fuel monitoring system‖ to realize data sharing, so as to 214/326 accurately check the logic relations of fuel consumption, oil filling and oil storage. It also took a lead to introduce the evaluation indicator of ―dai ly oil consumption of single-TEU carrying capacity‖ to enhance the evaluation strengths. In 2009 and 2009, it lowered speed of its fleet by 10%. On this basis, it required its fleet to reduce the speed by 10% again in 2010. It continued to trace energy conservation and speed-lowering situations of ships, redefined quota for oil consumption in accordance with speed-lowering requirements, and timely adjusted the oil consumption quota based on different periods for carrying capacity input, so as to strictly control oil consumptions in different shipping stages and trace the situations of ship. With respect to technical measures, it carried out technical reform on slide valve-styled oil head of main engines of Luhe and Tianhou Series of ships, so as to ensure low-steaming of ships. (c) Lubricant Oil Consumption and Conservation In 2010, COSCO Group consumed a total of 49,500 tons of lubricant oils. The management of lubricant oil constituted a very important part in COSCO Group‘s energy conservation and emission reduction efforts. The group enhanced regular examination of lubricating oil on its vessels and ensured that all performance indicators meet the requirements. For cases where the indicators exceeded the standards, the reasons would be analyzed and corrective measures such as changing oil, adding new oil and enhancing separation adopted. Strictly managing the quota of lubricating oil, the group enhanced its examination on lubricating oil consumption based on the actual situation during each voyage. Total Lubricant Oil Consumption of COSCO Group in Recent Years Indicator/Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Total consumption of lubricant oils 45,632.20 46,739.50 46,755.75 40,068.79 44,560.49 44,908.41 49,571.46 (ton) ▲COSCO Qingdao has enhanced the management on use of ship lubricant oils, and has formulated related regulations to enhance the supplies and management of ship lubricant oils. It guided the ships to conduct sampling test on lubricant oils of equipment such as main and auxiliary engines, steering machine and anchoring machine on a regular basis to ensure that technical indicators of lubricant oils can satisfy the using demands. In case that the use of lubricant oils exceeds the standards, it timely guided related ships to find the reasons and adopt corrective measures such as enhancing the separation and adding new oil to improve the performance of lubricant oil. With respect to new ships such as Yuzhonghai Liner and Yuhuahai Liner, it traced their navigation time to find the cylinder oil consumption in running-in period of main engines, and guided the ships to adjust the cylinder oil consumption timely, thus better controlling the lubricant oil consumption of ships. ▲COSCO Hong Kong strengthened its promotional and training efforts by organizing trainings for engine officers, enhancing trainings before stepping on vessels and publishing professional articles in 215/326 internal magazines of the company, so as to enhance the energy conservation consciousness of engine officers and strengthen management of cylinder oil. The company has collected data of various ships, including workshop inspection report before shipment, oil injection criteria in instructions of main engines, types of cylinder oil injector and related management tips, statistics of cylinder oil injecting rate of main engines and statistics of wear rate of main engine cylinder liners, and formulated implementation plans in partnership with professional manufacturers based on actual situations of each ship and adjusted the ships. For instance, oil injection rate of Fu‘an Liner was gradually reduced from 340L/D to 255L/D, that of Yongtong Liner was reduced from 320L/D to 250L/D and that of Kangyuan Liner was reduced from 320L/D to 240L/D. This has greatly reduced the oil consumption while ensuring the normal operation of ship main engines. Moreover, it also promoted the work stably by introducing the successful experiences of specific ships to all ships, and enhanced the monitoring to ensure safety of equipment. The company effectively adjusted the oil injecting rate of cylinder oil of 65 ships, accounting for 58.5% of the company‘s fleet. The oil consumption rate of cylinder oil has reduced by 14.3% averagely, and the daily consumption volume has reduced by more than 2250L, saving more than 520,000 liters of cylinder oil each year.

With an aim to implement all tasks in practice, COSCO Group established strict and complete management system and formulated operational regulations for management activities such as oil residue disposal, shore-returning of garbage and sewage discharge. In the past seven years, neither oil residue pollution accidents were occurred, nor the group received any economical or non-economical penalties. All ships of COSCO Group were equipped with 15PPM monitoring devices of oil-water separator. The environmental protection facilities had kept 100% of perfection rate and 100% of stable operation rate. Companies affiliated to the group have done a good job in anti-pollution work of ships based on requirements of related ports to prevent against any pollution accidents. ▲In respect to the requirements of the Implementation Plans for ―Gree n Offshore City‖ Action Plan carried out by the Qinhuangdao Maritime Bureau, COSCO Hong Kong made special arrangements on ships arriving at Qinhuangdao Sea Area, and enhanced anti-pollution work of ships. It also put forward detailed working requirements, requiring ships to carry out and implement related laws and regulations, enhanced on-duty and inspection, strengthened inspection on conditions of equipment on ships, in particular, kept anti-pollution equipment at normal status. It also formulated strict anti-pollution rules and regulations, implemented strict on-ship oil residue emergency response plans, carried out inspections, trainings and rehearsals on on-ship oil residue emergency-response plans and requirements. It also carefully acted in and implemented the pollution reporting system and avoided any pollution leakage. ▲COSCO Shipyard (Shanghai) carried out oil leakage emergency response rehearsal to prevent against pollution and build up Green World Expo Shanghai. On April 15, COSCO Shipyard (Shanghai)‘s Baiyunshan Floating Dock and surrounding sea areas organized an oil leakage emergency response rehearsal. At 11:30 in the morning, Baiyunshan Floating Dock‘s ship-repairing dock gave out warning on oil leakage. After receiving the warning, related units took actions immediately, organized related persons to clean oil pollution on deck and floating in surrounding sea areas with various cleaning tools, and prepared various firefighting measures. After 20 minutes of emergency response operation, all oil pollutions are cleaned, and the rehearsal achieved satisfactory results. In the rehearsal, the company has changed the traditional of giving a notice before rehearsal, and carried out sudden rehearsal without any prior notice. This not only checked the emergency response ability of staff in face of accidental events, but also played an important role in promoting environmental protection work during the World Expo Shanghai. 224/326 Oil Residues Pollution Discharged to the Sea and Pollution Discharge and Shore-Returning Volume Indicator/Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Oil residues discharged 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 to the sea (ton) Ship pollution discharge and shore-returning 35,706 44,866 48,753 44,658 35,021 31,578 42,325 volume (ton) (3) Waste By strictly complying with the supplementary provisions to the MARPOL Convention, all ships operated by COSCO Group recycled and incinerated the solid wastes.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions In order to alleviate and adapt to climate changes, intervention measures shall be adopted to reduce 225/326 greenhouse gas emissions. Ships are main assets of COSCO Group. Main source of greenhouse gas emissions is fuel oil of ships. By adjusting fleet structure, increasing operation capacity of ships, optimizing design of shipping lines, reducing navigation speed, adopting matured technologies and developing new technologies, it has successfully reduced specific fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Carbon Footprint Calculation In a world where energy conservation, emission reduction and green ecology are the major themes, enterprises are endeavoring to establish an economic mode that is energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly. COSCO Group promoted scientific and technological innovation in energy conservation and emission reduction by improving energy efficiency and eliminating energy-consuming, pollution-causing production. It is the company‘s social responsibility to develop low-carbon economy and reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, the calculation of carbon footprint serves as a new token of the group‘s commitment to social responsibility and points to the way for the group‘s future development. In 2010, COSCO Group adopted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to calculate and study the carbon emissions throughout the entire life cycle of vessel transportation, especially in its ocean shipping business. Carbon footprint (carbon consumption) was studies on three stages: ship manufacturing, vessel transportation and vessel disposal. After having obtained a clear picture of the carbon emission at every link and period, the Group was able to control and reduce its carbon emissions. 3. Carbon Emission Calculator After eight months of struggling, COSCON affiliated to COSCO Group successfully completed the R&D of COSCON carbon emission calculator. It is the third shipping company in the world (the other two are Orient Overseas and Han Jin Shipping) and the first in China that can provide carbon emission calculator for global users. Its carbon emission calculator is the only one that passes DNV‘s certification. The carbon emission calculator adopts systematic and dynamic calculator approach, i.e. establishment of dynamic EEOI value based on real oil consumption and other shipping data of the company‘s fleet in recent years, so as to vividly reflect the carbon emissions of each ship at different shipping lines. In the meantime, dynamic EEOI value will help customers to reduce the deviation when calculating the carbon emissions of cargos transported, which is innovative among carbon emission calculators of existing shipping companies. Release and operation of the carbon emission calculator further promotes the energy conservation and 226/326 emission reduction management work and further elevation of the comprehensive competitiveness of the company. (Carbon emission calculator and DNV certificate) 4. The “Green Flag” Program The ―Gree n Flag‖ program is an environmental protection program initiated by the Port of Long Beach of the United States. The program requires ships entering and departing the port to lower its navigation speed to 12 sea·mile/h at the distance of 20 sea·miles to the terminal, so as to reduce exhaust emission generated in combustion. Since the implementation of the Green Flag program in 2005, COSCO Group has responded and supported the program with full strengths. On April 7, 2011, ships of COSCON met the Port of Long Beach‘s requirements on reduction of air pollution at terminals as regulated by the Long Beach Port Authority, winning the Green Flag Award from the authority for six years successively. (IV) Bio-diversity After assessing the value of ocean shipping and other operations to biological diversity in involved areas, COSCO Group decided that traditional vessel paint, ballast water and vessel pollution had the largest impact on marine bio-diversity. Therefore, COSCO Group tracked the requirements for bio-diversity in international conventions, and formulated policies to protect bio-diversity. After active research and effective implementation, non-toxic paint was used in the entire supply chain from shipbuilding to ship maintenance to protect the lives of ocean creatures. The Group also introduced and implemented plans for the treatment of ballast water to protect the living environment of marine life. In addition, international safety management regulations were strictly observed to prevent sea pollution and ensure the safety of ocean creatures. COSCO Group paid close attention to the natural resources and ecological environment in the world and made efforts to sustain bio-diversity in the ocean environment to fulfill its responsibility as a multinational company. In 2010, it continued to promote the use of energy-conservative and environment-friendly paints. It invested RMB22.44 million to painted three ships with INTERSLEEK paint. It prolonged the reparation period at docks, thus reducing the total consumption volume of paints while better protecting the marine creatures. 227/326 ▲ Ballast Water Treatment COSCO Group strictly followed the conventions and requirements of related port countries. It formulated Ship Ballast Water Management Plans for every ship, clearly defined responsibilities, formulated requirements on replacement of blast water, recorded the blast process and implemented whole-process supervision of blast water, so as to fully protect marine environment and maintain biological diversity. Based on the research and development of COSCO Group Ship Ballast Waster Physical Purification Treatment Technology, COSCO Group actively minimized the negative impact of ship ballast water to marine biological diversity and promoted marine environment and marine biological diversity protection. All the vessels operated by COSCO Group also responded actively to the initiative and incorporated bio-diversity protection into their daily operations. The Ocean Ship Ballast Waster Physical Purification Treatment Technology invested and developed by the group achieved fruitful results in pre-treatment of blast water treatment system, high-efficient disinfection technology and system automation, forming blast water treatment technology with independent intellectual property rights and establishing standard shore-based testing facilities and inspection approaches. The R&D achievement have met international advanced level, and the pre-inlet-style gas-aid, liquid-backswing filter self-clean technology and UV treated water turbidity degree self-adaptive adjustment technology have reached internationally leading level. The project passed the check and acceptance organized by the Ministry of Transport on April 26, 2010, and passed the check and acceptance of the expert team organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology on Oct. 9, 2010. A total of nine patents were formed, of which, eight are national invention patents, while one is useful new patent. (COSCO Blue Ocean Shield Blast Water Management System) (V) Environmental Protection Products and Services Over the years, COSCO Group has been actively fulfilling its behavior standards in environmental protection, endeavoring to become a ―gr een service‖ provider. In order to improve oil quality and the burning efficiency thus reducing the environmental influences of emissions of ships‘ propulsion, COSCO Group actively used the additives that have combustion-support, stabilization and energy-conservation functions on fuels. COSCO Logistics has enhanced the survey, investigation, design and preparation work during transportation processes and sought for best opportunities in terms of time, equipment and operation to reduce the influence on neighboring residents as much as possible. In terms of ship-building and ship-repairing, related companies actively controlled the environment-influencing factors such as 228/326 emission, dust and noise, building a harmonious production and living environment as well as a coordinated community environment. NACKS affiliated to COSCO Shipyard has paid close attentions to factors such as noise of factory area that may influence the environment. In 2010, it conducted environmental protection inspections on Lingjin Workshop Reconstruction Project, Project to Replace Natural Gas with Ethyne, Technological Building Project and Wood Model Workshop Project. It carried out noise monitoring and environmental protection inspection before opening of new workshops. Moreover, it also conducted noise reduction on main noises, monitored specific noises (night monitoring), and inspected on the noise control status of the workshop. In 2010, it conducted 13 times noise monitoring and inspection within the company, with favorable results achieved and no disputes with communities due to noises. ▲ Ship Decommissioning Policies COSCO Group is very concerned about the disposal of vessels, which are the major service tools in ocean shipping, after they are decommissioned. In 2010, COSCO Group continued to implement related requirements of the Ministry of Communications to put the ships reaching the decommissioning age out of commission. In the meantime, ships not reaching the decommissioning age, but were in a poor state and were considered as not suitable to ocean shipping were also put out of commission. The decommissioned ships of COSCO Group were sold in two ways, i.e. operational ships and waste steel ships, which were sold to shipping companies with operational qualifications and to qualified ship scrapping companies respectively, so as to avoid the environmental influences. For ships sold to qualified ship scrapping companies, COSCO Group required the scrapping companies to made commitment on the contract in terms of qualifications, establishment and operation of environment management systems and main purposes after scrapping, ensuring the scrapping of ships the premise of environmental protection and thus reducing the impacts to the environment to minimum extents.
