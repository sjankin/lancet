Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information About this Report This Annual Report provides an overview of the activities of the Capital Group of Grupa LOTOS S.A. (“the LOTOS Group” or “the Group”), with a particular focus on the LOTOS Group’s parent company – Grupa LOTOS S.A. (“Grupa LOTOS”, “the Company” or “we”). Grupa LOTOS is a leading industrial company and Poland’s second largest oil major. In 2010, our share in the domestic fuel market exceeded 31%. Moreover, as the only Polish company – through our subsidiary LOTOS Petrobaltic, – we are directly engaged in exploration and production operations on the Baltic Sea. The processing of crude oil at our refinery in Gdańsk is based on state-of-the-art technologies, designed to mitigate the environmental impact of industrial processes. The LOTOS Group employs more that 5,000 staff, ranking it as the largest employer in Pomerania and an important one in southern regions of Poland, where many of the LOTOS Group’s companies hold shares. This Report is being released in what is a momentous time for Grupa LOTOS. In 2010, a strategically important stage in our development, involving primarily the implementation of the 10+ Programme launched in 2006, finally drew to a close. The year 2011 opens up new development prospects for our Company, which have been defined in our business strategy for 2011–2015 (adopted in November 2010) and development directions until 2020. This is a fitting time to recapitulate but also the right moment to lay out plans for the future and make a mature entry into another decade of growth, worthy of the 21st century. The first decade of the new century, whose end was marked by the completion of the 10+ Programme, was a period of unprecedented expansion of the LOTOS Group. A period when – despite an extremely challenging business climate as well as the worldwide economic slowdown and recession – we managed to achieve nearly all of our strategic objectives. The success was rooted in the resolve, commitment and responsibility of the Company’s Management Board, its management staff and all employees of the LOTOS Group. Responsible pursuit of clearly defined objectives involving all human resources is also the course to be followed in the next decade covered by the LOTOS Group’s new development strategy. The strategy whose goal is to develop into a strong, modern, vertically integrated oil conglomerate, relying on its own sources of feedstock, optimum processing capacities using cutting-edge technologies, as well as into a competitive trading organisation with a prominent market position. The LOTOS Group is determined to implement this vision – as it did implement the strategy for the previous period – adhering to the principles of sustainability and social responsibility. One of our corporate priorities is to use economic, social and environmental resources in such a manner as to preserve them for generations to come. Also high on our agenda are corporate transparency and openness, based on which we communicate with the outside world and with all stakeholder groups – including our employees, shareholders and investors. These principles form the basis for building the LOTOS brand, fostering its credibility and reputation, as well as the confidence it inspires. This approach has been delivering tangible benefits by reinforcing our market position and adding to its value. Grupa LOTOS was named winner of the Investor Relations category in the Listed Company of the Year 2010 ranking, while its shares were once again included in the prestigious stock index RESPECT, which includes companies whose commitment to CSR, and adherence to corporate governance standards and best practices are rated as the best. Economy, society and the environment – we view all these spheres as equally important and mutually complementary. This approach has found its reflection in this Report, with which we continue the inclusive reporting model adopted with the publication of last year’s report – the first integrated annual report to have been released by a Polish company, honoured with the CSR Reports 2010 award for successful integration of the Company’s social and environmental performance into its reporting framework. This comprehensive approach to stakeholder communication gives all those with whom we interact a full picture of our operations – not only in their economic aspects, but also in the social and environmental dimension. In reporting the latter areas, the Company applies the international standards codified in the Sustainability Reporting Framework of the Global Reporting Initiative (G3 GRI) as well as the UN Global Compact’s Principles derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. In preparing its consolidated financial and non-financial statements, Grupa LOTOS embraces the principles of accuracy, materiality, completeness, comparability, balance and credibility. The performance indicators contained in the consolidated financial statements are supported by a narrative part in separate sections of this Report, which outlines the vision of the Company’s development, its strategic objectives, achievements and development plans by business area. Additionally, this Report includes an index designed to facilitate search for specific performance indicators and descriptive parts relating to specific matters discussed in this Report, which is included in the Table of Content of the GRI and the Principles of the UN Global Compact. 2 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board Our human capital will serve as a basis for us achieving the objectives set out in the LOTOS Group's new strategy for the years 2011–2015. Dear All, 2010 turned out to be a much more benevolent year for the global economy than 2009. The severe financial crisis was overcome, although its symptoms may yet resurface on a larger or smaller scale. On the whole, however, the climate for business activity, also in the petroleum industry, warmed up and stabilised, which permits a brighter outlook on the external conditions for the Company's development. All the more so that for Grupa LOTOS itself last year was exceptionally successful. First of all, the Company successfully completed the 10+ Programme, on which its resources and efforts had been concentrated since 2006. The annual processing capacity was expanded to 10.5 million tonnes of crude, while the actual volumes processed in 2010 exceeded for the first time on record 8 million tonnes. Also, the Company's market position strengthened. Its share of the domestic fuel market grew to over 31%, a target planned to be achieved only in 2012. Strong year-on-year increases were also Wiesław Skwarko posted in sales revenue and operating profit, which rose by 37% and 82%, respectively. Chairman of the Supervisory Board The Company was able to reap such large financial rewards not only thanks to its coherent business strategy, pursued by the Management Board with consistency and resolve. Above all, the strong performance was a fruit of years-long efforts to build an atmosphere of trust, commitment and integration of employees around the Company's strategic objectives. Without that human capital, which Grupa LOTOS views as its most precious asset, it would have been difficult to surmount the 2009 crisis and bring the 10+ Programme to its completion in 2010. Based on its human capital, Grupa LOTOS also intends to implement the LOTOS Group's objectives set down in the new strategy for 2011–2015, along with the development directions until 2020, unveiled in November 2010. The strategy paints a vision of developing the LOTOS Group into one of Europe's most advanced oil conglomerates which relies on: its own sources of feedstock, securing production at the level of 1.2 million tonnes of crude annually, a technologically advanced base of processing facilities, allowing it to produce top quality, high-margin products, a strong sales force based on a chain of patronage and partner petrol stations, which will secure at least a 10% share of the Polish retail fuel market. As always, Grupa LOTOS' business strategy will be aligned with the principles of sustainable growth and social responsibility and fully harmonised with the Company's core values of transparency, openness, innovativeness and responsibility. In 2010, the Company closed the first historical five-year perspective of the decade of growth – if I may use the title of this Report here. 2011 opens up a new perspective of the decade – oriented towards the future and outlined in the strategy until 2015. I am deeply confident that, drawing on the Management Board's professionalism and determination, employee commitment and investor trust, the Company will be able to consistently deliver value for its shareholders, while realising its strategic development vision. Yours faithfully, Wiesław Skwarko Chairman of the Supervisory Board Grupa LOTOS S.A. 6 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Letter from the President of the Board Sustainable development and corporate social responsibility are the basic criteria underlying the LOTOS Group's activities. 2010 was a truly landmark year for the LOTOS Group for three important reasons: firstly – its wide-ranging CAPEX project (10+ Programme) was completed, secondly – our market position was markedly strengthened both in the operational and marketing areas, and thirdly – a new strategy for 2011–2015, along with development directions until 2020, was adopted. The completion of the 10+ Programme, in line with its objectives and within schedule, is for the Company, its Management Board, and for me personally, a source of enormous satisfaction. Especially that for more than a year – particularly in 2009 – our operating environment was marked by a profound financial crisis accompanied by a severe slowdown of the global economy and significantly elevated risks. We managed, however, to ward off its impact on the project implementation, with a strong dialogue-based contribution from our employees. Paweł Olechnowicz The 10+ Programme was the largest CAPEX project to have ever been undertaken by Grupa LOTOS, and one of the major President of the Board initiatives carried out at that time in the Polish industrial sector and the European refining industry. With its completion, the Chief Executive Officer Company’s processing capacities have been expanded to 10.5 million tonnes of crude – up by 75% on the start year (2006). Moreover, the depth of conversion has been significantly increased, leading to a shift in the production structure towards the highest quality products attractive in market terms (such as diesel oils and aviation fuel) which on the one hand offer particularly high margins and are more profitable whereas on the other hand their quality guarantees better parameters with regard to environmental protection. It also increases export possibilities of high-margin products into more demanding foreign markets. Their share in the product mix has risen to 10%, which has obviously been reflected in the Company’s financial performance and value. The new facilities and units installed as part of the 10+ Programme are among the most sophisticated and technologically advanced, which has a positive effect on the quality of products, while mitigating the environmental impact of our industrial processes. For the Company, which has firmly embedded the principles of sustainable growth into its strategy, the environmental benefits offered by the 10+ Programme are as important as the purely production-related gains. We remain socially responsible in every aspect of our operations. As it was nearing completion, the 10+ Programme delivered measurable and spectacular effects already in 2010. For the first time ever, the volume of crude oil processed by the Gdańsk refinery exceeded 8 million tonnes – an increment of more than 48% on a year earlier. That strong production potential allowed the Company to increase its share of the Polish fuel market from 28.3% to over 31%. In practice, it meant that the target market share envisaged for not earlier than 2012 in the LOTOS Group’s strategy, effective until the end of 2010, was achieved in the year 2010. The completion of the 10+ Programme has already substantially strengthened the Company’s competitive and market position, laying down solid foundations for its sustainable and consistent growth, based on innovation and sustainability in all dimensions: social, environmental and economic. We are now excellently placed to establish a presence as a large and modern oil company and an important player in Central Europe. Grupa LOTOS will be pursuing that objective in line with its strategy for 2011–2015, along with development directions until 2020, adopted in November 2010. Following the outlays on the operational segment, the Company’s main development efforts will now focus on the upstream and downstream segments. Grupa LOTOS will intensify work on the Baltic Sea and on the licenses acquired, or planned to be acquired, on the North Sea. With that end in mind, in 2010 we undertook equity consolidation of the upstream assets; as part of this effort, we took over full control of Lithuanian production company AB Geonafta, through our subsidiary – LOTOS Petrobaltic. The strategic goal is to produce 1.2 million tonnes of crude oil by 2015. In the downstream area, the strategic goal is to maintain the not lower than 30% share of the domestic fuel market, achieved in 2010, and to increase the share of the domestic retail market from 7% to 10%. The overarching strategic objective remains to create and maximise the Company’s shareholder value. In that context, the year 2010 was also highly successful. Sales revenue reached PLN 19.7bn – a 37% increase on the previous year, and operating profit amounted to PLN 763m, up 82% on 2009. The fact that the Company has consistently reported robust financial performance, translated from the second quarter into relatively stable prices of its shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, while the release of the new strategy triggered their strong appreciation. This attests to the market’s belief that Grupa LOTOS has sustainably staved off the threats arising from the global financial crisis, and to the investors’ confidence in our ability to successfully deliver the strategic vision – of establishing Grupa LOTOS as a strong player in the European oil industry. That confidence is highly prized by the Company, its Management Board and me personally. I am convinced that it is equally grounded in the LOTOS Group’s business achievements as in the fact that for many years the LOTOS Group’s 7 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 strategy has been aligned with the sustainability principles and based on an open dialogue with employees – especially under the unique “Let’s talk about LOTOS” programme – and with investors. The Company’s openness and transparency have gained attention and recognition. Our shares were again included in the RESPECT index, launched in 2009 by the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The LOTOS brand is also gaining strength – as evidenced by Rzeczpospolita’s ranking of the most valuable Polish brands, according to which the market value of the LOTOS brand rose 10% on the year before. I wish to note with pride and satisfaction that since 2002 the Gdańsk refinery has evolved from an operation with annual capacities of 4.5 million tonnes and a monolithic structure into a vertically integrated oil conglomerate with annual throughput capacities of 10 million tonnes, which has built an upstream segment wellplaced for international expansion. Over that time, Grupa LOTOS has posted a four-fold rise in revenues, while the LOTOS trademark has enjoyed a growing recognition in the international market. It is the pride and joy for the management personnel and all employees, as well as a source of immense satisfaction for the Management Board, that the role of the Pomerania region and Polish economy has been strengthened. The consistency, openness, transparency, and respect for the principles of sustainable growth and corporate social responsibility are the basic criteria underlying the LOTOS Group’s economic, social and environmental performance. They determine the manner and quality of corporate management, forming the foundation on which Grupa LOTOS’ value and reputation, as well as confidence in the Company, are built. This approach has yielded measurable benefits in the form of improving hard business indicators – revenues, profit and margins – as well as more difficult to capture but no less important qualitative benefits associated with the mitigation of the Company’s environmental footprint and the Company’s perception by its social partners. These synergies constitute a huge capital of Grupa LOTOS. I assure you that we intend to develop it, while working towards improving Poland’s energy security and the strength of its economy.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information “Decade of growth” an interview with Paweł Olechnowicz, President of the Board of Grupa LOTOS “Decade of growth” is the title you chose for the 2010 Annual Report of Grupa LOTOS S.A. How would you, as the Company’s President of the Board and CEO, interpret its message? I look at it from a double perspective – historical and forward-looking. The first one relates primarily to the 10+ Programme, which from 2006 to 2010 was for us the absolute priority, taking precedence over all other projects carried out by Grupa LOTOS. Since its successful implementation was to be the key foundation underpinning the Company’s long-term growth, it was the main focus of the Management Board’s attention. After all, its goal was to expand the capacities of the Gdańsk refinery by as much as 75%, construct modern facilities relying on state-of-the-art and environmentally-friendly technologies and increase the share of top quality products, commanding the highest margins, in the oil refining mix. This is the historical perspective, going five years back. The forward-looking perspective, which also spans a five-year period, relates primarily to the implementation of the strategy for 2011–2015, which was adopted in November 2010 and whose solid foundations were laid down by the completion – according to plan and schedule – of the 10+ Programme. It is a perspective of sustainable, steady, innovative and environmentally-friendly growth and expansion of a large, vertically integrated oil company, enjoying a strong competitive position in Central Europe. A company which – in addition to the production base built in the previous period – would have access to its own sources of feedstock, annual production of approximately 1.2 million tonnes of crude oil and a strong sales force ensuring at least a 10% share in the domestic fuel market. It is a simple equation: five years of consistent and rapid growth which are already behind us plus another five years during which we will work towards achieving the vision outlined in our strategy add up to the titular “decade of growth”. The successful completion of the 10+ Programme provides solid grounds for an optimistic outlook on that future-oriented vision. You were mainly referring to the business aspects of the “decade of growth”. However, the social and environmental contexts are equally important, are they not? It is understood. At Grupa LOTOS we have always attached great importance – and are determined to do so in the future – to acting in conformity with the Sustainable Development concept. Let me remind you that the term was first used in the report of the UN World Commission on Environment and Development entitled Our Common Future (1987), where it was defined as the process of meeting the development needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Accordingly: economic growth yes, but with due respect for the environment and sustainable management of natural resources. And engagement in corporate social responsibility. All business decisions made at Grupa LOTOS are reviewed against those criteria. Could you elaborate on that? First: protection of natural resources and the environment. The business of Grupa LOTOS is based on the exploitation of non-renewable resources – crude oil and natural gas. That very fact imposes on the Company certain obligations towards the environment, the most important of them being to mitigate the environmental impact of its operations. In that area, we boast a track record of considerable achievement. First of all, one of the 10+ Programme’s deliverables was a massive upgrade of the Gdańsk refinery. The plant currently operates using the most advanced technologies, guaranteeing a high level of desulphurisation of petroleum products and reduced emissions of hazardous substances and waste into the atmosphere and the immediate surroundings. Moreover, the newly installed facilities are highly energy efficient. Today the refinery deserves the name of the greenest, most environmentally-friendly refinery in the Baltic Sea region. Grupa LOTOS is engaged in a project aimed to construct a CHP plant powered with heavy residue sourced directly from the refinery. The new plant will operate in the co-generation cycle, which means it will simultaneously produce heat and electricity, which in itself will enhance energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse emissions by 30%. The use of waste from petroleum processing will in turn eliminate its negative environmental impact. The launch of the plant with a target 24 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 capacity of 250 MW, which is being constructed under a consortium agreement with the ENERGA group, is scheduled for 2014. It needs to be added that Grupa LOTOS already has its own CHP plant, whose process system enables co-generation of electricity and heat. In 2010, the Company obtained a certificate from the Energy Regulatory Office confirming the production of so-called “red” energy. As a condition of the certification, the Company had to meet a number of stringent requirements, for instance it had to prove a high degree of primary energy efficiency and a significant reduction of carbon emissions. Among other steps taken by Grupa LOTOS with a view to reducing emissions I should mention our plans to connect the refinery to a gas pipeline and use gas supplied via the pipeline (as a fuel much cleaner than coal) to power the production processes. We also have plans to recover gas currently combusted in flare units and use it as a process fuel, which will reduce the overall atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide. All that makes for a significant contribution of Grupa LOTOS into the development of a low-emission economy in Poland, in line with the guidance laid down by the Climate and Energy Package, which proposes to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 20% and to reduce total energy consumption by 20% by the year 2020. Second: quality of life of the communities in which we operate. Grupa LOTOS is the leading employer in Pomerania and an important one in the south of Poland, where several of its subsidiaries are located, including in regions in which unemployment is one of the gravest economic and social ailments. The Company, being an important part of the communities, cannot shun responsibility for its social environment. It is not so much about various charities, educational or sponsoring projects, which are either initiated or partnered with by Grupa LOTOS, but rather about social responsibility in a broader sense, related to the well-being of the communities in which we are based. This manifests itself chiefly in our indirect economic effect on a vast number of cooperating businesses, along the whole length of our complex chain of supplies. Thanks to that cooperation, they are able to maintain existing jobs and create new ones. A model example here is the 10+ Programme, which we implemented in cooperation with a large group of sub-suppliers from various parts of Poland – the number of employees of external firms engaged to work on that strategic project ran to several thousand. Looking at a lower level, that of local markets, we could point to the example of LOTOS Asfalt, which operates in the vicinity of Jasło, a town where the problem of unemployment is especially grave. Following the company’s expansion and deepening of its product mix, it was possible to create 100 new jobs. This naturally contributes to stimulating economic recovery in the regions which are often grappling with serious economic problems. Third: openness, transparency and social development. On these pillars, inherent within the concept of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility, we have for years been building trust in the Company, its credibility and reputation: among its stakeholders, in employee relations and as part of the vertical communication process. This latter dimension is of particular importance in the case of an organisation as complex as the LOTOS Group, consisting of a large number of companies, with a total of over 5,000 staff. Among the many initiatives and systemic solutions in that area, the one I would like to highlight is the internal communication programme called Let’s Talk about LOTOS”. I am deeply convinced it is one of the most notable examples of our commitment to social development, to an open dialogue with the employees. That views-sharing platform was put in place by in 2006, as part of the communication process related to the new strategy and the 10+ Programme. Having proved to be an attractive and effective communication platform, it has become a fixture in the Company’s social landscape. Within its framework, several dozen meetings are held every year, attended by a large number of employees. In 2010, at the level of the entire LOTOS Group there were 56 such “talks about LOTOS”, which were attended by 53% of all staff. The Company initiates a similar model of dialogue as it is strengthening and expanding the chain of petrol stations operating under the LOTOS brand. Our strategy in that area includes primarily the development of partner stations, managed by dealers directly interested in the achievement of the best possible economic results. Their acquisition and active involvement in the implementation of the Company's forward-looking vision, outlined in the strategy for 2011-2015, is essential for the success of Grupa LOTOS. Especially in the context of building the brand value and its perception by customers, who come into contact with the brand primarily at petrol stations. In the Annual Report for 2010 you continue the integrated approach to reporting the Company’s business, environmental and social performance, which was initiated by last year's Report. Apparently the practice, which you pioneered in Poland, has proved its merits? Absolutely. And not just because of the fact that our Annual Report for 2009, entitled Sustainable Development in the 10+ Perspective was commended in the fourth edition of the CSR Reports award, organised by the consulting firm PwC, the Responsible Business Forum and CSR Consulting. I will say immodestly that we have become accustomed to such awards, as already our Corporate Social Responsibility Report of the LOTOS Group for 2006-2007 was recognised as the best, and the next one, for 2008, received an honourable mention. Moreover, the last year's report was the first integrated report, covering both consolidated financial and non-financial statements, to be published by a Polish company – and for that very reason, it was a frontrunner. Naturally, all those awards and distinctions are immensely gratifying for the Company, its Management Board, and for me personally. However, the crucial thing is to foster confidence in Grupa LOTOS. Transparency and openness, an open disclosure policy, readiness to subject ourselves to thorough and comprehensive reviews and systematic reporting of all aspects of our operations are key to creating that atmosphere of confidence and credibility. And annual reports, integrated and prepared in accordance with the internationally accepted standards of financial and non-financial reporting – like the reports for this year and for last year – play a particularly important role in this context. The benefits of integrated reporting cannot be overestimated. It affords a wider perspective on the Company’s business, enables better identification of risks and opportunities and a more in-depth analysis of the Company’s impact on its environment, provides more comprehensive management information and enhances the process of communication with key stakeholder groups. It is also appreciated by the market and investors. The LOTOS shares were again included in the prestigious RESPECT index, launched in 2009 on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, which primarily takes into account the qualitative aspects of the operation of public companies, mainly their business ethics and social responsibility. The Company itself won the Listed Company of the Year 2010 ranking prepared by the Puls Biznesu daily, in the Investor Relations category. 25 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 The integrated approach to reporting adopted by Grupa LOTOS will certainly remain a permanent feature of its stakeholder communication process. In 2010, it was extended to include the environmental indicators for LOTOS Petrobaltic. In subsequent years, the Company wants its integrated annual reports to be increasingly more comprehensive in scope and coverage. 26 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Business strategy Our strategy calls for mitigating the negative environmental impact and valuing the intellectual capital of our employees. In 2006, the LOTOS Group formulated a development strategy, which was updated two years later. The key project envisaged in the strategy was the 10+ Programme, designed to rapidly expand the LOTOS Group’s capabilities, while significantly enhancing Poland’s energy security. In November 2010, the LOTOS Group unveiled its new development strategy for 2011–2015, along with long-term development directions until 2020. The foundation on which the new strategy rests is the successful completion in 2010 of the 10+ Programme, as a result of which the annual capacities of the Gdansk refinery have been increased to over 10 million tonnes, in reliance on state-of-the-art technologies. These advanced technologies also mitigate the negative environmental impact of the industrial processes. Having developed such a strong processing base, in its new strategy the LOTOS Group focuses on: rapid development of exploration for and production of hydrocarbons (upstream segment), improvement of sales efficiency combined with optimisation of the operating area. The main assumptions underlying the new strategy include: predictions that margins in the production sector will exceed oil processing margins in the long term, a gradual increase in fuel consumption, the need to diversify operating risks. The LOTOS Group has remained committed to its overarching strategic objective of building shareholder value through optimal use of available intellectual resources and assets and through implementation of development programmes in the area of: exploration and production, oil processing, sales. The strategy underscores the importance of developing those areas in compliance with the principles of sustainable development: striving to continuously reduce the environmental impact, while valuing the intellectual capital and experience of employees. In the exploration and production area, the LOTOS Group intends to intensify efforts aimed at expanding its resource base, so as to capture the high margins projected for this sector in the long term. The most important strategic objectives in the segment are: to increase production of hydrocarbons in line with the priorities of Poland’s energy policy until 2030, to achieve in 2015 production volumes in the range of 24 thousand boe/d (barrel of oil equivalent/day) – equivalent to 1.2 million tonnes. In the marketing area, the LOTOS Group will focus on further development of its sales force, based on the expanding distribution network and efficient product logistics, as well as rapid development of trading activities in the area of crude oil and petroleum products. The key strategic objectives in this segment are: to uphold a 30% share in the domestic fuel market, to achieve fuel sales exceeding the fuel production capacities of the Company’s refinery by 15%, to achieve a 10% share in the domestic retail market by the end of the effective term of the strategy, to develop the chain of petrol stations and enhance sales through the existing chain. 27 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 In the operating area, the LOTOS Group will focus on efficient utilisation of its expanded refining capacities, further increase of the conversion ratio and optimum exploitation of synergies between the refining and power generation sectors. The key strategic objectives are: to achieve the world-class standards of production and maintain a strong competitive position among European refineries, to make optimum use of assets held and acquired as part of its growth strategy, to ensure safe and stable operation of the production and ancillary facilities, as measured by the minimum availability of 98% during the year, to further increase the conversion ratio and intensify processing. The implementation of the strategy for 2011–2015 will enhance the position of the LOTOS Group as a strong, innovative and successfully developing entity, which plays a crucial role in ensuring Poland’s energy security and operates in compliance with the CSR concept. 28 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Progress in implementation of strategic objectives The implementation of our new strategy will increase the value of the LOTOS Group, while enhancing Poland's energy security. In the operating and marketing areas, the LOTOS Group has managed to achieve the key objectives for 2010, envisaged in the strategy adopted in 2006 and updated in 2008. With the completion of the 10+ Programme, the oil throughput was significantly increased which translated into an increase of finished products output, while the LOTOS Group's share in the domestic fuel market exceeded the target level of 30%. The largest discrepancies between the target and actual performance were seen in the exploration and production segment. The objective, assuming production volumes equal to 10% of the 2012 throughput, proved impossible to achieve. The decisive factors here included the global financial crisis unfolding since 2008, the adverse macroeconomic climate and strong volatility in oil prices. The prevailing conditions made it impossible to borrow funds required to finance the development of exploration licences and planned acquisitions. Given the emerging growth opportunities, a decision was made to develop a new strategy, that would place the strongest emphasis on the exploration and production segment. Its implementation will increase the LOTOS Group’s value in the long term, while enhancing Poland’s energy security. 29 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Key risks, opportunities and challenges in the context of sustainable development Compared to 2009, some of the operating, financial and market-related risks were relatively reduced. Grupa LOTOS operates in an environment and conditions which entail a large number of risks. The risks inherent in the various areas of the Company’s operations are first identified and assessed, and then reviewed to determine what further measures need to be taken. Compared with the previous reporting period, some of the operating, financial and market-related risks were relatively reduced thanks, among other things, to the efforts aimed to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis, the successful completion of the 10+ Programme and the implementation of various measures aimed to mitigate the risks identified earlier. Risks associated with the government strategy for the oil sector. Strategic legal risks Given Poland’s membership in the European Union, national normative acts passed by the Polish government bodies are not the only source of legal risk, which may also stem from EU directives. In order to identify that risk, Grupa LOTOS keeps track of the trends in EU policies with regard to both proposed and existing directives affecting the oil sector, and cooperates with state authorities responsible for preparing and implementing the government strategy for the oil sector. In addition, the Company is involved in the process of issuing opinions on the draft and effective legislation concerning its area of interest, particularly mandatory stocks of oil and fuels, as well as biocomponents and biofuels. The key risk in the area of biofuels and biocomponents is still associated, like in the previous year, with a failure by Polish authorities to introduce regulations regarding transposing into national law the provisions of Directives 2009/30/EC and 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 23rd 2009, which provide for a higher biofuel content in standard fuels (B7, E10). Due to the lack of legal solutions provided for in the directives and the fact that National Indicative Targets (NCW) are annually increased, Grupa LOTOS is forced to market higher volumes of unprofitable biofuel B100. In the area of mandatory stocks, it remains unclear in which direction the regulations will evolve. The time when mandatory stocks may start to be taken over from market operators by relevant governmental agencies is unknown, as is the speed of the process. According to the current draft law, the takeover of mandatory stocks is to span ten years. A serious risk arising from the prolonged legislative process in Poland is the impossibility to predict dates of entry into force of various legal regulations and the related consequences for the Company and the entire industry. It is also time to take into account the risks associated with the introduction from 2013 of more stringent CO2 emission requirements and with changes to the rules governing the allocation of CO2 emission allowances. The authorities have yet to announce the relevant decisions, which makes it impossible to develop an appropriate model on which specific investment decisions would be based. Risks associated with changes in and interpretations of tax laws The legal environment in which Grupa LOTOS operates has for many years been marked by significant instability. Newly enacted regulations and changes in interpretations of the provisions already in force affect the Company’s operations, its objectives, as well as the tax policy and the amount of tax liabilities. It should be noted, however, that changes in tax laws may be a source of both opportunities and risks for the Company. Grupa LOTOS looks at many new interpretations of those laws as an opportunity to benefit from tax optimisation. There are interpretations which confirm the correctness of the Company’s approach to certain transactions. However, it is equally probable that changes in the interpretations of tax laws may give rise to tax risk in transactions where such risk was non-existent before. Differences in interpretations of tax laws are frequent, both between various tax authorities and between such authorities and businesses, which leads to uncertainties and conflicts, and in foreign transactions may compromise the Company’s reputation as a reliable business partner. This in turn may prompt the Company to give up profitable ventures or transactions for the sake of fiscal security. These factors mean that the tax risk of doing business in Poland is significantly higher than in countries where tax regimes are better developed. Another factor which necessitates a great deal of caution in managing tax risks is related to high potential penalties which may be imposed in the case of a fiscal 30 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 offence or other violation of tax legislation, and the generally restrictive approach manifested by the Polish tax authorities. When conducting business activities, an entrepreneur has to reckon with the risk that an erroneous interpretation of the law, a human error on the part of its employee or incompetence of civil servants may inadvertently result in tax arrears, as a consequence of which it may face charges of committing an offence. Given the frequent interpretive changes and enactment of new legal regulations, which are often inconsistent, convoluted or incompatible with the EU laws, Grupa LOTOS reviews and updates its internal procedures on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with the requirements currently in force and to identify and mitigate any tax risks, and in particular their effect on the Company's financial statements. The process involves employees who actively participate in numerous training courses concerned with tax issues. In situations where a tax risk related to a possibility of disparate interpretations is identified, Grupa LOTOS avails itself of the right to request an individual written interpretation issued by the Minister of Finance. Compliance with such interpretations eliminates the tax risk to the extent covered by a given interpretation. Furthermore, Grupa LOTOS, as a member of Poland’s major organisations of employers and entrepreneurs, takes an active role in issuing opinions on draft legislation. This is primarily aimed at improving the quality of tax legislation, but also allows the Company's governing bodies to adequately respond to any changes in the legal environment. Financial risks The Financial Risk Management Committee operating at Grupa LOTOS is responsible for supervising the financial risk management process at the Company, seeking to achieve the following objectives: increase the probability that budget and strategic objectives will be met, limit volatility of cash flows, ensure short-term financial liquidity, maximise the result on market risk management, given an assumed level of risk. The key financial risk from the point of view of the Company’s operations is the risk related to prices of raw materials and petroleum products. The Company is in the process of developing a new policy for managing that risk, which will include the objectives connected with the introduction, with effect from January 1st 2011, of a new model of trade in raw materials and petroleum products within the LOTOS Group. Currency risk is managed in line with the Strategy of Currency Risk Management at Grupa LOTOS, the basic guideline governing that area. The management horizon is determined in line with the rollover budgeting period. The natural currency of Grupa LOTOS’ operating market is the US dollar (USD). Consequently, Grupa LOTOS has a structurally long position in USD on its operating activity. For this reason, it was decided that USD was the most appropriate currency for contracting and repaying long-term loans to finance the 10+ Programme. Interest rate risk management is connected with the cash flows which depend on future interest rates, in particular the expected schedule of repayments under the loan extended to finance inventories and the implementation of the 10+ Programme, and the resulting interest calculated on the basis of a floating rate (LIBOR USD). The risk related to prices of CO2 allowances is managed in line with the objectives set forth in the Strategy for Managing the Risk Related to Prices of CO2 Allowances by Grupa LOTOS. The management horizon is determined by the subsequent phases of the Kyoto protocol; the current management horizon runs until the end of 2012. Liquidity risk management process consists in monitoring the forecast cash flows and available sources of financing, and then matching the maturities of assets and liabilities, analysing the working capital and maintaining access to various sources of financing. Liquidity management is consolidated to cover the entire LOTOS Group. Measures designed to mitigate the risk of restricting or change in conditions of access to external financing include contracting loans with a wide group of financial institutions, the correct, complete and timely fulfillment of disclosure obligations, analysis and compliance with the financial indicators and covenants, as well as with other obligations towards banks stipulated in the loan agreements. In addition, Grupa LOTOS monitors the credit ratings and general standing of the banks with which it contracts financing. Management of credit risk relating to counterparties in financial transactions consists in ongoing monitoring of the credit exposure in relation to the limits granted. The counterparties must have an appropriate credit rating, assigned by leading rating agencies, or hold guarantees from institutions meeting the minimum rating requirement. Grupa LOTOS S.A. enters into financial transactions with reputable firms with sound credit standing, and diversifies the group of institutions with which it cooperates. As regards management of credit risk relating to counterparties in non-financial transactions, all customers requesting trade credit or payment limits undergo verification of their creditworthiness, whose results determine the amount of credit or limits to be granted. Decisions related to evaluation of business partners are made by the Credit Committees, set up within the marketing segment of the LOTOS Group. In order to ensure that the financial risks are effectively managed and to minimise the risk of errors, all data used to support the process are very precise, and decisions are based on in-depth analyses, in accordance with the operating procedures which are in place. The financial risk management policies and instruments and the impact of the key risk factors on the individual items of financial results have been presented in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. 31 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Risks related to the upstream business Risks related to the upstream business include production and technical risks, exploration risks, risks related to the geological characteristics of the fields or simply weather-related risks. All of them are monitored and appropriate strategies are implemented with a view to mitigating them. One of the major risks are process risks associated with the production of hydrocarbons. These include risks of oil spills, marine collisions, fires, gas eruptions and other failures. A number of preventive measures are applied, such as leakage testing, monitoring of fire risk parameters and eruption risk prevention, for example by securing the boreholes. Additionally, procedures have been put in place applicable in day-to-day work and when a threat of failure occurs. An important measure helping to reduce the risk is the provision of regular training courses and practical exercises for staff. In the event of an incident or accident, a thorough analysis is conducted, and the event itself is discussed at the training courses held at that time, with a view to preventing its recurrence. Technical risks are associated with the equipment used to exploit hydrocarbons. It is mitigated through ongoing monitoring of the condition and performance of the equipment, as well as technical supervision (according to the schedule of periodic reviews) and performance of necessary tests. Regular training courses are also provided to staff to teach them how to operate the equipment/components in order to minimise the risk of human error. The exploration risk follows largely from incorrect estimation of in-place resources. Therefore, such resources are always estimated (in accordance with the SPE 2007 resources classification system) for three scenarios P10/P50/P90, which means that quantities are given that can be potentially recovered with the 10%, 50% and 90% probability. In addition, the internal Chance of Success (CoS) rate is applied when evaluating the potential of the play covered by geological testing. Moreover, in the design phase there is the risk of having to conduct additional, in-depth geological analyses of high potential production plays. Other risks in the upstream area are related, among other things, to possible occurrence or intensification of phenomena which may cause loss of wells or declines in well rates (e.g. falling reservoir pressures, entry of water), as well as bad weather, which may lead to a suspension of work or production. Risks related to the supply of raw materials Grupa LOTOS continues its efforts related to the strategy of diversification of crude oil supplies, focusing on two key aspects of this strategic goal: security of crude oil supplies: steady expansion of presence on the international oil market, regular contracting of various types of oil from offshore production, while creating conditions to radically increase their share in total supplies to the refinery, in case of a threat to the continuity of supplies from the main direction, increasing the role of own production, improvement of competitiveness: by fully capitalising on the coastal location of the Gdańsk refinery and the possibility to source oil supplies through two independent channels: Russian oil through the Druzhba Pipeline and various types of oil available through Naftoport. An appropriate selection of types of oil and directions of supplies is the result of optimisation efforts, carried out on an ongoing basis, to maximise the integrated margin. Risks related to operating activities The management of risks related to operating activities covers various areas: from process and technology-related risks, to workplace safety and environmental risks, to legal risks relating to the respective areas. Risks related to implementation of the 10+ Programme Risks related to the implementation of the 10+ Programme, which were quite significant in recent years, have either markedly diminished or been altogether eliminated. The credit for that is attributable to the mitigation measures applied by Grupa LOTOS with respect to those risks, as well as the fact that the implementation of the 10+ Programme (along with the construction of all its facilities) has now been completed, as a consequence of which the likelihood of the occurrence of such risks is now minimal. Detailed analyses of major risks in the implementation area of this investement project were carried out, which allowed the Company to determine the best ways of dealing with them. The greatest risk was associated with possible delivery or fitting in of defective installations/equipment and materials, which could necessitate repairs and replacements, driving up costs and causing delays. The measures applied, including the preparation of a list of preferred suppliers and a list of entities with which contracts should be avoided, monitoring of critical equipment, inspection of fixtures, performance of the appropriate amount of diverse testing (e.g. tests of the chemical composition and thickness of selected pipeline components, identification of materials and quality of joints) and compliance with internal standards, allowed us to reduce the above risks. In terms of quality control, the measures undertaken helped to avert events which could have critically affected the project. Thanks to implemented controls, some risks were detected at a stage when it was still possible to eliminate them completely. In the few cases where any of the risks materialised, the scope of control was extended, which allowed to eliminate the risk of similar events in further work. It should be noted, however, that there is still a risk that any latent defects in the materials supplied may be identified during their lifetime. Despite the fact that a majority of the units built as part of the 10+ Programme have already been proven, tested and put into operation, the risk of identifying defects during the start-up and initial period of operation still exists with respect to those units which are currently in the start-up phase. Any such event may disorganise and/or delay the start-up work, affecting the implementation schedule of the entire Programme. Furthermore, in some cases, late detection of such defects, after a facility has already been put into service, may give rise to risks associated with workplace safety, fires and explosions. The 10+ Programme also involves a number of other risks which have been subject to supervision and monitoring, as a result of which the project has so far been implemented according to schedule and within budget. Currently, the main risk related to the 10+ Programme has to do with the Company’s ability to complete the entire project by the deadlines specified in the loan agreement and perform the required tests. 32 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 However, on the basis of experience gained while carrying out the 10+ Programme and managing the related risks, measures were designed to reduce the identified risks, also when new projects are implemented in various areas Grupa LOTOS’ business. Progress of work under the 10+ Programme Environmental risks Grupa LOTOS’ operating activities entail certain environmental risks, the most important of them being: risk of failure to comply with the requirements of environmental laws (Polish and EU), risk related to shortage of CO 2 emission allowances, risk of serious industrial failure (described in detail further on, in the section devoted to the process and technology-related risks). The likelihood that the risk of non-compliance with the legal requirements might materialise is minimised through ongoing monitoring of the Polish and EU laws, efficient implementation of their provisions and taking an active and effective role in the legislative process. Any identified environmental law requirements are notified, in the form of information or orders, to all those at Grupa LOTOS for whom such requirements are relevant. The processes of obtaining permits are carried out with a sufficient time reserve, taking into account the risk that administrative proceedings might last longer than expected, which guarantees that the relevant documents will be obtained in time. Grupa LOTOS is making intensive efforts to mitigate the risk related to the need to secure a sufficient number of CO2 emission allowances. Legislative changes at the level of Polish and EU laws are monitored on a routine basis. The Company has ongoing liaison with the National Administrator, while applications for new allowances are prepared sufficiently in advance. For the refining units which participate in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, including units constructed as part of the 10+ Programme which were commissioned in 2010 (CDU/VDU, HDS, HGU and ASR), the number of allowances will suffice until the end of the current trading period, i.e. 2012. Additional allowances were granted for the CHP, whose emissions have increased in connection with the supply of heat supporting the operation of the above units. Given that the last units covered by the 10+ Programme are being commissioned, in the near future Grupa LOTOS will apply for allowances from the national reserve for the MHC and ROSE units and for the CHP, whose emissions will increase further as the new refinery production units will be connected with the CHP. It is expected that a relevant decision is made by the National Administrator in mid-2011. Process and technology-related risks, risks related to workplace safety One of the key risks for Grupa LOTOS, addressed by specially designed preventive and preparatory measures, is the risk of industrial failure. Emergency events may disrupt the work of refining units, cause excessive emissions of pollutants into the environment or accidents at work. To prevent such events, a variety of precautions are taken, such as diagnosing the technical condition of the units and equipment, establishing an appropriate inspection agenda on the basis of analyses, e.g. corrosion reports, using lists of eligible vendors of equipment and providers of technical services, and the implementation of various operational procedures, including with respect to acceptance and inspection of supplies. Grupa LOTOS also carries out criticality analyses of the equipment, as part of which it identifies and assesses risks and implements appropriate action plans for individual items of equipment, depending on their degree of criticality. All equipment supporting the work of units has been classified on the basis of the following criteria: safety for humans and the environment, the importance from the perspective of the refinery, the importance from the perspective of the units, probability of failure, complexity of repair. 33 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 The classification of a piece of equipment to a specific criticality group determines the selection and application of an optimal strategy for maintenance of its operations. Installations built under the 10+ Programme are a special case in that respect. As many of these installation have only worked in the refinery for a short period of time, the adequate measures of managing process-related risks described above have not been implemented yet. Additionally, it is possible that defects originating in construction will be identified later. The risks of such defects are analysed above in the subchapter Risks related to the implementation of the 10+ Programme. However, the positive aspect of the newly-constructed installations is the fact that they perform technological processes which have already been performed before at the refinery, therefore it is possible to reserve the processing capacity for such an event. Hence, should any failure occur at any of the installations, it will not have such far-reaching consequences for the entire plant and the rest of the refinery will be able to work without any major disruptions. A factor contributing to the increase in the risk of failure of the new installations is the insufficient training of staff. To mitigate this risk, a number of steps were taken at the refinery, including employing staff which were to operate new installations well, even up to 2 years, in advance so that the training process could be finished on time. Grupa LOTOS also invested in state-of-the-art training tools – training simulators – which are industrial equivalents of flight simulators applied in aviation. Thanks to them, the staff operating new installations can be trained in conditions which are very close to actual working conditions with a real installation. The refinery also uses technologies and equipment meeting the BAT criteria (Best Available Techniques). Process units are equipped with adequate safety and security solutions, including multi-layered security systems (prevention, protection and counteraction layers). Alarm, emergency stop and shutdown systems are deployed in order to prevent uncontrolled development of an emergency situation and serious damage to machinery and equipment. In order to mitigate the effects of the risk, failure response training and exercises are provided on a regular basis to all employees of the refinery, to ensure prompt and effective response to any actual failures. If an emergency event does occur, a thorough analysis of its causes is performed (Root Cause Analysis). Based on its findings, measures are implemented designed to prevent the recurrence of such failures in future. Information gathered about the various failures and incidents is used in subsequent assessments of the technology-related risk. Given the nature of Grupa LOTOS’ production processes, workplace safety is an issue of utmost importance for the Company. Many jobs are exposed to hazardous or noxious factors, which is why each job is assessed in terms of inherent occupational risks, including risks related to explosive atmosphere, noise, vibration or presence of chemical and biological substances. On the basis of that assessment, individual and collective security systems are deployed. New technical and organisational measures are also put in place to ensure safe working conditions for all persons staying and/or working on the premises of and for Grupa LOTOS. Regular checks of the procedures are undertaken and the requirements are enforced. In many cases, the rules implemented at Grupa LOTOS are more stringent than those required by law. Grupa LOTOS attaches particular importance to raising employee awareness of occupational safety. This objective is being accomplished for instance through a series of above-standard initiatives and programmes designed to promote awareness of the health and safety-at-work issues in accessible and interesting ways. The Company also implements incentive schemes in that area. All the above activities are designed to ensure safe conditions of the work and processes taking place at Grupa LOTOS, which is a priority concern for the Company. Risk management in the operating area is also related to limiting the likelihood of failure to comply with the legal requirements applicable to the operations of Grupa LOTOS. This risk is minimised through ongoing monitoring of the Polish and EU laws, efficient implementation of their provisions and taking an active and effective role in the legislative process. Risk of stricter quality requirements for petroleum products Grupa LOTOS S.A. keeps a close eye on the proposed new standards and regulations relevant for its production and sales. The source of information about future changes in the quality requirements is Technical Committee 222 at the Polish Committee for Standardisation, responsible for petroleum products and process liquids. Thanks to active participation in the work of the subcommittees of Technical Committee 222, Grupa LOTOS is able to issue opinions on proposed EU standards at the stage of their development. Grupa LOTOS can also have a say on the quality requirements, especially for motor fuels, through participation in the Polish Organisation of Oil Industry and Trade (POPiHN). The Company’s participation in that body’s work substantially reduces the risks of delayed compliance with future quality standards for petroleum products. In 2010, a change was expected in the quality requirements for gasolines and diesel oils regarding the admissible content of biocomponents. Unfortunately the change, whereby the admissible content of FAME was to be raised to 7% of the total volume, was not effected, and is now expected in 2011. Work is also under way to admit to trading gasolines with ethanol content of up to 10% of the volume. Grupa LOTOS is already prepared for those changes and thus they do not pose any threat to the Company’s continuing as a going concern. Marketing risks Risk management in the area of Grupa LOTOS’ marketing activities covers both market-related and financial risks associated with the liquidity of its counterparties. For a description of the Company’s strategy for managing the credit risk of its non-financial counterparties, see the financial risks section. One of the key marketing risks to which Grupa LOTOS is exposed is the risk of declining margins due to price competition. The most important measure addressing the price risk is the ongoing monitoring of parameters related to prices and margins, in conjunction with the monitoring of sales volumes and results. The Company is planning to introduce tools and mechanisms that will allow it to fine-tune pricing to optimise achieved margins. In addition, in the retail sector, the Company is diversifying into market segments less susceptible to downward pressure on margins due to competition (both existing and potential), while 34 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 making efforts aimed to foster sustained customer loyalty, for example by enhancing the Navigator loyalty programme at LOTOS stations and the LOTOS Biznes schemes. Grupa LOTOS also manages the risk of decreased demand. High availability of fuels (increased supply in the domestic market plus imports) is likely to drive down the prices, which in turn may result in lower sales volumes. To mitigate that risk, sales are made through various distribution channels, while the production processes are continuously enhanced. Risk management in the marketing area is also focused on maintaining uninterrupted supplies of products to the market. At Grupa LOTOS, the process is coordinated by the Supply Chain Management Committee, whose role is to guide the LOTOS Group's operating activities in the area of production, procurement, logistics and sales, in terms of the whole supply chain. Additionally, any logistical constraints are taken into account in the process of operational planning and optimisation. Moreover, the availability times of the distribution centres are constantly monitored. In order to minimise the risks associated with loss of products as a result of theft or improper handling during storage or transport, agreements are only concluded with eligible suppliers, while the parameters throughout the logistic chain are constantly monitored. Mitigation measures are also taken to address the risk arising from the proposed legislative changes in respect of mandatory stocks, which may increase the costs of logistics. In order to ensure effective and prompt response to the various risks and emergencies, Grupa LOTOS has developed crisis scenarios for the most strategic areas, including oil supplies, oil processing, fuel production, product storage and logistics. Costs of implementation of hedging strategies Many of the planned and implemented risk mitigation measures involve organisational or procedural changes, which usually entail negligible costs. However, some measures require large expenditures. In such cases, the ALARP principle (“As Low As Reasonably Practicable ) is applied, whereby risks are reduced to a level as low as reasonably practicable. Risks are considered acceptable if it is impossible to reduce them any further or if the costs of their reduction outweigh the benefits to be gained. Any hedging strategies, including plans to mitigate risks or transfer them (e.g. by way of insurance), are therefore implemented following careful analysis, focused especially on the costs that would need to be incurred. 35 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Business environment The success of the 10+ Programme served as the basis for the strategy of Grupa LOTOS, focusing on the exploration & production and the marketing segment. The economic climate in 2010 was markedly different from that seen in the previous year. The world’s largest economies pulled out of the recession, while emerging markets saw their growth rates accelerate. Global GDP was on a fast track, although the worldwide recovery was still quite susceptible to any negative data. To maintain positive GDP momentum in 2010, the states had to take an interventionist role and issue a number of guarantees intended to gradually rebuild economic relations. The role of the state authorities as the primarily guarantors of access to capital will also be called for in 2011, especially to ensure monetary stability. The economic improvement observed in 2010 fuelled demand for oil, driving up the prices of that commodity. 37 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Financial and economic standing Financing structure of the 10+ Programme was well thought out and implemented. It proved resilient in the face of adverse market developments when the financial and economic crisis set in. Dear Stakeholders, The last months of 2010 saw the successful completion – on schedule and within budget – of the 10+ Programme – the largest refinery expansion project in Central and Eastern Europe. Bringing that project, on a scale unmatched in Polish economy, to the finishing line was an achievement of strategic importance for the entire LOTOS Group, as it will entrench our market position for many years to come, while delivering value to our Stakeholders. I have never doubted that the project would be anything but utter success, basing my conviction on its financing structure, which was well thought out and implemented. Thanks to our conservative approach, it proved resilient in the face of adverse market developments when the financial and economic crisis set in. Mariusz Machajewski Following the expansion of the Gdańsk refinery, in 2010 we recorded a record-high oil throughput, in excess of 8 million Vice-President of the Board tonnes. The upgrade has allowed us to intensify processing, resulting in a greater yield of high-margin products – especially Chief Financial Officer diesel oil and aviation fuel. It should further be noted that the newly built units are capable of processing diverse types of crude oil, which has improved the refinery’s flexibility and our ability to capitalise on changing market trends. Thanks to the increased throughput, our sales volumes grew, while imported fuel components were replaced by our own product streams from the new units. As a result, in 2010 Grupa LOTOS posted PLN 763.3m in operating profit, up by nearly 82% year on year. Operating performance was also boosted by favourable trends in the prices of petroleum products on global markets. The LOTOS Group’s sales revenue also came to a record-high level of PLN 19.7bn, a 37.4% growth on a year earlier, chiefly on the back of higher sales volumes and soaring prices of crude oil and petroleum products on international markets. For instance, the average market price of Brent dtd in 2010 went up by 28.9% relative to 2009, while crack margins on diesel oil and gasoline rose over the same period by 24.8% and 13.8%, respectively. The rapid growth of Grupa LOTOS’ business and the resulting level of capital expenditure, which in 2010 ran to more than PLN 1.2bn, affected the structure of the Company’s equity and liabilities. However, the fact that debt ratios stayed within assumed ranges and liquidity ratios remained safe confirms the soundness of our financing strategy, which has allowed us to implement key investment programmes without disruptions. Going ahead, the Company will focus on deleveraging its business, using the increased cash flows generated by newly completed projects connected with the refinery’s expansion and production of crude oil. It is worthy of note that – being an oil company – Grupa LOTOS operates in a sector with potential environmental impacts and plays an important role in Poland’s energy security. It is also one of the region’s largest employers. This demonstrates the complexity of our Stakeholder map and the resulting importance of a transparent and open disclosure policy, offering a broad basis for assessment of our credibility. I view it as an important factor behind the Company’s value creation. The superior quality of the Company’s communication with the capital market was highlighted by the highest laurels in the Investor Relations category of the Listed Company of the Year ranking, prepared by the Pentor Research Institute for the Puls Biznesu daily. The performance we delivered in 2010, as well as our sound financial position, provide solid foundations for the Company’s ambitious strategy for 2011–2015. I am fully convinced that the success of the 10+ Programme proves, and upholds the Stakeholder confidence, that we are able to accomplish the ambitious goals we set for ourselves and thus increase the Company’s value.

At the beginning of the year, the LOTOS stock clearly underperformed the market, bottoming out at its annual low of PLN 25.05 on the February 25th session. Thereafter, the stock started to follow the market, but only the release of the Company’s new strategy in November provided a sufficient impulse to propel its dynamics past the 100% mark compared with the year’s beginning, translating into positive returns, only slightly below the WIG20 performance. On December 17th, the Company’s stock price reached its annual peak of PLN 37.85 per share. As at the end of 2010, its dynamics, relative to the period’s beginning, was 110.3%, which meant a rise of 10% and PLN 3.40 in absolute terms. On December 31st 2010, the stock closed at PLN 36.35. The average daily volume of trading in 2010 was 234.5 thousand shares. The Company’s market capitalisation as at the year’s end was a little more than PLN 4.7bn. Quotations of Grupa LOTOS shares in 2010 Generally speaking, the performance of the LOTOS stock was, save for a temporary plunge in the first quarter, fairly stable. It would indicate that investors responded positively to the anti-crisis measures adopted by the Company in 2009 and its consistent implementation of the 10+ Programme. The relative stability was reflected in investment recommendations regarding the Company’s securities issued throughout 2010 by financial institutions. Positive recommendations slightly outnumbered negative ones: 13 (including four to “buy” and nine to “hold”) to 12 (including six to “sell” and six to “reduce”).

Altogether, 16 A-rated companies met the criteria for inclusion in the index. Following a review announced on January 25th 2011, the LOTOS stock was included in the index again. In 2010, the index value was published twice daily. Starting from 2011, it is quoted in the continuous system, from the beginning to the end of a trading session. The RESPECT project is intended to promote responsible management of WSE-listed companies. Similar indices have been launched on several dozen stock markets around the world, the most prominent of them being the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and FTSE4Good. The basic criteria for inclusion in the RESPECT Index are the results of the rating designed to assess the sustainability-driven companies. The analysis covered the companies listed on the regulated market of the Warsaw Stock Exchange which received the highest ratings in terms of their social responsibility efforts and are leaders in communication with the financial markets, sustainable development and corporate disclosure discipline. To assess the WSE-listed companies (excluding the NewConnect market, foreign companies and companies whose shares are traded outside of the Warsaw Stock Exchange) and establish the RESPECT rating, corporate social responsibility was defined as a management strategy and conceptual approach to doing business. In 2009, Grupa LOTOS joined the project independently as one of the 120 companies that agreed to subject themselves to the assessment. Starting from 2011, the first two stages of the qualification process are run without the participation of the candidate companies. At present, the Warsaw Stock Exchange together with the Polish Association of Listed Companies – based on publicly available information – undertake the assessment of the listed companies as to their meeting the criterium of liquidity and then to the practices adopted by them in the areas of corporate and information governance as well as investor relations. It is only at the third stage of the process that the consent to be included in the project along with the detailed verification by the consulting firm Deloitte from the companies interested is required. Companies which ranked highest in course of this qualification process were included in the RESPECT sustainability index, which is an income index, taking into account income from dividends and pre-emptive rights to evaluate the economic condition of companies considered to operate to the highest corporate standards.

An important success confirming the high ratings achieved by Grupa LOTOS in the RESPECT assessment was the first award in the Investor Relations category of the Listed Company of the Year 2010 ranking, prepared by the Pentor Research Institute for the Puls Biznesu daily. The winner was selected by capital market experts stock analysts, investment advisers and brokers representing brokerage houses and offices, insurance companies, investment funds, capital departments of banks and consulting firms located all over Poland – in acknowledgement of the quality of Grupa LOTOS’ dialogue with retail and institutional investors, as well as the promptness of its response to investor queries.

Its links with Grupa LOTOS go back to 2005, when the Company became the major shareholder of LOTOS Petrobaltic. LOTOS Petrobaltic operates offshore Poland, over an area covering approximately 29 thousand sq. km. Currently, work is underway on eight exploration and four production licences. LOTOS Petrobaltic is the parent company of its own group, which comprises six subsidiaries and associates. The scope of the company’s operations in 2010 included exploration and development work on the Baltic Sea, expansion of the portfolio of licences on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and development of the Yme Production Project. On the Norwegian Continental Shelf, LOTOS Petrobaltic conducts its exploration and production work through LOTOS E&P Norge (LOTOS Exploration & Production Norge AS) with its registered seat in Stavanger, Norway, which was established in 2007. Grupa LOTOS, through its subsidiary LOTOS Petrobaltic, is the only Polish enterprise engaged in hydrocarbons production in the Polish economic zone of the Baltic Sea LOTOS Petrobaltic is focused on pursuing the strategy of the LOTOS Group, while maximising its financial performance. Shareholder value is created in a sustainable manner, based on the management standards adopted by the LOTOS Group, that is with due regard to the principles of social intercourse and environmental protection. In 2010, LOTOS Petrobaltic was covered by the LOTOS Group’s non-financial reporting, which constitutes the basis for preparation of reports demonstrating the Company’s adherence to the principles of sustainable growth. As part of that system, LOTOS Petrobaltic reports its environmental performance, which is another proof of the commitment of the whole LOTOS Group and of LOTOS Petrobaltic to corporate social responsibility. In November 2010, the LOTOS Group unveiled its new strategy for 2011–2015, along with development directions until 2020. The new strategy places a particular emphasis on intensifying the Company’s upstream operations (exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas). For LOTOS Petrobaltic this spells the need to embrace new challenges and initiatives, while indicating its growing role as member of the LOTOS Group. The LOTOS Group’s strategic objective for its upstream business is to increase the production of hydrocarbons, in line with the priorities of Poland’s energy security policy until 2030. The objective will be accomplished by: improving the security of supplies by obtaining direct access to hydrocarbon reserves, increasing the production volumes – thanks to the implementation of programmes aimed at increasing oil production rates from the Baltic offshore fields, as well as the execution of new projects outside of Poland – to: 24,000 boe/d (barrels of equivalent/day), or 1.2 million tonnes per year, by 2015, 45 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

Exploration and production area of LOTOS E&P Norge Key achievements in 2010 included: continued work on the Yme project – drilling work and installation of submarine equipment was completed, construction of a production platform was continued. In September 2010, the MOPU production platform was hauled from the Abu Dhabi shipyard to the Norwegian Rosenberg shipyard in Stavanger, where another stage of work and preparation to site the platform on the field is being executed. As soon as the shipyard work is over, the platform will be hauled to the Yme field and connected to the production facilities. The timing of the production launch will depend on the weather, as specific sea conditions are required for transporting the platform and connecting it to the field. It is provisionally scheduled that the Yme field will be brought on stream in the third quarter of 2011, acquisition of new licences as a result of execution of agreements as part of the APA 2009 Licensing Round: 50% working interest and operatorship of the PL 556 licence, 10% working interest in the PLN 497B licence, created by expanding the scope of existing PL 497 licence, submission of an application as part of the APA 2010 Licensing Round and award in January 2011 of a 25% working interest in the PL 503B licence, created by expanding the scope of existing PL 503 licence, drilling, analytical and re-interpretation work, as well as in-depth economic analyses, which found the hydrocarbon potential and prospectivity of the exploration licences PL 316CS (20% working interest) and PL 316DS (20% working interest) to be low.

Overview of achievements The most important achievements of the LOTOS Group in the operating segment were linked to the completion of the 10+ Programme. Development plans The completion of the 10+ Programme does not mean that the Company’s operating segment will cease to develop in the years to come. A major challenge for next year will be to maximise the utilisation of operated assets. 52 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Management approach The LOTOS Group’s operating segment is focused on carrying out refining operations and supplying the market with high quality products, while making optimum use of its production capacities and mitigating the environment impact. In line with the LOTOS Group’s new strategy until 2015, the segment will focus on effective utilisation of the refining capacities expanded as part of the 10+ Programme, further increase of the conversion ratio and optimum exploitation of synergies between the refining and power generation sectors. The LOTOS Group’s strategic objectives for the operating area are: to achieve the world-class standards of production and maintain a strong competitive position among European refineries, to make optimum use of assets held and acquired as part of its growth strategy, to ensure safe and stable operation of the production and ancillary facilities, as measured by the minimum availability of 98% during the year, to further increase the conversion ratio and intensify processing. In order to meet the ever stricter environmental requirements, the LOTOS Group adopts pro-environmental development criteria and the best available techniques, combined with solutions featuring low emissions and high production efficiency. This relates both to the production process itself and its output in the form of environmentally-friendly product streams. The degree to which these objectives are met will be confirmed by an indicator placing Grupa LOTOS among the safest refineries in Europe. The LOTOS Group’s operating segment comprises the operations of the Gdańsk refinery and of subsidiaries involved in production or support functions. These include: LOTOS Czechowice, LOTOS Jasło, LOTOS Serwis, LOTOS Lab and LOTOS Straż. The refinery operated by Grupa LOTOS is the largest of the LOTOS Group’s production plants. 53 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Overview of achievements The most important achievements of the LOTOS Group in the operating segment were linked to the completion of the 10+ Programme. In 2010, the key tasks of the operating segment included: successful completion of the 10+ Programme, optimum use of production assets, research and development of new technologies. The major achievements of the LOTOS Group’s operating segment centred around the implementation of the 10+ Programme. In 2010, the Programme entered its final stage, as the construction of all production units was completed. 2010 was also the first year in which the refinery reached its nameplate refining capacities of 10.5 million tonnes, which was related to the launch of the CDU/VDU unit. 10+ Programme The 10+ Programme is the largest CAPEX project to have ever been undertaken by the LOTOS Group. Its goal was to increase the throughput capacities and depth of conversion of the Gdańsk refinery, and consequently to improve the Company’s competitive position. 2010 saw the completion and launch of a number if key units constructed as part of the 10+ Programme. As at the end of December 2010, the progress of work under the 10+ Programme came to 100%, which means that the project was completed within schedule. The scope of engineering, procurement and construction work was completed with respect to all key and ancillary units. Progress of work under the 10+ Programme MHC (mild hydrocracking) unit, the largest facility constructed as part of the 10+ Programme, was assigned the RFSU (Ready For Start Up) status on October 10th 2010. On October 27th, feedstock was fed into the unit. The first product streams obtained from this facility in mid-January 2011 were of very high quality, with the conversion ratio – measured as a percentage of the highest value products – standing at 70% (the design conversion ratio is 60%). The main purpose of the MHC unit is to intensify oil processing and obtain a higher yield of top quality fuel components from each barrel of crude, which is a distinguishing parameter of the most advanced refineries in Europe and globally. The residuum oil supercritical extraction (ROSE) unit, as the last of the 10+ Programme facilities, was assigned the RFSU (Ready For Start Up) on December 31st 2010, in line with the schedule. Work on the 10+ Programme was executed without major disruptions, while the defined execution risks were kept to a minimum. The work was entrusted to 54 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 experienced contractors with sound technical and financial standing, able to execute projects irrespective of changing market conditions. The ongoing financial and economic crisis had no material impact on the implementation of the 10+ Programme.

Annual Report 2010 33 ROSE unit and ROSE tank RFSU 34 Road systems and yards RFSU MC – Mechanical Completion RFSU – Ready For Start Up PDU – Transfer For Use Other projects In addition to the 10+ Programme, Grupa LOTOS was implementing other projects designed to enhance the efficiency, safety and technical performance of its assets, while mitigating their environmental impact. The key projects included: construction of a railway loading facility: to increase the loading capacities of the refinery operated by Grupa LOTOS. The project’s deliverable is a railway loading facility capable of handling up to 2.6 million tonnes of diesel oil per year; replacement of existing burners in CHP boilers with low-emission ones: 2009 saw replacement of burners in the first boiler and 2010 – in the second boiler. The project increased the availability of steam used to power production units, in line with the emission caps specified in the Integrated Permit; air-tight sealing for tanks of the wastewater treatment plant: to mitigate the odour nuisance. The scope of work included the mounting of roof coverings, as well as the construction and launch of biofilters designed to purify the air coming from covered tanks of the refinery’s wastewater treatment plant. Based on operational experience, assumptions were prepared for air-tight sealing for the remaining tanks of the wastewater treatment plant in 2011; upgrade of the fuel depots located in Rypin and Piotrków Trybunalski – as part of the project, gasoline vapour recovery units were built at the depots and road tanker loaders were upgraded by equipping them with systems for overfill prevention, monitoring and vapour collection. Refining At over 8 million tonnes, the crude throughput volume in 2010 grew substantially relative to previous years. The growth is attributable to the launch in the first quarter of 2010 of a new crude distillation unit with a nameplate annual capacity of 4.5 million tonnes. Taking into account the existing unit, the refinery’s nameplate capacities now amount to 10.5 million tonnes of crude oil per year. However, the relatively low refining margins in 2010 disinclined the Company to maximise crude throughput. The impact of the worldwide economic crisis was still being felt, while some of the units built as part of the 10+ Programme were not yet fully operational in 2010, which affected the efficiency of the refining process. The refinery’s work load was being optimised based on market-derived data and for the better part of the year ranged around 23-27 thousand tonnes per day. The dominant type of crude being processed by Grupa LOTOS was Russian REBCO crude, however it was the processing of other crudes that was intensified. With two independent crude distillation lines, the refinery had more flexibility in selecting crude blends, as a result of which it was able to optimise output. Hence the highest in years share of crudes imported by sea in the refinery’s total mix of processed crudes. The refinery’s throughput and production volume While in 2010, Russian REBCO crude still accounted for the largest share of Grupa LOTOS’ total mix of processed crudes, its share was markedly reduced – especially in favour of Troll, Volve and Aasgard – crude types with well proven qualities, produced from North Sea offshore fields. The sources of feedstock were 56 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 more broadly diversified, which had an added benefit of significantly enhancing Poland’s energy security. Mix of processed crudes Apart from crude oil, other production inputs included components and feedstock purchased for further processing, as well as enhancing additives. As a result, the total production volume of the Gdańsk refinery exceeds the volume of processed crude, although in 2010 the gap narrowed compared with 2007–2009. However, fuel components (such as ethanol, ETBE and FAME) and enhancing additives still remain indispensable production inputs. The increase in the volume of crude processed by the Gdańsk refinery led to a significant reduction of imports of finished diesel oil to Poland. In previous years, Grupa LOTOS imported diesel oils so as to – through higher supply – develop a market for the product, which was introduced in 2010. The result of the 10+ Programme was the replacement of imported diesel oil with diesel output from the Gdańsk refinery. A major success, related chiefly to the 10+ Programme but also to the ongoing output optimisation, was the maintenance in 2010 of a very high share of diesel oil in the fuel mix produced by Grupa LOTOS. This was accomplished despite the fact that the mild hydrocracking unit, a key one in diesel production, is not yet operating at its full capacity. Production mix In 2010, the utilisation rate of the refinery’s installed capacities was adjusted to the prevailing market conditions. The greatest success was a record high (105.8%) utilisation rate of the capacity of the refinery’s hydrocracker unit, which attests to both its excellent technical condition, as well as high qualifications of the operating staff. With the start-up of the remaining 10+ Programme units, the refinery’s configuration will be complemented, while the bottleneck related to the use of vacuum distillates in the hydrocracking process will be eliminated. Capacity utilisation 57 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Grupa LOTOS Meets the National Indicative Target Methyl esters produced by LOTOS Biopaliwa in Czechowice-Dziedzice play an important role in implementation of the National Indicative Target. In 2010, the FAME unit ensure a stable production process, and produced 101.3 thousand tonnes of biocomponents, thus exceeding the project assumptions. The consumption of materials and chemicals, as well as energy consumption, was more advantageous than originally assumed. The quality of FAME produced was markedly higher than the applicable standards. LOTOS Biopaliwa made a registration filing under the REACH Regulation for the produced chemicals, and the chemicals were subsequently registered. This also means that production of FAME in 2011 will not be disrupted, and its volume and efficiency should be on a par with the 2010 level. Research and Development Following the launch of the Crude and Vacuum Distillation Unit (CDU/VDU) built under the 10+ Programme, in 2010 Grupa LOTOS started to produce and market a new product – naphtha. Additionally, the Company’s R&D efforts focused on developing technologies for production of speciality products, based on further conversion of feedstock from the oil unit. The key R&D achievements in 2010 included: launch of the commercial production and sale of reduced-toxicity oil plasticizer for use in caoutchouc and rubber products, QUANTILUS T50. The new plasticizer type is a TDAE (treated distillate aromatic extract) plasticizer which meets the EU requirements for plasticizers used in the tyre industry, effective from January 1st 2010, launch of the production and sale of low-oil paraffin 64/25/0.5 as the main component for paraffin products (waxes), production and sale of the first batch of Ceresine as a component for production of white ceresine meeting the requirements set by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), launch of the sale of Filtrates made of medium and heavy slack wax, used as inputs for production of paraffin emulsions and anti-caking agents for artificial fertilisers. They are also used as impregnation agents for chipboard and kindling, launch of the sale of V1500 Bitumen used in production of various aggregate and bitumen mixtures, launch of the sale of 50 SDA Bitumen used for bitumen production based on air oxidation or blending. In 2010, development work also focused on oil products produced by LOTOS Oil. The most important R&D activities related to lubricants included: commencement of research into ways of improving the quality of oils for passenger cars, in reliance on the Company’s own base oils – the research is scheduled to be completed in 2011, introduction of ten new types of engine oils (including LOTOS Quazar C-4, LOTOS Quazar S, LOTOS Quazar K, LOTOS Traffic PRO 025A/B, LOTOS Traffic PRO 505.01), extension of 42 Approvals for lubricants, obtaining 6 Approvals for new oils. 58 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Development plans The completion of the 10+ Programme does not mean that the Company’s operating segment will cease to develop in the years to come. A major challenge for next year will be to maximise the utilisation of operated assets. The newly built units offer huge potential capacities, while increasing the refinery’s flexibility. Ongoing output optimisation is becoming an issue of ever greater importance. In order to better control the production flows, there are plans to deploy in 2011 a system for detailed scheduling of the refining process. It will allow Grupa LOTOS to monitor the implementation of its production plans on an ongoing basis and identify any deviations in time to take effective corrective measures. The Company is also engaged in investment activities. A number of projects are undertaken to increase the refinery’s flexibility, achieve efficiency gains and mitigate the environmental impact of the refining process. The key projects scheduled for 2011 include: construction of xylene separation and reformate splitter unit: separation of xylene fraction from reformate will reduce the share of noxious aromatics in engine gasolines blended at the refinery, in line with prescribed standards and environmental protection trends. Sales of xylene will complement or replace sales of reformate, which is the current method of reducing the share of noxious aromatics in gasoline products, upgrade of the furfural extraction unit: the project is designed to increase the unit’s capacity, thus increasing the availability of the TDAE plasticizer and reducing the unit’s energy intensity. The project will include addition of a third stage of furfural regeneration and modification of the process furnace system, replacement of furnaces at the light distillate hydrorefining unit: the project is designed to replace obsolete, heavily depreciated, furnaces, which will improve the unit’s energy efficiency and safety, extension of a high pressure gas pipeline to connect it to the refinery: the project is designed to connect the refinery facilities with the high pressure gas grid and use gas as a component for hydrogen generation and a fuel for the refinery’s fuel gas network. The use of natural gas will significantly reduce atmospheric emissions of CO 2 , construction of a flare gas recovery unit designed to reduce atmospheric emissions of pollutants and the plant’s energy intensity. The project will involve the construction of a unit diverting gas which was burned in the flares from the discharge pipeline. The gas will be directed to fuel the process furnaces, air-tight sealing for tanks of the wastewater treatment plant – stage 2: the project, which is the continuation of the project executed in 2009-2010, is designed to mitigate the odour nuisance by sealing the air space of open tanks of the wastewater treatment plant and utilisation of degassing products on biofilters. Work is also under way to define the scope of further expansion of the Gdańsk refinery, which is to involve the addition of a heavy residue gasification unit. 59 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Market activities In the Most Valuable Polish Brands ranking published by the Rzeczpospolita daily, the value of the LOTOS brand was estimated at PLN 675m in 2010 an increase of 9.8% as compared to 2009. Management approach Marketing activities are carried out by the LOTOS Group’s parent company – Grupa LOTOS, as well as subsidiaries: LOTOS Paliwa, LOTOS Tank, LOTOS Oil, LOTOS Asfalt, LOTOS Parafiny and LOTOS Kolej. Overview of achievements In 2010, Grupa LOTOS solidified its market position and reputation as a stable and reliable business partner, offering products of the highest quality. Development plans The development plans for the marketing segment in 2011 are focused around the segment-related objectives set out in the corporate strategy for 2011–2015. 60 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Management approach Marketing activities are carried out by the LOTOS Group’s parent company – Grupa LOTOS, as well as subsidiaries: LOTOS Paliwa, LOTOS Tank, LOTOS Oil, LOTOS Asfalt, LOTOS Parafiny and LOTOS Kolej. In 2010, functions in the marketing area were allocated as follows: The sales force located at Grupa LOTOS was responsible for sales of engine fuels to international companies, sales of aviation fuels, exports and intra-Community supplies of petroleum products, as well as purchases of feedstock, production inputs and goods for resale. The business of LOTOS Paliwa was the retail sale and wholesale of engine fuels and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) on the domestic market. LOTOS Tank was engaged in the sale of aviation fuels on the domestic market. The business scope of LOTOS Oil included the production and distribution of lubricants: finished oils, automotive and industrial lubricants, as well as trade in base oils produced by Grupa LOTOS. Additionally, the company sold car-care products – automotive fluids – and expanded its offering to include plasticizer products (TDAE). LOTOS Asfalt produced and sold road and industrial bitumens, emulsions and binders, trading also in heavy fuel oil. The business of LOTOS Parafiny was the production and sale of high-quality paraffin and a wide range of paraffin mass and paraffin articles for the retail market. LOTOS Kolej organised and provided railway transport services to companies of the LOTOS Group and to third parties (mainly transport of petroleum products). In line with its new strategy, the LOTOS Group’s efforts in the marketing area will focus on further development of the sales force, based on the expanded distribution network and efficient product logistics, as well as rapid development of the trading business in the area of crude oil and petroleum products. The specific objectives set for the individual areas of the marketing segment are as follows: Fuels The objective is to maximise the economic effect by flexibly controlling the product flows and further strengthening the market position: to uphold a 30% share in the domestic fuel market, to achieve sales exceeding the Gdańsk refinery’s fuel production capacities by 15%. Chain of petrol stations The objective is to continue to rapidly develop the nationwide chain of LOTOS petrol stations, as a fully controlled and highly effective distribution channel by: securing a 10% share in the domestic retail market by the end of the time horizon covered by the strategy, expanding the chain of petrol stations and enhancing sales through the existing chain. Other petroleum products In the category of lubricating oils, the objective is to retain the lead of the Polish market, while in other product categories – to achieve the optimum economic effect by leveraging the available resources and market conditions. Supply chain optimisation In order to maximise its integrated margin, the LOTOS Group will focus on making optimum use of its assets and coordinating the key areas of the supply chain: planning, procurement, production and distribution. Crude oil supplies 61 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Thanks to its newly expanded processing capacities, the LOTOS Group will continue its policy aimed to diversify the routes and sources of crude oil supplies by: maintaining access to the sources of crude oil supplied via pipelines and by sea, flexibly selecting the types and routes of crude oil supplies, so as to maximise the integrated margin, intensifying its presence on the international oil market, increasing the share of its own production in crude oil supplies. 62 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Overview of achievements In 2010, Grupa LOTOS solidified its market position and reputation as a stable and reliable business partner, offering products of the highest quality. A key element of the Company’s market offering is service quality, understood not only in terms of basic parameters, such as uninterrupted supplies and adequate logistic infrastructure, but also as openness to novel solutions designed to facilitate mutual cooperation and settlement of accounts (e.g. electronic transfer of data, e-invoices). Another vital element of the Company’s offering is the ability to deliver products tailor-made to meet specific requirements. In 2010, the LOTOS Group achieved a 31.3% share in the Polish fuel market, the target planned in the LOTOS Group’s strategy to be achieved only in 2012. In line with the new strategy for the years 2011–2015, unveiled in November 2010, this market share is to be upheld in the coming years. Share of the LOTOS Group in the fuel market (%) In 2010, the LOTOS Group’s total sales volume amounted to 8.8 million tonnes on a consolidated basis, having grown 16% on the previous year. The major contributor to the increase were higher sales of diesel and heavy fuel oils. As the successive units constructed as part of the 10+ Programme were being launched, the volume and structure of Grupa LOTOS’ turnover on the international markets was also changing. The more crude oil was being processed, the higher was the output of petroleum products for domestic and export sale. For instance, an increase was recorded in exports of engine gasolines, reformate and heavy fuel oil. In July 2010, export sales of naphtha – a new product in the LOTOS Group’s portfolio – were launched. LOTOS Group’s sales (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group 63 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Sales of engine fuels In 2010, engine fuels were sold mainly on the Polish market to retail customers, foreign companies, institutions and petrol station operators. The total volume of engine gasolines sold was 11% higher than a year before. Domestic sales of Grupa LOTOS’ gasoline remained on a par with the 2009 level, which means that the market for the product was quite stable. Exports of engine gasolines grew 75% year on year, and were transported by sea to the UK, Swedish and Dutch markets. LOTOS Group’s sales – gasolines (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group In 2010, a 2% year-on-year rise was recorded in sales of premium LOTOS Dynamic 98 gasolines. Sales of LOTOS Dynamic 98 (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group (*) In 2007, sales of LOTOS Dynamic 98 were only launched in October. In 2010, there was a nearly 10% growth in total sales of diesel oil relative to the previous year. This level of growth is mainly attributable to domestic sales of the product. LOTOS Group’s sales – diesel oils (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group 64 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 In the category of diesel oils, in addition to standard fuels for diesel engines, which are highly valued by operators of delivery vehicle and lorry fleets, another important product was the LOTOS Dynamic Diesel premium fuel. In 2010, its sales rose by 23% year over year. Sales of LOTOS Dynamic Diesel (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group (*) In 2007, sales of LOTOS Dynamic Diesel were only launched in October. Sales of light fuel oil 1 2010 brought an 18% year-on-year increase in sales of light fuel oil produced by the LOTOS Group. Sales better than initial expectations resulted from higher demand for the product as the heating season – due to the long and harsh winter – was prolonged. LOTOS Group’s sales – light fuel oil (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group 65 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 1 Since November 2010, the product has been classified as diesel oil for heating purposes. Sales of aviation fuels The total volume of JET aviation fuel sold by the LOTOS Group fell in 2010 by 31% from the previous year’s level. The decline was caused by lower sales on the Polish market and in seaborne export. In the domestic market, the decrease was the effect of lower demand for Grupa LOTOS’ aviation fuel from Poland’s key player on that market. Seaborne exports were sent to Sweden, Finland and Denmark. As for export by land, in 2010 two new customers for aviation fuel were acquired on the Czech market, which translated into a 77% year-on-year rise in sales through that channel. LOTOS Group’s sales – aviation fuel (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group Sales of engine, industrial and process oils In 2010, a 17% increase was reported in total sales of lubricating and process oils on a year-on-year basis, of which the domestic volume remained basically flat, whereas export sales surged by 56%. The rise in total sales was driven largely by higher sales of process oils. 2010 was another year of slackening consumption of industrial oils in the wake of the crisis. While businesses were slowly rebuilding their production capacities, purchases of lubricants – a material cost item were kept at a level lower than before 2009. Concurrently, increased market interest in innovative industrial products was recorded. On the market of engine oils, interest in one-season mineral oils weakened further, chiefly on the back of modernisation of the agricultural machinery base. Similarly in the automotive market, a shift of demand from mineral engine oils to semi-synthetic or synthetic oils was seen. As the leader of the mineral oils segment, LOTOS Oil was hit the hardest by the falling demand for that product category. By adding LOTOS Quazar oils to its offering and focusing on sales of semi-synthetic and synthetic products, the Company is seeking to steadily increase its share in the market for those products. LOTOS Group’s sales – lubricating and process oils (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group 66 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Sales of bitumens Relative to 2009, 2010 saw a 5% growth in total sales of bitumens, driven by the launch of regular seaborne sales, which led to a nearly 50% growth in exports on a year-on-year basis. Bitumens were exported to such countries as Romania, the Baltic States, Nordic countries, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Lower domestic demand for bitumens, due principally to the long and harsh winter followed by floods, pushed down sales by 8% year on year. It should be noted that in September 2010 demand for bitumens began to grow at a brisker rate, as road contracts planned under the National Roads Construction Programme were started. LOTOS Group’s sales – bitumens (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group In 2010, sales of modified bitumens remained flat relative to the year before. LOTOS Group’s sales – modified bitumens (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group Sales of heavy fuel oil In 2010, total sales of Grupa LOTOS’ heavy fuel oil surged 137% relative to the previous year, with domestic sales staying largely flat compared with 2009. As the units built under the 10+ Programme were being launched and the product yield grew, the Company needed to secure markets for those products with a favourable relationship between demand and prices. Consequently, in addition to the existing foreign markets, such as the Netherlands or Sweden, sales of 67 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 heavy fuel oil were also launched on markets outside Europe. LOTOS Group’s sales – heavy fuel oil (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group Sales of paraffin In 2010, total sales of paraffin remained unchanged compared with the previous year. Candle paraffin was sold mainly domestically, to leading manufacturers of candles and votive candles. Additionally, cooperation was developed with manufacturers of artificial fertilisers, wood-based products, paints and varnishes, rubber and building materials. The main export markets were Germany, the Netherlands and Slovenia. LOTOS Group’s sales – paraffin (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group Development of the chain of petrol stations The share of Grupa LOTOS in the retail fuel market in 2010 stood at 7.3%. As at the end of 2010, the chain of LOTOS petrol stations comprised 324 outlets, including: 154 own stations, 109 partner stations, and 61 patronage stations. Number of LOTOS petrol stations 68 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 The aggregate number of own and partner stations rose by 21 relative to 2009. Within the chain of own stations, six new Motorway Service Areas were opened in 2010 – two pairs on the A4 motorway (Rachowice – Kozłów and Witowice – Oleśnica) and one pair at the PoliceŁęka interchange on the A2 motorway. The range of products available through the LOTOS petrol stations included both standard and premium (LOTOS Dynamic) fuels. Sales through own and partner stations grew by 17% year over year. Sales of LOTOS Dynamic fuels through own stations (tonnes) Source: LOTOS Group In addition to fuels, LOTOS petrol stations sell a wide range of products typically offered by convenience-style shops – small retail outlets offering mainly groceries, confectionaries, beverages and other consumer staples such as newspapers and magazines, cigarettes, batteries, etc. Some stations have dedicated food service areas where snacks and refreshments may be bought. The offering is complemented by additional services, such as car wash or compressor services. The Company’s priority objective is to develop the chain of own stations. The target number of own stations which Grupa LOTOS plans to achieve is supposed to allow it to effectively run and develop customer loyalty schemes, intended to boost sales. In 2011, the Company will resume plans to work towards entering the segment of low-cost stations. This should allow it to effectively acquire potential locations in areas with relatively lower purchasing power. Plans also include further, gradual withdrawal from the patronage stations channel, assuming that cooperation with selected stations would be carried on under the partner stations formula. Logistics One of the logistics function’s primary goals, both in 2010 and in subsequent years, is to develop a flexible system to accommodate changing needs in the area of sales and production. The logistics function’s success is measured as a level of support it is able to provide for the Company’s commercial activities, taking into account the seasonal nature of petroleum product sales, and the ability to flexibly respond to an unforeseen rise or fall in sales. In 2010, Grupa LOTOS focused its efforts on adapting the logistics system so that it could handle the distribution of new products obtained following the completion of the 10+ Programme, the creation and replenishment of substantial amounts of mandatory stocks, as well as projects aimed to expand the handling capacities of its fuel depots. The Company completed the upgrade of two depots, as part of which the fuels handling technology was adapted to meet the latest 69 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 requirements. Following the refinery’s expansion as part of the 10+ Programme and the significant increase in fuel sales, the Company needed to increase the level of inventories and feedstock, which required adjustment of inventory levels to both current and future needs. The network of depots used in 2010 was being optimised on an ongoing basis. The number of third-party depots, fuel volumes and fuel types distributed by independent operators were regularly adjusted to account for market needs and newly secured sources of supplies. Work was undertaken to control and minimise losses throughout the supply chain. A plan of mandatory stock turnover was implemented with a view to replenishing mandatory stocks in the most cost-effective way. Work on those projects is expected to be continued in the coming years. In 2010, efforts were also made to identify potential synergies within the LOTOS Group in the logistics area, which would enable economies of scale to be achieved with respect to transport and storage. Rail transport In order to ensure highly effective use of their assets, as well as economically efficient, smooth and secure distribution of their products, the LOTOS Group companies commission rail transport services from a subsidiary, LOTOS Kolej. Apart from the provision of services to other members of the LOTOS Group, the strategic objective of LOTOS Kolej is to diversify its revenue structure into internal and external sources of income. The minimum target share of external customers for rail transport services has been set at 10% (in 2010, the figure was 26%). LOTOS Kolej offers its customers a comprehensive portfolio of services, which combines freight transportation (petroleum and chemical products, and intermodal transportation services), lease of freight cars, and rail siding management services in Gdańsk, Czechowice, Jasło and at the Rypin storage depot. This model guarantees low costs and high service quality. LOTOS Kolej ranks third among the leading freight rail carriers in Poland (second among private carriers). According to the data of the Polish Rail Transportation Authority from December, after the first three quarters of 2010, the company’s share in the domestic market for intermodal freight transportation services was 22% (as measured by freight activity).

Annual Report 2010 Sea transport Freight transport by sea is a vital element of Grupa LOTOS’ logistics chain. The Company enjoys a considerable market advantage offered by the direct access to product pipelines linking the Gdańsk refinery to the liquid fuel handling facilities at Port Północny. In 2010, nearly 300 tankers docked at the Naftoport, Port Północny and Siarkopol terminals to unload crude oil, petroleum products and biocomponents, and to load petroleum products from Grupa LOTOS intended for exports. A major year-on-year rise in the number of ships handled at the facilities was caused by stronger export sales driven by the projects implemented as part of the 10+ Programme. The liquid fuel handling terminal operated by Naftoport handles tankers with maximum draught of 15 metres and the capacity to load up to 150 thousand tonnes of crude oil or petroleum products. This allows Grupa LOTOS to export the surplus products and sell them on the markets in Scandinavia and Northern and Western Europe. The direct connection to the port also makes it easier to arrange for and carry out import deliveries of petroleum products, including diesel oils and the light fuel oil component. Grupa LOTOS is in an advantageous position of having a refinery in a short distance from a cargo handling terminal, which allows it to diversify the sources of supply and facilitates the shipping of crude oil from the Company’s own reserves under the Baltic Sea and, in the near future, crude oil produced from the reserves under the North Sea. Grupa LOTOS is consistent in its efforts to take over the management of cargo transportation by sea. Apart from ensuring greater control, this would help streamline the planning process as regards cargo handling at ports and also reduce the frequency and costs of ship detention. LOTOS brand Building a strong brand and a distinctive brand image is a key theme of the LOTOS Group’s strategic assumptions for 2011–2015 and development directions until 2020.

Annual Report 2010 packages, employee benefits, an investment and pension benefits fund, etc.), harness the maximum potential from the employees, refine the periodic performance evaluation system by adding a goal setting and development-oriented task assigning mechanism, create conditions conducive to effective development and practical application of the acquired skills and competencies (the LOTOS Academy training and development scheme), enhance the existing incentive tools – linking financial and non-financial incentives to employee performance, and implement employee surveys. It is the underlying assumption of the HR management strategy to treat employees as our most valuable asset. Remuneration policy The Company has an up-to-date and transparent remuneration system in place. Its key component is the base salary determined on the basis of national payroll reports compiled by professional HR consultancies. Base salaries received by the employees of Grupa LOTOS and its subsidiaries have risen by 2% since January 2010. In addition to the base pay, employees may also receive annual bonuses, special bonuses, length-of-services awards, and severance pays on retirement due to old age or disability. They are also eligible for the company social benefits fund. A new component was added to the remuneration system in 2010 – a quarterly incentive bonus allocated per organisational unit. Its amount can range from 3% to 10% of total base salaries payable to the unit employees. The incentive bonus is a discretionary component of the remuneration package and all supervisors (masters, foremen and team leaders) participate in the bonus award process. The employee remuneration policy, set out in the Grupa LOTOS Employee Collective Bargaining Agreement, has been in force and effect since April 20th 2005 and provides for the following remuneration constituents: monthly base salary, allowances payable under the labour law (night duty allowance, holiday pay, and overtime allowance), annual bonus of up to 10% of the annual remuneration, paid in the first half of the ensuing year, provided that corporate performance targets (such as revenues or net profit) are achieved, quarterly incentive bonus allocated per organisational unit whose amount ranges from 3% to 10% of total quarterly base salaries. In addition, the Company sets aside a pool of special bonuses, paid as reward for excellent individual performance, work on project teams or extra effort. Apart from the standard remuneration package, the employees are entitled to receive the following: length-of-service award paid at five-year intervals after 15 years of service, one-off severance pay received on retirement due to old age or disability, which is disbursed on the employment contract termination date. It is the Company’s aim to ensure that the remuneration paid is market-competitive and attractive for the employees. For each position, a market median has been set as a target against which the remuneration should be benchmarked. The medians were computed based on the data furnished by external HR consultancies. Twice a year, base salary levels are compared against the pre-determined market medians and raised by the supervisors as appropriate. In 2010, this benchmarking procedure was combined with the periodic remuneration review provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Hence, the benchmark pay adjustments coincided with by pay increases awarded to employees recognised for outstanding performance. Social benefits scheme The employees are eligible to participate in the company social benefits fund on the terms defined in the Rules of Participation in the Company Social Benefits Fund. Grupa LOTOS and the subsidiaries covered by the common social policy arrangements have increased the base contribution to the company social benefits fund provided for in the Act of March 4 1994 to 100% of the average monthly salary in Poland per each employee and to 6.25% of the average monthly salary per each retiree. This led to achieving an almost 100% performance on the managementand union-approved social expenditure budget for 2010. Under the Rules, the persons covered by the social benefits scheme include: the employees of Grupa LOTOS and its subsidiaries, their children aged from six to eighteen, retired employees, spouses of deceased employees and retired employees, and persons eligible for pre-retirement allowances. The entitled persons are offered various forms of social support provided for in the approved budget: holiday allowances, rehabilitation allowances for children with disabilities confirmed by a doctor certificate, housing loans, and non-refundable financial aid to persons in a difficult life situation. Social expenditure is on the rise due to a dynamic corporate growth and ever-higher number of newly recruited personnel who consider a satisfactory wage and rich social benefits package an important factor when applying for a job.

Therefore, internal recruitment is a priority and each job application received from the LOTOS Group’s employee is taken into consideration. This approach facilitates knowledge transfers across the LOTOS Group. At the same time, the Company recruits persons from outside the organisation – through classifieds, online ads, media announcements and career fairs – who contribute the skills and competencies necessary to successfully deal with new tasks. Recruitment procedures are carried out in a professional and transparent manner, in accordance with the adopted and continuously refined standards. Details concerning recruitment procedures and policies are posted on the intranet and the internet. Internship and training programmes The LOTOS Group is an active promoter of educational and professional development of university undergraduates and secondary school students. In 2010, 128 persons participated in our internship programme, including students from the Gdańsk University of Technology, University of Gdańsk, University of Science and Technology in Kraków, Cracow University of Technology, Technical University of Łódź and Gdańsk Maritime University. 33 students from secondary schools in Gdynia, Gdańsk and Sopot enrolled in our vocational training scheme. The Company also helps university graduates and undergraduates take their first steps on the labour market. It once again participated in the Wakacyjny Staż (Summer Internship) programme organised by the Gdańsk town hall under the patronage of the Mayor of Gdańsk. As part of the efforts aimed at strengthening the links between the academic community and the business world, the Company funded 18 graduate and undergraduate internships. LOTOS Academy Launched in 2004, the LOTOS Academy is a training and development programme which aims to build a partnership-oriented corporate team able to deliver the task of creating a transparent, modern, efficient and powerful organisation, which would be well-positioned to successfully compete on the EU market. The mission of the Akademia LOTOS initiative is to entrench a work culture and a management philosophy built around a model employee, one who consciously participates in the process of creating added value for customers and shareholders and whose main attributes include competence, values, responsibility and creativity. When designing the Akademia LOTOS training and professional development programmes, the Company is guided by the principles of: coherence – a training scheme must be consistent with the Company’s mission, strategy and long-term development plans, and aligned with other HR management areas, accountability – all participants in the design and implementation of a training and development programme are accountable for its effects, accessibility – trainings are meant for all employee groups, continuity – professional development planning is a continuous process, aligned with the periodic performance evaluation system, individual career paths, succession planning and development programmes designed for a particular employee group, flexibility – training scheme planning and implementation process must account for the fast-changing external conditions and changes in the qualifications expectations. The following tools are applied when defining the employee development directions: Skills map – a set of key skills required to properly perform a task, Codes of ethics – adopted codes of conduct (the Code of Conduct for Grupa LOTOS’ Employees, the Code of Managers, the Corporate Decalogue), Periodic Performance Assessment System (SOOP) – facilitates reviewing the employees’ skills and competencies, and target setting. 81 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 As part of its Training Calendar of the LOTOS Academy in 2010, the Company helped the employees develop their skills and competencies during the following training sessions: Enhanced efficiency – stress management techniques, Creative thinking and creative problem solving, Public speaking – presentation skills, Work planning and scheduling, Team leading, Work-Life Balance, MS Office, Task delegation and execution, Handling difficult conversations, Employee motivation and evaluation. The agendas and schedules of training sessions held as part of the Training Calendar are available on LOTOSTRADA, the corporate intranet, under the LOTOS Academy tab, administered by the Office for Human Resources Management. The themes to be covered during the training sessions are determined based on the analysis of the skills map, the SOOP results, and employee development plans at individual organisational units. Also, they take into account the corporate development requirements. The other type of education and professional development programmes implemented as part of the LOTOS Academy initiative are those dedicated to particular employee groups. The most important ones include: Induction programme for new employees, Certification programme for production employees, Seminars for the management, Programme Staff 10+, Programme MASTER, Management competence programme for technical service employees, Series of training sessions titled “Management by objectives – financial incentive systems”, Corporate edition of the MBA (Master of Business Administration) course.

The collective bargaining mechanism is the most widely used method of negotiating the terms of employer-employee relationships in companies comprising the LOTOS Group. As a rule, collective negotiations are also used to deal with any matters subject to collective labour laws, particularly salary increase rates and the issues of conflict elimination. A good example for how the corporate dialogue and adequate communication are put to use to solve a conflict is how the dispute which emerged at the turn of 2009 and 2010 was solved. The dispute concerned regulations of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the Anti-Crisis Package signed, on February 10 2009. Despite justified doubts on part of the employer about the compliance of the demands made with the Labour Law provisions which regulate collective bargaining (confirmed by two opinions of leading labour law experts), negotiations with social partners were commenced, which – after a month and a half – put an end to the conflict when a mutually satisfactory agreement was concluded. Social partners in the field of Health, Safety and Environment The social labour inspectorate function at Grupa LOTOS is a platform for cooperation between the employer and the trade unions in matters concerned with Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). Currently, the Social Labour Inspectorate comprises four members appointed for the years 2008–2011, who are released from their employee duties in order to more effectively monitor the level of compliance with the HSE regulations. The Social Labour Inspectorate, together with the employer’s representatives, was also responsible for monitoring whether the HSE regulations were observed by subcontractors responsible for the delivery of projects under the 10+ Programme. In 2010, Mr. Krzysztof Chyliński, the Social Labour Inspector at Grupa LOTOS, was awarded an honorary distinction by the Regional Labour Inspector in Gdańsk as the most devoted Social Labour Inspector. Employee Council In Autumn 2010, an election was held among the employees of Grupa LOTOS to elect the seven members of the Employee Council of the second term. Two election rounds were held, and the overall turnout was approximately 37%. The terms of cooperation between the employer and the Council are set out in the 83 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 agreement executed with the Employee Council of the first term, which was amended an annex reflecting the amendments to the legal framework. Let’s talk about LOTOS Programme Launched in 2006, the Let’s talk about LOTOS programme is a unique platform for an open social dialogue at the Company, as part of which several dozen sessions with employees are held each year. Participants discuss the corporate strategy, current efforts undertaken to achieve strategic objectives, and common problems concerning the Company’s functioning. This offers a double advantage of providing all employees with access to information and creating opportunities to exchange views between workers and executives. The Management Board attaches great importance to this particular formula of intracompany dialogue and considers it a vital tool in building the intellectual capital, the Company’s most precious asset. In 2010, eight Let’s talk about LOTOS meetings were held at the Company level and 56 meetings were held at the LOTOS Group level, which were attended by, respectively, 572 employees (44% of total workforce) and 2,581 employees (53% of total workforce). The initiative received positive feedback from the vast majority of participants (95.3%). Answers to the question “Do you think regular meetings should be held to discuss the current situation at Grupa LOTOS and the entire LOTOS Group?” Safety at work The safety of our employees and contractors is our priority. Particular attention is paid to efforts aimed at maintaining high safety standards, minimising risks, reducing accident rates, and raising awareness of and promoting a safe working culture. This has helped Grupa LOTOS earn the reputation of an employer offering a workplace that is safe, well-equipped and well-organised. We spare no effort to ensure that: the workplace is properly organised, regular workplace surveys are performed, the best possible precautionary measures are applied as regards technical processes and people’s health, the threat identification and man-machine-environment risk assessment system is up-to-date, consulting, oversight and inspection tasks are performed on a regular basis, hands-on trainings and dedicated workshops are organised, partnerships are fostered with the public administration, domestic trade organisations, and scientific and research institutions, experience is shared with partner organisations from the Polish chemicals industry, employee awareness and commitment is raised to achieve a safe working culture. As regards safety at the workplace, Grupa LOTOS is held in high esteem by international companies, visiting external auditors, and insurance companies. We concentrate our efforts on developing safety standards for the entire LOTOS Group. Workplace safety awareness is raised among employees by: trainings and other skill-development initiatives; education on HSE-related matters; encouraging involvement in the development and implementation of the corporate HSE policy, 84 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 organising awareness campaigns and knowledge testing in an appealing form. The year 2010 saw the first pilot edition of the HSE Day at Grupa LOTOS. The Company is also engaged in a number of non-obligatory initiatives designed to promote the HSE themes in an easy-to-understand and engaging manner. These involve: using the most advanced process tools and methods, keeping employees abreast of the current situation at the plant, and industry news from Poland and abroad, with the use of available communication channels. The most noteworthy initiatives seeking to improve HSE-related communication with the LOTOS Group’s employees include: publishing articles devoted to health and safety at work in each issue of the LOTOSFERA monthly staff newsletter, publishing the Bezpiecznik monthly (in 2009, it won a distinction from the Custom Publishing Association in the internal newsletter category, in recognition of “uninterrupted reporter-like vigilance of the HSE unit employees who offer practical tips how to avoid hazards using on-site examples”), dedicated workplace safety displays with materials promoting accident-free work environment, examples of dangerous occurrences provided by the employees, and answers to enquiries submitted via HSE boxes or in e-mails, “Accident Rate” boards placed on the premises of the refinery, providing detailed figures on accidents and hazardous occurrences reported at plants and subsidiaries, “Workplace safety” intranet panel providing employees with access to tips on how to stay healthy and fit, video tutorials, training materials, trade news from the world, and knowledge tests, “Workplace safety” binder to be found on the industrial premises, containing educational materials on safety at work; developing the employee training system: producing a video tutorial designed for employees, visitors, and contractors, featuring potential hazards, site rules, a to-do and not-todo list, rules covering protective clothing and equipment, jobs involving fire risks, and fire precautions, practicing emergencies (accidents at work, chemical alerts, and evacuations), and practising emergency scenarios set out in the Safety Report, jointly with LOTOS Straż and the Refinery Response Team, organising trainings for a dedicated first-aid team of production workers responsible for providing medical care until the arrival of a doctor. Aids and tools used during trainings include video tutorials, photos, multimedia presentations, educational games, and group and individual exercises. Considering the implementation of the 10+ Programme projects, intense construction and assembly work, and a large number of external contractors’ employees moving around the refinery, a need arose to promote awareness of issues related to responsible on-site behaviour, safe performance of work activities and compliance with internal HSE and fire safety rules. To this end, the management staff and employees of external contractors: are furnished with Grupa LOTOS Site Rules and the internal safety requirements for Grupa LOTOS; before entering the premises of the refinery, are handed the leaflet “General site rules at Grupa LOTOS”; prior to commencement of work, receive training in internal safety rules and safe performance of work activities; a video tutorial for employees, visitors and subcontractors was recorded in 2010.; are regularly assessed for compliance with the internal HSE requirements; are penalised with fines or temporarily/permanently prohibited from entering the Company premises in the event of non-compliance with the HSE rules and procedures; attend meetings with Grupa LOTOS’ employees devoted to internal work safety standards and most frequent irregularities in the area of health and safety at work. The HSE team and representatives of external contractors monitor work done under a project. Moreover, the Company delegates its representatives to project sites who provide support and advice to site supervisors. Short-term plans: management staff engagement programme designed to encourage compliance with safety rules and procedures among employees, raising workplace safety awareness by organising and encouraging participation in the World Day for Safety and Health at Work, putting in place an incentive system to reward contractors’ staff for safe behaviour and for encouraging proper attitudes, implementation of a uniform assessment system for testing production plants and subsidiaries for compliance with the HSE and fire safety requirements. Medium-term and long-term plans: building a safe work culture with the support from the management and lower-level staff, implementation of a programme based on the lessons learnt by Grupa LOTOS and other organisations around the world, as a preventive measure in the area of safety at work, 85 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 establishing uniform safety standards across the LOTOS Group, reducing the lost time injury frequency ratio below the average for European refineries by eliminating injury risks and implementing working conditions improvement projects on the basis of the most advanced solutions and methods known in the world. 86 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Society Open relations with its social environment which are built on confidence and cooperation constitute an important value for the LOTOS Group. We have a significant non-economic influence on the society. The completion of the 10+ Programme serves as a clear proof for it. For years, the LOTOS Group has also invested in comprehensive projects aimed at counteracting social problems in its environment such as increasing traffic safety and protecting endangered species as well as in long-term sporting education programmes for children and youths. Impact of the 10+ Programme on the Company’s environment The capital expenditure programme dubbed 10+ Programme made a major indirect impact on the Company’s immediate environment. The aspects of that impact are presented in the chart below: Implementing and endorsing European safety standards Seeking to ensure a high level of safety during the implementation of the 10+ Programme, the Company had a clause on cooperation in and coordination of the overall HSE activity incorporated in the agreement with the Project Managing Contractor (PMC). HSE procedures and instructions Considering the scale of the 10+ Programme, a number of procedures and instructions for contractors were developed in order to facilitate the monitoring of the HSE performance (HSE plans). The purpose of doing so was to compile a set of guidelines and recommendations on the health, safety and environmental protection management during large-scale capex projects such as the 10+ Programme. The documents were attached as schedules to agreements and contracts signed with contractors. HSE best practices Multiple brochures were produced in order to more effectively promote the issues concerning health, safety and environmental protection at the workplace. All general contractors were provided with the brochures and the subcontractors were placed under an obligation to read them. Safety boards Adequate monitoring and assessment tools were called for to help build a positive safety culture during the 10+ Programme implementation. To spur healthy competition among contractors, special safety boards were placed at the construction sites. 87 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 HSE site inspections To monitor the construction site for health, safety and environmental protection performance, the Company and the PMC, jointly with the site managers, the contractor’s HSE team and the construction site inspectors, carried out weekly HSE inspections. Each time, a post-inspection report was prepared by Grupa LOTOS and sent to the contractor concerned. If any corrective actions were required, the contractor was expected to deliver a report on the corrective measures performed. HSE reviews In line with the procedures developed for the 10+ Programme, the Company and the PMC performed a series of HSE reviews at key contractors. This was done to assess the progress of implementation by contractors and subcontractors of the HSE guidelines and recommendations set forth in the documents prepared for the purposes of the 10+ Programme and of the overall implementation of HSE measures at the construction sites. Monthly HSE coordination meetings In order to promote cooperation between the project owner and the contractors, Grupa LOTOS and the PMC held meetings with the personnel responsible for ensuring and monitoring the health, safety and environmental protection performance. During the meetings, the contractors reported on the progress of work aimed at improving the HSE standards, and recapitulation of the past month and action plans for the coming month were made, whose major purpose was to increase the overall safety level. Creating new jobs at Grupa LOTOS and in its sphere of influence New projects entail new jobs. To fulfil the staffing needs arising in connection with the launch of technological units built as part of the 10+ Programme, Grupa LOTOS hired and trained 120 new personnel, including 30 persons with an engineering degree. In addition, 3,450 external workers were engaged to work on the construction sites for the 10+ Programme. Facilitating CAPEX projects and business development of contractors, subcontractors and suppliers As at the end of 2010, the total amount paid by Grupa LOTOS to contractors under contracts for the engineering, procurement and construction works under the 10+ Programme reached PLN 5.5bn. Value of services purchased under the 10+ Programme (PLN bn) as at December 31 2010 It should be noted that 41% of the expenditure incurred by Grupa LOTOS to contract services under the 10+ Programme was spent on the domestic market, of which PLN 0.51bn (26%) was paid to contractors from the Gdańsk region, and PLN 1.66bn (74%) – to contractors from the rest of the country. Value of services purchased on the domestic market under the 10+ Programme (PLN bn) as at December 31 2010 Cooperation with leading international companies and technology transfer 88 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 The technology solutions implemented as part of the 10+ Programme were selected from among the most advanced and most efficient ones. The technology providers included global leaders: Shell Global Solutions, Kellogg Brown and Root, Lurgi GmbH, and Chevron Lummus Global. Under the offset arrangements with the Polish government related to the purchase of the F-16 fighter aircraft, the US-based company Lockheed Martin helped finance the technology transfer and provided support for the entire Programme. The world’s leading industrial engineering firms, boasting proven track-records in the provision of engineering and project management services for large refining and chemical projects, were contracted for the 10+ Programme: Technip (Italy), ABB Lummus Global (Germany), Lurgi (Germany/Poland), Fluor (Netherlands/Poland). A major contribution towards the implementation of individual projects, particularly in the area of assembly and construction, was made by contractors from the Gdańsk region and construction companies from all over Poland. Enhancing the state’s energy security and diversifying the supply sources by ensuring an uninterrupted supply of energy carriers The new technical ability of the Gdańsk refinery to process various types of crude oil, as well as own hydrocarbon reserves and close vicinity of freight-handling marine terminals add to energy security and promote diversification of the supply sources. CSR initiatives The LOTOS Group’s CSR activity is focused on projects and initiatives matching the corporate mission, growth strategy and values embodied in the LOTOS brand, which are designed to benefit customers and local communities. The Company seeks to align its business and CSR objectives. Two key priority areas for action have been identified: environmental protection and wildlife conservation – with a particular focus placed on the preservation of natural systems of the Baltic Sea, people and their environment – which involves providing support to public healthcare institutions, the disabled, and the initiatives promoting science and education, sports, and physical education among the young generation. Environmental projects In line with its CSR strategy, the LOTOS Group is engaged in pro-environmental work, understood as any activity that helps preserve the structure or function of a natural ecosystem. As part of its environmental commitment, the Company initiates or supports projects aimed at increasing environmental awareness and encouraging pro-environmental behaviours. Cooperation with the Foundation for the Development of the University of Gdańsk In 2009, Grupa LOTOS forged partnership with the Foundation for the Development of the University of Gdańsk and the Hel Marine Station of the University’s Institute of Oceanography. Joint efforts were undertaken to prevent the extinction of the endangered marine species, notably the harbour porpoise, also known in Poland as the Baltic Sea dolphin. Apart from these efforts, the partnership paved the way for further projects which aim to promote knowledge on the Baltic Sea biodiversity and provide information on how the endangered species may be protected. Furthermore, the Company financed the purchase of specialist equipment which helps prevent the accidental by-catch of porpoises. A project called “Active protection of the porpoise against by-catch” is implemented in the Puck Bay area. Grupa LOTOS made a cash donation to fund diverse environmental measures, including the protection of the harbour porpoise, which was expended to purchase hydroacoustic detectors and pots for fishing. As part of joint efforts to protect the ecosystems of the Baltic Sea, the Company, for another consecutive year, co-organised the Porpoise Day, an event held to educate the public on the behaviour and protection of that particular species. Cooperation with the Company’s partners also resulted in the project “Learn about and protect biodiversity of the Baltic Sea”, which aimed to increase awareness about natural resources conservation and to address the issues concerning marine mammals living in the Baltic Sea. In 2010, a competition was held among 53 junior high school students to test their knowledge on the biodiversity of the Baltic Sea and its protection. Also, an awareness campaign titled “Wildlife in the water under the keel” was run, promoting protection of the Natura 2000 areas and encouraging the public to get involved in the conservation planning process. The campaign was conducted onboard vessels operated by Żegluga Gdańska between May 1 and August 31 2010. 75,000 leaflets were handed out and ten education boards were installed. To complement these efforts, advertising hoardings were displayed in Gdańsk, Gdynia, Sopot and the Hel Peninsula, promoting the conservation of habitats in the Natura 2000 designated areas. Grupa LOTOS’ cooperation with the Foundation for the Development of the University of Gdańsk and the Hel Marine Station of the University’s Institute of Oceanography was recognised by the participants of the CSR Best Practices Trade Fair organised by the Responsible Business Forum and held on the premises of the Warsaw University Library in Autumn 2010. The Company’s biodiversity protection projects won second place among 28 corporations and NGOs participating in the fair. Clean Up the Baltic Sea, Clean Up the World As part of the international Clean Up the Baltic Sea and Clean Up the World campaigns, the Company launched the project “Let’s clean up the Baltic Sea! Let’s clean up the world!”, targeted at students from primary and secondary schools in Gdańsk, Gdynia and Sopot. Its purpose was to develop the sense of responsibility for the environment, particularly the Baltic Sea, including the responsibility for keeping it clean. The event was located on the Sobieszewska Island, which is in close proximity to the Company’s premises and which has considerable environmental value. The students cleaned up a stretch of woods and beach and then joined in a special educational and entertainment event focused around environmental themes. Some 300 children from ten preschools and primary 89 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 schools participated in the project, and around 60 sixty-litre garbage bags were filled. Cooperation with the foundation Agency of Regional Air Quality Monitoring As the Company’s business encompasses the chemicals sector, we feel particularly responsible for the environment. Apart from running education campaigns, we cooperate with environmental organisations, including the foundation Agency of Regional Air Quality Monitoring (ARMAAG). In 2010, Grupa LOTOS provided financial assistance to the foundation to facilitate the extension of the SoundPlan IT system and upgrade of the AM2 monitoring station in Gdańsk Kaczeńce. The purpose of these efforts was to develop, maintain and improve the regional monitoring system in the Gdańsk agglomeration and in Tczew, which is a step towards achieving the ultimate goal – building a modern air quality information system and tools for assessing the impact of emitters on the air quality. Community projects LOTOS Safety Academy The LOTOS Safety Academy (Akademia Bezpieczeństwa LOTOS) programme comprises a number of initiatives aimed to prevent road traffic accidents involving young children, this being achieved through traffic safety educational projects promoting the rules of safe behaviour on the road among children and adults. The following projects were implemented in 2010 as part of the programme: LOTOS – Safe Journey to School (LOTOS – Bezpieczna droga do szkoły), Free Reflectors (Uwolnić odblaski) art competition (promoting the reflective clothing and accessories) Auto Rally and Traffic Safety Picnic in Sopot, Communication efforts targeted at the employees. The LOTOS Safety Academy projects are aimed at members of the general public (mainly children and young people) and at the LOTOS Group’s employees. LOTOS – Safe Way to School (LOTOS Bezpieczna droga do szkoły) is an education and accident prevention programme run jointly with the Polish Police and road safety experts, designed to prevent traffic accidents involving schoolchildren. Targeted principally at first graders, the programme seeks to encourage students to pay attention to road safety issues, and to teach them safe traffic behaviour. The low level of traffic safety, particularly among pedestrians, is a widespread social problem in Poland. The programme offers an opportunity to participate in educational meetings with police officers and road safety experts to learn about traffic safety rules and safe places to play. All participants are presented with reflective accessories and road safety educational materials funded by the Company. The programme is implemented in the areas of operation of selected LOTOS Group subsidiaries: in the Province of Gdańsk and in the counties lying within the sphere of influence of LOTOS Czechowice and LOTOS Jasło. The LOTOS Safe Way to School initiatives have been implemented in the Gdańsk region, Jasło and Czechowice since 2001, 1998 and 2004, respectively. Over the past five years, the Company has funded some 61 thousand reflective accessories and 38 thousand educational packages (13 thousand items of each type in 2010 alone). Free Reflectors (Uwolnić Odblaski) competition forms an integral part of the LOTOS Safety Academy programme and is devised for first-grade students from the Province of Gdańsk and the counties of Jasło and Bielsko-Biała, particularly those participating in the LOTOS – Safe Way to School project. Its overall aim is to warn children about road traffic dangers and to help them develop a habit of wearing reflective accessories which reduce the likelihood of accidents. LOTOS Safety Academy in figures – 2010: participants of the LOTOS – Safe Way to School programme: 13,000 children, including 9,000 in the Province of Gdańsk, 2,000 in Jasło and 2,000 in Czechowice-Dziedzice, participants of the Free Reflectors art competition: 500 students from 70 schools, participants of the Auto Rally and Traffic Safety Picnic in Sopot: 5,000. In 2010, the value of the LOTOS Safety Academy programme was recognised by the Home&Market; magazine which awarded Grupa LOTOS the title of the Best Partner in Business in the Corporate Social Responsibility category and strongly emphasised the Company’s commitment to road traffic safety. LOTOS Safety Academy was also shortlisted for inclusion in the 2010 Best Practices Report compiled by the Responsible Business Forum. The report serves to honour corporate practices which offer an innovative approach to a problem and at the same time bring tangible benefits to the organisation, thus creating added value for the organisation itself or for its local communities. Good Neighbour programme The Good Neighbour (Dobry Sąsiad) programme was launched in 2006. It is implemented in the city of Gdańsk, the Company’s immediate sphere of influence. Its overall objective is to raise environmental awareness and promote eco-friendly behaviour among young children. This overall objective is achieved through: involvement in the life of local communities (i.e. organising family events, sporting events, etc.), involvement in the environmental projects run in the refinery’s immediate vicinity, notably the Sobieszewska Island, offering support to selected local government projects which seek to improve the quality of life of inhabitants in the districts covered by the 90 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 programme, developing the local inhabitants’ understanding of the refinery’s operation and assuring them that it has state-of-the-art environmental security controls, tackling social inequalities by providing support to public benefit institutions and organisations, especially those helping children, involvement in long-standing initiatives aimed at inhabitants of Grupa LOTOS’ neighbouring districts, with a particular focus on children (construction of playgrounds and sports fields, and park revitalisation work). In pursuit of the programme’s objective, Grupa LOTOS, in cooperation with the Ornithology Station of the Museum and Institute of Zoology (MILZ) of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the Kuling Waterbird Research Group, and the Association of Sobieszewska Island Lovers, devised and implemented the “Protect the Wildlife of the Sobieszewska Island” programme. The following efforts were undertaken as part of the programme: proper infrastructure was built to minimise threats to the Mewia Łacha bird reserve: a three-kilometre eco-route was laid out. The final section is delineated by a rope fence, with 16 information boards installed alongside. awareness and education campaign was run: the campaign was devised for local inhabitants and tourists to show them the extraordinary natural charm of the Sobieszewska Island; twelve information boards, featuring the flora and fauna of the island, were installed and 2,000 copies of the Echa Wyspy periodical were printed, presenting natural wonders of the Sobieszewska Island, education campaign for children was run: educational lectures were delivered, which were attended by 1,048 primary and junior high school students from Gdańsk and the Pruszcz Gdański commune, and the brochure Reedbed birds was prepared as a teaching aid used during the campaign, of which 13,000 copies were printed and distributed among participants. Other community projects As part of its social commitment, Grupa LOTOS supports projects which cater for the needs and expectations of its local communities. Particular importance is attached to initiatives aiming to bridge social gaps among children and provide help to those placed in children’s homes or raised in poor or dysfunctional families. In 2010, the Company was again engaged in the preparation of the Children’s Day festivities, held at the Gdańsk-Oliwa zoo, and St. Nicholas gift-giving events in Gdańsk, Jasło and Czechowice-Dziedzice. To deliver on its corporate social responsibility policy objectives, Grupa LOTOS supports initiatives which aim to ensure equal opportunities for the disabled. In 2010, Grupa LOTOS was a partner in the following projects: III Międzynarodowe Spotkania Artystyczne (3rd International Art Fairs), organised by Centrum Spotkań Europejskich Światowid in Elbląg, Muzyka pamięcią serca (Music as Memory of the Heart) concert for the disabled, organised by the Nuta Nadziei foundation in Smętowo Graniczne. Grupa LOTOS also supports fundraising initiatives for people in need. In 2010, the Company provided assistance to the following projects: XIV Aukcja Rotariańska (14th Rotary Auction) Rotary International, organised by Elbląski Klub Rotary, Pomóż sobie i Innym (Help yourself, help others) charity concert, organised by the Gdańsk branch of the Polish Red Cross, XVIII Uroczysty Wieczór Koncertowy (18th Ceremonial Concert Night), organised by Stowarzyszenie Lion Club Neptun, Charytatywny Koncert Świąteczny (Holiday Charity Concert), organised by Gdańska Fundacja Innowacji Społecznych in Gdańsk, charity auction held during the Charity Ball organised by Sopot Rotary International Club Zeszyt dla ucznia (Notebook for a Student) fair, organised by Centrum Wspomagania Organizacji Pozarządowych in Gdańsk, Planeta Marzeń (Wonder Planet) fair for children, organised by the social welfare centre Miejski Ośrodek Pomocy Społecznej in Gdańsk. The community projects run by Grupa LOTOS gain wide recognition. In 2010, the Company was among the nominees to the Firma Dobrze Widziana (WellPerceived Company) award. The winner will be announced at a gala to be held in Spring 2011 in Warsaw. The competition is administered by Business Centre Club as part of the Human Capital Operational Programme, which promotes education campaigns and research into corporate social responsibility and supports the implementation of CSR-compliant management techniques at Polish companies. The judging criteria include CSR performance, and the quality of work environment, market communications, environmental efforts and CSR reporting. For a number of years now, the Company has been involved in important cultural events arranged in the areas of the LOTOS Group’s operation and beyond. In 2010, Grupa LOTOS co-organised the following cultural and social events: II Festiwal Solidarity of Arts (2nd Solidarity of Arts Festival), Światowy Zjazd Gdańszczan (World Gdańsk Reunion), Miesiąc Heweliusza (Johannes Hevelius Month), Święto ulicy Bohaterów Monte Cassino (Bohaterów Monte Cassino Street Celebrations), Festiwal Polskich Filmów Fabularnych (Polish Feature Film Festival), Cuda Wianki – Lato zaczyna się w Gdyni (an event marking the beginning of summer) Bieszczadzkie Spotkania ze Sztuką “Rozsypaniec” (the Rozsypaniec Bieszczady Encounters with Art), 91 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 XXVIII Międzynarodowe Obchody Święta Kultury Łemkowskiej “Łemkowska Watra” (28th International Lemkos Culture Celebration), LOTOS Jazz Festival – Bielska Zadymka Jazzowa LOTOS for sports The Company regards its CSR sporting initiatives, designed to promote sporting development of young athletes and develop sports talent that will later join local clubs or the national team, as an element of its CSR efforts reflecting its responsibility for the environment in which it operates. Education through sports is also a way to counteract incipient social pathologies, properly spend leisure time and educate young people in the spirit of healthy competition and fair play. Sporting education Grupa LOTOS together with its Partner – the Polish Ski Federation – is running one of the widest-ranging projects in the area of sporting education – “LOTOS Cup – Looking for the Champion’s Successors”, organised under the National Programme for the Development of Ski Jumping. The project came into being in 2004 and for the five subsequent seasons has been a huge organisational and sporting success, attracting considerable media attention and becoming one of the leading CSR sporting projects in Poland. The cornerstones of the initiative are to promote, on an unprecedented scale, ski jumping among kids and teenagers and discover the finest ski-jumping talent. The key objective behind the programme was to launch a system designed to actively support young athletes training at ski-jumping clubs which run their own youth sections. In the years 2004-2010, 185 pairs of skis complete with binding, 161 suits, 100 helmets and 150 ski-jumping boots were purchased for the most talented young ski jumpers from 19 clubs all over Poland. By donating a total of 596 sets of professional sports equipment, the programme made it possible to provide training to the youngest age groups. In this way Grupa LOTOS launched the largest CSR project aimed to support talented ski jumpers from Polish clubs. In addition, sports scholarships were awarded to 72 ski jumpers from the age groups 11-12 and 15-16 who finished in the top six places in the general classification of the LOTOS Cup tournament in the 2004-2010 seasons. In each of the 48 LOTOS Cup youth competitions, held between 2005 and 2010 to the World Cup format on the ski jumps in Szczyrk, Wisła, Zagórz and Zakopane, the number of competitors was 170. Three years from its inception, the first athlete trained under the “Looking for the Champion’s Successors” programme was called up to the national senior team. Maciej Kot from the Start Krokiew club of Zakopane took part in the team event of the FIS World Cup held in Finnish Lahti (March 2007) and thus one of the main objectives behind the initiative – to discover the finest Polish ski-jumping talent who could represent Poland at the world’s most famous jump sites – was accomplished. Also Kamil Stoch, who has been improving his performance from season to season and who in 2011 for the first time won one of the World Cup events (held in Zakopane), has been trained under the programme. In the 2007/2008 season, a Nordic combined youth team was selected from the wide group of talented ski jumpers – beneficiaries of the “Looking for the Champion’s Successors” programme. The coaches were assigned the mission to restore Nordic combined in Poland. In the 2010-2011 season, the programme’s beneficiaries formed the core of the Nordic combined youth team. Taking into account the goal set by the Polish Ski Federation, as well as the results of training to date, a decision was made that in 2010/2011 the scope of the “Looking for the Champion’s Successors” project would be expanded to include three LOTOS Cup Nordic combined competitions, which would be run on the facilities in Szczyrk, Wisła and Zakopane among all the age groups covered by the programme, including open senior and A junior categories. Another field of the Company’s activity connected with the support of young sportspeople is our cooperation with two youth groups training with the Lechia Gdańsk football club, on the basis of which an indoor football tournament for youthful players is held under the name of “Golden Gdańsk Lions”. The latest event attracted 78 teams of teenagers born between 1995-2000 from all around Poland, including a total of 1,073 young players. Junior GDAŃSK 2012 is a scheme operated by the Social Committee of Euro 2012 Support. As part of its work on the Social Committee of Euro 2012 Support established by the Mayor of the City of Gdańsk, of which the Company’s President is member and President of the Council of Sponsors, Grupa LOTOS has sponsored a project involving the construction of football pitches with artificial turf to be located within school grounds. The project is being implemented under the Junior Gdańsk 2012 scheme, whose objective is to build a network of football pitches within the grounds of various Gdańsk schools, with the financial support of enterprises active in the region of Pomerania. Grupa LOTOS, as the only company, has sponsored the construction of two pitches – in 2010 the first project was completed at the Primary School No. 61 in Gdańsk, while the other project has been commenced at the Junior High School No. 20 in Gdańsk. In 2010, our financial support was extended to junior ice-hockey teams. As part of that cooperation, in December 2010 an international ice-hockey tournament was played with teams coming over from Russia, Belarus and Poland, and at the beginning of 2011, the team of sub juniors supported by Grupa LOTOS won the gold medal at the Polish Youth Winter Olympic Games in Krynica Zdrój. In the area of motorsports, like in the case of other disciplines supported by Grupa LOTOS, the Company helps a group of beginners at motorcycle speedway. In 2010, an agreement was concluded with the Wybrzeże Gdańsk Speedway Club Association, which trains a new generation of racers with the utmost diligence and dedication to making the sport more popular with kids and teenagers. The aim of the Speedway Youth School is to develop young racers to join the first team of the club of GKS Wybrzeże S.A., the owner of the LOTOS Wybrzeże Gdańsk team. In the very first months after the School was opened, representatives of LOTOS Wybrzeże managed to score above-average successes, as the title of Poland’s individual speedway champion went to a thirteen year old from Gdańsk. In the previous season, the LOTOS Wybrzeże Gdańsk team also won golden “circles” of Poland Minispeedway Club Pairs Cup. Grupa LOTOS has supported training of young motorcycle racers since 2006. In previous years, the School was run by the Foundation, chaired by prominent sportsman Zenon Plech. The greatest success achieved in the period 2006-2009 was the title of Poland’s individual speedway champion won by one of the School’s pupils. The quality of the Company’s efforts aimed to promote sporting education of young people is confirmed by a Sport & Business Statuette in the “Youth Sport Programme” category of the DEMES 2010 Sport & Business Awards in recognition of the National Programme for the Development of Ski Jumping “Looking the Champion’s Successors”, run jointly with the Polish Ski Federation. Successes of future sportsmen depend largely on the professional development of children, which is why it is so important to encourage them to spend their leisure actively. As part of the programme, a professionally organised cyclical LOTOS Cup competition is held, allowing ski-jumping beginners to compete with their peers, while promoting education through sports and objectively enforcing the rules of 92 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 competition and fair play. Sporting sponsorship Grupa LOTOS has a strategic, long-term approach to its sponsorship of sports. Its activity focuses on team sports, which have greatly gained in popularity in recent years on the back of international successes, as well as motorsports and winter sports. Basketball and volleyball For over 12 years, Grupa LOTOS has been the titular sponsor of women’s basketball team LOTOS Gdynia, which holds 11 Poland’s Championships, five Poland Cups (2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011) and one Poland Super Cup. It has also been the team vice-champion of the World League, vice-champion of the Euroleague (in 2002 and 2004), and has played in the Euroleague continuously since 1998. Additionally, Grupa LOTOS supports two men’s volleyball teams: LOTOS TREFL Gdańsk (since 2009) and TREFL Sopot (since 2010). Skiing For six years now, the Company has been Poland’s General Skiing Sponsor. Under the cooperative arrangement with the Polish Ski Federation, it supports ski jumpers from the A and youth teams, cross country skiers from the A and youth teams, as well as the Nordic combined team. As the General Sponsor, Grupa LOTOS also supports Justyna Kowalczyk (winner of three Olympic Games medals from Turin (2006) and Vancouver (2010), a double World Champion from Liberec (2009), winner of two World Championship medals in Oslo (2011) and a World Champion and World Cup winner in the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons), as well as Adam Małysz (winner of Olympic Games medals from Salt Lake City (2002) and Vancouver (2010), four individual World Championships, four World Cup titles and three Summer Grand Prix wins and winner of a World Championship medal in Oslo (2011). Motorsports In addition to the LOTOS Baltic Cup Rally sponsored by Grupa LOTOS for six years and Poland’s Mountain Rally Championships, 2010 saw the involvement of product companies LOTOS Paliwa and LOTOS Oil in cyclical rally events. The companies cooperated with two teams: the team comprised of Kajetan Kajetanowicz and Jarek Baran, which won Poland’s championship title in the general ranking of Poland’s Rally Championship 2010, and the Dynamic World Rally Team (Michał Kościuszko and Maciej Szczepaniak), which ranked fifth in the SWRC World Championship. For a few years, Grupa LOTOS has supported speedway racers from Gdańsk, and for two seasons has acted as Titular Sponsor of the LOTOS Wybrzeże team, which competes in the First Speedway League. The team includes both Poles and foreigners and will compete for entry into the Speedway Extraleague in the 2011 season. The Company’s CSR efforts are described in more detail on its corporate website. [ link ] 93 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

THE SECOND PILLAR OF THE LOTOS GROUP’S CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGY ENVIRONMENT = ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY task = to create environmental values environmental efficiency, projects delivering “twofold benefits” Mitigation of environmental impact For many years, the Company has striven to align its environmental policy with the principles of sustainable growth, in compliance with the environmental standards prescribed by law and with due regard to corporate social responsibility. Development plans In the years to come, the environmental impact of the individual industrial processes and the refinery as a whole will be mitigated by a range of investement and renovation programmes. When the projects are completed, the level of atmospheric emissions will be significantly reduced. 94 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Mitigation of environmental impact For many years, the Company has striven to align its environmental policy with the principles of sustainable growth, in compliance with the environmental standards prescribed by law and with due regard to corporate social responsibility. The achievement of these objectives is possible thanks to orienting the environmental policy towards: cleaner production, involving steady reduction of consumption of utilities and raw materials, reduction of pollutant emissions, waste management, security of industrial processes so as to effectively prevent failures. The sustainability and corporate social responsibility principles also entail the delivery of high quality products, leaving the smallest environmental footprint possible. The Company takes measures aimed at reducing its environmental impact, acting in cooperation and/or consultation with local authorities and social organisations responsible for environmental protection in a given area. Below are examples of measures taken by the Company with a view to minimising its harmful environmental impact: The negative environmental impact is minimised by: on-going monitoring of ambient air and water pollutant concentration and of hydrocarbon concentration in the area immediately surrounding the refinery, enabling quick response if the metrics reflecting the refinery’s environmental impact show any undesirable upward trends, discharge of wastewater whose quality is fully compliant with legal requirements thanks to a three-stage wastewater treatment plant, reuse of treated wastewater to produce process water, strict supervision over waste management, use of equipment and measures designed to help protect the environment, such as: double sealing of tanks with floating roofs, ensuring air tightness of all process facilities and connecting them to the emergency discharge system, where hydrocarbons are burned in flares, ensuring that the process of pumping fuel to road tankers and railway tank-cars is performed using the airtight vapour recovery system. The organisational unit within Grupa LOTOS responsible for issues relating to environmental protection is the specialised Environmental Protection Office. Apart from monitoring how and to what extent the Company’s production facilities impact the environment and reviewing the quantitative and qualitative compliance of emitted pollutants, produced waste, discharged wastewater and water and emitted noise, the Office is also tasked with the coordination of efforts aimed to ensure compliance with the environmental requirements imposed by law and establishment of environmental standards for the entire LOTOS Group. The scope of the Office’s remit also includes monitoring of CO2 emissions and activities related to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from the Company’s industrial facilities covered by the ETS is unobjectionable, as evidenced by positive annual assessments by an accredited verifier – a world leading provider of certification services. When discussing the Company’s approach to environmental management, we should mention its efforts designed to raise the staff’s environmental awareness through internal communication channels, which involve education of staff on issues related to environmental protection, understood as at an individual, corporate, regional and global level. 95 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Development plans In the years to come, the environmental impact of the individual industrial processes and the refinery as a whole will be mitigated by a range of investement and renovation programmes. When the projects are completed, the level of atmospheric emissions will be significantly reduced. Grupa LOTOS is involved in the construction of a high-efficiency gas-fired power plant, which will partly replace the existing oil-fulled CHP plant. Before then, other projects are also planned, e.g. the upgrade of the CHP plant’s boilers, which will involve fitting them in with low-NOX emission burners. Conceptual design work is also under way to switch to natural gas as the basic fuel for the refinery (both as an energy source and feedstock in hydrogen production) and utilise discharge gases currently burned in flares. Management of chemicals The Polish and EU legislation requires Grupa LOTOS to specify the impact of all its products on human health and safety. All products from crude oil refining are subject to classification, and thus to a health-impact and safety assessment. Throughout 2010, Grupa LOTOS was working intensively to ensure compliance with the requirements of the REACH (Registration Evaluation Authorisation of Chemicals) Regulation, as amended. In late September/early October 2010, the Company completed the REACH registration process and in December 2010 submitted the classification of substances marketed but not subject to obligatory registration under REACH. It needs to be noted that the meeting of the prescribed registration and classification deadlines was possible thanks to good coordination of work under the REACH Project, which was started well in advance. The registration was made jointly with other refineries, based on relevant agreements concluded through the agency of international organisation of oil companies CONCAWE, whose research covers water and air quality. As part of the registration process, common classification criteria were agreed, labelling was proposed and the results of toxicity, ecotoxicity, physicochemical and identification testing were presented. Thanks to acting jointly, the cost of research done under the REACH Project was brought down some 25-fold relative to initial estimates. Thanks to steps taken under the REACH programme, the Company’s customers have the guarantee that they will continue to receive certified high-quality products and that deliveries will be made in compliance with the provisions of applicable laws. Information between the individual companies as part of SIEF (Scientific Information Exchange Forum) and with the European Chemicals Agency based in Helsinki, Finland, was exchanged via electronic channels. The REACH system at the LOTOS Group was supported by the integrated IT system, made available to all companies subject to the obligation to register refinery product streams. The system is compatible with other systems used by product consortia of other petrochemical companies. The IT tools included: free European data base and website, which was used for sending registration files. Grupa LOTOS is reviewing the progress of compiling so-called SVHC (substances of very high concern) Candidate Lists, taking all necessary steps to meet the obligations imposed by the REACH Regulation. None of the substances produced and marketed by Grupa LOTOS is currently included in the SVHC Candidate List published by the European Chemicals Agency, and none is subject to the authorisation procedure. 96 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Internal Control System The Internal Control System in Grupa LOTOS is a set of organisational and procedural solutions regarding the whole organisation as well as of procedures determining the functioning of the individual processes. The system guarantees the organised and effective conduct of the Company’s activities in line with its business objectives and in compliance with legal and internal regulations. The Internal Control System of Grupa LOTOS is organisationally expressed through: the organisational structure determining the principles of reporting, the rules and regulations determining goals and tasks of the individual organisational sections, the scope of duties, rights and responsibilities for all employees, varying levels of access to information, documents and stored data, systems of authorisations, proxies and formally granted substitutions, limitations of access to rooms, especially those of special character where confidential information, personal data etc. are stored, etc. along with the adapted principles of: security and protection, defining the goals, documenting activities (in particular operational, financial and accounting, and trading activities). creating internal regulations, internal reporting. The remaining solutions which form the Internal Control System in the Company are embedded in each of the operational processes defined in the organisation. Supervision of the system has been alloted to the respective functions within the organisational structure of the Company. Moreover, an internal auditing unit has been put in place which among other things evaluates the solutions adopted in the Internal Control System. The results of its audits are then reported to the Management Board and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Grupa LOTOS. 100 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Main changes to the systems and key projects executed in 2010 Grupa LOTOS strives to reach the expected level of professionalisation of its organisational culture. This factor determines its chances of succeeding in protecting and building stakeholder value. Organisational Maturity Assessment During the period under report, an Organisational Maturity Assessment of Grupa LOTOS was conducted. The assessment referred to the year 2010 and – as it is the first assessment of the Company ever done – it shall serve as a model for future assessments. Organisational maturity of a company is the professionalisation level of its key organisational systems, processes and activities which is achieved by the company as well as their compliance with best practices in the area of its functioning and management. In line with the management approach adopted byt Grupa LOTOS, which assumes continuous improvement, the Company has decided to take steps to obtain the objective reassurance that the solutions it adopted in the areas of: internal control, risk management, compliance, abuse prevention, corporate governance meet the criteria of maturity as defined above. In order to conduct the internal assessment of the maturity of these systems, the Company – in cooperation with an external advisor – has developed an assessment model using best practices set out in the GRC Capability Model (Government, Risk Management and Compliance) designed by the Open Compliance and Ethics Group. Other documents including the Code of Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies and methodology drawn up by the external advisor for risk management and abuse risk management also provided the basis for work on the model. The developed model calls for a unified approach to conducting the review and formulating assessments of the structure of the individual systems as well as of the effectiveness of their operation. It enables the company to both formulate an assessment for any of the systems separately and to carry out a comprehensive organisational maturity assessment of the entire Company. Therefore, this approach helps to identify the areas in which improvement or deterioration of the results have taken place as well as to formulate recommendations and to initiate corrective measures. The assessment of the Internal Control System mainly concerns the internal control environment. The main area of interest for the assessment of the risk managament system is how this process is managed and how the risks are identified and assessed. The compliance system is assessed with regard to the correctness of the solutions adopted to ensure compliance with external regulations of the applied measures and actions taken. In the assessment of the abuse prevention system mainly the solutions which aim to prevent abuse, including those aimed at building and cultivating appropriate ethical positions as well as the approach adopted to identify and assess the areas of abuse are assessed. Important elements of the corporate governance assessment are management effectiveness and organisational efficiency of the Company, including shaping the corporate culture, setting goals, communication, monitoring, control, etc. The aggregate organisational maturity assessment of the Company shows that Grupa LOTOS is an organisation which strives to professionalise its activities and to adopt solutions which constitute best practices in the functioning and management of the organisation. However, it can be also noticed that the level of development, understood as design and efficiency, of the separate systems influencing the organisational maturity of the Company differs markedly between the systems. The high assessment rating achieved in the process by Grupa LOTOS results mainly from efforts made in previous years to preserve the value and functioning of the company. The efficient internal control system as well as the solutions adopted in corporate governance and compliance systems are the effects of these efforts. This result was also possible thanks to actions taken to establish the risk management system in the organisation. The consistent implementation and linking of this system to decision-taking processes undertaken in the Company will possibly become an important factor in the process of creating shareholder and stakeholder value. 104 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Grupa LOTOS intends to conduct organisational maturity assessments also in the coming years, on an annual basis. Requirements of Grupa LOTOS for its Contractors software system One of the priorities of Grupa LOTOS is to provide secure working conditions both for its own employees and for the employees of external companies, commissioned to do work on the premises of the Company. Following these priorities and the results of contractor audits, a need arose to refine the distribution channel of Grupa LOTOS’ requirements to its contractors. Bearing in mind the consistent effort to raise the effectiveness of communication with its stakeholders – one group of which are the contractors, – Grupa LOTOS devised a new electronic system aimed at distributing current internal requirements and rules applicable on the Company’s premises, in particular the ones regarding safety at work, health care, physical safety and fire protection in their broad sense. The software system Requirements of Grupa LOTOS for its Contractors, which was implemented as of January 1st 2011, will be availbale only for authorised persons through a protected, dedicated website. It also constitues a platform for information exchange regarding safety at work between the contractors and the HSE service of Grupa LOTOS. Information Security Management System In Grupa LOTOS, Data Loss Prevention – a sensitive information protection system – is currently being implemented. The system enables the company to control the flow of information within the organisation and to prevent uncontrolled or unauthorised leakage or transmission of information which are of uppermost importance to the Company outside it, in compliance with its information security rules. Enterprise Risk Management The LOTOS Group continues to implement its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system which is aimed at ensuring the secure and effective execution of the LOTOS Group’s strategic and operational goals. The system supports the organisation in taking prompt, accurate and informed decisions based on the results of the previously conducted risk analysis whereas the implemented principles of identifying and evaluating risks allow the company to react early to existing threats and to eliminate them, partially or totally. The system also allows to prepare for the scenario when the given risk materialises by drawing up suitable action plans and to identify arising chances and opportunities for Grupa LOTOS which the Company strives to take advantage of. Thanks to the ERM system, Grupa LOTOS can take actions – within the acceptable risk limit – which are optimum from the point of view of its business activities. 105 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Development plans In 2011, the Company will continue to work on its current and newly implemented projects which respond to the requirements of the internal process of organisational improvement. This year, new projects dictated by the Company's true needs are planned to be included in the existing Integrated Management System. The key ones among them are: the implementation of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system – detailed information on the ERM system in Grupa LOTOS, including the adopted principles and tools, are to be found in chapter Development vision, the implementation of the requirements of the Energy Management System (EnMS) aimed to support actions taken to improve the energy efficiency in Grupa LOTOS. The implementation process will be executed in compliance with the goals of the Polish Energy Policy until 2030 (with respect to improving the energy efficiency and reducing environmental impact) and quantity targets of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. The Company intends to use the potential of the projects raising the energy efficiency which have been completed so far as well as to implement best practices along with technical solutions and standards aimed to save energy (including projects implementing the recommendations of the EU Directives), the implementation of enterprise project management in the LOTOS Group aimed to develop tools and methods which help to execute the Company’s strategy effectively. Based on the best world standards and our employees’ experience, we are going to introduce a unified system allowing: to choose the best undertakings helping to accomplish our strategic goals, to effectively complete these undertakings, to efficiently monitor their completion, to fairly evaluate the achieved results, the improvement and expansion of the LOTOS Group’s Integrated Management System Portal used to distribute internal requirements and information regarding legal acts as well as to gather information on environmental protection, granted proxies and references, the improvement of the software system aimed to distribute internal requirements and rules applicable on the premises of Grupa LOTOS to our contractors, the execution of the next stage of training courses under the Auditor School programme aimed to prepare adequately qualified and experienced auditors who will be carrying out audits in the LOTOS Group’s companies using top and unified corporate standards. 106 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Risk management For all registered risks, adequate controlling measures and prevention mechanisms are indicated along with methods of monitoring them. Management approach In 2010, detailed rules concerning identification and evaluation of risks, methods of monitoring and reporting them as well as verification of the effectiveness of actions taken were set out. The procedure is aimed at ensuring that the actions planned for the LOTOS Group are being completed periodically, that the applied methodology is optimum and adequate to the various areas of activities and also that the risk management process itself is consistent and effective. Key instruments Grupa LOTOS identifies the risks for accomplishing both its strategic as well as precedural and operational goals. This identification is mainly done at group workshops but all employees are also entitled and obliged to report threats and opportunities which are linked to the processes they take part in and can have influence on accomplishing the defined goals. Development plans In Grupa LOTOS, works are underway on the preparation of the IT tool which will support the corporate risk management system. 107 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Management approach In 2010, detailed rules concerning identification and evaluation of risks, methods of monitoring and reporting them as well as verification of the effectiveness of actions taken were set out. The procedure is aimed at ensuring that the actions planned for the LOTOS Group are being completed periodically, that the applied methodology is optimum and adequate to the various areas of activities and also that the risk management process itself is consistent and effective. At Grupa LOTOS, the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system is aimed : to provide comprehensive knowledge on threats and opportunities linked to the activities of the LOTOS Group, to facilitate taking quick and effective decisions, based on risk analysis, to prepare the organisation for an immediate reaction in case any risk materialises. In order to execute the above principles, a systemic approach to risk management is being implemented, including: the identification of the risks and their quality and quantity evaluation, the preparation of a strategy of dealing with a particular risk category, the implementation of the planned actions, the verification of the efficitiveness of the actions taken, constant monitoring and control of both the risk level and the status of the actions implemented, the standardisation of communication and reportng principles. In Grupa LOTOS, the reaction to risks involves four types of actions: limiting the possibility of the risk materialising, e.g. through controlling measures, changing the process, etc., transferring, i.e. shifting the risk onto another entity, eg. through insurance, outsourcing, etc., avoiding risk by withdrawing from the given risk area or not conducting given activities (however, this strategy remains most infrequent) accepting the given risk level if it cannot be further limited or if the risk is so low that it is not necessary. Basic rules and the scope of responsibilities relating to the system are defined in The LOTOS Group’s Enterprise Risk Management Policy. In Grupa LOTOS, there is also a Strategy and Enterprise Risk Management Committee which serves a consultative function. It is mainly responsible for making sure that the actions planned by the Company to limit the risks are consistent from the point of view of the entire LOTOS Group’s functioning and do not result in increasing the risk to a a dangerous level in a different area of activities. Each year, an annual evaluation of the Enterprise Risk Management system is done, whose results are used to further improve the system. Reports on the functioning of the ERM system are then submitted to the Management Board and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Grupa LOTOS. 108 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Key instruments Grupa LOTOS identifies the risks for accomplishing both its strategic as well as precedural and operational goals. This identification is mainly done at group workshops but all employees are also entitled and obliged to report threats and opportunities which are linked to the processes they take part in and can have influence on accomplishing the defined goals. The risk assessment is done in two time horizons: within the next year and till the end of the period for which the current LOTOS Group’s Strategy is valid, that is till the year 2015. For all risk types, the probability of their materialising is estimated and then the financial consequences which would be incurred as well as the possible effect on reputation of the LOTOS Group are calculated should the given risk materialise. The human safety and the environmental impact along with the expected reception by the Company’s stakeholders is also taken into account in this calculation. For all registered risks, adequate controlling measures and prevention mechanisms put in place are indicated along with the method of monitoring them. Each risk has its own so-called risk owner who is reponsible for its supervision and monitoring, using the pre-set indicators. The monitoring results are then reported in compliance with the adopted principles. Based on this risk assessment, the aggregated Risk Map for the LOTOS Group is prepared. It is a dynamic document which is subject to changes due to the changeable character of the business environment, the business processes being put in place in the organisation, finalising the completion of some investments and starting new ones as well because of the actions being taken to limit the identified risk. All risk types which were assessed as significant from the point of view of the goals which are set to be accomplished by the Company are then subjected to detailed analysis with regard to the factors of the given risk and the current system of managing and monitoring it. Further to the analysis, plans aimed at limiting the risk and action plans in case of its materialising are prepared. In Grupa LOTOS, the project risk management is also put in place, especially for investment projects. The risk assessment criteria differ slightly from the ones discussed above as they have been adapted to the area of project management. However, the principles of how the risk itself should be handled are consistent in the whole Grupa LOTOS and help to complete the planned projects efficiently and safely. 109 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Development plans In Grupa LOTOS, works are underway on the preparation of the IT tool which will support the corporate risk management system. The tool currently applied helps to evaluate the risks and visualise them on a map. However, the new comprehensive tool will also allow the company to constantly monitor the levels of different risks, using pre-set Key Risk Indicators (KRI). To facilitate its functioning, the new tool will be integrated with other systems used by Grupa LOTOS (eg. with SAP) so as to enable it to gain direct access to and use data stored by them. Also, the incident base for the entire Grupa LOTOS is being prepared, containing events which can influence different risks materialising, and highlight new risks, which have not been identified so far. 110 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Remuneration As the State Treasury’s equity interest in the Company exceeds 50%, Grupa LOTOS is subject to the provisions of the Compensation Cap Act. In 2000, the powers to determine the remuneration policy for members of the Management Board rested with the General Shareholders Meeting, which exercised its powers by adopting, in August 2000, of resolutions setting out the rules of remuneration and employment of members of the Company’s Management Board. The resolutions remained in effect until June 30th 2009, when the Annual General Shareholders Meeting amended the Company’s Articles of Association regarding the division of powers between the General Shareholders Meeting and the Supervisory Board, so that the powers to determine the remuneration policy for members of the Management Board, the amount of monthly remuneration for members of the Management Board and the amount of the annual bonus for President of the Board, were transferred from the General Shareholders Meeting to the Supervisory Board. The amendments were introduced to render the Articles of Association flexible enough to incorporate a general principle set forth in Art. 378.1 of the Commercial Companies Code, whereby the powers to determine the remuneration of Management Board members rest with the Supervisory Board, with the proviso: “unless specifically provided for otherwise in applicable laws”, which refers to the Act on Remunerating Persons Who Manage Certain Legal Entities of March 3rd 2000 (Dz. U. of 2000, No. 26, item 306, as amended). The proposal of the Supervisory Board concerning the transfer of powers from the General Shareholders Meeting to the Supervisory Board, put to vote at the General Shareholders Meeting, was justifiable and not in conflict with the provisions of the Compensation Cap Act by which the Company was bound, since the same General Shareholders Meeting approved an increase in the Company’s share capital by way of a non-cash contribution in the form of shares in Przedsiębiorstwo Poszukiwań i Eksploatacji Złóż Ropy i Gazu Petrobaltic, LOTOS Czechowice and LOTOS Jasło held by the State Treasury. By virtue of the General Shareholders Meeting’s decision, the share capital of Grupa LOTOS was increased from PLN 113,700,000 to PLN 129,873,362, through the issue of 16,173,362 new Series C ordinary bearer shares, which were offered to the State Treasury in private placement, with the pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders waived. In return, the State Treasury transferred to Grupa LOTOS 2,801,400 shares in Petrobaltic, 375,000 shares in LOTOS Czechowice and 300,000 shares in LOTOS Jasło. As a result of the transaction, upon the registration of the share capital increase by the competent court (on July 17th 2009), the Company’s ownership structure changed. The equity interest of shareholder Nafta Polska S.A. fell from 51.91% to 45.45%, and consequently Grupa LOTOS ceased to be subject to the provisions of the Compensation Cap Act. However, on July 22nd 2009, the State Treasury acquired another significant block of shares in Grupa LOTOS based on an agreement of July 16th 2009 between Nafta Polska and the Minister of the State Treasury. In performance of the agreement, Nafta Polska transferred to the State Treasury a total of 59,025,000 shares in Grupa LOTOS. As a result, Nafta Polska does no longer hold any shares in the Company, while the State Treasury’s equity interest has risen to 63.97%. In connection with the transaction, the provisions of the Compensation Cap Act are again applicable to Grupa LOTOS. Accordingly, as provided for in the Act, the powers to determine the remuneration policy for President of the Board are vested with the General Shareholders Meeting, acting upon a proposal from the Supervisory Board, whereas the powers to determine the rules and amounts of remuneration for other members of the Management Board rest with the Supervisory Board. Given that the State Treasury’s equity interest in the Company exceeds 50% (50% of all shares), Grupa LOTOS is subject to the provisions of Art. 8.4 of the Act. In view of the foregoing, on November 13th 2009, the Supervisory Board – acting within the powers vested in it by Par. 13.2.1 of the Company’s Articles of Association and the Act of March 3rd 2000 – decided that Vice-Presidents of the Company’s Management Board would receive remuneration equal to six-fold the average monthly salary in the non-financial corporate sector, net of bonuses paid from profit in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, as announced by President of the GUS (Central Statistics Office), and proposed that the General Shareholders Meeting determine the remuneration for President of the Board at the same level. Concurring with the proposal of the Supervisory Board, contained in Resolution No. 63/VII/2009 of November 13th 2009, on December 17th 2009 the Extraordinary General Shareholders Meeting determined the remuneration policy for President of the Board, while repealing the General Shareholders Meeting’s resolution of August 18th 2000, which until then defined the rules of remuneration for members of the Management Board. On January 22nd 2010, the State Treasury sold 14,000,000 ordinary bearer shares in Grupa LOTOS, which however did not affect the rules of remuneration for members of the Management Board, as the provisions of the Compensation Cap Act continue to apply to Grupa LOTOS. Following the above transaction, the State Treasury currently holds a total of 69,076,392 ordinary bearer shares, representing 53.19% of the Company’s share capital and conferring the right to 53.19% of the total vote. Furthermore, pursuant to individual employment contracts, members of the Management Board are entitled – for the duration of their respective employment contracts – to fringe benefits including: the costs of life insurance (incl. monthly premiums), 131 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 above-standard medical care, provided by non-public healthcare establishments in Poland and abroad, for members of the Management Board and their families. In addition, the President of the Board and Vice-President of the Management Board, Chief Commercial Officer, are entitled to a fringe benefit in the form of tied accommodation in the Gdańsk-Gdynia-Sopot conglomeration (inc. payment of rent and service charges), although the above persons have not yet claimed that benefit. At the same time, pursuant to the Act on Remunerating Persons Who Manage Certain Legal Entities dated March 3rd 2000 (Dz. U. of 2000, No. 26, item 306, as amended) and the Regulation of the Minister of State Treasury concerning Detailed Rules and Procedure for Granting Annual Bonuses to the Management Staff of Certain Legal Entities, dated March 12th 2001 (Dz. U. of 2001, No. 22, item 259), members of the Management Board may receive annual bonuses. Annual bonuses may be awarded if the Company: improved its financial performance, strengthened its position on the market or in the industry, successfully implemented restructuring or growth plans, did not exceed the maximum annualised average monthly remuneration growth ratio, settled public charges in a timely manner. Annual bonuses may only be granted after the financial statements have been approved. Eligibility to receive an annual bonus is limited to members of the Management Board who served in that capacity for the full financial year and during that time were not found guilty of gross dereliction of duty, their employment was not terminated for reasons attributable to them, their management contracts were not terminated or they were not removed from office for reasons constituting grounds for summary dismissal. In accordance with the applicable regulations, the maximum amount of annual bonus is equal to three-fold the average monthly salary in the year preceding the bonus award. A decision to grant an annual bonus to the President of the Board rests with the General Shareholders Meeting, upon a proposal from the Supervisory Board. In the case of the other members of the Management Board, a decision to grant annual bonuses rests with the Supervisory Board.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Avoidance of conflicts of interest As a means to avoid conflicts of interest, the Company complies with the provisions of the Commercial Companies Code, the Rules of Procedure of the Management Board and the “Code of Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies”. Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure of the Management Board, in conjunction with Art. 377 of the Commercial Companies Code, if there occurs a conflict between the interests of the Company and those of a Management Board member or any persons to whom the Management Board member is personally related, then the Management Board member should refrain from participating in the resolution of a given matter. Furthermore, in accordance with the “Code of Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies”, a Management Board member should notify the Management Board of any conflict of interests which has arisen or may arise, and should refrain from taking part in the discussion and from voting on resolutions on the issue which gives rise to such conflict of interests. Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board’s approval is required for members of the Management Board to hold positions on the supervisory or management bodies of other companies. Concurrently, the provisions of the Commercial Companies Code apply which prohibit a current member of the Management Board from serving on the Supervisory Board. This also applies to other persons reporting directly to a Management Board member. 133 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Auditor’s opinion To the Supervisory Board of Grupa LOTOS S.A. 1. We have audited the attached consolidated financial statements of Capital Group Grupa LOTOS S.A. (‘the Group’), for which the holding company is Grupa LOTOS S.A. (‘the Company‘) located in Gdańsk at 135 Elbląska Street, for the year ended 31 December 2010 containing, the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2010, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash flow, the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 and the additional notes and explanations (‘the attached consolidated financial statements’). 2. The truth and fairness (1) of the attached consolidated financial statements, the preparation of the attached consolidated financial statements in accordance with the required applicable accounting policies and the proper maintenance of the consolidation documentation are the responsibility of the Company’s Management Board. In addition, the Company’s Management Board and Members of the Supervisory Board are required to ensure that the attached consolidated financial statements and the Directors’ Report meet the requirements of the Accounting Act dated 29 September 1994 (2009 Journal of Laws No. 152 item 1223 with subsequent amendments – ‘the Accounting Act’). Our responsibility was to audit the attached consolidated financial statements and to express an opinion on whether, based on our audit, these financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the required applicable accounting policies and whether they truly and fairly (2) reflect, in all material respects, the financial position and results of the operations of the Group. 3. We conducted our audit of the attached consolidated financial statements in accordance with: • chapter 7 of the Accounting Act, • national auditing standards issued by the National Council of Statutory Auditors, in order to obtain reasonable assurance whether these financial statements are free of material misstatement. In particular, the audit included examining, to a large extent on a test basis, documentation supporting the amounts and disclosures in the attached consolidated financial statements. The audit also included assessing the accounting principles adopted and used and significant estimates made by the Management Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the attached consolidated financial statements. We believe our audit has provided a reasonable basis to express our opinion on the attached consolidated financial statements treated as a whole. 4. The consolidated financial statements for the prior financial year ended 31 December 2009 were subject to an audit by a key certified auditor acting for another authorised audit firm who issued a qualified opinion with an emphasis of matter on these financial statements, dated 26 April 2010. The qualification concerned the lack of ability to verify the impact of the issues, which were the subject of the qualifications in the auditors’ opinion issued to the consolidated financial statements of the Lithuanian Capital Group of AB Geonafta on the value of the shares held by the Group in the dominant entity of the AB Geonafta Capital Group. The emphasis of matter concerned the assets related to capital expenditures incurred on the exploration of gas fields B-4 and B-6 as well as the costs of drilling in the total amount of 47.8 million zlotys. 5. In our opinion, the attached consolidated financial statements, in all material respects: • present truly and fairly all information material for the assessment of the results of the Group’s operations for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010, as well as its financial position (3) as at 31 December 2010; • have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU; • are in respect of the form and content, in accordance with the legal regulations governing the preparation of financial statements. 6. As disclosed in note No. 17 of the additional notes and explanations to the attached consolidated financial statements, the Group recognized under construction in progress the expenditures incurred by LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS for the purchase of 20% interest in Norwegian production licenses relating to the YME field as well as the costs of drilling and other costs of said field exploration in the total amount of 1,151 million zlotys. The Group carried out an impairment test for the said assets described in the mentioned note, based on the analysis of discounted cash flows for the 20% interest held in hydrocarbons’ reserves acquired as part of the production licenses for the development of the YME field. Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the uncertainty indicated by the Company’s Management concerning recoverability of these assets recognized in the attached consolidated financial statements in respect of the YME field due to the fact that the forecasted cash flows are determined by a series of future events, in particular, by market volatility of crude oil prices. 7. We have read the ‘Directors’ Report for the period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 and the rules of preparation of annual statements’ (‘the Directors’ Report’) and concluded that the information derived from the attached consolidated financial statements reconciles with these financial statements. The information included in the Directors’ Report corresponds with the relevant regulations of the Decree of the Minister of Finance dated 19 February 2009 on current and periodic information published by issuers of securities and conditions for recognition as equivalent the information required by laws of non-EU member states (Journal of Laws No. 33, item 259). on behalf of Ernst & Young Audit sp. z o.o.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information 9. Basis of Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements These consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and the IFRS endorsed by the European Union which have been published and are in effect as at December 31st 2010. The IFRS include the standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (“the Board”, “IASB”) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”). As at the date of approval of these financial statements for publication, taking into account the ongoing process of implementation of the IFRS in the EU and the business activities conducted by the Company, as far as the accounting policies applied by the Company are concerned, there is no difference between the IFRS that have become effective and the IFRS endorsed by the EU. The Parent Undertaking and LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A., LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS, LOTOS Asfalt Sp. z o.o., LOTOS Oil S.A., LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o., LOTOS Kolej Sp. z o.o., LOTOS Tank Sp. z o.o., and LOTOS Serwis Sp. z o.o. maintain their accounting books in accordance with the accounting policies prescribed by the International Financial Reporting Standards. The other Group companies maintain their accounting books in accordance with the accounting standards defined in the Polish Accountancy Act of September 29th 1994 and the accounting policies and standards applicable at their foreign locations. These consolidated financial statements include adjustments which are absent from the accounting books of the Group’s undertakings applying standards other than IFRS, and which have been introduced to ensure consistency of the undertakings’ financial information with the IFRS. The Group chose to early apply as of January 1st 2009 the revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations and the revised IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. Application of the revised IFRS 3 and IAS 27 had no material effect on the previous periods. In April 2009, the International Accounting Standards Board released the second collection of amendments to its accounting standards, which aim to eliminate any inconsistencies or ambiguities. Different transitional provisions apply to the individual standards. Implementation of the amendments to the standards listed below led to changes in the Group's accounting policies, but had no impact on the Group’s financial standing or performance as presented in the financial statements. IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows. It has been made clear that only expenditure which leads to recognition of an asset may be classified as cash flows from investing activities. IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. The amendment clarifies that the largest unit to which goodwill acquired in a business combination may be allocated for the purpose of impairment testing is an operating segment, as defined in IFRS 8, before aggregation for reporting purposes. The change had no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. IFRS 8 Operating Segments. It has been clarified that segment assets and liabilities should be disclosed only when such assets and liabilities are included in the measures used by the chief operating decision maker. As the Group’s chief operating decision maker reviews segment assets, the Group continues to disclose the required information in Note 11. The Group has reviewed the new interpretations, standards and amendments to the existing standards. The new interpretations, standards and amendments to the existing standards which are in effect and have been adopted by the European Union, have no material impact on the accounting policies applied by the Group. 9.1 New Standards and Interpretations The following new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board or the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee, but have not been adopted by the European Union: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for periods beginning on or after January 1st 2013), Amendments to IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Transfers of Financial Assets (effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1st 2011), 163 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets (effective for periods beginning on or after January 1st 2012), Amendments to IFRS 1 – First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards: Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters (effective for periods beginning on or after July 1st 2011). The Group has not decided to choose the option of early application of any other standard, interpretation, or amendment to an existing standard which has been published but has not yet become effective. By the date of approval of these financial statements, the first phase of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2013) has not been endorsed by the European Union. During the next phases, the International Accounting Standards Board will focus on hedge accounting and impairment. The project is scheduled for completion in mid-2011. Implementation of the first phase of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets. The Group will analyse this effect along with the effect from the other phases of the project after their publication, in order to present a coherent picture. The Management Board does not expect the introduction of the new standards and interpretations specified above to have any material impact on the accounting policies applied by the Group or the Group’s financial standing or performance as presented in the financial statements. The following new interpretations, standards and amendments to the existing standards, which have been adopted by the European Union, are effective in periods beginning after January 1st 2010: IAS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation: Classification of Rights Issues (effective for annual periods beginning on or after February 1st 2010), Amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-Time Adopters (effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1st 2010), Amendments to IFRIC 14 IAS 19 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction: Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement (effective for periods beginning on or after January 1st 2011), Revised IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st 2011), IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1st 2010), Changes introduced as part of the improvements to IFRSs published in May 2010 (some changes are effective for annual periods beginning on July 1st 2010, some for annual periods beginning on January 1st 2011). 9.2 Changes in Accounting Policies and Correction of Errors The accounting policies and calculation methods adopted by the Group in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are the same as those used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31st 2009, except that since January 1st 2010 the Group has applied amendments to IAS 17 Leases, as a result of which perpetual usufruct right to land obtained free of charge was capitalised at fair value and presented under property, plant and equipment (equity was increased accordingly as the related liabilities could not have been determined). Previously, the perpetual usufruct right to land obtained free of charge was classified by the Group as operating lease and disclosed at fair value as an off-balance-sheet item. In connection with the disclosure of the land perpetual usufruct rights obtained free of charge in the balance sheet, the Group adjusted the data presented in these financial statements. As a result of the adjustment, as at December 31st 2009 and January 1st 2009, the value of property, plant and equipment rose by PLN 163,446 thousand, deferred tax liabilities increased by PLN 31,055 thousand, and equity (retained earnings) grew by PLN 132,391 thousand, taking into account the effect of deferred income tax. As at December 31st 2009, the Group reclassified certain items which had earlier been presented as restricted cash and cash equivalents into non-current financial assets. These items included the PLN 5,819 thousand (as at January 1st 2009: PLN 31,440 thousand) deposit securing the repayment of interest on the loan intended for financing of inventory, and the PLN 1,205 thousand (as at January 1st 2009: PLN 7,255 thousand) security deposit (margin). In connection with the foregoing, cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities changed respectively by PLN 6,050 thousand and PLN 25,621 thousand. Furthermore, as at December 31st 2009 the Group presented in restricted cash PLN 18,320 thousand of its cash in bank account on which a hold had been placed. In the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31st 2009, valuation of financial instruments previously disclosed under “(Profit)/loss on investing activities” (of PLN 214,433 thousand) and under “Foreign exchange (gains)/losses” (of PLN 161 thousand) was transferred to “Settlement and valuation of financial instruments”. 164 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 In the year ended December 31st 2009, the Group reclassified costs relating to transport between storage terminals. For the year ended December 31st 2009, general and administrative expenses decreased by PLN 25,248 thousand with the corresponding increase reflected in cost of sales.

For the year ended December 31st 2009, finance income and expenses related to foreign exchange differences decreased by PLN 40,012 thousand. In connection with the purchase of an organised part of business in the form of the LPG Trading Division of LOTOS Gaz S.A. by LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. from LOTOS Gaz S.A. in December 2009, in order to ensure comparability of the data disclosed in Note 11, the sales revenue, operating profit (EBIT), depreciation and amortisation, and operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) related to the LPG trading business of the LOTOS Gaz Group have been presented in the downstream segment.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information 10. Accounting Policies These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost principle, except with respect to financial derivatives, which are measured at fair value. The key accounting policies applied by the Group are presented below. 10.1. Basis of Consolidation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the financial statements of the Parent Undertaking and financial statements of the undertakings it controls, prepared as at December 31st 2010. The financial statements of the subsidiaries, subject to the restatements made to ensure compliance with the IFRS, are prepared for the same reporting period as the financial statements of the Parent Undertaking, with the use of consistent accounting policies and in accordance with uniform accounting policies applied for transactions and economic events of a similar nature. Adjustments are made in order to eliminate any discrepancies in the adopted accounting policies. All significant balances and transactions between the Group’s undertakings, including significant unrealised profits on intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in their entirety. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless they are indicative of an impairment of value. Subsidiary undertakings are consolidated starting from the date when the Group assumes control over them and cease to be consolidated when control is lost. The Company is deemed to exert control when it holds, directly or through its subsidiary undertakings, more than 50% of votes in a given undertaking unless it is possible to prove that the ownership of over 50% of votes is not tantamount to exerting control. The Company’s ability to influence a given undertaking’s financial and operational policies is also deemed exerting control. 10.2. Investments in Associated Undertakings Investments in associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method. Associated undertakings are the undertakings over which the Parent Undertaking has significant influence, either directly or indirectly through its subsidiary undertakings, and which are neither its subsidiary undertakings nor interests in joint ventures. The financial statements of associated undertakings serve as a basis for the equity method valuation of the shares held by the Parent Undertaking. Associated undertakings’ financial years coincide with the Parent Undertaking’s financial year. Investments in associated undertakings are recognised in the statement of financial position at cost, adjusted for subsequent changes in the Parent Undertaking’s share in the net assets of the associated undertakings, and reduced by impairment losses, if any. The statement of financial position includes the Parent Undertaking’s share of the profits and losses of the associated undertakings. In the case of a change recognised directly in an associated undertaking’s equity, the Parent Undertaking recognises its share in such change and, if applicable, discloses it in the statement of changes in equity. 10.3. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are recognised if the Group is likely to obtain future economic benefits attributable directly to the assets. Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost, if they are acquired in separate transactions. Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at their fair value on acquisition date. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The Group capitalises and recognises as an intangible asset both the fees under the licences for crude oil and natural gas exploration and the royalties under the concluded mining use agreements granting the right to conduct crude oil and natural gas exploration. Exploration work cannot be conducted without obtaining a relevant licence and executing the mining use agreement. Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The expected useful lives of the Group’s intangible assets range from 2 to 33 years. 166 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset are reviewed at the end of each financial year. Changes in the expected useful life or pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset are reflected by changing the amortisation period or amortisation method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Useful lives are also reviewed each year and, if required, they are adjusted with effect from the beginning of the following financial year. With the exception of capitalised expenditure on development, expenditure on intangible assets produced by the Group is not capitalised and is charged to expenses in the period in which it was incurred.e. 10.4. Goodwill Related to Subordinated Undertakings The acquirer recognises goodwill on acquisition, equal to the excess of the sum of (i) consideration transferred, measured at its acquisition-date fair value, (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and (iii) in the case of a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, measured at fair values. In the case of a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer remeasures its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisitiondate fair value and recognises the resulting gain or loss, if any, in the statement of comprehensive income. Following the initial recognition, goodwill is carried at cost less cumulative impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment once a year. It is not amortised. As at the date of assuming control, the acquired goodwill is allocated to every identifiable cash-generating unit. The Group calculates any impairment of value by estimating the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit relevant to a given part of goodwill. If the recoverable value of a cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying value, the Group recognises an impairment loss. If goodwill comprises a part of a cash-generating unit and the Group sells a part of the business of the cash-generating unit, the goodwill connected with the sold business is included in the carrying value of the sold business for the purpose of calculating gains or losses on disposal of the part of business. In such a case, goodwill pertaining to the sold business should be measured using the relative value of the sold business, pro-rata to the interest in the retained part of the cash-generating unit. 10.5. Property, Plant and Equipment Items of property, plant and equipment other than land are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Land is valued at cost less impairment losses. In the case of perpetual usufruct rights to land, cost is understood to mean the amount paid for the right to a third party. Perpetual usufruct rights to land obtained free of charge are capitalised in the accounting books. Initial value of a tangible asset comprises its cost, which includes all costs directly related to its acquisition and bringing it to working condition for its intended use. The cost also includes the cost of replacing component parts of plant and equipment, which is recognised when incurred, if relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled. Costs incurred on an asset which is already in service, such as costs of repairs, overhauls or operating fees, are expensed in the reporting period in which they were incurred. Tangible assets (including their components), other than land and tangible assets used for crude oil production, are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which are as follows: Buildings and structures 1–80 years Plant and equipment 1–25 years Vehicles 1–15 years Other tangible assets 1–10 years Tangible assets used in petroleum production are depreciated using the units-of-production depreciation method, i.e. depreciation per unit of produced crude oil is charged to expenses. The depreciation rate is estimated in reference to forecasts of crude oil production from a given geological area. If the estimated reserves (2P – proved and probable reserves) change significantly as at the balance-sheet date, depreciation per unit of produced crude oil is re-valued. Then, starting from the new financial year, the re-valued depreciation rate is applied. An item of property, plant and equipment may be removed from the statement of financial position if it is sold or if the company does not expect to realise any economic benefits from its further use. Any gains or losses on removal of an asset from the statement of financial position (calculated as the difference between net proceeds from its sale, if any, and the carrying value of the asset) are disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of removal. 167 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 The residual value, useful economic life and depreciation method are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted – if required – with effect from the beginning of the next financial year. The costs of each overhaul are included in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, if relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled. In its consolidated financial statements, under tangible assets the Group discloses an asset corresponding to the value of provision for the decommissioning of Offshore Oil and Gas Facilities. The asset was created in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, which reads: “The cost of an item of property, land and equipment comprises … the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period”. The Group’s obligation to incur costs of decommissioning of the Offshore Oil and Gas Facilities results directly from the reasons specified in IAS 16. Under Paragraph 63 of the same standard, the entities applying the IAS are obliged to test the value of the asset periodically, at least at each balance-sheet date. It should further be emphasised that the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) has issued Interpretation IFRIC 1: Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities. The Interpretation directly refers to, inter alia, IAS 16, including in particular to the revaluation of the asset recognised as future decommissioning cost. Revaluation of the asset so recognised may be caused by: change in estimated cash outflow necessary to ensure performance of the decommissioning obligation, change in the current market discount rate, increase in the value resulting from the passage of time – shortening of the time remaining until decommissioning, leading to the adjustment of the discount rate. The Group complied with IFRIC’s requirement in this respect, therefore these consolidated financial statements show the asset at its present value. 10.6. Tangible Assets under Construction Tangible assets under construction are valued at the amount of aggregate costs directly attributable to the acquisition or production of such assets, including finance expenses, less impairment losses, if any. Tangible assets under construction are not depreciated until completed and placed in service. Tangible assets under construction comprise tangible assets which are under construction or assembly and are recognised at cost. Finance expenses capitalised in tangible assets under construction include costs of servicing the debt incurred to finance the assets. The cost of exploration for crude oil and natural gas is capitalised as tangible assets under construction until the size of an oil/gas field and the economic viability of production are determined. Upon confirmation of the existence of reserves whose extraction is technically and economically viable, the expenditure incurred on exploration is transferred to tangible assets and is subsequently depreciated. If exploration drillings do not result in discovery of any reserves whose extraction is technically and economically viable, impairment losses on tangible assets under construction are recognised in the profit or loss of the period in which it is found that commercial production from the discovered fields is not viable. 10.7. Exploration and Evaluation Assets Exploration and evaluation assets are exploration and evaluation expenditures recognised as assets in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Exploration and evaluation expenditures are expenditures incurred by the Group in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources is the search for mineral resources, including oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources after the entity has obtained legal rights to explore in a specific area, as well as the determination of the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the mineral resource. The Group classifies the exploration and evaluation assets as property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, depending on the type of the acquired assets, and applies this classification policy in a consistent manner. When the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource is demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets are no longer classified as such. The Group presents and discloses impairment losses on exploration and evaluation assets in accordance with IFRS 6 and evaluates such assets in accordance with IAS 36. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss, in accordance with IAS 36. The Group examines the need to recognise impairment losses on exploration and evaluation assets by considering, inter alia, the following circumstances in relation to a specific area: the period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period or will 168 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed; no substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources is anticipated; exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities; sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale. 10.8. Leases A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership onto the lessee. All other types of leases are treated as operating leases. The Group as a Lessor Finance leases are disclosed in the statement of financial position as receivables, at amounts equal to the net investment in the lease less the principal component of lease payments for the given reporting period calculated based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor's net investment outstanding in respect of the finance lease. Finance income from interest on a finance lease is disclosed in the relevant reporting periods based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor's net investment outstanding in respect of the finance lease. Income from operating leases is recognised in the statement of financial position on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group as a Lessee Assets used under a finance lease are recognised as assets of the Group and at initial recognition are measured at fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The resultant obligation towards the lessor is presented in the statement of financial position under finance lease liabilities. Lease payments are broken down into the interest component and the principal component so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expense is charged to statement of comprehensive income. Operating lease payments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 10.9. Non-Current Assets Held For Sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is deemed to be met only if the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Classification of an asset as held for sale means that the management intends to complete the sale within one year from the change of its classification. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 10.10. Impairment Losses on Non-Financial Non-Current Assets As at each balance-sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any evidence of impairment of any of its assets. If the Group finds that there is such evidence, or if the Group is required to perform annual impairment tests, the Group estimates the recoverable value of the given asset. The recoverable value of an asset is equal to the higher of the fair value of the asset or cash generating unit, less the transaction costs, or its value in use. The recoverable value is determined for the individual assets, unless a given asset does not generate separate cash inflows largely independent from those generated by other assets or asset groups. If the carrying value of an asset is higher than its recoverable value, the value of the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is recognised up to the established recoverable value. In assessing value in use, the projected cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses related to the assets used in the continued operations are disclosed under the cost categories corresponding to the function of the asset with respect to which impairment has been identified. As at each balance-sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is evidence that any impairment loss recognised in the previous periods with respect to a given asset is no longer necessary or should be reduced. If there is such 169 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 evidence, the Group estimates the recoverable value of the given asset. The recognised impairment loss is reversed only when following the recognition of the last impairment loss there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable value of the asset. In such a case, the carrying value of the asset is increased up to its recoverable value. The increased value may not exceed the carrying value of the asset that would have been determined (net of accumulated amortisation/depreciation) if the impairment loss related to that asset had not been recognised in the previous years. Reversal of an asset impairment loss is immediately recognised as income in the statement of comprehensive income. Following reversal of an impairment loss, in the subsequent periods the amortisation/depreciation charge related to the given asset is adjusted so that over the remaining useful life of that asset its revised carrying value, less its residual value, can be regularly written off. 10.11. Investment Property Investment property is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Investment property, including investments in land, perpetual usufruct of land, buildings and structures, include property which the Group does not use for its own purposes but which will generate benefits in the form of value appreciation or rent income. 10.12. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in order to bring each inventory item to its present location and conditions are accounted for in the following manner: materials and goods for resale – acquisition cost calculated on weighted average basis, finished goods and work-in-progress – the cost of direct materials and labour and an appropriate portion of indirect production costs, established on the basis of normal capacity. Net realisable value is the selling price estimated as at the balance sheet date net of VAT, excise duty and fuel charge, less any rebates, discounts and other similar items, and less the estimated costs to complete and costs to sell. Mandatory stocks are disclosed as non-current assets given their turnover in a short term. 10.13. Trade and Other Receivables Trade receivables, which typically become due and payable in 7 to 60 days, are recognised and carried at amounts initially invoiced, less impairment losses on doubtful receivables. Impairment losses on receivables are estimated when the collection of the full amount of receivables is no longer probable. Uncollectible receivables are written off through the statement of comprehensive income when recognised as unrecoverable accounts. If the effect of time value of money is significant, the value of receivables is determined by discounting the projected future cash flows to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate reflecting the current market estimates of the time value of money. If the discount method is applied, an increase in receivables over time is recognised as finance income. 10.14. Foreign Currency Transactions Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are reported in the functional currency of the Group companies (Polish złoty) as at the transaction date, using the following exchange rates: 1. buy or sell rate of the bank at which the transaction is effected – in the case of sale and purchase of currencies and payment of receivables and payables; or 2. mid-exchange rate quoted for the given currency by the National Bank of Poland as at that date unless a different exchange rate in specified in another document binding on a given undertaking. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the balance-sheet date are translated into the złoty at relevant złoty mid-exchange rates quoted by the National Bank of Poland as at that date. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are carried as finance income/(expense) or cost of sales, except for foreign exchange gains and losses which are considered a part of borrowing costs and are capitalised in property, plant and equipment (foreign exchange gains and losses on interest). Foreign-exchange gains and losses on valuation of foreign-currency denominated loans are charged against finance income or expenses. Non-monetary assets and liabilities recognised at historic cost expressed in a foreign currency are recognised at the historic exchange rate effective as at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value expressed in a foreign currency are translated as at the balance-sheet date at the exchange rate effective as at the date of determining the fair value. Exchange rates applied for the purposes of balance-sheet valuation: 170 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Mid-exchange rate quoted by the NBP for: Dec 31 2010 Dec 31 2009 USD 2.9641 2.8503 EUR 3.9603 4.1082 NOK 0.5071 0.4946 LTL 1.1469 1.1898 The financial statements of foreign undertakings are translated into the Polish currency at the following exchange rates: items of the statement of financial position – at the mid-exchange rate quoted by the National Bank of Poland for the balance-sheet date; items of the statement of comprehensive income – at the exchange rate computed as the arithmetic mean of mid-exchange rates quoted by the National Bank of Poland for the days ending each financial month. The resulting currency-translation differences are recognised directly in equity as a separate component. At the time of disposal of a foreign undertaking, the accumulated deferred currency-translation differences recognised in equity and relating to this foreign undertaking are transferred to the statement of comprehensive income. 10.15. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash in hand and at banks, as well as and non-current deposits held to maturity are valued at face value. Cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows comprise cash in hand and cash at banks, overdraft facilities as well as those bank deposits maturing within three months which are not treated as investment activity. 10.16. Accruals and Deferrals The Group recognises prepayments if they relate to future reporting periods. Accrued expenses are recognised at probable values of current-period liabilities. Employees of the Group undertakings are entitled to holidays in accordance with the rules set forth in the Polish Labour Code, The Group recognises the cost of employee holidays on an accrual basis using the liability method, The amount of the provision for unused holidays is calculated on the basis of the difference between the balance of holidays actually used and the balance of holidays used established proportionately to the passage of time. 10.17. Equity Equity is recognised in the consolidated financial statements by categories, in accordance with the rules set forth in applicable laws and in the Articles of Association. The share capital of the LOTOS Group is the share capital of the Parent Undertaking and is recognised at its par value, in the amount specified in the Company’s Articles of Association and in the relevant entry in the National Court Register. 10.18. Provisions Provisions are created when the Group has an obligation (legal or following from commercial practice) resulting from past events, and when it is probable that the discharge of this obligation will cause an outflow of funds representing economic benefits, and the amount of the obligation may be reliably estimated. If the Group anticipates that the costs for which provisions have been made will be recovered, e.g. under an insurance agreement, the recovery of such funds is recognised as a separate item of assets, but only when such recovery is practically certain to occur. The cost related to a given provision is disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income net of any recoveries. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, the amount of provisions is determined by discounting projected future cash flows to their present value at gross discount rates reflecting the current market estimates of the time value of money and risks, if any, related to a given obligation. If the discount method is applied, an increase in provisions as a result of lapse of time is recognised as finance expenses. 10.19. Retirement Severance Pays and Length-of-Service Awards In accordance with the company remuneration systems applied by the LOTOS Group companies, the Group’s employees are entitled to length-of-service awards and severance pays upon retirement due to old age or disability. Length-of-service awards are paid out after a specific period of employment. Old-age and disability retirement 171 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 severance pays are one-off and paid upon retirement. Amounts of severance pays and length-of-service awards depend on the length of employment and the average remuneration. The Company creates a provision for future liabilities under retirement severance pays and length-of-service awards in order to assign costs to the periods in which they are incurred. According to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, length-of-service awards are classified as other long-term employee benefits, while retirement severance pays – as defined post-employment benefit plans. The present value of the obligations as at each balance-sheet date is calculated by an independent actuary. The calculated value of the obligations is equal to the amount of discounted future payments, taking into account the employment turnover, and relate to the period ending at the given balance-sheet date. Information concerning demographics and employment turnover is sourced from historical data. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Furthermore, the Company creates a provision for the benefits to which employees and other eligible persons are entitled as part of the Company Social Benefits Fund. 10.20. Profit Distribution for Employee Benefits and Special Accounts According to the business practice followed in Poland, company shareholders have the right to allocate a part of profit for employee benefits by making contributions to the Company’s social benefits fund and to other special accounts. In the financial statements prepared in accordance with the IFRS such distributions are charged to operating expenses in the period to which profit distribution relates. 10.21. Interest-Bearing Bank Loans, Borrowings, and Debt Securities All bank loans, borrowings, and debt securities are initially recognised at cost, equal to the fair value of funds received, less cost of obtaining the loan. Following initial recognition, interest-bearing loans, borrowings, and debt securities are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost includes the cost of obtaining the loan as well as discounts or premiums obtained at settlement of the liability. Upon removal of the liability from the statement of financial position or recognition of value impairment, gains or losses are charged to the statement of comprehensive income. 10.22. Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs are disclosed as the costs of the period in which they were incurred, except for the costs which relate directly to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset being completed, which are capitalised as a part of the cost of such an asset. To the extent that the funds are borrowed specifically for the purpose of acquiring the asset being completed, the amount of the borrowing costs which may be capitalised as part of such asset is determined as the difference between the actual borrowing costs incurred in connection with a given loan in a given period and the proceeds from temporary investments of the borrowed funds. To the extent that the funds are borrowed without a specific purpose and are later allocated for the acquisition of an asset being completed, the amount of the borrowing costs which may be capitalised is determined by applying the capitalisation rate to the capital expenditure on that asset. The accounting policies with respect to capitalisation of currency exchange differences have been described in Note 10.14 Foreign Currency Transactions. 10.23. Government Subsidies If there is reasonable certainty that the subsidy will be received and that all related conditions will be fulfilled, government subsidies are recognised at fair value. If a subsidy concerns a cost item, it is recognised as income in matching with the expenses it is to compensate for. If it concerns an asset, its fair value is recognised as deferred income, and then it is written off annually in equal parts through statement of comprehensive income over the estimated useful life of the asset. 10.24. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emission Allowances The Group recognises carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emission allowances in its financial statements based on the net liability method – the Group recognises only those liabilities that result from exceeding the limit of emission allowances granted, and the liability is recognised only after the Company actually exceeds the limit. The Group analyses the limits granted to it on an annual period basis. Income from the sale of unused emission allowances is credited against the statement of comprehensive income at the time of sale. 172 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 10.25. Taxes 10.25.1 Income Tax Mandatory decrease of profit/(increase of loss) comprises: current income tax (CIT) and deferred income tax. The current portion of the income tax is calculated based on the net profit/(loss) (taxable income) for a given financial year. The net profit (loss) established for tax purposes differs from the net profit (loss) established for financial reporting purposes to the extent of the income which is taxable and costs which are deductible in future years and the expenses and income items which will never be subject to deduction/taxation. The tax charges are calculated based on the tax rates effective for a given financial year. For the purposes of financial reporting, the Company creates deferred tax liabilities using the balance-sheet liability method in relation to all temporary differences existing as at the balance-sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying value as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: except to the extent that the deferred tax liabilities arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination, and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss), and in the case of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiary or associated undertakings, and interests in joint ventures, unless the investor is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are disclosed in relation to all deductible temporary differences, unused tax assets, and unused tax losses brought forward in the amount of the probable taxable income which would enable these differences, assets and losses to be used: except to the extent that the deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination, and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss), and in the case of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiary or associated undertakings and interests in joint ventures, the related deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position to the extent it is probable that in the foreseeable future the temporary differences will be reversed and taxable income will be generated which will enable the deductible temporary differences to be offset. The carrying value of deferred tax assets is revised as at each balance-sheet date and is subject to appropriate reduction to the extent it is no longer probable that taxable income sufficient for a partial or full realisation of the deferred tax assets would be generated. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are calculated using tax rates expected to be effective at the time of realisation of particular asset or release of particular provision, based on tax rates (and tax legislation) effective as at the balance-sheet date or tax rates (and tax legislation) certain to be effective as at the balance-sheet date in the future. Income tax related to items posted directly to equity is disclosed under equity rather than in the statement of comprehensive income. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position in the amount obtained after they are offset for particular undertakings consolidated within the Group. 10.25.2 Value-Added Tax, Excise Duty and Fuel Charge Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are recognised net of the VAT, excise duty and fuel charge: except where the value added tax paid on the purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the tax authorities; in such a case it is recognised in the cost of the given asset or as part of the cost item, and except in the case of receivables and payables, which are recognised inclusive of the VAT, excise duty and fuel charge. The net amount of the VAT, excise duty and fuel charge which is recoverable from or payable to tax authorities is carried in the balance sheet as part of receivables or liabilities. 10.26. Financial Assets Financial assets are classified into the following categories: 173 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Financial assets held to maturity, Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, Loans and receivables, Financial assets available for sale. Financial assets held to maturity are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities, which are quoted on an active market and which the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, other than those: designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition, designated as available for sale, which qualify as loans and receivables. Financial assets held to maturity are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Financial assets held to maturity are classified as non-current assets if they mature more than 12 months after the balance-sheet date. A financial asset at fair value through profit or loss is a financial asset that meets either of the following conditions: a) it is classified as held for trading. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they: have been acquired principally for the purpose of being sold in the near future, are part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is probability of profit-taking in the near future, are derivatives (except for those which are part of hedge accounting or financial guarantee contracts), b) it has been assigned to this category on initial recognition (in accordance with IAS 39). Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, based on their market value on the balance-sheet date, without reflecting sales transaction costs. Any changes in the value of these instruments are recognised directly the statement of comprehensive income as finance income or expenses. An entire contract can be designated as financial assets as at fair value through profit or loss if it contains one or more embedded derivatives. The above does not apply when an embedded derivative has no significant impact on the cash flows generated under the contract or when it is clear without an analysis or following a superficial analysis that if a similar hybrid instrument was first considered, separation of the embedded derivative would have been prohibited. Financial assets may be designated as financial assets as at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition if the following criteria are met: (i) such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (an accounting mismatch); or (ii) the assets are part of a group of financial assets that are managed and measured based on fair value, according to a well-documented risk management strategy; or (iii) the assets contain embedded derivatives which should be presented separately. Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments not classified as derivatives and not traded on any active market. They are disclosed under current assets if they mature within 12 months from the balancesheet date. Loans and receivables with maturities exceeding 12 months from the balance-sheet date are classified as non-current assets. Financial assets available for sale are financial assets that are not derivative instruments, and have been classified as available for sale or do not belong to any of the previous three categories. Financial assets available for sale are recognised at fair value increased by the transaction costs which may be directly attributed to an acquisition or issue of a financial asset. If quoted market prices from an active market are not available and the fair value cannot be reliably measured using alternative methods, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at cost less impairment. The positive or negative differences between the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets (if they have a market price derived from an active market or their fair value can be established in any other reliable manner) and their cost are recognised net of deferred tax in other comprehensive income. Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in finance expenses. Any purchase or sale of financial assets is recognised at the transaction date. On initial recognition, financial assets are recognised at fair value including – in the case of financial assets other than those at fair value through profit or loss – transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase. Financial assets are derecognised when the Group loses control over contractual rights comprising particular financial instruments; this is usually the case when a financial instrument is sold or when all the cash flows related to a given instrument are transferred to a third party. 10.27. Impairment of Financial Assets As at each balance-sheet date the Group determines whether there is objective evidence of impairment of a financial 174 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 asset or a group of financial assets. Assets Carried at Amortised Cost If there is objective evidence that the value of loans and receivables measured at amortised cost has been impaired, the impairment loss is recognised in the amount equal to the difference between the carrying value of a financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future losses relating to irrecoverable receivables, which have not yet been incurred), discounted using the initial effective interest rate (i.e. the interest rate used at the time of initial recognition). The carrying value of an asset is reduced directly or by creating relevant provisions. The amount of loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. First the Group determines whether there exists objective evidence of impairment with respect to each financial asset that is deemed material, and with respect to financial assets that are not deemed material individually. If the analysis shows that there exists no objective evidence of impairment of an individually tested asset, regardless of whether it is material or not, the Group includes the asset into the group of financial assets with similar credit risk profile and tests it for impairment together with the other assets from this group. Assets which are tested for impairment individually, and with respect to which an impairment loss has been recognised or a previously recognised loss is deemed to remain unchanged, are not taken into account when a group of assets are jointly tested for impairment. If an impairment loss decreases in the next period, and the decrease may be objectively associated with an event that occurred subsequent to the impairment loss recognition, the recognised impairment loss is reversed. The subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost as at the reversal date. Financial Assets Carried at Cost If there exists objective evidence of impairment of a non-traded equity instrument which is not carried at fair value since such value cannot be reliably determined, or of a related derivative instrument which must be settled by delivery of such non-traded equity instrument, the amount of impairment loss is established as the difference between the carrying value of the financial asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted with the market rate applicable to similar financial assets prevailing at a given time. Financial Assets Available for Sale If there exists objective evidence of impairment of a financial asset available for sale, the amount of the difference between the cost of that asset (less any principal payments and depreciation/amortisation charges) and its current fair value, reduced by any impairment losses previously recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, is derecognised from equity and charged to the statement of comprehensive income. Reversal of an impairment loss concerning equity instruments qualified as available for sale may not be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. If the fair value of a debt instrument available for sale increases in the next period, and the increase may be objectively associated with an event that occurred subsequent to the impairment loss recognition in the statement of comprehensive income, the amount of the reversed impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 10.28. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivatives used by the Group to hedge against currency risk include in particular FX forwards. In addition, the Group relies on full barrel swaps and commodity swaps to hedge its exposure to raw material and petroleum product prices, uses futures contracts to manage its exposure to prices of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission allowances, and enters into interest rate swaps (IRSs) and forward rate agreements (FRAs) to hedge its interest rate exposure. Derivative financial instruments of this type are measured at fair value. The fair value of FX forwards is established by reference to the forward rates of contracts with similar maturities prevailing at a given time. The fair value of interest rate swaps is established by reference to the market value of similar instruments. Derivative instruments are recognised as assets if their value is positive and as liabilities if their value is negative. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of a derivative which does not qualify for hedge accounting are charged directly to the net profit or loss for the financial year. In the statement of financial position, financial instruments are presented as either current or non-current, depending on the expected time of realisation of assets and liabilities classified as held for trading. 10.29. Trade and Other Payables Current trade payables are reported at nominal amounts payable. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading, and financial liabilities initially designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they were acquired for the purpose of being sold in the near future. Derivative financial instruments, including separated embedded instruments, are also classified as held for trading, unless they are considered as effective hedges. Financial liabilities may be designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition, if the following criteria are met: (i) such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or 175 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases, (ii) the liabilities are part of a group of financial liabilities that are managed and measured based on fair value, according to a well-documented risk management strategy, or (iii) the financial liabilities contain embedded derivative instruments which should be presented separately. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, reflecting their market value as at the balance sheet date, excluding sale transaction costs. Changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognised in profit or loss as finance income or expenses. Other financial liabilities, not classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group removes a financial liability from the balance sheet when it is extinguished, that is, when the obligation specified in the contract is either discharged or cancelled or expires. When a debt instrument between the same parties is replaced by another instrument whose terms are substantially different, the Group treats such replacement as if the former financial liability was extinguished and recognises a new liability. Similarly, material modifications in the terms of a contract concerning an existing financial liability are presented as extinguishment of the former and recognition of a new financial liability. Any differences in the respective carrying values arising in connection with the replacement are charged to profit or loss. Other non-financial liabilities include in particular VAT, excise duty and fuel charge liabilities to the tax authorities and liabilities under received prepayments, which are to be settled by delivery of goods and tangible assets, or performance of services. Other non-financial liabilities are measured at nominal amounts payable. 10.30. Recognition of Revenue Revenue is recognised in the amount of probable economic benefits to be derived by the Group which may be reliably estimated. 10.31. Sales of Products, Goods for Resale and Services Sales revenue is disclosed at the fair value of payments received or due, and it represents the accounts receivable for the products, goods for resale and services provided in the ordinary course of business, less discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes (excise duty, fuel charge). The sales of products and goods for resale are recognised at the moment of delivery, when material risk and benefits resulting from the ownership of the products and goods have been transferred to the purchaser. 10.32. Interest Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate), unless the receipt of the interest is doubtful. 10.33. Dividend Dividend is recognised as finance income as of the date on which the appropriate governing body of the Company adopts a resolution concerning distribution of profit, unless the resolution specifies another dividend record date. 10.34. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards requires a number of judgments and estimates which affect the value of items disclosed in the financial statements and in the notes thereto. Although the judgments and estimates are based on the Management Board’s best knowledge of the current and future events and developments, the actual results might differ from the estimates. The areas in which the Management Board made estimates include provisions, property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets, goodwill, merger transactions, financial assets, and deferred tax assets. Material assumptions used in the estimates are described in the relevant notes. Measurement of Provisions Provisions for employee benefits are estimated using actuarial methods once a year, unless major changes to the assumptions underlying the estimates occur during a given year. The assumptions adopted for the measurement of provisions have been described at greater length in Note 36. Depreciation/Amortisation Charges Depreciation/amortisation charges are determined based on the expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The Group reviews the useful lives of its assets annually, on the basis of current estimates. 176 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of financial instruments for which no active market exists is determined by means of appropriate valuation methods. In selecting appropriate methods and assumptions, the Group relies on professional judgment. The assumptions adopted for the measurement of fair value of financial instruments have been described in Note 42. Deferred Tax Assets The Group recognises deferred tax assets if it is assumed that taxable profit will be generated in the future against which the asset can be utilised. If taxable profit deteriorates in the future, this assumption may prove invalid. The assumptions adopted for the measurement of deferred tax assets have been described in Note 13.4. Impairment of Cash-Generating Units, Individual Items of Property, Plant and Equipment, Intangible Assets and Goodwill The main assumptions used to determine recoverable value relate to evidence of potential impairment, models, discount rates, and growth rates. For information on impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, see Notes 17, 18 and 20. Other than enumerated above, there were no indicators of impairment of value of any of the assets. Crude Oil Production Forecasts On the basis of geological data and identified reservoir characteristcs, as well as test production, subsequent production data and the schedule of work adopted for the long-term strategy, the Group evaluates, revises and updates its 2P (proved and probable) reserves and forecasted production volumes from the individual fields, which serve as the basis for calculation of depreciation (using the units-of-production depreciation method) of the Offshore Oil and Gas Facility assets. For information on crude oil reserves, see Note 17. Provision for Decommissioning of Offshore Oil and Gas Facilities and Provision for Land Reclamation As at each balance-sheet date, the Group analyses the costs necessary to decommission the Offshore Oil and Gas Facilities in the Baltic Sea and the Norwegian Continental Shelf, and the costs to be incurred on future land reclamation. As a result of these analyses, the Group corrects the value of the land reclamation provision set up in previous years by adjusting its value to the amount of indispensable future costs. Any changes in the time value of money are also reflected in the increase of the provision amount. For information of crude oil reserves, see Note 36. 10.35. Net Earnings/(Loss) per Share Earnings/(loss) per share for each period are calculated by dividing the net profit/(loss) for a given period by the weighted average number of shares in this reporting period. If the number of ordinary or potential ordinary shares outstanding increases as a result of a capitalisation, bonus issue, or share split, or decreases as a result of a reverse share split, the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods presented is adjusted retrospectively. If such changes occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, the earnings per share calculations for those and any prior period financial statements presented are based on the new number of shares. The Group does not disclose the diluted earnings/(loss) per share, since there are no dilutive instruments outstanding. 10.36. Contingent Liabilities and Receivables A contingent liability is understood as a duty to discharge an obligation which is conditional upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position, however information on contingent liabilities is disclosed, unless the likelihood of the outflow of funds embodying economic benefits is negligible. Contingent receivables are not recognised in the statement of financial position, however information on them is disclosed if the inflow of funds embodying economic benefits is likely to occur. 10.37. Joint Venture A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control (strategic financial, operating and political decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of the venturers). When a Group member becomes directly involved in activities as part of a joint venture, the Group’s share of jointly controlled assets and liabilities incurred jointly with the other venturers is disclosed in the financial statements of such Group member and classified in accordance with its nature. Liabilities and costs incurred directly in connection with a share in jointly controlled assets are accounted for using the accrual method. Income from the sale or use of the Group’s share of the output produced by jointly controlled assets and the share of expenses 177 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 incurred by the joint venture are recognised when the inflow/transfer by the Group of the economic benefits connected with relevant transactions becomes probable, provided that they can be measured reliably. 10.38. Segment Reporting International Financial Reporting Standard 8 Operating Segments (“IFRS 8”) requires the disclosure of information on the Group’s operating segments based on internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision makers to make decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and to assess the segments’ performance. For management purposes, the LOTOS Group is divided into business units which correspond to the business segments. The Group’s operating activity comprises two main reportable operating segments: upstream segment – comprising activities related to the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas reserves, and crude oil and natural gas production, downstream segment – comprising the production and processing of refined petroleum products and their wholesale and retail sale, as well as auxiliary, transport and service activities. The segments are identified at the Group level. The Parent Undertaking is included in the downstream segment. The upstream segment is comprised of the LOTOS Petrobaltic Group (excluding Energobaltic Sp. z o.o.). Segment performance is assessed on the basis of sales revenue, EBIT (= operating profit/(loss)) and EBITDA (= operating profit/(loss) before depreciation and amortisation). The segments’ sales revenue, EBIT and EBITDA do not account for intersegment adjustments. Financial information of the operating segments used by the chief operating decision makers to assess their performance is presented in Note 11.

Income Tax 13.1 Tax Expense The main components of the tax expense for the year ended December 31st 2010 and for the year ended December 31st 2009 are as follows: Year ended Year ended Dec 31 Dec 31 PLN '000 2010 2009 Corporate income tax 94,810 84,239 Deferred tax (54,224) 113,557 Total tax charged to consolidated profit 40,586 197,796 Income tax expense recognised in the statement of changes in 88 equity Income tax expense recognised in other comprehensive income (2,877) For entities operating in Poland, the current portion of income tax was calculated at the rate of 19% of the corporate income tax base. In the case of foreign subsidiary LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS, the marginal tax rate is 78% of the tax base. LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS's activities are subject to taxation under two parallel tax systems: the corporate income tax system (28% tax rate) and the petroleum tax system (additional tax rate of 50%). 13.2 Income Tax Calculated at Effective Tax Rate and Reconciliation of Pretax Profit (Loss) to Taxable Income The change in deferred tax assets and liabilities charged to the statement of comprehensive income in 2010 is primarily attributable to the fact that as of January 1st 2010 Grupa LOTOS S.A. and some Group companies have applied the tax method to measure the foreign exchange differences for the purpose of corporate income tax settlements.

Assets for Social Purposes and Liabilities of the Company’s Social Benefits Fund The Act on Employee Benefits Fund of March 4th 1994, as amended, stipulates that each employer of more than 20 staff (in full-time job equivalents) should create the Social Benefits Fund. In accordance with the statute and internal rules of procedure, the Group creates such fund and makes regular contributions to it, which are charged to costs. The purpose of the Social Benefits Fund is to subsidise social activities of the Group companies, finance loans to employees and other social spending. The Group offset the Fund’s assets against its liabilities towards the Fund as the assets are not fully controlled by the LOTOS Group companies.

Prospects for Development of the B-4 and B-6 Gas Fields The item “Tangible assets under construction” includes expenditure of PLN 48,113 thousand incurred by LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. on gas exploration at the B-4 and B-6 fields (including exploration and evaluation assets of PLN 47,520 thousand), on which an impairment loss was recognised in 2010 (the impairment loss was charged to other operating expenses). According to the findings of the analyses which have been carried out, significant capital expenditure is required to obtain profitable commercial production of hydrocarbons. Given the results of the activities carried out to date with the aim of finding a partner for a joint development of the B-4 and B-6 gas fields, the Management Board of LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. made a decision to intensify the process. In the medium term, LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. does not plan to incur any material expenditure on development of the B-4 and B-6 gas fields, until there are any concrete arrangements regarding the terms of potential cooperation with a business partner as part of a joint venture. Information on Interests in Norwegian Production and Exploration Licences The item “Tangible assets under construction” includes expenditure of NOK 2,345,122 thousand (the equivalent of PLN 1,189,212 thousand, translated at the mid-exchange rate for NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2010) incurred by LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS on the purchase of interests in Norwegian production licences and on the YME field development, additionally adjusted by the tax effect connected with the YME field purchase transaction, of NOK 75,966 thousand (i.e. PLN 38,522 thousand, translated at the mid-exchange rate for 196 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2010). The Group tested these assets for impairment based on a discounted cash flow analysis of LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS's interests in the hydrocarbon reserves held under the acquired production licences covering the YME field development project. As at December 31st 2010, the carrying value of these interests amounted to NOK 2,270 million, taking into account the tax effect connected with the YME field purchase transaction. The YME field impairment test as at December 31st 2010 was carried out assuming a change in crude oil prices by +/15%/bbl relative to Brent crude oil spot and forward prices as at January 3rd 2011, a +/-15% change on the USD/NOK forward rate as at January 3rd 2011, and a +/-15% change in the YME field reserves, analysing a weighted average cost of capital of 6.5% to 9% subject to a 78% marginal tax rate. The Group determines the recoverable amount of the YME field based on the values in use, using the discounted cash flow method. Future cash flows were calculated by LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS based on 10-year production volume and cost forecasts prepared by Talisman Energy AS (the field operator). As at December 31st 2010, the carrying amount of the assets related to the YME field was within the limits of the recoverable amount ranges, determined by assuming a +/-15%/bbl change in crude oil prices, a +/-15% change in the USD/NOK exchange rate and a +/-15% change in the field reserves, and analysing a weighted average cost of capital of 6.5% to 9% after tax. Therefore, the Management Board concluded that the tests did not demonstrate any necessity to recognise impairment losses. Sensitivity to Changes in the Adopted Assumptions Calculation of the YME field's recoverable amount is most sensitive to the following variables: Volatility in crude oil prices Volume of recoverable crude oil reserves in the YME field NOK/USD exchange rate fluctuations Discount Due to high market volatility, in particular with respect to crude oil prices, the adopted assumptions might be subject to reasonable changes, as a result of which the YME field's carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the assets recognised in connection with the YME field will be realised, as the projected cash flows depend on a number of factors in the future, in particular crude price fluctuations. Given the specific structure of the project, involving significant tax benefits and the related tax shield, and provided that the assumptions adopted at the end of 2010 remain unchanged, the major part of the projects' recoverable amount will be absorbed in 2011-2014. Therefore, when applying the units-of-production depreciation method (which consists in charging to expenses the depreciation attributable to a unit of produced crude oil) the carrying amount of the YME field related assets may be decreasing at a slower rate than their recoverable amount, which may entail the necessity to make charges to expenses to decrease the assets' carrying amount in excess of the recoverable amount. As at December 31st 2010, LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS held exploration licences PL 316 and PL 316B (20% interest in the YME field) and the following exploration licence interests: 20% interest in licence PL 455, 10% interest in licence PL 497/497B, 25% interest in licence PL 498, 25% interest in licence PL 503, 20% interest in licence PL 515, and 50% interest in licence PL 556. Furthermore, under “Intangible assets” LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS recognised expenditure of NOK 115,892 thousand as at December 31st 2010 (the equivalent of PLN 58,769 thousand, translated at the mid-exchange rate for NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2010) incurred on the exploration licences, and in particular the PL 455 licence. The balance sheet item “Intangible assets” is additionally adjusted by the tax effect of NOK 271 thousand (i.e. PLN 138 thousand, translated at the mid-exchange rate for NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2010). As at December 31st 2010, the net value of intangible assets related to exploration licences, net of impairment loss, amounts to NOK 60,246 thousand (the equivalent of PLN 30,551 thousand, translated at the mid-exchange rate for NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2010) (see Note 18). Volume of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Held by the LOTOS Group The volume of crude oil and natural gas reserves held by the LOTOS Group is as follows: Dec 31 2010 Dec 31 2009 Crude oil (2P*) 6.2 million tonnes 6.4 million tonnes Crude oil (2C**) 1.3 million tonnes 0.8 million tonnes Natural gas (2P*) 0.5 billion cubic metres 4.5 billion cubic metres Natural gas (2C**) 6.5 billion cubic metres 2.4 billion cubic metres 197 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 *2P proved and probable reserves **2C contingent resources As at December 31st 2010, the Group reclassified gas reserves from 2P (proved and probable reserves) to 2C (contingent resources), until there are any concrete arrangements regarding the terms of potential cooperation with a business partner as part of a joint venture and development of the B-4 and B-6 fields advances, enabling commercial production. The 10+ Programme (Comprehensive Technical Upgrade Programme) An element of the growth strategy of the LOTOS Group is the implementation of the 10+ Programme, designed to increase the throughput capacity of the Gdańsk Refinery by approximately 75%, that is to 10.5m tonnes of crude oil p.a., at a higher conversion ratio. As at December 31st 2010, the 10+ Programme reached a 100% completion status, meaning it was completed as scheduled. All the work connected with the engineering design, procurement and construction has been completed for all the basic and auxiliary installations. In 2010, the following basic units reached the Ready For Start Up status: mild hydrocracker (MHC), residue oil supercritical extraction (ROSE). On December 31st 2010, the Final Acceptance Commission signed the Ready for Start Up Certificate for the ROSE unit, the last of the installations constructed as part of the 10+ Programme to have been officially handed over for start up to the target user (the Crude Oil Distillation Complex). Also the following auxiliary infrastructure entered the Ready For Start Up phase in 2010: nitrogen production unit, hydrogen recovery unit (HRU), inter-facility pipeline connection systems (phase III), pumping stations, buildings of the S31 electrical substation, roads and yards commissioned gradually together with the installations. The majority of the 10+ Programme units and facilities have been placed in operation in 2010, including: amine sulphur recovery unit (ASR), hydrogen generation unit (HGU), hydrodesulphurisation unit (HDS), refinery-harbour product pipeline, hydrogen recovery unit (HRU), crude distillation unit (CDU/VDU), product tanks, pumping stations. Work on the 10+ Programme units which has been scheduled for 2011 includes mainly work related to start up of the MHC and the ROSE units, as well as additional work related to operational recommendations for the CDU/VDU unit and extension of the utilities and off-sites. At present, Grupa LOTOS S.A. is making preparations to launch in 2012-2015 the second phase of the 10+ Programme, which will focus on the management of heavy residue. As at December 31st 2010, capitalised expenditure on the IGCC project, including a reduction of production lines capacity and a different method of processing of gases, was PLN 6,239 thousand (as at December 31st 2009: PLN 20,468 thousand).

The above transaction was accounted for and presented in these consolidated financial statements as a business combination achieved in stages within the meaning of the revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations, based on the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Below are presented the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the accounting for the goodwill as at the acquisition date, that is November 27th 2009: (PLN '000) November 27th 2009 Consideration transferred (acquisition-date fair value) (A) 34,179 Acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity 35,456 interest in the acquiree (B) Total (A+B) 69,635 Equity interest in the acquiree 100.00% Current assets, including: 8,164 Cash and cash equivalents 4,561 Non-current assets 130,620 Total assets 138,784 Provisions 10,303 Non-current liabilities 45,660 Current liabilities, and accruals and deferred income 14,312 Total liabilities and provisions 70,275 Net assets 68,509 Company's share in net assets 68,509 Excess of the share in net assets over acquisition cost (goodwill) 1,126 In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer remeasures its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognises the resulting gain or loss, if any, in the statement of comprehensive income. The remeasurement of LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A.'s previously held equity interest in Energobaltic Sp. z o.o. at its acquisition-date fair value was posted to finance income in 2009 in the amount of PLN 12,525 thousand. Determination of the fair value of the consideration transferred had to take into account the valuation of the liabilities and receivables taken over by LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. as part of the business combination, of PLN 321 thousand. By December 31st 2010, LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. had discharged its liabilities connected with the acquisition of shares, amounting to PLN 3,035 thousand (as at December 31st 2009: 3,035 thousand). As at the balance-sheet date, that is December 31st 2010, LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A.'s liability under the acquisition of shares in Energobaltic Sp. z o.o. from Stablewood Power Ventures (Wladyslawowo) Ltd. amounted to PLN 31,669 thousand (as at December 31st 2009: PLN 30,011 thousand). (3) Goodwill Arising on Acquisition of an Organised Part of Business from ExxonMobil Poland and Slovnaft Polska As at December 31st 2010 and December 31st 2009, the Group disclosed goodwill from the acquisition of an organised part of business from ExxonMobil Poland and Slovnaft Polska, with a net value of PLN 31,759 thousand and PLN 1,932 thousand, respectively. 204 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 The Group determines the recoverable amount of goodwill based on the value in use, using the discounted cash flow method. Future cash flows were calculated based on five-year cash-flow projections. The residual value for the discounted cash flows was calculated using the growing perpetuity formula. A fixed growth rate of 2.23% (2009: 2.76%) was used to extrapolate cash-flows projections beyond the five-year period. The extrapolation was based on a quantitative forecast of the fuel consumption growth rate in Poland in 2009–2015. To test goodwill for impairment, the Group assumed net weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.61% (2009: 8.86%). Discounted cash flows calculated separately for each cash-generating unit were grossed up. As at December 31st 2010 and December 31st 2009, the Group tested its assets for impairment. As at December 31st 2010 and December 31st 2009, no additional impairment loss on the goodwill was recognised (impairment tests of goodwill allocated to individual cash-generating units did not reveal the need to recognize any impairment losses).

An assessment of the land and water environment, geological structure of the area and an analysis of the potential costs of land reclamation methods used at LOTOS Czechowice S.A., carried out by an independent entity as at December 31st 2010, enabled the Group to determine a revalued amount of the provision at PLN 18,900 thousand, which in the Group's opinion, is a reliable estimate. The cost of dismantlement and decommissioning of retired installations was estimated at by a qualified property appraiser also at LOTOS Czechowice S.A. The revalued provision for the indispensable costs of dismantlement and decommissioning of permanently retired installations amounted to PLN 15,699 thousand. The Group's computation of the provisions for employee benefits was based on the following assumptions: the long-term annual growth rate of remuneration: within the range 0% – 5%; in the following years: 1.5%– 7% (December 31st 2009: the long-term annual growth rate of remuneration: within the range 0% – 6.1%; in the following years: 1.5% – 7%), the discount rate for future payments of employee benefits is 5.8% (i.e. it equals the return on the safest longterm securities traded on the Polish capital market as at the valuation date) (December 31st 2009: 6.2%), the probability of employee attrition is based on the historical data on employee turnover at the Group and statistical data on employee attrition in the industry, the adopted mortality and life expectancy ratios are based on the Life Expectancy Tables of Poland for 2009, published by the Polish Central Statistics Office (GUS) and assume that the Group's employee population is representative of the average Polish population in terms of mortality (December 31st 2009: Life Expectancy Tables of Poland for 2008), it is assumed that the Company employees will retire according to the standard system, i.e. men – after reaching the age of 65, women – after reaching the age of 60, except for those employees who, based on the information provided by the Group, meet the conditions for early retirement. 36.1 Change in Provisions The changes in provisions were as follows: 234 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

(2) As at December 31st 2010, the Management Board of LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. analysed the costs needed to be incurred to decommission the Offshore Oil and Gas Facilities in the B -3 and B -8 mining areas, which were also worked in the previous years. The analysis found that the costs necessary to be incurred in future on decommissioning of the Offshore Oil and Gas Facilities in the mining areas increased in 2010 due to changes in the expected expenses due to price changes by PLN 8,906 thousand (2009: PLN 15,853 thousand), and due to the passage of time and the related change in the time value of money by PLN 8,038 thousand, charged to finance expenses in 2010 (2009: PLN 7,048 thousand). As at the balance-sheet date, i.e. December 31st 2010, LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS recognised a provision for future costs related to the decommissioning of the Offshore Oil and Gas Facilities at the YME field in the amount of NOK 64,400 thousand (or PLN 32,657 thousand, translated at the mid-exchange rate for NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2010). The liquidation of non -current assets of the Offshore Oil and Gas facilities at the YME field and land reclamation are scheduled for 2021. Compared with the provision of NOK 48,202 thousand (or PLN 23,841, translated at the mid-exchange rate for NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2009) assessed as at December 31st 2009, the provision was increased by an upward adjustment in the estimated future costs amounting to NOK 12,129 thousand (PLN 6,151 thousand, translated at the mid-exchange rate for NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2010) and by a discount representing the estimated changes in the time value of money amounting to NOK 4,097 thousand (PLN 2,078 thousand, translated at the mid-exchange rate for NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2010). The amount of the provision was reduced due to the use of NOK 27,000 (PLN 14,000, translated at the mid-exchange rate for NOK quoted by the National Bank of Poland for December 31st 2010). Another change in the provision resulted from the fact that the amount corresponding to the contributions calculated and transferred to the bank account of the Mining Facilities Decommissioning Fund (pursuant to the Geological and Mining Law of February 4th 1994 and the Minister of Economy’s Regulation of June 24th 2002) was released from the provision. For 2010, this amount totalled PLN 1,836 thousand (2009: PLN 1,485 thousand) jointly in respect of the B -3 and B -8 fields. As at December 31st 2010 the provision for decommissioning of the B -3 and B -8 Offshore Oil and Gas Facilities totalled PLN 153,963 thousand (December 31st 2009: PLN 138,585 thousand), and the value of the related asset was PLN 82,901 thousand as at December 31st 2010 (as at December 31st 2009: PLN 83,311 thousand).

On July 1st 2008, the Council of Ministers adopted, by way of a regulation, the National Allocation Plan of Carbon Dioxide (CO2 ) Emission Allowances for 2008-2012, issued under the EU carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emission trading scheme to existing installations and installations undergoing modification (Dz. U. of November 14th 2008, No. 202, item 1248). In accordance with the current legislation, allowances under Phase II (2008–2012) were allocated free of charge to all the installations covered by the emission trading scheme. The aggregate annual average carbon dioxide (CO2 ) allowance granted to the Group companies in 2010 was 1,236 thousand tonnes. Additionally, by virtue of the decision of the Marshal of the Gdańsk Province, dated January 18th 2011, Grupa LOTOS S.A. obtained allowances for 143 thousand tonnes, to be used by the Company’s CHP.

In the opinion of the Company’s Management Board, given that in fact the production and sale of the U95 universal gasoline were not discontinued, the allegations of the Competition and Consumer Protection Office are unfounded. In April 2005, the Management Board motioned for issuing a decision to the effect that Grupa LOTOS S.A. has not been found to use practices restricting competition. In July 2005, the Company appealed to the Anti-Monopoly Court against the Competition and Consumer Protection Office’s decision limiting access to a part of the evidence gathered in the case. Independent of the appeal, in September 2005 the Company filed another request with the Court to issue a decision to the effect that Grupa LOTOS S.A. does not use monopolistic practices. In October 2005, the Company received another decision of the Competition and Consumer Protection Office concerning limitation of access to a part of the evidence, against which the Company appealed to the Anti-Monopoly Court. The Regional Court Competition and Consumer Protection Court, dismissed the appeals.

Cassation complaints have been filed against all of the above decisions by Rafineria Czechowice S.A. (currently LOTOS Czechowice S.A.), in the case of the tax for July 1998, and by the Tax Chamber Head, in the case of the tax for October 1998, for July 1998 and for May 1998. LOTOS Czechowice S.A. paid the amounts of VAT together with default interest. There is a possibility that as a result of the tax and court proceedings the amounts paid will be returned together with high interest. In December 2005, LOTOS Czechowice S.A. received the following decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court: a decision repealing the decision of the Provincial Administrative Court issued in December 2004 (with respect to the tax for October 1998) in the part concerning determination of the tax liability, tax arrears and default interest; the above issues were submitted for re-examination to the Provincial Administrative Court, and with respect to other issues the cassation complaint was dismissed; a decision repealing the decision of the Provincial Administrative Court issued in December 2004 (with respect to the tax for May 1998) in the part concerning determination of the tax liability, tax arrears and default interest; the above issues were submitted for re-examination to the Provincial Administrative Court, and with respect to other issues the cassation complaint was dismissed; a decision upholding the decision of the Provincial Administrative Court issued in December 2004 (with respect to the tax for July 1998); the Supreme Administrative Court resolved not to award costs of cassation proceedings.

By virtue of decision of November 27th 2006, the Provincial Administrative Court of Gliwice dismissed the cassation complaint concerning the tax for October 1998. Currently, the proceedings are pending before the Constitutional Court concerning breach of the Constitution, committed by issuing a decision on dismissal of the cassation complaint. With respect to the case concerning overpayment of VAT for August 1998, in the amount of PLN 292.7 thousand, the Provincial Administrative Court of Gliwice dismissed the complaint against the decision of the Tax Chamber Head by virtue of the ruling of June 26th 2007. The ruling was appealed against by LOTOS Czechowice S.A. to the Supreme Administrative Court; the case is pending. On December 29th 2007, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the cassation complaint concerning the tax for May 1998. The company appealed to the last instance authority and lodged a complaint to the Constitutional Court, which may repeal the decisions of the tax authorities as issued on the basis of unconstitutional provisions of the regulations of the Minister of Finance. The objection in the complaint concerns exceeding the statutory competence of the Minister of Finance as regards issuing regulations. The proceedings do not pose any financial threat to the company as additional liabilities resulting from the decisions issued by the tax authorities were paid along with interest in the previous years and may only be a source of additional income for LOTOS Czechowice S.A. Proceedings Related to Excise Duty for Certain Months of 1998 As a result of the inspections carried out by the tax authorities, there are six tax proceedings pending against LOTOS Czechowice S.A., related to the decisions concerning excise duty for certain months of 1998, against which the LOTOS Czechowice S.A. submitted appeals to the administrative court. The total value of the claims disputed under appeal proceedings is PLN 2,881 thousand. The Supreme Administrative Court set October 26th 2005 as the date for the court hearing concerning excise duty for September 1998, August 1998 and June 1998. By virtue of the Supreme Administrative Court’s ruling, the Provincial Administrative Court’s decision regarding excise duty for September 1998, August 1998 and June 1998 was repealed in full and remanded for re-examination. LOTOS Czechowice S.A. paid the amounts of excise duty together with default interest. There is a possibility that as a result of the tax and court proceedings the amounts paid will be returned together with high interest. LOTOS Czechowice S.A. filed cassation complaints with the Supreme Administrative Court against the decisions of the Provincial Administrative Court of Gliwice dated April 27th 2006 in the cases concerning taxes for: September 1998 – PLN 52.5 thousand, August 1998 – PLN 842 thousand, 246 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 June 1998 – PLN 468.8 thousand, Considering the case of the tax for October 1998, in the amount of PLN 1,138.8 thousand, the Provincial Administrative Court of Gliwice suspended the proceedings. No negative tax consequences for LOTOS Czechowice S.A. may arise in connection with these proceedings; they may only be a source of additional income. By virtue of the decision of the Provincial Administrative Court of Gliwice, dated October 16th 2006, issued in the proceedings regarding tax for August 1998 (with respect to the request for returning the difference between the court fee actually paid and the court fee due), the Provincial Administrative Court decided to return PLN 57.9 thousand to LOTOS Czechowice S.A. On December 29th 2007, the Supreme Administrative Court issued a ruling dismissing the cassation complaints in the following cases: the case relating to the tax for September 1998 (PLN 52.5 thousand), the case relating to the tax for August 1998 (PLN 842 thousand), the case relating to the tax for June 1998 (PLN 468.8 thousand). The company appealed to the last instance authority and lodged a complaint to the Constitutional Court, which may repeal the decisions of the tax authorities as issued on the basis of unconstitutional provisions of the regulations of the Minister of Finance. The objection stated in the complaint refers to the fact that in issuing the regulations the Minister of Finance acted beyond the scope of his statutory mandate. The proceedings do not pose any financial threat to the company, and may only be a source of additional income (as additional liabilities resulting from the decisions issued by the tax authorities were paid along with interest in the previous years).

By virtue of the decision of March 19th 2006, the Head of the Customs Office of Bielsko-Biała set the deadline for resolving the case at May 30th 2007.

On December 1st 2008, LOTOS Czechowice S.A. filed an appeal against the decision issued by the Head of the Customs Office determining the excise duty liabilities in amounts exceeding those declared by the company, with the Director of the Customs Chamber of Katowice, through the agency of the Head of the Customs Office in Bielsko-Biała. On December 4th 2008, the Director of the Customs Chamber in Katowice initiated enforcement proceedings against LOTOS Czechowice S.A. by issuing enforcement orders with respect to the decisions of the Head of the Customs Office in Bielsko-Biała regarding excise duty liabilities for September – December 2003, and by seizing the amounts owed from LOTOS Czechowice S.A.’s bank accounts.

On December 17th and 18th 2008, the District Court of Pszczyna registered the seven ordinary compulsory mortgages as was requested. On December 23rd 2008, the Court resolved to dismiss one of the requests filed by the Director of the Customs Chamber in Katowice on the grounds of having encountered obstacles in registration (inconsistencies between the contents of the Land and Mortgage Register entry and the request). On February 23rd 2009, LOTOS Czechowice S.A. received four decisions of the Director of the Customs Chamber of Katowice repealing the earlier decisions of the Head of the Customs Office of Bielsko-Biała and remanding the cases for re-examination. Given the decisions of the Director of the Katowice Customs Chamber of March 4th 2009 to discontinue the enforcement proceedings concerning the excise duty liabilities for September – December 2003, the Director of the Katowice Customs Chamber filed relevant requests with the District Court of Pszczyna to de-register the mortgages. On May 4th, May 6th, and May 14th 2009, LOTOS Czechowice S.A. received notices from the District Court of Pszczyna to the effect that the compulsory mortgages, previously registered at the request of the Director of the Customs Chamber in Katowice, were de-registered. By virtue of the decisions of the Head of the Customs Office of Bielsko-Biała dated August 28th 2009, the deadline for resolving the cases concerning the excise duty liabilities for the period September – December 2003 was extended to October 28th 2009.

Subsequently, by virtue of decisions dated February 25th 2010, the Head of the Customs Office of Bielsko-Biała set May 28th 2010 as a new deadline for resolving the cases. On May 17th 2010, the Head of the Customs Office in Bielsko-Biała issued decisions determining the amounts of excise duty liability for September, October, November and December 2003, which exceeded the excise duty liability amounts reported by LOTOS Czechowice S.A. in its tax returns: by PLN 3,588 thousand – with respect to the excise duty liability for September 2003, by PLN 12,189 thousand – with respect to the excise duty liability for October 2003, by PLN 8,887 thousand – with respect to the excise duty liability for November 2003, by PLN 6,223 thousand – with respect to the excise duty liability for December 2003.

The amounts specified in the decision were paid by LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. On September 24th 2007, the company appealed against the decision of the Gdańsk Tax Office. On January 18th 2008, the Head of the Tax Chamber of Gdańsk issued decision No. PC/4407-660/07/13 upholding decision No. PV/4400-96/124/VT/06/AR of the Head of the Gdańsk Tax Office, dated September 10th 2007, stating that the excess of input VAT over output VAT for March 2005 was PLN 5,292 thousand and that the amount of tax difference to be returned was PLN 5,292 thousand, and requiring the company to additionally pay PLN 7,842 thousand on account of value added tax for March 2005. On February 1st 2008, LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. appealed to the Provincial Administrative Court of Gdańsk against decision No. PC/4407-660/07/13 issued by the Head of the Tax Chamber of Gdańsk. The decision concerns the right to reduce the tax amount due as settlement for the month in which the seller was provided by the buyer with a confirmation of receipt of an adjusting invoice, arising from settlement of the acquisition of an organised part of business of LOTOS Gaz S.A., and compliance of additional tax sanctions in this respect with the constitution.

On July 31st 2008, the Head of the Gdańsk Tax Chamber filed with the Supreme Administrative Court of Warsaw a cassation complaint against the decision of the Provincial Administrative Court of Gdańsk dated June 24th 2008. On January 19th 2010, the Supreme Administrative Court of Warsaw reversed the decision issued in respect of LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. by the Provincial Administrative Court of Gdańsk concerning the correctness of VAT settlements for March 2005 and remanded the case for re-examination. On June 17th 2010, the Provincial Administrative Court of Gdańsk dismissed LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o.’s complaint. In connection with the foregoing, the previously reported amount receivable in connection with the sanction paid by LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. concerning an additional tax liability of PLN 7,850 thousand, was included in other operating expenses of LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. for 2010. LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. does not expect any additional costs related to the settlement of the purchase of an organised part of business of LOTOS Gaz S.A. On August 25th 2010, LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. lodged a cassation complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court of Warsaw. As at the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the case was pending. Court Proceedings Instigated by WANDEKO Court proceedings are pending against LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o., instigated by Mr Andrzej Wójcik, conducting business activity under the business name of WANDEKO. On October 28th 2009, District Court of Gdańsk, Commercial Division IX, issued a default judgement awarding PLN 1,921 thousand plus contractual interest from the company to the plaintiff. LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. created a provision for the amount awarded against it along with interest in the amount of PLN 15,318 thousand. The company appealed against the judgement by lodging an objection to the default judgement with the Regional Court of Gdańsk on November 10th 2009. Due to the objection, the case is under examination as to its merits by the first instance court. The default judgement does not constitute an enforceable document as the judgement was reversed following the intervention by the company. Concurrently, as by virtue of statutory provisions a default judgement constitutes an interlocutory injunction, LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. filed an application requesting that also this restriction be lifted. By virtue of its non-final decision of April 14th 2010, the Regional Court of Gdańsk lifted the interlocutory injunction in its entirety in compliance with LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o.’s request. Following a complaint by Mr Andrzej Wójcik of May 18th 2010, in its decision of October 13th 2010 the Gdańsk Court of Appeals changed the aforesaid decision of the Regional Court of Gdańsk, as a result of which the default judgement still constitutes an interlocutory injunction. By virtue of its decision of December 28th 2010, the Court of Appeals dismissed Mr Andrzej Wójcik's complaint against the decision issued by the Regional Court of Gdańsk rejecting reversal of a decision to lift court order making default judgement immediately enforceable, and awarded reimbursement of the cost of proceedings to LOTOS Paliwa Sp. z o.o. As at the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the case was 250 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 pending. Material Court Proceedings Instigated against Grupa LOTOS S.A. Proceedings Brought by PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. Seeking Compensation for Losses Incurred as a Result of Monopolistic Practices On May 18th 2001, PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. brought an action against the Company whereby it sought the courts’ decision awarding an amount of PLN 6,975 thousand, together with statutory interest from May 1st 1999, as compensation for damage incurred as a result of the Company’s monopolistic practices, which involved selling BS base oils in a manner favouring some customers, whose orders were executed to a disproportionately higher extent than the orders of PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. The alleged use of the monopolistic practices by the Company was confirmed by a decision of the Anti-Monopoly Office of September 26th 1996, in which the Office ordered the Company to abandon such practices. The Company appealed against the decision. The Provincial Court of Warsaw – the Anti-Monopoly Court, changed, by virtue of its decision of October 22nd 1997, only the wording of the decision and ordered the Company to abandon monopolistic practices. The cassation complaint against this decision filed by the Company was dismissed by the Supreme Court by virtue of its decision of June 2nd 1999. The Regional Court of Gdańsk, by virtue of its decision of December 21st 2002, dismissed the action for compensation, fully complying with the Company’s objection referring to the statute of limitation. However, this decision was overruled on December 4th 2003 by the Gdańsk Court of Appeals, in case No. I ACa 824/03, and remanded for re-examination by the Regional Court of Gdańsk. The Court of Appeals found that the reference to the statute of limitation was not justified. According to the Court, it was only on June 2nd 1999 (the date of the Supreme Court’s ruling) that PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. became aware that the damage it incurred resulted from monopolistic practices giving rise to the Company’s liability in tort, and it is as of that date, in the Court’s opinion, that the three-year period of limitation of compensation claims should be counted. The case was pending before the Regional Court of Gdańsk (First Instance Court); court docket No. IX GC134/04. The Company has also defended itself by raising objections as to the merits of the case (it questions the fact that any damage was incurred by PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o., the amount of the alleged damage, and the existence of the cause and effect relationship between the monopolistic practices and the damage). Following a hearing held in June 2005, the Regional Court of Gdańsk ordered an court expert in accountancy and economics to draw up an opinion concerning the extent of the damage which the plaintiff incurred as a result of Grupa LOTOS S.A.’s activities. In the issued opinion, the court expert stated that based on the materials presented by PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. it was not possible to establish the amount of the losses or even state whether any losses were actually incurred. Besides, the expert pointed out that an opinion should be requested from an court expert in a field other than accountancy. The lack of evidence required to issue an opinion prevented the plaintiff from procuring the appointment of another expert witness. Another hearing was held on March 27th 2007. Announcement of the ruling was scheduled for April 10th 2007, and subsequently postponed until April 20th 2007. Pursuant to the ruling of April 20th 2007, the action was dismissed. On May 17th 2007, the Company filed an appeal against the court's decision regarding the cost of the proceedings. On June 4th 2007, PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. lodged an appeal against the ruling issued on April 20th 2007. On August 12th 2007, the Company submitted its response to the appeal. On December 20th 2007, the Court dismissed PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o.’s appeal against the Regional Court's decision. On March 19th 2008, an enforcement motion was filed with a Court Enforcement Officer against PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. On April 17th 2008, PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. lodged a cassation complaint against the ruling of December 20th 2007. The complaint was delivered to Grupa LOTOS S.A. on June 17th 2008. On June 30th 2008, Grupa LOTOS S.A. sent a response to the complaint. The case was referred to pre-trial proceedings scheduled for November 14th 2008. On January 14th 2009, the Supreme Court reversed the ruling appealed against and remanded the case for re-examination by the Court of Appeals in Gdańsk. On March 10th 2009, the case files were delivered to the Court of Appeals. On April 3rd 2009, the Court Enforcement Officer sent the decision on discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings. On May 14th 2009, the Court of Appeals referred the case to the Regional Court for re-examination. During a hearing held on November 3rd 2009, the Court obliged PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. to appoint an expert. On October 1st 2010, a hearing was held during which the expert was heard. As at the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the case was pending. The Company’s Management Board is of the opinion that the risk of an unfavourable ruling in a potential dispute is low, therefore no provisions for potential damages were created in these consolidated financial statements. Proceedings Brought by the Minister of State Treasury Seeking Invalidation of the Share Purchase Agreement Concerning Shares in Naftoport Sp. z o.o. On November 3rd 2005, Grupa LOTOS S.A. was served a nullity suit submitted by the Minister of State Treasury, concerning the agreement of August 18th 1998 between Grupa LOTOS S.A. and Polska Żegluga Morska, a stateowned company, providing for the sale of two shares in Naftoport Sp. z o.o., valued at PLN 3,340 thousand. On April 21st 2006, the Regional Court of Gdańsk, IX Commercial Division, issued a ruling dismissing the suit in its entirety. On June 8th 2006, the Minister of State Treasury appealed against the ruling of April 21st 2006 which dismissed the Minister’s nullity suit regarding the agreement of August 18th 1998. On June 30th 2006, the Company filed its response to the appeal. On December 28th 2006, the Court of Appeals passed a ruling reversing the challenged decision of April 21st 2006 and declaring the agreement on the sale of two shares in Naftoport Sp. z o.o. as invalid. On April 6th 2007, the Company filed a cassation complaint and a request to stay enforcement of the decision of the second instance. By virtue of the ruling of the Court of Appeals of Szczecin dated April 20th 2007, the request to stay enforcement of the decision of the second instance was dismissed. On August 10th 2007, the Supreme Court issued a decision to accept the cassation complaint for consideration. On November 21st 2007, the Supreme Court issued a decision to remand the 251 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 case back to the Court of Appeals of Szczecin. The hearing was held on May 7th 2008. The court dismissed the claim in its entirety and decided that the costs of the proceedings in the amount of PLN 100 thousand would be returned to Grupa LOTOS S.A. On May 7th 2008, the court’s decision became final. On August 20th 2008, the State Treasury lodged a cassation complaint. On December 11th 2008, the case files arrived at the Supreme Court, Civil Chamber Division II. In a closed session held on March 6th 2009, the court accepted the complaint for consideration. The date of the hearing was set for May 6th 2009; during the hearing, the Supreme Court remanded the case for re-examination by the Szczecin Court of Appeals. At the hearing held on September 30th 2009, the Court of Appeals dismissed the action and awarded reimbursement of the cost of court proceedings to Grupa LOTOS S.A. by the State Treasury. On January 11th 2010, the State Treasury lodged a cassation complaint against the ruling to the Court of Appeals. The complaint, along with the court’s decision to accept the complaint for consideration, was served on the Company on June 6th 2010. On July 8th 2010, the Supreme Court overruled the Court of Appeals’ judgment and remanded the case for reexamination. On February 17th 2011, a hearing was held before the Court of Appeals in Szczecin, but the Court did not issue any ruling due to the complexity of the case. As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the case was pending. The Company’s Management Board is of the opinion that the risk of an unfavourable ruling in a potential dispute is low, therefore no provisions for potential damages were created in these consolidated financial statements. Tax Settlements Tax settlements and other regulated areas of activity (e.g. customs or foreign exchange control) are subject to inspection by competent administration authorities, which are authorised to impose high penalties and sanctions. As the legal regulations regarding these issues in Poland are relatively new, they are often ambiguous and inconsistent. Differences in the interpretation of tax legislation are frequent, both within governmental authorities and between those authorities and businesses, leading to uncertainty and conflicts. Consequently, the tax-related risk in Poland is significantly higher than in countries where tax systems are better developed. Tax settlements may be subject to tax inspection for a period of five years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax payment was made. As a result of such inspections, additional tax liabilities may be assessed with respect to the tax settlements made by the Company. In the Company’s opinion, as at December 31st 2010 it had adequate provisions for identified and measurable tax risks. Court Proceedings Instigated by or against the Company or the Companies of Its Group Court Proceedings Instigated by Rafineria Jasło S.A. (currently LOTOS Jasło S.A.) against a Private Individual On December 4th 2003, in the course of payment order proceedings, the Regional Court of Krosno issued a decision in favour of LOTOS Jasło S.A., whereby it ordered payment of PLN 4,829 thousand, together with interest, representing claims under unpaid invoices for goods sold (file No. VIII GNc 292/03). The order for payment became final. Due to the fact that on April 2nd 2004 the debtor was declared bankrupt, with a possibility of concluding an arrangement, LOTOS Jasło S.A. submitted to the judge-commissioner its claims in the total amount of PLN 7,668 thousand, including: (i) PLN 6,138 thousand – outstanding principal of the payment due for the goods sold; (ii) PLN 1,498 thousand – delayed payment interest; and (iii) PLN 32 thousand – costs of litigation before the Regional Court of Krosno related to the case. The claims of up to PLN 2,580 thousand, including the principal and interest, are not subject to the arrangement as they are secured on the bankruptcy estate by a security (deposit) mortgage (hipoteka kaucyjna). As at December 31st 2010, subject to the execution of the terms of the arrangement, the amount receivable was PLN 370 thousand. LOTOS Jasło S.A. recognized an impairment loss on the receivable described above. Other Proceedings Involving LOTOS Gaz S.A. as a Party As at December 31st 2010, proceedings were pending involving LOTOS Gaz S.A. as a party. These proceedings are discussed below. On June 20th 2008, the Tax Supervision Authority in Kraków issued a post-inspection report as part of the proceedings instituted on November 21st 2006 (i.e. prior to the purchase of shares in KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. by LOTOS Gaz S.A.) in order to review the correctness of settlement of excise duty for the years 2003–2004 by KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. In the course of the proceedings, it was established that KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. failed to pay the excise duty due in the total amount of PLN 7,545 thousand plus interest (the figure as at June 30th 2008). On October 31st 2008, the Director of Tax Supervision Authority in Kraków issued a decision whereby the excise duty liability for the years 2003–2004 was established at PLN 16,408 thousand. On November 25th 2008, KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. appealed against that administrative decision. The appeal has not yet been considered by the appellate body. With the letter of February 6th 2009, the Director of the Customs Chamber in Kraków notified KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. that there was a delay in processing the appeal, and set March 31st 2009 as the new deadline for considering it. On November 26th 2008, the Director of the Customs Chamber initiated enforcement proceedings against KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. by issuing enforcement orders covering the amount specified in the decision issued by the Director of Tax Supervision Authority. On December 8th 2008, KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. appealed against the decision to initiate enforcement proceedings. In accordance with the letter of December 17th 2008, the Director of the Customs Chamber decided to allow the appeal concerning errors in calculating the amount of excise duty arrears and to discontinue the proceedings. On December 19th 2008, the company received another final decision and enforcement orders from the Customs 252 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Chamber, for the revised amounts of excise duty arrears and interest. The excise duty due and payable for 2003-2004 was established at PLN 8,309 thousand, including interest and costs of enforcement proceedings. On December 29th 2008, KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. submitted objections against the aforementioned enforcement orders, citing, inter alia, incorrect identification of the creditor. By virtue of a decision of January 19th 2009, the Director of the Customs Chamber in Kraków dismissed the objections as groundless. On January 27th 2009, KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. filed a complaint against the decision of January 19th 2009 directly with the Head of the Kraków Tax Chamber, who by virtue of his decision of March 9th 2009 upheld the Customs Chamber Director’s decision of January 19th 2009. Through the Director of the Customs Chamber, KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. lodged an appeal against the decision, in a letter dated April 6th 2009, with the Provincial Administrative Court of Kraków. Furthermore, KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. submitted with the Director of Tax Supervision Authority in Kraków a request to stay execution of the decisions and, if this request were not to be granted, a request to allow payment of the tax arrears in instalments. By virtue of a decision of February 24th 2009, the Director of the Customs Chamber in Kraków dismissed the request to stay the execution of the decisions. KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. lodged a complaint against the dismissal on March 9th 2009, seeking reversal of the decision of February 24th 2009 and stay of execution of the decision issued by the Director of Tax Supervision Authority on October 31st 2008. Concurrently, KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. filed an appeal against the decision by the Director of the Customs Office in Kraków of October 31st 2008, establishing the amount of excise duty liability for the years 2003–2004. By virtue of his decisions of May 6th 2009, the Director of the Customs Chamber in Kraków upheld the decisions issued by the Director of the Customs Office. On June 8th 2009, KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. filed complaints with the Provincial Administrative Court against the decisions of the second instance authority. These complaints have not yet been considered. On July 20th 2009, the Director of the Customs Chamber in Kraków submitted to the Provincial Administrative Court responses to the 16 complaints by KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. against the decisions of May 6th 2009. On April 30th 2009, KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. filed a petition requesting a declaration of its bankruptcy by liquidation of assets. On July 23rd 2009, District Court for Kraków-Śródmieście in Kraków declared KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. bankrupt. As at the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the bankruptcy proceedings were pending. Taking into consideration the decision issued by the Director of Tax Supervision Authority in Kraków and the contents of the post-inspection report prepared by the Tax Supervision Authority in Kraków on June 20th 2008, the Management Board of LOTOS Gaz S.A. made two representations (on July 11th 2008 and December 9th 2008) towards the sellers of shares in KRAK-Gaz Sp. z o.o. regarding reduction of the purchase price of shares in KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. by a total amount of PLN 16,368 thousand. Accordingly, the sellers’ claim for payment of the last instalment of the Purchase Price in the amount of PLN 1,500 thousand expired. On July 28th 2008, the Management Board of LOTOS Gaz S.A. called upon the former owners of shares in KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. to enter into mandatory negotiations, in line with the provisions of the share purchase agreement. On December 15th 2008, the Management Board of LOTOS Gaz S.A. instigated arbitration proceedings against the sellers of shares in KRAK-Gaz Sp. z o.o. On April 14th 2010, the Arbitration Court issued its award in the case instituted by LOTOS Gaz S.A. against the sellers of KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o., and in the cross action for payment instituted against LOTOS Gaz S.A. by the sellers. The court awarded (i) to LOTOS Gaz S.A.: PLN 4,155 thousand along with interest from December 19th 2008 until the payment date, to be paid jointly and severally by the defendants, and (ii) to the sellers, based on the cross action: PLN 1,682 thousand along with interest from July 5th 2009 until the payment date, to be paid by LOTOS Gaz S.A. Furthermore, as reimbursement of the costs of proceedings, the court awarded PLN 209 thousand to LOTOS Gaz S.A. to be paid by the sellers, and PLN 98 thousand to the sellers to be paid by LOTOS Gaz. S.A. Any other mutual claims for reimbursement of costs/expenses between the parties were cancelled by the court. Following a complaint submitted by LOTOS Gaz S.A. requesting reversal of the Arbitration Court's award, by virtue of its decision of August 13th 2010, the Regional Court of Kraków stayed enforcement of the Arbitration Court's award in full. The complaint lodged by the sellers against this decision was dismissed; the ruling dismissing the complaint became final on October 15th 2010. As at the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the case was pending. LOTOS Gaz S.A. additionally obtained a decision from the Regional Court of Kraków, dated November 17th 2008, establishing a claim bond to secure LOTOS Gaz S.A.’s claims against the sellers of the shares up to the amount of PLN 5,975 thousand (the enforcement clause was appended on January 20th 2009). On February 2nd 2009, the sellers petitioned for cancellation of the claim bond. In its decision of April 23rd 2009, the Regional Court of Kraków declared cancellation of the claim bond. Next, following a complaint filed by LOTOS Gaz S.A., by virtue of its decision of June 15th 2009, the Kraków Court of Appeals changed the decision appealed against in such a manner that the sellers’ petition for cancellation of the claim bond was dismissed. On the basis of the final decision granting the claim bond, LOTOS Gaz S.A. instigated enforcement proceedings concerning the claim bond before the court enforcement officer of the District Court for Gdańsk-Północ in Gdańsk. As at the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements the proceedings were closed ineffectively, i.e. no sellers’ property has been seized. On December 10th 2008, a notification of suspected offence against KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o. was submitted with the Regional Prosecutor’s Office of Kraków Podgórze in Kraków, alleging an offence consisting in failure to fulfil professional duties by former members of the company’s Management Board. The proceedings were finally discontinued on June 28th 2010. On January 29th 2009, two former members of KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o.’s Management Board received calls for payment 253 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 of PLN 801 thousand as remedy for the damage done to the company. Following declaration of bankruptcy of KRAKGAZ Sp. z o.o., the right to seek compensation was transferred to the bankruptcy administrator of KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. However, by the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the bankruptcy administrator of KRAKGAZ Sp. z o.o. has not taken court action against the former members of KRAK–GAZ Sp. z o.o.’s Management Board. In May 2009, LOTOS Gaz S.A. filed a notification of suspected offence of fraud to the detriment of LOTOS Gaz S.A. by the sellers of KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. An investigation was launched by the prosecutor’s office and is still under way. In February 2010, the proceedings were extended to investigate the issue of whether the persons who participated in the process of acquisition KRAK-GAZ Sp. z o.o. on the Grupa LOTOS S.A.’s side exercised due care. As at the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the proceedings were suspended due to the need to obtain an expert's opinion as to whether a damage was sustained and as to its value.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information 41. Financial Risk Management The Group is exposed to financial risk, including chiefly: market risk (risk related to the prices of raw materials and petroleum products, risk related to prices of CO2 emission allowances, currency risk, interest rate risk) liquidity risk credit risk related to financial and trade transactions. The Financial Risk Management Committee (“FRMC”) operating within the Parent Undertaking is responsible for the supervision and coordination of the financial risk management process at Grupa LOTOS S.A. In order to ensure the efficiency and operational security of this process, the following areas have been distinguished: financial transaction area (front-office), risk analysis and control area (middle-office), and transaction documentation and settlement area (back-office). The key objectives sought to be achieved through financial risk management are as follows: limiting volatility of cash flows, increasing the probability that budget and strategic objectives will be met, ensuring short-term financial liquidity, maximising the result on market risk management, at the assumed risk level. In order to achieve these objectives, documents have been prepared and approved at appropriate decision-making levels of the Parent Undertaking. These documents specify the necessary framework for effective and secure functioning of the financial risk management process, including principally: methodology for quantifying exposures to particular risks (risk mapping), acceptable financial instruments, method of assessing financial risk management, limits within risk management, reporting method, credit limits for counterparties in financial transactions. The Parent Undertaking monitors all managed market risks on an ongoing basis. Opening a position with respect to risks which do not arise as part of the Company’s core activity is prohibited. The Parent Undertaking uses liquid derivatives which it is able to value by applying commonly applied valuation models. The valuation of the underlying position and derivatives is performed based on market data received from reliable providers. Starting from January 1st 2011, the Parent Undertaking has introduced hedge accounting with respect to cash flow hedges (i.e. foreign-currency denominated loans intended for financing of the 10+ Programme, designated as hedges of future USD-denominated petroleum product sales transactions). Risk Related to Prices of Raw Materials and Petroleum Products The Company regards management of the risk related to prices of raw materials and petroleum products, as well as the currency risk, as an issue of utmost importance. The concept for the management of the risk related to prices of raw materials and petroleum products expired at the end of 2010. The main objective of the concept was to increase the probability of generating cash flows guaranteeing safe financing of investment projects under the 10+ Programme. Currently, the Company is preparing a new policy for managing this risk, which is to cover objectives connected with the introduction of the new raw materials and petroleum products trading model within Grupa LOTOS S.A. as of January 1st 261 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 2011. The last refining margin hedging transactions expired on September 30th 2009. Due to adverse market conditions, the LOTOS Group resolved not to enter into hedging transactions until margins improve to levels which are satisfactory to the Company. There were no open refining margin transactions as at December 31st 2010 or December 31st 2009. In 2010 the Company entered into commodity swaps in connection with sales of bitumen components at fixed prices, to ensure that the original risk profile remains unchanged. As at December 31st 2009, there were no open commodity transactions.

Annual Report 2010 difference between the average market price and the transaction price. The fair value has been established on the basis of prices quoted on active markets, as provided by an external consultancy (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). Risk Related to Prices of Carbon (CO 2 ) Allowances The risk related to prices of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) allowances is managed in line with the assumptions set forth in The Strategy for Managing the Risk Related to Prices of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) Allowances by Grupa LOTOS S.A. The period covered by the management is determined by the individual phases of the Kyoto protocol; currently, it is the period until the end of 2012. A position limit is defined based on the number of allowances granted for a given phase. The position in a given phase comprises the aggregate of positions for individual years within the phase. The maximum loss limit is defined based on the Company’s equity. Depending on the market situation and allowances granted, the Company maintains an appropriate position in carbon allowances by entering into financial transactions. The basic risk map takes into account the allowances granted and the carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions planned for a given phase, which can be reliably determined both with respect to the existing installations and the installations which are planned to be constructed. Underlying CO2 allowances position as at December 31st 2010: Period EUA CER TOTAL Phase II (2008-2012) (55,924) 49,863 (6,061) Underlying CO2 allowances position as at December 31st 2009: Period EUA CER TOTAL Phase II (2008-2012) (122,789) 82,010 (40,779) Due to uncertainty as to the number of allowances to be granted for the units constructed under the 10+ Programme, the Company sought to minimise the size of its open position in the CO2 emission allowances. In 2010, the Company entered into EUA/CER swap transactions, as that was justified by the spread between these two types of emission allowances.

The exposure management horizon is connected with the introduction of a budget roll over into four quarters in advance as a permanent component of planning activities at the Company. The four quarter period is treated as the basis for determining the exposure management time horizon. The base map of currency positions takes into account principally the volumes and price formulae for purchases of raw materials and sales of products, investments, loans denominated in foreign currencies, as well as valuation of derivatives, and may be adjusted for a ratio reflecting the volatility in the prices of raw materials and petroleum products. The strategy provides for the calculation of the following limits: transaction position limit (open currency transactions must not increase the Company’s underlying position and must not exceed the volume of the underlying position); maximum loss and liquidity limits are expressed as a percentage of the Company’s equity (the liquidity limit is 266 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 calculated in order to reduce the risk of excessive accumulation of financial transactions over a limited period of time, the settlement of which could result in liquidity and operating problems); gross total and global currency position limits applicable for the entire management period as well as for subperiods. For the purpose of the limits calculation, equity is remeasured on a quarterly basis. Moreover, when a loss on risk management exceeds a defined threshold, limits are immediately revised in order to prevent any significant exceeding of the maximum loss limit set by the Management Board of Grupa LOTOS S.A. The strategy allows for the possibility of consolidated risk management at the Group level. USD is used in market price quotations for crude oil and petroleum products. For this reason it has been decided that USD is the most appropriate currency for contracting and repaying long-term loans to finance the 10+ Programme, as such an approach contributes to reducing the structurally long position, and consequently to reducing the strategic currency risk. Under the agreement on the financing of the 10+ Programme, Grupa LOTOS S.A. has the obligation to maintain a specified level of the hedge ratio for the currency risk (EUR/USD and USD/PLN) which arises in connection with the fact that the currency in which the investment projects are financed is different from the currencies in which project execution contracts are denominated. This obligation remains binding only with respect to payments under the 10+ Programme projects execution contracts to be made by mid-2011.

TOTAL, (3,178) including: positive negative (3,178) Interest Rate Risk The base map of interest rate positions is related to the cash flows which depend on future interest rates; in particular it is based on the planned schedule of repayments under the loan for financing of inventories and implementation of the 10+ Programme and the associated interest calculated on the basis of a floating LIBOR USD rate. The structure of limits is based on the underlying’s nominal value hedge ratio. In a long-term perspective, a partial risk mitigation effect was achieved through the choice of a fixed interest rate for the SACE sub-tranche under the investment loan granted to finance the 10+ Programme described in Note 34. The agreement on the financing of the 10+ Programme provides for the obligation to maintain a specified hedge ratio for the interest rate risk, i.e. the risk connected with the LIBOR USD floating interest rate on the loan to finance the 10+ Programme in the period until mid-2011.

The service consists in the application of favourable interest rates for debit and credit balances, which are subject to offsetting as at the end of each business day. Liquidity Risk The liquidity risk management process within the Group consists in monitoring the forecast cash flows, matching maturities of assets and liabilities, analysing working capital and maintaining access to various financing sources. In the period covered by the budget, liquidity is monitored on an ongoing basis across the Group as part of the financial risk management. In the mid and long term, it is monitored as part of the planning process, which helps create a longterm financial strategy. In the area of financial risk, in addition to an active management of market risk, the Company follows the following rules with respect to liquidity management: employs no margins with respect to trade in derivatives on the over-the-counter market, limits the possibility of an early termination of financial transactions, establishes limits for spot financial instruments of low liquidity, establishes credit limits for counterparties in financial transactions, ensures adequate quality of the available credit lines, implements internal control processes and ensures organisational efficiency, which facilitates prompt reaction in case of emergencies.

Credit Risk Management of credit risk relating to counterparties in financial transactions consists in ongoing monitoring of credit 276 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 exposure in relation to the limits granted. The counterparties must have an appropriate credit rating assigned by leading rating agencies or hold guarantees granted by institutions meeting the minimum rating requirement. The Group enters into financial transactions with well-established firms with good credit standing. As at December 31st 2010, the concentration of credit risk with respect to a single counterparty in financial transactions did not exceed 0.35% of the Group’s balance-sheet total. As regards management of credit risk relating to counterparties in trade transactions, all customers requesting trade credit undergo verification of their financial reliability, whose results determine the level of credit limits to be granted. Furthermore, due to the fact that the Group’s receivables are monitored on an ongoing basis, the risk of it holding uncollectible receivables is low. Carrying values of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure. The maximum credit risk exposure as at the balance-sheet date stood at: Dec 31 2009 PLN ‘000 Note Dec 31 2010 (restated) Shares: 9,927 9,929 non-current 23 9,915 9,917 current 28 12 12 Derivative financial instruments: 69,370 101,879 non-current 23 29,667 54,862 current 28 39,703 47,017 Decommissioning fund 23 21,668 18,851 Deposits: 5,932 6,130 non-current 23 6,130 current 28 5,932 Security deposits (margins) 23 3,108 3,316 Trade and other receivables: 1,810,637 1,515,812 non-current 25 28,612 22,061 current 1,782,025 1,493,751 Cash and cash equivalents 391,266 355,054 Total 2,311,908 2,010,971 The age analysis of past due financial assets as at December 31st 2010 and December 31st 2009 is shown in Note 26.

Financial Instruments Description of Financial Instruments Financial Assets and Liabilities Held for Trading The Group discloses derivative transactions with positive fair values under financial assets held for trading. Derivative transactions with negative fair values are disclosed under financial liabilities held for trading. Under financial assets and liabilities held for trading the Company discloses valuation of the following types of derivatives: swaps, futures, forwards, options, interest-rate swaps, forward rate agreement. Fair value of commodity swaps is established by reference to future cash flows connected with the transactions, calculated on the basis of the difference between the average market price and the transaction price. The fair value has been established on the basis of prices quoted on active markets, as provided by an external consultancy (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). Fair value of futures contracts for carbon dioxide (CO2 ) allowances (EUA, CER) is established by reference to the difference between the market price, quoted by the European Climate Exchange (ECX) for the valuation date, and the transaction price (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy). Fair value of spots and currency forwards is established by reference to future discounted cash flows connected with the transactions, calculated on the basis of the difference between the forward rate and the transaction price. The forward rate is calculated on the basis of the fixing rate quotations of the National Bank of Poland and the interest rate curve implied in fx swaps (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). Apart from the parameters used in the valuation of currency forwards, implied volatility is additionally taken into account in calculating the value of currency options (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). Fair value of FRAs is established by reference to future discounted cash flows connected with the transactions, calculated on the basis of the difference between the forward rate and the transaction price. The forward rate is calculated using the zero-coupon interest rate curve based on 6M or 3M LIBOR, depending on the type of transaction. This is considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Financial Assets Available for Sale Non-current financial assets available for sale measured at fair value as at December 31st 2010 and December 31st 2009 include mainly shares and equity interests for which there is no active market.

As at December 31st 2009, the Group did not carry any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss whose components would be designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition (fair value option). As at December 31st 2009, the Group did not carry any financial assets held to maturity. As at December 31st 2009, the carrying value of loans, receivables and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost did not significantly differ from their fair value (not applicable to loans bearing interest at a fixed rate). The majority of non-current contracted loans and borrowings bore interest at floating rates, with interest payable in a short term. As at December 31st 2009, financial assets available for sale measured at fair value comprised mainly shares for which there was no active market.

Other Information 44.1 Special Rights of the State Treasury and How These Rights Are Exercised in Companies The Act on Special Rights Vested in the Minister Competent for the State Treasury and How Those Rights Should Be Exercised at Certain Companies or Groups of Companies Operating in the Power, Crude Oil and Gaseous Fuels Sectors, dated March 18th 2010 (Dz.U. No. 65, item 404) (“the Act”), introduced the institution of a special officer responsible for the protection of critical infrastructure. Under the Act, the minister competent for the State Treasury has the right to raise and objection against a resolution adopted, or any other act in law performed, by the Company’s Management Board to make a disposition with respect to any of the assets included in the single list of facilities, installations, equipment, and services comprising critical infrastructure, referred to in Art. 5b.7.1 of the Polish Crisis Management Act of April 26th 2007, if such disposition constitutes a real threat for the operation, continuity of operation and integrity of critical infrastructure. The minister competent for the State Treasury may also raise an objection with respect to any resolution by the Company’s governing body providing for: dissolution of the Company, changes in the intended use or discontinuation of use of any of the Company’s assets(1) included in the single list of facilities, installations, equipment, and services comprising critical infrastructure, referred to in Art. 5b.7.1 of the Polish Crisis Management Act of April 26th 2007, change in the Company’s business profile, sale or lease of the Company’s business or its organised part, or creation of any proprietary interest therein, adoption of the budget, plan of investment activities, or a long-term strategic plan, relocation of the Company’s registered office abroad, if the implementation of any such resolution could constitute a real threat for the operation, continuity of operation and integrity of critical infrastructure. (1) such assets comprise: in the power sector – infrastructure used for the purpose of generation or transmission of electricity; in the oil sector – infrastructure used for the purpose of production, refining, processing, storage and transmission via pipelines of crude oil and petroleum products, as well as seaports used for handling crude oil and petroleum products; in the gaseous fuels sector – infrastructure used for the purpose of production, refining, processing, storage and transmission via gas pipelines of gaseous fuels, as well as LNG terminals. In accordance with the Act, the Company’s Management Board, acting in consultation with the minister competent for the State Treasury and the Head of the Government Centre for Security, has the right to appoint and remove from office a special officer responsible for critical infrastructure protection at the Company. The special officer’s duties include in particular providing the minister competent for the State Treasury with information on the execution by the Company’s governing bodies of any of the acts in law referred to above, providing the Head of the Government Centre for Security with information on critical infrastructure whenever requested, and – in cooperation with the Head of the Government Centre for Security – providing and receiving to or from other entities information on any threats to the critical infrastructure. The special officer responsible for protection of critical infrastructure is authorised to request from company governing bodies any documents or explanations regarding the issues referred to above, and, having analysed them, is required to submit the same to the minister competent for the State Treasury and the Head of the Government Centre for Security, along with the officer’s written position, including grounds, regarding any issue at hand. Until the approval of these consolidated financial statements, Grupa Lotos S.A. has not received any notification to the effect that any of its assets have been included in the list of facilities, installations, equipment, and services comprising critical infrastructure, and therefore has not appointed a special officer responsible for protection of critical infrastructure. 287 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

Capital Management The objective of the LOTOS Group’s financial policy is to maintain long-term liquidity, while using an appropriate level of financial leverage to support the achievement of the principal goal of maximising the return on equity attributable to the shareholders. The achievement of the above objectives is done by striving to develop the desired financing structure at the Group level. The LOTOS Group monitors its financing structure using a debt to equity ratio calculated as net debt by equity. Net debt is the sum of interest-bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Equity includes equity attributable to owners of the Parent increased by non-controlling interests.

Material Events Subsequent to the Balance-Sheet Date No material events occurred in the period from the balance-sheet date until the date of these consolidated financial statements except for the following: 1. Starting from January 1st 2011, the Parent Undertaking has introduced hedge accounting with respect to cash flow hedges (i.e. foreign-currency denominated loans intended for financing of the 10+ Programme, designated as hedges of future USD-denominated petroleum product sales transactions). 2. As of January 1st 2011, Grupa LOTOS S.A. has used the accounting method to measure the foreign exchange differences for the purpose of corporate income tax settlements. 3. Starting from January 1st 2011, the Group changed its accounting policies as regards the exchange rates used to translate business transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As of January 1st 2011, such business transactions will be recognised as at the transaction date (i) using the exchange rate actually applied on that date given the nature of the transaction – in the case of sale or purchase of foreign currencies, and (ii) using the mid-exchange rate quoted for a given currency by the National Bank of Poland for a day preceding the transaction date – in the case of payment of receivables or liabilities where there is no rationale for using the actual exchange rate, and in the case of other transactions. Application of the new accounting policies will not affect the Group’s total net result, but will affect the values presented in the operating and financial parts of the statement of comprehensive income. 4. On January 10th 2011, the General Shareholders Meeting of LOTOS Gaz S.A. adopted a resolution to dissolve LOTOS Gaz S.A. by way of its liquidation. Furthermore, on January 3rd 2011 the Management Board of LOTOS Gaz S.A. filed a petition with the Commercial Division of the District Court of Płock requesting a declaration of bankruptcy of LOTOS Gaz S.A. According to the information received by the Company, the petition was effectively withdrawn, and the bankruptcy proceedings were discontinued on January 7th 2011. 5. On January 18th 2011, following completion of the APA 2010 licence round, LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS was granted a 25% interest in, and the operator status with respect to, license PL 503B located in the Norwegian Sea. The remaining 75% interest in the license was distributed in equal parts among three other companies, including Skagen 44AS, Edison International Norway Branch and 4Sea Energy AS. In line with a programme of work for the aggregate area covering licence PL503 and the adjacent licence PL 503B described above (i.e. an area of approx. 1,500 sq km), 3D seismic surveys are planned to be carried out in mid-2011, on the basis of which a decision will be made whether to drill an exploration well. The cost of the work corresponding to the 25% license interest is estimated at NOK 17.5m (i.e. PLN 8.7m, translated at the NOK mid-exchange rate quoted by the National Bank of Poland for January 19th 2011). 6. Following approvals by the General Shareholders Meeting of LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. and the Lithuanian anti-trust authority, on February 3rd 2011 UAB LOTOS Baltija (a subsidiary of LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A.) acquired 100% of shares in UAB Meditus, which holds 59.41% of shares in AB Geonafta. LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. directly holds 40.59% of shares in AB Geonafta, therefore, as a result of the transaction, LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. gained control of AB Geonafta. AB Geonafta is the parent undertaking of its own group, which comprises: UAB Minijos Nafta (50% of shares held by AB Geonafta), UAB Genciu Nafta (100% of shares held by AB Geonafta), UAB Manifoldas (50% of shares held by AB Geonafta). As at December 31st 2010, the AB Geonafta Group’s net assets amounted to PLN 229m (see Note 21). The business of AB Geonafta and its group members, including UAB Genciu Nafta, UAB Minijos Nafta and UAB Manifoldas, consists in oil exploration and production in Lithuania. Oil production operations are conducted on shore. As at the transaction date, the volume of crude oil reserves and resources (2P and 2C) attributable to the AB Geonafta Group was approximately 1 million tonnes. The price of acquisition of UAB Meditus, which holds 59.41% of shares in AB Geonafta, comprises EUR 56.8m adjusted for net debt and a portion of the potential payment to be received from one of AB Geonafta’s debtors. Pursuant to the agreement, the final acquisition price will be determined not later than within 90 days from the transaction closing date. Given the fact that as at the business combination date, the Group held a 40.59% stake in AB Geonafta, acquired jointly with its group through the purchase of 100% shares in UAB Meditus by UAB LOTOS Baltija, the business combination will be accounted for and presented as a business combination achieved in stages within the meaning of the revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations, based on the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In a business combination achieved in stages, the acquirer remeasures its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognises the resulting gain or loss in finance income or expenses. As at the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the provisional accounting for the business combination referred to above was not yet complete. The business combination will be provisionally accounted for in the consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2011. 290 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 7. On February 11th 2011, LOTOS Jasło S.A. entered into an agreement with an external partner concerning sale of five investment areas, including an organised part of business and a block of 95.5% shares in PLASTEKOL Organizacja Odzysku S.A. 8. On February 21st 2011, the Management Board of Grupa LOTOS S.A. was notified that LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS had relinquished the 50% interest in licence PL 556 in the Norwegian Sea, awarded to it as part of the APA 2009 license round. As the operator of licence PL 556 (the remaining 50% interest in the licence having been awarded to Skeie Energy AS), LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS had recommended that no commitments be made to undertake exploratory drilling as part of another phase of the field development process. LOTOS Exploration and Production Norge AS's recommendation and decision to relinquish its rights to licence PL 556 were based on an evaluation of the geological potential of the licence area, made as part of the first exploration phase which ended on February 19th 2011. 9. On March 23rd 2011, LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. and Grupa LOTOS S.A. executed an agreement whereby Grupa LOTOS S.A. purchased 1 share in AB Geonafta for LTL 3 thousand (PLN 3.5 thousand). Following the transaction, the shareholder structure of AB Geonafta is as follows: LOTOS Petrobaltic S.A. – 40.59%, UAB Meditus – 59.41%, Grupa LOTOS S.A. – 0.00062%. 10. On April 7th and April 8th 2011, following the transactions carried out as part of the squeeze-out described in Note 2 hereof and after relevent entries were made in the share books of LOTOS Czechowice S.A. and LOTOS Jasło S.A., Grupa LOTOS S.A. held 100% of the share capital in LOTOS Czechowice S.A. and 100% in the share capital of LOTOS Jasło S.A.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Consolidated non-financial statement Grupa LOTOS declares to have reached Level A within the three-level reporting system of GRI Application Levels. Profile of the statement The 2010 consolidated non-financial statement has been prepared based on the Reporting Framework and Version 3 of the Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines (G3 GRI). Grupa LOTOS is at the Application Level A 1 in the three-level reporting system. GRI application C C+ B B+ A A+ level Selfdeclaration This statement provides an overview of the LOTOS Group activities in the financial year 2010. It also covers important corporate events occurring in the first three months of 2011, that is shortly before the report release date. This consolidated non-financial statement is the fourth in a series of publications which present the non-financial aspects of the LOTOS Group’s operations. A sustainability overview formed an integral part of the 2009 Annual Report, which was the first integrated report ever released by a Polish company. It received accolades in the 2010 best social report competition organised by PwC, the Responsible Business Forum and CSR Consulting. The distinction was granted in recognition of the successful incorporation of social and environmental reporting into the corporate reporting system, as well as for the LOTOS Group’s determination to prepare integrated corporate reports encompassing the financial and non-financial aspects of its activities. This Annual Report is a continuation of the adopted practice, but at the same time the scope of its non-financial section has been extended to include the exploration and production company, LOTOS Petrobaltic in addition to the parent Grupa LOTOS and its service and distribution subsidiaries, which were covered by the 2009 report. The previous reports are available at www.csr.lotos.pl. The Management Board of Grupa LOTOS resolved to start publishing reports on the progress in the implementation of the CSR strategy on a yearly basis. The Office for Sponsorship, Social Affairs and Corporate Social Responsibility is in charge of coordinating the sustainability reporting processes at the LOTOS Group. Interested parties may contact the Office at csr@grupalotos.pl. For further contact details, see the closing sections of the report.. 1 The individual Application Levels were assigned the letters from C (lowest grade), through C+ (where “+” is given if the report has been verified by an independent external certification body) B, B+, A to A+. The reporting criteria used for each level measure the extent to which the Guidelines and the GRI Reporting Framework have been applied. 293 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Scope of the report In determining the content of the consolidated non-financial statement and other non-financial sections of the Annual Report, we were guided by the GRI Reporting Framework. The information contained in the statement was selected based on the materiality criterion, which we define as the potential to impact the LOTOS Group’s compliance with the sustainable development principles and the power to influence the LOTOS Group’s external stakeholders looking for reliable, comparable and accurate information and data which then affect their decisions and choices. This statement was prepared using the full range of core indicators, including economic, environmental and social performance indicators, as well as the majority of additional indicators provided for in the GRI Guidelines. As no relevant sector supplement was available at the time of drafting the statement, no sectorspecific performance indicators were applied except for those included in the core set. The methods used to calculate the figures presented in the financial statement were the same as applied for the purposes of preparing the LOTOS Group’s consolidated financial statements for 2010, i.e. in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) effective as at December 31 2010. For a vast majority of thematic areas, the facts and figures presented in the statement pertain to Grupa LOTOS, the parent company. However, all due care and consideration was given to account for the consolidated data where possible. In sections devoted to product responsibility, information relating to service and distribution companies was disclosed, while in sections focusing on environmental responsibility, we provided data on LOTOS Petrobaltic, our exploration and production subsidiary. In each case, a clear distinction was made by specifically indicating the subsidiary currently discussed.In the previous reporting period, no material changes occurred with respect to the LOTOS Group’s subsidiaries which would affect the overall assessment of the organisation, both in terms of specific aspects of its activities and domestic peer comparison.

Annual Report 2010 Report 2010 Organisation profile Development vision Achievements and forecasts Sustainability Management Statements Additional information Data verification All data contained in the statement was gathered in a reliable and responsible manner and certified by members of senior management staff of Grupa LOTOS and selected subsidiaries, who are responsible for the respective reporting areas. The financial information is consistent with the data disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods. The content of the consolidated non-financial statement was not verified by an independent external certification body. It should be emphasised, however, that the bulk of the data for the previous financial year contained in this statement was subject to a review by auditors with Ernst&Young Audit Sp. z o.o.; who audited the LOTOS Group’s consolidated financial statements. Grupa LOTOS has implemented the Integrated Management System which is certified for compliance with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and PN-N-18001. In addition, the requirements of AQAP 2110 (Allied Quality Assurance Publication) and requirements of the Internal Control System for trading in strategic materials (consistent with the PN-N-19001 standard) are met. In July 2010, the Integrated Management System recertification audit was successfully completed at the Company. The audit is designed to determine whether the management system is compliant with the ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and PN-N-18001 standards. The recertification audit is performed every three years. Both recertification and surveillance audits (carried out annually) are performed by an independent external certification body. Moreover, internal audits are carried out at the LOTOS Group which aim to monitor the progress achieved in the implementation of the Integrated Management System requirements, as well as the efficiency of related processes. For more information on the audits of the Integrated Management System, see subsection Management systems. Acting in line with the adopted principles of transparent communication with stakeholders, Grupa LOTOS has its CSR performance regularly reviewed by external experts: it participates in professional surveys which serve to compare the achievements of socially responsible companies. A major accomplishment in this area in 2010 was the participation in: 2010 Responsible Company Ranking – compiled by Business Ethics Centre of the Kozminski University and Responsible Business Forum. Grupa LOTOS’ performance and achievements on which the ranking was based were reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the project partner; RESPECT Rating – providing the basis for selecting companies eligible for the Warsaw Stock Exchange’s RESPECT Index. The CSR activities undertaken by Grupa LOTOS were reviewed by the accounting firm Deloitte during the selection process. In both cases, auditors verified information furnished by the Company by holding interviews with its representatives and by analysing the provided documents. 295 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

Annual Report 2010 January 23rd 2008. The permit is valid through November 15th 2017. In light of the applicable regulations, LOTOS Asfalt is exempt from corporate income tax over the period covered by the permit. The company assesses the taxable income in accordance with the Act on Corporate Income Tax of February 15th 1992. For the purposes of calculating the taxable income and tax exempt income, LOTOS Asfalt makes a distinction between costs and income associated with in-zone operations and out-of-zone operations. The tax exemption is applied under the Act on Special Economic Zones of October 20th 1994 and Permit No. 158/ARP S.A./2008 of January 23rd 2008. Also, owing to the fact that its investments are conducted within the Tarnobrzeg Special Economic Zone, LOTOS Asfalt is entitled to a tax exampetion which allows it to reduce the income tax due by an amount not exceeding 50% of total investment expenditures incurred within the Tarnobrzeg Special Economic Zone.

INDICATOR GRI Policy, practices, and proportion of spending on locally -based suppliers at significant locations of EC 6 operations As one of the largest business enterprises in the Gdańsk region, Grupa LOTOS feels responsible for the local communities and their dynamic growth. In the course of doing business, the Company is guided by the principles of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. This means that ethics, transparency and openness play an important role in its day-to-day activities. According to in-house estimates, local suppliers account for 84% of all business partners in the Company’s key locations (Gdańsk, Warsaw and Kraków), and 298 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 50% of all contracts are signed with suppliers from the region of Pomerania. The chart below presents the percentage shares of liabilities to business partners having registered offices in the Company’s key locations. Percentage shares of liabilities to business partners having registered offices in Grupa LOTOS’ key business locations (2010) No. of contracts with business partners having registered offices in Grupa LOTOS’ key business locations (2010) Registered office No. of contracts Gdańsk and the region of Pomerania 385 Warsaw 197 Kraków 59 Other 125 Total 766 LOTOS Paliwa: The company purchases nearly 100% of its fuel stocks for resale from Grupa LOTOS. A major portion of the fuel is produced domestically at the Gdańsk refinery. LOTOS Asfalt: In the process of choosing service and product suppliers, the company must follow a selection procedure which defines the rules to be applied and the course of action to be taken when purchasing products or services of any kind, with the key criteria being the quality and environmental impact of the product or service, compliance with health and safety regulations by the supplier, and the proposed terms of payment and warranty. The strategic supplier of feedstock to LOTOS Asfalt (Gdańsk, Jasło, Czechowice) is Grupa LOTOS. The share of local suppliers in the company’s supply structure is 5%, with Polish importers and international producers of raw materials and semi-finished products accounting for the balance. LOTOS Kolej: The company’s procurement team seeks to optimise the purchasing process, including by selecting the best possible supplier, with one of the criteria being its location in the region. The largest item under costs of materials is the cost of spare parts for the rolling stock. A vast majority of spare part suppliers operate in the south of Poland, therefore only a portion of the supplies may be procured from local partners operating in the region of Pomerania. LOTOS Parafiny: The company operates productions plants in the towns of Czechowice and Jasło, where local means from the south of Poland. Approximately 60% of transport services to or from Jasło and Czechowice are provided by local firms. As regards procurement of investmentor overhaul-related services, no special rules or restrictions apply as to the supplier’s location. In 2010, the local versus non-local supplier breakdown for the Jasło and Czechowice plants was 68%/32% and 85%/15%, respectively. LOTOS Oil: The company tends to follow a supplier selection policy which enables it to secure at least two sources of supplies in each product category. If a monopoly is identified, the company monitors the market for any changes in the status quo on a regular basis. In line with the currently applied procurement policy, the company searches local markets for potential suppliers, and, if a reliable prospective partner is found, it is invited to participate in a tender procedure. In 2010, the procurement structure by value (net of services), accounting for all production units, the Distribution Centre, and business arrangements with Grupa LOTOS, was as follows: local suppliers represented 82% of total purchases, with the other 18% attributable to non-local suppliers. As regards the structure of service purchases by value, local providers accounted for 90% and non-local providers – for 10% of total purchases. GRI INDICATOR Procedures for local hiring and proportion of senior management hired from the local community EC 7 at locations of significant operation Grupa LOTOS hires members of senior management staff according to the job profile and skills required for the position. Only those candidates are selected who best satisfy the employment criteria. Managerial positions are often filled by persons selected in an internal recruitment process. At the Company’s key locations, 76.4% of senior management staff are persons from local communities. 299 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 LOTOS Asfalt: When creating a new job, or filling a managerial vacancy, priority is given to persons from the local labour market, provided that their skills and qualifications meet the relevant criteria. In 2010, local-community members represented, respectively, 82%, 100%, and 75% of the management staff employed in Gdańsk, Czechowice and Jasło. LOTOS Kolej: When selecting senior managers, the company is guided by a pragmatic evaluation of the candidates, including their expertise and skills required for a given position. During a recruitment process, internal candidates, i.e. the Company’s or the LOTOS Group’s current employees, are considered first. All senior executives employed at the company come from the region of Pomerania. LOTOS Oil: The company has adopted a global recruitment policy: the same procedures apply at each of its branches. The policy provides for no special treatment of candidates from the local labour market. However, all senior management staff members (directors, deputy directors, plant managers, heads of office) employed at the company’s key business locations (the Gdańsk Branch, the Czechowice Branch, the Jasło Branch and the Distribution Office in Piotrków Trybunalski) are locals. Similarly, 100% of staff employed at the offices established across the country as part of the management function diversification process are members of local communities. LOTOS Parafiny: The company selects well-qualified candidates for senior executive positions in line with relevant procedures. During a recruitment process, applications from the existing employees of the LOTOS Group are considered first. Ninety-one percent of senior management staff employed at the company’s key locations represent local communities. LOTOS Paliwa: The company does not follow the global policy of favouring local community members in the recruitment of managerial personnel. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations, management staff members across Poland are hired on an as needed basis. Indirect economic impacts GRI INDICATOR Development and impact of infrastructure investments and services provided primarily for EC 8 public benefit through commercial, in -kind, or pro bono engagement Detailed information on Grupa LOTOS activities in this area are available on the Company’s website [ link ]. GRI INDICATOR Understanding and describing significant indirect economic impacts, including the extent of EC 9 impacts – cooperation with suppliers at significant location of operation Grupa LOTOS seeks to align its decision-making process with the corporate social responsibility strategy by giving due consideration to the potential impact of its decisions on local communities and the development of the Gdańsk region as a whole. Half of the contracts for the supply of goods or services are signed with local suppliers. Around 35% of all contracts are recurring or long-term arrangements entered into with small and medium-sized enterprises operating on local markets. This fact alone demonstrates our commitment to the local market and its economic prosperity. By contracting locally, the Company indirectly contributes to improved financial standing of local populations. For many small and medium-sized businesses in the region, Grupa LOTOS is a source of additional capital, which fuels their operations and helps increase employment rates in the SME sector. This, in turn, supports improvement in the living standards, stimulates consumer spending, including on luxury goods and services, and encourages investment in education and intellectual resources, which the Company considers pillars of the economy. Intellectual assets offer measurable benefits: hired by Grupa LOTOS, the competent and well-educated members of the Gdańsk region community build the Company’s potential and innovation at the local, national and international levels. LOTOS Asfalt: The company is a wholesaler of bitumens, heavy fuel oil, bunker fuel and waterproofing materials. These are produced and sold under businessto-business (B2B) arrangements. Accordingly, by establishing business links with its partners, the company has an indirect impact on their growth prospects and economic standing. Moreover, the company contributes to maintaining or increasing employment rates and stimulates economic activity on its local markets. Since 2009, LOTOS Asfalt’s indirect economic impact on the Jasło region, suffering from an economic slowdown, took the form of investments in a new manufacturing business, the Waterproofing Materials Production Plant. The large-scale project located in the Tarnów Special Economic Zone in the south-east of Poland helped improve the local labour market, affected by unemployment concerns. Launched in 2009, the plant, after becoming fully operational, created 104 new jobs (data as at the end of 2010). As at the end of 2009 the headcount was 69 persons. Thanks to relevant training, employees of the newly launched modern production facility were offered an opportunity to gain hands-on experience and skills in operating technologically advanced manufacturing equipment and to learn how to function in organisational, logistics and distribution systems based on contemporary IT tools. LOTOS Kolej: Although no monitoring takes place in this area, certain aspects of the company’s activities may be classified as having an indirect economic impact. One such aspect is the company’s consistent efforts to upgrade the operated rolling stock. Purchases of new road locomotives strengthen the company’s competitive edge and position it among leading carriers that invest in new technologies. In late 2009, the company signed a contract for the sale of ST 43 Diesel locomotives (the last engine of this type left the company’s premises in 2010). In September 2009, LOTOS Kolej signed a contract for the delivery of the highly advanced TRAXX F140 DE diesel locomotives with Bombardier Transportation GmbH and an operating lease of 14 TRAXX F140 MS electric locomotives with Railpool GmbH. As a result, the company owns the most modern railroad plant and equipment in Poland, adding to the technological advancement of the local market. LOTOS Oil: In distributing its products, the company supports employment at its business partners operating locally and nationally. Entering into cooperation agreements at home and abroad, LOTOS Oil obtains access to new technologies. The company undertakes efforts to upgrade its processes, enhance the quality of its products and services, and provide employees with opportunities to improve their professional qualifications through training. These efforts make the company the most sought after employer in the country, which offers prospects for improvement and development and attracts specialists with extensive experience. 300 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 LOTOS Parafiny: The company’s indirect economic impact on local communities is reflected in its efforts to create new jobs across the supply chain and improve professional qualifications and skills on the local labour markets, which is linked with recruiting more suppliers. 301 Grupa LOTOS S.A.

The benefits offered to the Company’s employees include a unit-linked life insurance, additional medical care provided by a non-public healthcare establishment, parental leave for mothers and fathers, and social benefits in the form of loans, allowances, and partial financing of holidays for employees and their children. Labour/management relations GRI INDICATOR LA 4 Percentage of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements The Collective Bargaining Agreement in place at the Company covers 95.5% of its employees. GRI INDICATOR Minimum notice periods regarding significant organisational changes, including whether it is LA 5 specified in collective bargaining agreements 303 Grupa LOTOS S.A. Annual Report 2010 In accordance with the labour law provisions, the minimum notice period for an indefinite-term employment contract depends on the duration of work with the employer. The minimum notice period is two weeks if an employee has worked less than six months and three days if an employee has been employed as a substitute. Occupational health and safety GRI INDICATOR Percentage of total workforce represented in formal joint management-worker health and safety LA 6 committees that help monitor and advise on occupational health and safety programmes In accordance with the labour law provisions, Grupa LOTOS has set up a Health and Safety-at-Work Committee. It is composed of: proxy for trade unions, staff responsible for health and safety, doctor responsible for prophylactic care of employees, the Company’s Social Labour Inspector, trade union representatives. GRI INDICATOR Rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days and absenteeism, and total number of work LA 7 related fatalities by region The most frequent accident-related injuries at the LOTOS Group are injuries of upper and lower limbs. Incidents have mostly occurred while moving around or operating machinery and equipment. In 2010, there were no serious accidents or fatalities. 2010 saw a year-on-year decline of the rate of accidents at work and the LTIF value at Grupa LOTOS. This was attributable to higher employee awareness regarding occupational safety, resulting, among other things, from large-scale awareness initiatives, increased commitment and fostering the culture of occupational safety. Employees took part in training and informal sessions focusing on occupational safety. Other communication channels were also made available for that purpose. The above initiatives have delivered the expected results, as the level of employee awareness has been steadily rising. At the same time, the focused and planned process aimed at raising employee awareness and fostering the culture of occupational safety is meant to be a long-term effort and pursued also in the years to come. In recent years, there has been a welcome downward trend in accident frequency at Grupa LOTOS, which shows that our efforts in the area of health and occupational safety have put the Company on the right track. A major problem, however, has been a lack of harmonisation between Polish and EU laws. If the applicable legal regimes were harmonised, it would be possible to adopt a uniform approach to the classification and statistical reporting of accidents. This in turn would significantly reduce the number of accidents at work occurring at Grupa LOTOS, while allowing fair benchmarking between Grupa LOTOS and other businesses from the global chemical industry.

In addition, the LOTOS Group records and keeps statistics of incidents according to the European scale, i.e. dangerous occurrences (including dangerous states and incidents with potential to cause an injury), accidents resulting in incapacity for work lasting more than one day (LTI – Lost Time Injury), based on which the LITIF (Lost Time Injury Frequency) rate is computed, incidents requiring first-aid treatment and road accidents. In line with the guidelines contained in the ILO (International Labour Organization) Code of Practice Recording and notification of occupational accidents and diseases, companies of the LOTOS Group: have established uniform procedures to address accidents at work, perform cause and effect analysis of accidents at work, draw conclusions and take appropriate corrective and preventive measures to eliminate the risk of recurrence of similar incidents, document accidents at work and other dangerous occurrences, identify and analyse dangerous occurrences, based on which they take appropriate proactive and reactive measures to prevent their recurrence.

In this way, the obligation to consult employees on all matters related to occupational health and safety is fulfilled.

Retiring employees are entitled to a one-off cash severance payment, whose amount depends on the length of service. Its amount may range from an employee’s monthly pay where his or her length of service does not exceed 15 years to 500% of the base amount if the employee has worked 35 years.

Public policy GRI INDICATOR SO 5 Public policy positions and participation in public policy development and lobbying Grupa LOTOS operates in the oil sector, a part of the larger energy sector, which is strategic to the state. The majority shareholder of the Company is the Polish Treasury. However, even if this was not the case, the state would still be granting certain rights to and imposing certain obligations on companies from the strategic sectors by using regulation. One such obligation is the requirement to cooperate on energy sector security. Accordingly, Grupa LOTOS is an active participant in the process of developing and guiding the public policy in the area of the broad energy sector. Our experts are members of expert teams set up by public institutions to develop new legislative solutions in the energy sector, who actively participate in the public consultation of draft laws regulating the sector. Such activities include e.g. cooperation with the Ministry of Economy on the report for the International Energy Agency concerning the fuel industry, participation in the work of the Poland-Ukraine Intergovernmental Committee for Economic Cooperation, or of the Interdepartmental Team for Shale Gas. Legislation-related work in 2010 included provision of opinions on the bills on biocomponents and liquid fuels, and on mandatory stock of crude oil and liquid fuels. Grupa LOTOS provides ongoing information to the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Treasury regarding the energy sector for top-level departmental meetings. Being a member of the Polish Academic and Economic Forum, Grupa LOTOS is an active contributor to initiatives aimed at strengthening cooperation between academic and business communities, promoting innovation and building a knowledge-based economy. The Company is also monitoring the European Union regulations on the energy sector on an ongoing basis, and cooperates with state authorities in the process of developing documents which implement EU directives into the national law. On the initiative of Grupa LOTOS, supported by three other entities, namely Energa, Jastrzębska Spółka Węglowa and Kulczyk Investments, as well as by the Polish Academic and Economic Forum, a non-profit organisation Central European Energy Partners (CEEP) was registered in Brussels in June 2010. The organisation represents the energy sector from Central Europe (including crude oil, natural gas, coal, electricity, renewable energy sources, nuclear energy, interconnectors, etc.). The prime objective of the organisation as defined by its charter is to contribute to integration of the Central European energy sector under a common energy and security policy for the EU’s energy sector. To that end, CEEP initiated close cooperation with recognised international think tanks, such as the Center for Strategic & International Studies (Washington), the Windsor Energy Group (London, UK), the King’s College (London), the Atlantic Council (Washington), and such organisations as the International Energy Agency (Paris), or Europia (Brussels). CEEP is an active stakeholder in all major events in the energy sector organised under the auspices of the European Union. It is also a keen participant of consultations organised by the European Commission, is involved in preparing expert materials for the EU institutions, as well as attends working group meetings, including the Berlin Fossil Fuels Forum. President of the Management Board of Grupa LOTOS Paweł Olechnowicz is the Chairman of CEEP’s Directors’ Council. Grupa LOTOS is also involved in the development of policies and regulations regarding a wide range of energy sector-related matters, in particular those pertaining to the fuel sector, also through membership in the various organisations. As a member of the Windsor Energy Group (WEG), Grupa LOTOS maintains its active involvement in discussing and analysing global energy matters and challenges, with top experts of the private and public sector also involved in the process. The organisation boasts a long list of recognised personalities, who have decided, and will decide on the lines of development of the oil and gas industry worldwide. In February 2010, the Company hosted an international conference, named “North European Energy Security Forum”, with energy sector security in the European Union and globally on the conference’s agenda.

Anti-competitive behaviour GRI INDICATOR Total number of legal actions for anti-competitive behaviour, anti-trust, and monopoly practices SO 7 and their outcomes 1. By decision of President of the UOKIK (Polish Office for Competition and Consumer Protection), dated March 21st 2005, anti-trust proceedings were instigated in connection with a suspected restrictive agreement between Polski Koncern Naftowy ORLEN S.A. of Płock and Grupa LOTOS of Gdańsk, concerning a concurrent termination of production and distribution of U95 gasoline. Since the production and sale of U95 continued, the Management Board of the Company claimed that the UOKIK’s charges were unfounded and, in April 2005, applied for a decision that Grupa had not been engaged in restrictive practices. In July 2005, the Company filed a complaint with the Anti-Trust Court against the UOKIK’s decision, arguing it had had limited access to some case-related evidence. Notwithstanding the complaint, in September 2005 the Company filed another application for a decision that would expressly state that Grupa LOTOS had not been involved in monopolistic practices. In October 2005, another decision was issued by the UOKIK, concerning limited access to some case-related evidence, that the Company complained against to the Anti-Trust Court. The Competition and Consumer Protection Department of the Regional Court dismissed the complaints. Grupa LOTOS filed complaints with the Court of Appeal in Warsaw concerning the dismissal of the previous complaints, which again were dismissed. By decision of April 18th 2007 Grupa LOTOS’ right of access to evidence in the anti-trust proceedings, namely the materials collected in the course of an inspection at PKN ORLEN S.A. in Płock, and specifically certain annexes to the report from the inspection at Płock offices, was restricted upon a motion from PKN ORLEN S.A., and access to the report from the inspection of their Warsaw offices, and annexes thereto, was also restricted. By the same decision, PKN ORLEN S.A.’s petition for restriction of the right of access to evidence, being the report from the inspection of the petitioner’s Płock offices, was dismissed. On April 26th 2007, Grupa LOTOS filed a complaint against the decision restricting Grupa LOTOS’ right of access to evidence. On May 9th 2007, Grupa LOTOS was served a notice from the UOKIK, whereby the latter demanded information on the change in U95 and Pb95 fuel prices. The Company provided the required information to the UOKIK on the same day. On August 2nd 2007, a notice of termination of U95 petrol production was delivered by Grupa LOTOS to the UOKIK. On December 31st 2007, President of the UOKIK imposed a fine of PLN 1,000 thousand on Grupa LOTOS. An appeal against the decision was subsequently filed with the Regional Court in Warsaw on January 17th 2008. On September 23rd 2008, the Competition and Consumer Protection of the Regional Court in Warsaw, forwarded the UOKIK President’s reply to the appeal against the UOKIK President’s decision. In the reply to Grupa LOTOS’ appeal, the UOKIK President stated that Grupa LOTOS’ arguments, where they related to both substantive and formal provisions, were unfounded, and applied for dismissal of the petitioner’s case in entirety, and award of legal representation costs from the petitioner. On April 27th 2010, the Court adjourned the decision until May 6th 2010. On May 6th 2010, the Regional Court in Warsaw issued a judgment dismissing the appeal against the UOKIK’s decision in the anti-trust proceedings instigated on own initiative by the UOKIK President on March 21st 2005 and concerning distribution of U95 gasoline, and upheld the fines imposed by UOKIK on Grupa LOTOS, totalling PLN 1,000 thousand, and fines on PKN ORLEN S.A., totalling PLN 4,000 thousand. On June 15th 2010, the judgment dismissing the appeal against the UOKIK President’s decision was served. On June 28th 2010, Grupa LOTOS appealed against the judgment. Subsequently, Grupa LOTOS and the UOKIK filed a reply to PKN ORLEN S.A.’s appeal, whereas PKN ORLEN S.A. and the UOKIK filed a reply to Grupa LOTOS’ appeal. The court announced a judgment dismissing the appeal by Grupa LOTOS and PKN ORLEN S.A on February 11th 2011. After examining the grounds for the judgment, the Company will consider filing a last resort appeal. The case is pending. Provisions for potential liabilities resulting from lost litigation were made in the amount of PLN 1,000,000. On March 10th 2011, the Company paid off the liability amounting to PLN 1,000,000 following the court ruling of February 11th 2011. 2. By petition of May 18th 2001, PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. filed for award of PLN 6,975 thousand, and statutory interest charged from May 1st 1999, in compensation for the damage suffered by PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. as a result of monopolistic practices of the Company involving the sale of BS base oil in a way which put certain recipients at an advantage, by having a disproportionately higher volume of their orders delivered as compared to deliveries of orders made by PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o. Engagement of the Company in such monopolistic practices was ascertained by decision of the Anti-Trust Office of September 26th 1996. By the same decision, the Office ordered that the Company should discontinue such practices. The Company appealed against the decision. By judgement of October 22nd 1997, the Anti-Trust Department of the Provincial Court in Warsaw made some editing changes only to the decision, and also ordered discontinuation of the monopolistic practices. The Supreme Court dismissed the Company’s last resort appeal by judgment of June 2nd 1999. By ruling of December 21st 2002, the Regional Court in Gdańsk dismissed the petition for compensation, acknowledging in entirety the Company’s defence that the petition was time-barred. The ruling was however rescinded by the Court of Appeal in Gdańsk on December 4th 2003, case ref. I ACa 824/03, and referred for re-examination to the Regional Court in Gdańsk. The Court of Appeal found that the time-bar defence was unwarranted. As argued by the Court, it was not until June 2nd 1999 (date of the Supreme Court judgment) that it came to PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o’s attention that the damage they had suffered was an effect of monopolistic practices, resulting in the Company’s liability in tort and, only on that date, as argued by the Court, did the three-year time-bar period for compensation claims commence. The case was examined by the Regional Court in Gdańsk (court of first instance), file ref. IX GC 134/04. The Company replied with substantive defences (by challenging the fact that any damage had been suffered by PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o, and also challenged the value of the damage, and the presence of a causal relation between the monopolistic practice and the damage). Following the hearing in June 2005, the Regional Court in Gdańsk tasked a court expert in accounting and economy with drafting an opinion on the determination of the value of damage that the petitioner had suffered as a result of Grupa LOTOS’ actions. The expert stated in the opinion that, based on materials provided by PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o., it was not possible to determine the value of the damage, or ascertain that it actually existed. The court expert also found that the opinion should be drafted by an expert in a field other than accounting. No evidence to support the drafting of such opinion frustrated the petitioner in being granted the claim for appointment of another expert. The hearing took place on March 27th 2007. Announcement of the judgment was originally scheduled for April 10th 2007, but subsequently rescheduled to April 20th 2007. By judgment of April 20th 2007, the petition was dismissed. On May 17th 2007, the Company appealed against the decision on the costs of proceedings. On June 4th 2007, PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o appealed against the judgment of April 20th 2007. On August 12th 2007, Grupa LOTOS filed a reply to the appeal. On December 20th 2007, the court dismissed PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o’s appeal against the judgment by the Regional Court. On March 19th 2008, a petition for enforcement against PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o was filed with the court enforcement officer. On April 17th 2008, PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o filed a last resort appeal against the judgment of December 20th 2007. The appeal was served to Grupa LOTOS on June 17th 2008. On June 30th 2008, a reply to the appeal was served. The case was referred for preliminary examination, to be held on November 14th 2008. On January 14th 2009, the Supreme Court rescinded the judgement which was appealed against, and referred the case to the Court of Appeal in Gdańsk for re-examination. On March 10th 2009, files of the case were submitted to the Court of Appeal. On April 3rd 2009, the court enforcement officer served a decision on discontinuation of the enforcement procedure. On May 14th 2009, the Court of Appeal referred the case to the Regional Court for re-examination. In a session held on November 3rd 2009, the court ordered that PETROECCO JV Sp. z o.o appoint an expert. A hearing was held on October 1st 2010, where the expert gave testimony. The case is pending.
