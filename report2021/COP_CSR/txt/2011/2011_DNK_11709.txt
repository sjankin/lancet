Our approach to the 10 principles We have decided to approach the 10 Principles in a context that makes sense for us as a law firm. 3.1 Human rights We respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and uphold individual freedom of expression and opinion. Internally, this basic principle is upheld by regular meetings between management and employee groups and bi-weekly office meetings. We have just conducted our first employee satisfaction survey, which showed that employee satisfaction is relatively high at 4.14 on a 0-5 point scale. To further improve the satisfaction rate, we have acted on the issues unearthed by the survey and will be conducting a follow-up survey in late May 2011. Externally, a tangible expression of our support to fundamental human rights is our partnership with the Danish chapter of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders). Médecins Sans Frontières is an independent international medical humanitarian organisation that delivers emergency aid in more than 70 countries to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural or man-made disasters, or exclusion from health care. Our support takes the form of pro bono support, so far more than 200 hours’ worth of free legal advice. 5 In addition, we continuously support good causes financially such as families of cancer children and we donate funds to international disaster relief projects. We are currently in the process of considering how to focus our efforts more effectively. Goals We wish to develop and cement our partnership with Médecins Sans Frontières Denmark and explore the possibilities of forming similar partnerships in Denmark and internationally. We wish to find ways to focus our efforts more effectively. How do we monitor and evaluate performance? Internally: We will conduct employee satisfaction surveys each year and act swiftly on any concerns shown by the survey to exist among our employees. Externally: We meet with Médecins Sans Frontières Denmark each year to discuss our partnership, and a similar procedure will be followed for any other partnership we decide to enter into in future. ”Médecins Sans Frontières is an organisation based on volunteers and commitment. We send out doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals to disaster zones all over the world to provide medical emergency aid. This requires a professional administrative organisation. With its dedicated effort and invaluable HR law services, Norrbom Vinding has enabled us to focus all of our energy on what we are here for: Delivering independent humanitarian aid wherever it is needed. Thank you. Thank you very much.” Torill Pallesen Davey, HR Director 6 3.2 Labour (employee rights) Knowledge In a knowledge-driven business like ours, knowledge sharing is crucial. Internally, we have a centralised knowledge acquisition and management function, knowledge sharing meetings and training activities for all employees and for individual employee groups. Externally, we share our knowledge with clients and other stakeholders through our e-newsletters, breakfast briefings, seminars and other events. We are also very active teaching and acting as external examiners at universities and business schools, organising industry or client seminars and courses, facilitating industry and client networks and participating in lawyers’ associations. Labour: Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 7 7 Health Health and working environment are two sides of the same story. Both of them affect employees’ well-being and motivation. In our industry, working fixed hours is only an option for some of our employees as lawyers must be available when clients need them, and in some periods the workload will be greater than in other periods. Therefore, it is important for us to focus on working environment and employee well-being. Some of the initiatives we have put in place to promote and protect our employees’ physical well-being include home working (all employees except office services), ergonomic work place assessments, lunch, fresh fruit, massage, health checks, training seminars, sports and social activities. Some of the initiatives we have put in place to promote and protect our employees’ mental well-being include employee satisfaction surveys and employee development interviews, and we have a constant focus on the importance of work-life balance, workplace consultation and continuing professional and personal development and training. As this issue is ever present if not growing in our industry, during the summer and autumn of 2011 we will be holding a series of one-day health seminars to support our employee health programme, which is scheduled to be launched in the autumn. The seminars will feature speakers and workshops on physical and mental well-being such as stress prevention and stress management training. These initiatives and our constant focus on these issues are reflected in the relatively low sickness absence of our employees. 8 Equal opportunities We are committed to providing equal opportunities in recruitment, training, promotion and all other aspects of employment. One tangible result of our policy is the fact that we have 4 women partners and 5 men and that our managing partner is a woman. Goals We wish to launch our employee health programme to increase employee health and motivation in the autumn. We wish to increase employee satisfaction by means of specific initiatives, including by offering courses in personal development, communication and health and addressing any concerns shown by the employee satisfaction survey to exist among our employees. How do we monitor and evaluate performance? Knowledge: We compare knowledge-sharing data (intellectual capital statements, training activities, courses and seminars) on a regular basis. Health: We will implement the employee health programme in a form that will allow year-to-year comparisons. Additionally, we compare sickness absence figures from one year to another to monitor employee health. Equal opportunities: We measure our performance in this field by maintaining employee statistics. 9 10 3.3 Environment The environmental impact of law firms and our scope for reducing it may be less largescale than in other industries. Even so, there is a lot that can be done. We are committed to green IT. In the past few years, we have implemented green IT solutions to reduce power draw and CO2 emissions such as energy efficient computer screens, thin clients, server consolidation, data life cycle management, IP telephony and videoconferencing. In addition, the possibility of working from home means reduced CO2 emissions. We are also in the process of installing light sensors and other energy saving equipment. We are currently considering other measures which can be implemented to further decrease our carbon footprint such as a monthly news alert to employees with tips and tricks on how to be environmentally friendly. Environment: Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies 11 Goals We wish to continue reducing our carbon footprint. How do we monitor and evaluate performance? We will keep this issue in constant focus and remind ourselves that we have a moral obligation to minimise our environmental impact. 3.4 Anti-corruption As a Danish law firm, we are bound by the Code of Conduct issued by the Danish Bar and Law Society, the Danish Administration of Justice Act’s provisions on lawyers and the Danish Money Laundering Act. This means, among other things, that we are required to keep confidential all information we receive from clients and to avoid conflicts of interest. As a result of our areas of speciality, we do not receive large money transfers from clients, but even so we have an anti-money laundering policy. Goals We wish to continue to steer clear of anything that might give rise to ethical or legal concerns in this area. How do we monitor and evaluate performance? We will continue to comply with the rules we are bound by and continue to carry out our thorough scrutiny of new clients to see if there is reason for any concerns in this area. Anti-corruption: Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery 12 4. Future initiatives In 2011 and 2012, we will focus on the following three initiatives: Employee health programme, which is scheduled to be implemented in the autumn of 2011 Follow-up employee satisfaction survey and annual surveys A constant focus on our environmental impact to ensure that we keep up awareness Dampfaergevej 26 2100 Copenhagen Denmark www.norrbomvinding.com 13
