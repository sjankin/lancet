The No. 3 HOU at GS Caltex is the industry’s largest in Korea and boasts the level of competitiveness that is incomparable to any domestic competitor. economic benefits • Industry’s Largest Investment: KRW 2.2 trillion • Increased Exports: Turning low value extra heavy oil into high-end cleaner light and middle distillates, all of which were exported overseas • Cost Reduction: Cutting cost by utilizing low-price heavy oil investment: upgrading ratio: KRW 2.2 trillion 28.3% environment investment: Job Creation: KRW 370 billion 3 million Hou Capacity: 215,000 barrels Social benefits • Job Creation: 3 million per annum • Development of Local Economy: Working with local companies in 80% of the construction work • Enhanced Competitiveness of Partner Companies: Boosting related businesses near the Yeosu Industrial Complex and assisting partner companies improve their technology competitiveness. environmental benefits • Large-Scale Environmental Investment: KRW 370 billion • Elimination and Recovery of Sulfur: Daily elimination and recovery of 450 tons of sulfur through the decomposition and desulfurization of feedstock extra heavy oil • Prevention of Soil Contamination: Pipelines and facilities that are built on the ground, not underground, in order to prevent soil contamination * Vacuum Residue: This refers to a relatively heavy kind of bunker-C oil that is produced when atmospheric residue goes through the vacuum distillation process * Hydrodesulfurization(HDS) Unit: Produces light products such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel from extra heavy oil as a feedstock and hydrogen as a catalyst. The HDS unit is considered environmentally-friendly as it generates high-quality light products by capturing sulfur out of the reaction between hydrogen and extra heavy oil that is even heavier than usual heavy oil feed stock including bunker C oil used for ordinary cracking units. overview 02 MESSAGE from the CEO: Bridge to the Future With the management goal of building a ‘Bridge to the Future’, we strive to address imminent challenges wisely by conducting our business more responsibly.

Third-Party Assurance Statement Dear GS Caltex management and Stakeholders ◈ introduction The Korean Standards Association was commissioned by GS Caltex to assure the ‘GS Caltex Sustainability Report 2010’(the ‘Report’ hereafter). We reviewed the evidence and validity of the data, achievements and relevant systems in this Report written by GS Caltex to arrive at independent assurance conclusions. GS Caltex is entirely and solely responsible for the collection, analysis and organization of the information and all the statements included in this Report. ▣ independence Aside from providing third-party assurance on this Report, we are independent and autonomousunaffected by any influence or interests of GS Caltex. ▣ assurance Standards and level Our assurance corresponds with the AA 1000AS(2008) principles, ISO 26000 and GRI G3.1 guidelines. The AA 1000AS(2008) assurance principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness were used as criteria against which to evaluate the Report. The level of assurance of the reliability of the Report data is moderate. ▣ assurance type and Scope Our assurance is a Type 2 assurance as defined by the AA 1000AS standards, which means that as an assurance provider, we evaluated the reliability and accuracy of specified sustainability performance information within the Report in accordance with the AA 1000AS principle of reporting responsibility. The scope of this assurance is limited to the GS Caltex Sustainability Report 2010 between January 1 2010 to December 31 2010 and physical inspections of the GS Caltex headquarters and its Yeosu Complex. ▣ assurance Methodology We gathered the necessary information, data and evidence in relation with the assurance scope and provided assurance using the following methods: • Review of sustainability issues that may impact GS Caltex and garner attention from stakeholders • Review of the process to determine material issues to be included in the Report • Review of the suitability of performance data collection system and reporting process in each area • Interview with senior managers working in relation with sustainability management • Review of process and system to generate sustainability data by visiting the headquarters • Review of internal documents and basic data to support core statements within the Report • Review of the consistency between financial data in the Report and corporate audit reports • Verification of the level of adherence to the GRI guidelines 55 ▣ our Conclusions We reviewed the draft of this report and presented our suggestions and which led to its necessary revisions. With assurance, we arrived at the conclusion that the content of this Report reflects the sustainability of GS Caltex’s management void of significant errors or biases. • Inclusivity Does GS Caltex ensure stakeholder engagement in designing and creating strategic response measures for sustainability? We believe that GS Caltex is operating with appropriate processes and channels to assure stakeholder engagement. In particular, our view is that the company is engaged in systemic communication activities to promote local community engagement. • Materiality Does the report include material issues that impact GS Caltex and its stakeholders? We believe that GS Caltex neither omits nor excludes any informative material from its stakeholders. We verified that the company completed the materiality process to identify sustainability issues through industry peer analysis, media research, expert interviews and stakeholder surveys in order to determine core material issues. • Responsiveness Does GS Caltex respond to stakeholder concerns appropriately? We believe that GS Caltex is integrating material sustainability issues into its corporate guidelines and activities and responding to the demands of stakeholders. ▣ our recommendations • The company would benefit from the enhancement of greater diversity in its employee demographics. It could also benefit through the inclusion of increased sustainability management indicators into its employee performance evaluation system as well as the inclusion of greater focus on achievements measured against targets in connection with sustainability management strategies. • The company is advised to activate its mid/long-term green management roadmap, build its own energy management system(EMS) and supplement its business system to include performance evaluation schemes which will ensure strategic response to varying business requirements such as GHG reductions. • The company would benefit from strengthening the link between its sustainability reports and its corporate website in expanding the scope of sustainability reporting to include overseas subsidiaries and offices.
