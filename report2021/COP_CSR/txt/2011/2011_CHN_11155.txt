Building the Management System of Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction and Promoting System Construction China Unicom has set up the Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Committee and the Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Office, developed relevant management approaches and regulations, improved statistical indicators, developed assessment methods, clarified assessment indicators, and applied the energy conservation technical standards of major equipment, air-conditioners, and power supply. China Unicom has set up the initial management system of energy conservation and emission reduction, including the organizational guarantee system, standard system, statistical indicator system, evaluations system, energy-saving technology system, and energy audit system. Promoting the Application of New and Energy-Saving Technologies Closely following the development and evolvement of the communication network, China Unicom has strengthened the research on 71 cloud computing and virtualization, gradually promoted the integration and sharing of information infrastructures, and increased the utilization of equipment. China Unicom has strengthened the application of new technologies, built up integrated and distributed base stations, and adopted BBU collective maintenance. China Unicom used current recourses to construct networks to save investment, share supporting facilities and equipment room and reduce construction and maintenance costs. China Unicom has established the Special Plan for Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction2011-2013, which has identified energy saving targets, energy-saving measures and implementation plans. China Unicom will guide our employees to carry out the plan with management and technical approaches. In project planning, China Unicom required that energy conservation and emission reduction must be included in the project application report and feasibility study report, which is a key part in the project assessment. Otherwise the project application report and feasibility study report will not be approved in principle. China Unicom strengthened the management of collective purchasing, and included 10 kinds of materials commonly used nationwide into the list of collective purchasing. Having separated the 72 materials into different categories, China Unicom has completed the collective purchasing with unified standard, approach, and scale. Meanwhile, in the tendering of major network equipment, base station equipment, and power equipment, China Unicom has introduced energy consumption index as a key indicator for the selection. Through the test on energy-saving capacity of all equipment, China Unicom has strictly controlled the use of equipment with high energy consumption and pollution. In the field of equipment maintenance, China Unicom has tapped the potentials of energy conservation and emission reduction of existing assets. China Unicom has actively promoted the application of energy saving technologies, such as intelligent overload shutdown, portable intelligent DC generators, intelligent heat exchange system, self-regulating air-conditioning system, intelligent fresh air exchange system, integrated equipment of heat exchange and air-conditioner, and heat pipe energy saving system. In 2010, 72 million yuan was saved due to the application of these technologies. 73 In Xinjiang, China Unicom adopted wind and PV hybrid technology to supply power to base stations. The solar power is the major supply in the daytime and wind will provide power in rainy days and evenings. Currently 76 base stations with wind and PV hybrid technology have been built up, which are expected to save 1.976 yuan in maintenance each year. In Hebei, China Unicom has installed new energy-saving air conditioners that use outdoor cold source and reconstructed 24 large core equipment rooms, a project that could save 50% electricity, i.e. 0.67 million kWh each year. In 2010, China Unicom has equipped new energy-saving software in GSM base stations, which will substantially reduce power consumption and electromagnetic radiation. New antennas installed in indoors wireless distribution system will send more even and stable signals than traditional antennas, which could effectively reduce the electromagnetic radiation 74 below the antenna. China Unicom has conducted pilot programs on contract energy management to explore new modes in energy conservation and emission reduction. China Unicom has standardized the operation and procedures of contract energy management, studied the calculation methods of electricity consumption and the sharing of energy-saving benefits, improved monitoring and inspections to lay a solid foundation for the promotion of contract energy management. Implementing Energy Consumption Management and Energy Saving in Daily Production In the daily management, China Unicom strengthened the management of energy conservation and emission reduction, set up energy saving management system, implemented accountability system, improved energy-saving management methods, optimized measurement instruments, and consolidated the foundation of energy-saving management. In line with the temperatures in different seasons, the air-conditioners in access equipment rooms and base stations in certain periods were be shut down to reduce electricity consumption. China Unicom built up intelligent electricity management system based on benchmark stations and implemented benchmarking management to find out power stealing, inaccurate electric meters, inappropriate design of 75 air-conditioners, and abnormal equipment running; the Company actively carried out technical reform, network streamlining, and system integration; adjusted and optimized network structure and upgraded old equipment with high energy consumption to increase network efficiency and reduce energy consumption. In 2010, around 0.14 billion yuan was saved due to the strengthened management. Achievements in Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction In 2010, the overall energy consumption has reached 1.7404 million tons of standard coal, an increase of 33.65% over 1.3022 million tons in 2008; the integrated energy consumption per unit information traffic is expected to reach 200 75.58 kg standard 54% 150 coal/TB, a 100 50 decrease of 54% 0 2008 2009 2010 compared with Unit Information Traffic（kg standard coal/TB） 164.48 kg standard coal/TB in 2008. Through mobile office, integrated information network, video conference, and other energy-saving businesses, China Unicom has supported enterprises and customers to increase their informatization level, reduce their resource consumption and the resource consumption of the whole society, and promote resource conservation in the society. 76 Strengthening Infrastructure Sharing In order to save resources, protect environment, and reduce repetitive telecom construction, China Unicom actively implemented the national policy of telecom infrastructure sharing, and cooperated with other telecom operators to build and share mobile signal towers, transmission lines, and other infrastructures. In 2010, China Unicom built 9,593 signal towers and 8,908 kilometers transmission lines with other operators; shared 6,185 signal towers and 13,481 kilometers transmission lines with other operators; shared 7,230 signal towers and 19,244 kilometers transmission lines of other operators. Through the joint building and sharing of infrastructures, China Unicom has reduced the consumption of raw materials, land and other resources, and saved over 20 billion yuan in construction investment, an achievement that has increased both corporate and social benefits. 77 Actively Taking Part in Social Welfare Undertakings China Unicom has been actively taking part in social welfare undertakings and has been supporting poor areas and making a donation to education; in the meantime China Unicom has been leading employees to join in volunteer campaigns to further reinforce their sense of social responsibility and drive the construction of a harmonious society. Caring for Poverty Alleviation and Student Financial Aid Poverty Alleviation Work to Special Areas China Unicom’s poverty alleviation task is to help Kangbao County and Guyuan County of Zhangjiakou. In 2010, China Unicom respectively allocated 1.1 million yuan to Kangbao and Guyuan for poverty alleviation, which amounted to 2.2 million yuan in total. The poverty alleviation fund was mainly used for such projects as winter greenhouses, practical agricultural technical trainings, construction of local roads, construction of farmland facilities, breeding of milk cows and so forth. Implementation of the poverty alleviation project has played a positive role in boosting the development of local society and economy and improving the production and living conditions of the poor. In the meantime, China Unicom’s branches have made positive 78 contributions to changing the poor and backward state of local regions by taking part in the program of poverty alleviation. In Guangdong, China Unicom’s fixed support targets for poverty alleviation is Jiaohang village of Waxi town of Zijin county of Heyuan. China Unicom invested over 0.5 million yuan in organizing warmth activities and cultural poverty alleviation initiatives, constructing roads, implementing “drinking water supply to the house” project and developing crop farming and breeding, which has increased farmer’s income and helped poverty-stricken families shake off poverty. In Shanxi, China Unicom’s fixed support target for poverty alleviation is Tianzhen county of Datong. China Unicom successively prepared 2.75 million yuan to solve the practical problems of lacking drinking water in Xinping town of Tianzhen county and donated some office supplies and books worth 100,000 yuan. In order to construct the “Modern distance-learning network for rural communist party members and cadres”, China Unicom donated 158 computers and activated 158 sites to improve the level of informatization in Tianzhen county. Donation to China Social Entrepreneur Foundation 79 (YouChange) China Social Entrepreneur Foundation is a non-profit charitable organization with independent legal status. It is formally approved by the State Council of the People’s Republic of China and officially registered at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The first of its kind in China, YouChange is an innovative private foundation funded by entrepreneurs from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Foundation takes building a people-centric harmonious society as the goal and operates through providing participatory grants. In Nov 2010, China Unicom donated 750,000 yuan to YouChange for its IDC hosting in China Unicom to facilitate public welfare undertakings via a network platform. Continuing to Support Tibet with Talents and Funds China Unicom has supported Geji county of Ali, Tibet with personnel, technology and fund since 2002. Up to now, China Unicom has completed three rounds of support work in Tibet, with total investment amounting to 42.8 million yuan. The investment in Geji county covers a wide range of areas, including education, culture, ecology, infrastructure, city planning, office equipment, environment rebuilding, and construction of pasture region so as to push the development of social undertakings. Supporting College Students for Social Practices 80 China Unicom provided opportunities to college students to participate in internship by building a base for college students to take a part-time job while studying at college. In Hainan, associated with the Hainan Committee of Communist Youth League of China, China Unicom initiated the “realizing dreams through work-study program” and recruited almost a thousand college students. The branch offered unified training and management to the college students and helped them broaden the horizon and improve technical skills. It is a good platform for college students to get exposure to the society, experience and practice in the society. In Shandong, associated with the Shandong Committee of Communist Youth League of China, China Unicom offered technology, fund and project to support college students to start a business. The initiative covered six universities and colleges including Shandong University and Shandong Normal University in the initial stage. Initial fund for provincial college students to start a business was 35 million yuan. In addition, eight platforms were provided to support them, i.e. fund support, project launch, training for starting a business, information service, internship, tutorship, incubator and community management. 81 In Gansu, in a big welfare campaign “embracing Longyuan with love and the wonderful “Wo” organized by the Propaganda Department of CPC Gansu Provincial Committee, the Gansu Committee of Communist Youth League of China and Gansu Provincial Education Board, the student volunteers on summer vocation were encouraged to bring “culture, technology and health knowledge to the countryside”. China Unicom donated 10000 “Wo” T-shirts, 26 team flags and 200,000-million-yuan-worth recharge cards to the 10,000 students coming from 26 colleges and universities in Lanzhou. In Guangdong, China Unicom built a “Wo internship base for college students, which has helped almost 300 graduates. Deputy Minister Zhang Xiaojian of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security inspected the base on Sep 9. He personally experienced the integrated “easy job-hunting” service platform and then highly praised the platform for its creation and social effect. “Childhood on the Snowy Land” Expo Summer Camp 82 Shanghai branch has been staying in touch with Diexi Town Primary School since it title sponsored the “Childhood on the Snowy Land” education support campaign in 2009 and planned to give prizes to teachers and students once a year . Before Jun 1st 2010, leaders of Shanghai branch went to Diexi Town Primary School of Mao county to give prizes to excellent teachers and students there. In August, China Unicom and Dongfang Daily co-organized “Childhood on the Snowy Land” Expo Summer Camp program. Students from Diexi middle and primary schools paired with Shanghai volunteer families had studied and lived together and visited Shanghai Expo to experience the two-way interaction. These activities will spread more hopes and harvest more fruits. Initiating the “caring for bear” campaign In order to help more caring enterprises and public figures learn about Animals Asia and the project in relation to black bear rescuing, China Unicom worked together with Animals Asia, activated a caring private line 11692099 named “visible love and caring for bear”. All the fees generated by the line would be donated to Animals Asia. By means of the Company’s service platform, customers may call the caring hotline 83 in the form of video telephone by making use of a 3G mobile phone to see the living conditions of black bears and relevant plans for rescuing black bear made by Animals Asia. It relieved the staff working in the black bear rescuing center of the pressure arising from reception. It is a perfect combination between caring projects and modern communications technologies and a window for external exchanges. Dissemination of Communications Scientific Knowledge and Culture Diffusion Dissemination of corporate culture or scientific knowledge is a supporting point for an enterprise to maintain sustainable development and a starting point to benefit the public and the society. Taking the advantage of its long history, Beijing branch planned a “communications journey” to spread the long history and culture and improve the quality of the people. Beijing branch was dedicated to social welfare undertakings based on the idea of “invigorating the nation through culture and benefiting the people through dissemination of scientific knowledge”. The “communications journey” collected all symbolic communications sites at different historical periods and is a visiting route 84 combining with history, culture, science and education. Until now, 14 visiting sites have been opened: Beijing Communications and Telecommunications Museum, royal telephone exchange in the Forbidden City, royal private telephone line exhibition in the Summer Palace, Xiangshan telephone exchange (former site), Telegraph Building, Shahe satellite communications bureau, Fuwai network management center, Yizhuang international data center, Zaojunmiao integrated communication building, Tucheng broadband experience center, Guiguliangcheng 10010 center, mobile communications bureau at Jingmen building, Beijing mobile communications bureau and central signaling station of international station. The “communications journey” lively presented Beijing branch’s rich communications resources and rarely known communications history to the public. The special Beijing one-day tour and the professional interpretation service team were highly praised by visitors. Up to now, over 50,000 visitors have experienced the special journey. It can be seen that the “communications journey” is a new way to truly understand communications and experience it. One of the features of the “communications journey” is Beijing Communications and Telecommunications Museum. It was titled “Beijing Science Popularization Base”, “Science Popularization and Education Base of China Institute of Communications” and “Communications Science Popularization and Education Base of Beijing 85 University of Posts and Telecommunications” respectively in recent two years. The design and implementation of the “communications journey” by Beijing branch has brought communications culture and knowledge to common people. “Sense of social responsibility”, “responsibility and obligation of building a harmonious society” and “people-oriented spirit” run through the whole “communications journey”, showing our respect to our modern history and culture and our contribution to the development of China’s communications, and in the meantime reflecting our care to the people. Furthermore, as a partner and supporting enterprise, China Unicom, in coordination with Telefónica and National Art Museum of China, co-held a “Cubism Era – Exhibition of Telefónica Art Treasures”. The exhibition collected many classical works of Spanish “cubism” representative artists Juan Gris, Emilio Pettoruti, Jean Metzinger, etc. Success of the exhibition has played a positive role in promoting exquisite art, expanding the 86 public’s appreciation of the beauty, driving social progress and cultural development and boosting communication and exchange between Chinese culture and western culture. China Unicom Employees Joining in Volunteer Campaigns China Unicom encouraged its staff to join in volunteer campaigns, enriched campaigns, enabled the campaign in relation to caring for migrant workers’ children and supported Expo volunteer campaigns, by which China Unicom’s brand image was fully presented. The campaigns were widely recognized and praised by all walks of life. During Shanghai Expo, 127 Expo volunteers from the Company worked for the Expo and played a significant role in ensuring a safe Expo. “China Unicom Wo team” of China Unicom Shanghai North Branch was titled “Shanghai Expo Excellent Volunteer Service Team” by Shanghai Trade Union. 87 Beijing branch and the Communist Youth League of China Beijing Committee and Henan Committee co-organized a volunteer campaign targeted at migrant workers’ children on May 4. In the campaign, tens of migrant workers from Henan talked with their relatives far away in the hometown with the help of volunteers in 3G China Communist Youth League service station. Wuhan branch’s youth volunteers met and communicated with migrant workers’ children and donated books worth 2000 yuan, and in the meantime, they registered migrant workers’ children to give one-to-one support, including tutoring service, accompanying service, city experiencing, self-protection instructions and donations. 88 Prospect for 2011 As a saying goes, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with single step”, China Unicom is going forward along with the Company’s visions.
