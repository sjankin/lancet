GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP REPORT 2010 27 Environment 28 BEER & A BETTER WORLD Environment Beer is a product of natural ingredients, and the stewardship of our natural environment — land, water and air — is fundamental to the quality of our brands in the long term. To be a responsible and resource-efficient global brewer, we must continually look for ways to incorporate practices that help us make the most of our raw materials, while also reducing the impact of our packaging and transportation on the environment. 2010 Highlights 2012 Global Environmental Targets Last year, we announced global, company­wide 4.04 567 targets on measures such as water and hl/hl projects 3% 3.7% energy use, as well as carbon emission reductions that we will strive to achieve by the end of 2012.
