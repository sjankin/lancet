Modern Bakeries has always aimed to be a model company, we believe that being a market leader puts a great responsibility on our shoulder to be a role model for other companies. We succeeded in doing that since our establishment and will continue with our commitment to grow our business while keeping our eyes focused on the benefits and interests of all our stakeholders. Our stake holders are: Share holders. Employees. Clients. Consumer. Suppliers. Community. The 10 principles of the global compact are a very effective tool for monitoring and assessing our performance towards sustainability and our stakeholders. We strive and up to our best knowledge to implement them and we will always keep enhancing our performance to meet them for a Better Earth . Regards, Amr Elhelaly.
