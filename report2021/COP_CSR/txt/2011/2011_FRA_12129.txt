Éric Stableaux, Technical Manager, 4-Wheel Bin Production Unit, Plastic Omnium Environment in Langres (France) CHAPTER 3 Sustainable Progress Page 41 The ability to work effectively with people from different backgrounds ensures the success of Plastic Omnium’s acquisitions and partnerships Deploying the Company’s strategy Pursuing the objectives of the “PO 2009” plan, the Company continued to diligently manage its human resources, ﬁnalizing voluntary separation plans at the Inoplast facilities in Douai, Andance and Saint-Désirat, France while maintaining its strategic commitment to innovation and international development. New projects now underway gave a boost to operations at the ∑-Sigmatech R&D Center. Employee training is one of our key drivers of excellence, enabling us to adapt to changes in speciﬁc job skills and transmit expertise to local managers and operators as new facilities open. In 2010, training initiatives were conducted at plants in Redondela (Spain), Vellore (India), and Nanjing and Pudong (China). A global company operating locally, Plastic Omnium promotes job mobility between countries as a means of creating multicultural teams working in a decentralized organization. The plant in Redondela, Spain was inaugurated on 1 September 2010 by Patrick Le Garrec, Director, Western Europe Business Unit. Teams took part in a training program to speed their integration into the Company. 2010 Key Indicators + 1,131 people hired + 277,497 hours of training + 17.7 hours of training per person per year + 238 managers took advantage of a job mobility opportunity + 18% of managers are women Page 42 New employee orientation and integration programs are essential to an effective human resources policy New career opportunities The Plastic Omnium “contract”: Plastic Omnium is especially attentive when integrating a two-way commitment new employees after a company is acquired.

The code federates team members in all our businesses worldwide around shared rules and values. A second code dealing speciﬁcally with competition rules has been published for employees working in sales or procurement. Both codes have been given to managers in all subsidiaries, who are responsible for seeing that they are properly applied. A corporate resource and an integral part of the PO Way, the Code of Conduct is presented to new employees on orientation day and is available on both the website and the intranet portal. Respecting the rules of law and ethical principles is everyone’s business and in the interest of employees and the Company alike CHAPTER 3 Sustainable Progress Page 45 Strengthening trust and transparency in relations with suppliers Partnering relations with customers The crisis in the automobile sector has led to a new way of working and created new relations that take into account the interests of all industry players in A CODE FOR NEW INDUSTRY PRACTICES France.

Christian Baillet, Process Relay Operator, Plastic Omnium Environment in Langres (France) KEY SAFETY INDICATORS Level 1 accident frequency rate: lost-time accidents Level 2 accident frequency rate: accidents with and without lost time Accident severity rate The Company has set a goal of optimizing safety performance on all sites. Page 48 A worldwide risk-prevention plan Doris Keilhack, Operator in Rottenburg (Germany) Meeting four challenges The HSE plan is organized around four objectives: eliminating the risk of serious accidents by reducing the total numbers of accidents; protecting the Company’s industrial assets; developing managerial skills through the PO Way; and reducing the environmental impact of our operations. Through the plan, Plastic Omnium has conﬁrmed that safety and the environment as well as risk management are fully integrated into decision-making and management processes of all units. Continuing Company-wide audits Following the renewal of OHSAS 18001 certiﬁcation for the Plastic Omnium safety management system in late 2009, three follow-up audits were conducted in 2010 (two by internal teams and one by a qualiﬁed independent organization) to ensure that the system was functioning smoothly. In this way, subsidiaries could adopt and widely share the safety procedures and objectives set for the Company as a whole. Internal audits will be continued while ongoing initiatives to obtain ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certiﬁcation will ensure efﬁcient management of safety and environmental protection programs. 1,713 days in a row without a lost-time accident The Plastic Omnium Auto Inergy plant in Rottenburg, Germany received an award in 2010 for its safety performance through the end of 2009. CHAPTER 3 Sustainable Progress Page 49 A High-Risk Protection label: ensuring the sustainability of the most strategically important sites Recognition of efforts to protect Company assets To ensure that its facilities are fully protected against the risk of ﬁre, a High-Risk Protection program was launched in 2010. This international label awarded by insurance companies recognizes companies that apply the highest standards of damage protection. Companies are graded following on-site audits and a classiﬁcation system is drawn up that takes into account their level of ﬁre prevention measures. This approach makes the production base more reliable by eliminating the risk of disruption in the customer supply chain while also reducing ﬁre hazards and ﬁre-related accidents. In 2010, four plants were awarded the label: Ruitz and ∑-Sigmatech in France, Measham in the United Kingdom and Silao in Mexico. Teams at ∑-Sigmatech integrate HSE criteria into new projects from the outset. Showcasing outstanding safety performance This approach makes it possible to assess Annual safety awards have been created to recognize and encourage efforts in this area. Presented by and eliminate risks at every stage, with the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer Laurent Burelle goal of improving plant safety performance at the Senior Management Convention on 23 March and workstation ergonomics. 2010, the 2009 awards covered three categories: François Mazères Best Safety Performance, Most Improved Safety HSE Coordinator, Plastic Omnium Auto Exterior Performance and Most Accident-Free Days Worked. While the challenges were not the same for all sites – which included plants as well as other operating facilities – all had two points in common: highly responsible management teams and committed employees. The four foundations of the HSE plan Safety + the environment + risk management = an ongoing commitment based on four foundations Management assumes responsibility for the HSE plan A reconnaissance system is deployed HSE criteria are taken into account beginning in the design phase A policy of excellence is developed Page 50 Safety As in 2008 and 2009, Plastic Omnium continued to implement its programs to ensure safety in the workplace as part of a disciplined risk management process. Signiﬁcant improvements were made, thus conﬁrming the effectiveness of our projects in the areas of equipment compliance upgrades, man-machine interface, deployment of the Top Safety training program and ergonomics. Eliminating the risk of serious accidents INERGY is also engaged in the process, carrying out One serious accident out of three is due to initial audits in Europe and South America.

Safety: an objective integrated into managers’ annual performance reviews CHAPTER 3 Sustainable Progress Page 51 Worldwide plans to ensure safety in the workplace Musculo-skeletal disorders Top Safety training at the plant in Ruitz, France A three-year internal study was conducted to prepare a list of reported occupational illnesses and injuries. The study found that 25% are due to repetitive movements that lead to musculo-skeletal disorders. To reduce this type of injury, training programs on basic ergonomic principles were conducted throughout 2010 via an e-learning module. Offered in seven languages, the module teaches correct movements and postures. This initiative is supported by programs on ergonomic workstation design using virtual reality techniques and the deployment of a behavioral approach to prevent disorders in cooperation with physical therapists. These three programs reﬂect Plastic Omnium’s commitment to preventing job-related disorders so that employees work in optimal conditions TOP SAFETY throughout their careers. Introduced in 2005, the Top Safety training program enables managers to conduct audits that identify at-risk situations and to promote a true culture of safety within the organization. In 2010, program content was modiﬁed to take into account issues related to man-machine interface, equipment compliance upgrades and ergonomics. Four pilot sessions were held for 48 managers in Langres and Vernon in France, Silao in Mexico, and Measham in the United Kingdom. Improved safety performance Since the program’s launch in 2005, training courses have been conducted for more than 450 managers + 42 facilities reported no accidents and awareness-building sessions have been held in 2010 compared with 36 in 2009, an increase of 16% for over 8,000 employees.

INERGY energy audits Since 2009, Plastic Omnium Auto Inergy has been involved on a site audit program with the goal of measuring energy use and rapidly taking steps to reduce consumption. Important ways of saving energy were identiﬁed on nine A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH pilot sites. In all, 90% of Inergy facilities will be audited by year-end 2011. As part of its Environmental Management System and HSE Plan, Plastic Omnium is pursuing efforts to obtain environmental certiﬁcation for its facilities. At year-end, 79 sites were ISO 14001 certiﬁed, an increase of 10% in one year. When facilities are acquired, complete environmental audits of soil, air and water, are carried out upstream before the certiﬁcation process is launched to prevent risks.
