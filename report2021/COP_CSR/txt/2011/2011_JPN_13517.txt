Kumi Fujisawa, who is trying to create new social systems as vice president of the think tank SophiaBank, and Daiwa Securities Group Chairman Shigeharu Suzuki (then president & CEO) discussed how financial institutions are uniquely positioned to make certain efforts, such as offering products and services for impact investing and that are compliant with the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

It is possible to apply for amounts starting Suzuki:Yes. Our microfinance products were from ¥1,000 in-store or online. Comments I received commercialized from a plan created by a front-line included, “It’s great that there is a company creating such employee concerned about poverty.

Creating products valuable to society sends a character positive message to employees and to the Japanese Fujisawa: I’ve heard that doctors were major buyers of people. It also sends a message abroad about the Vaccine Bonds. I imagine that offering impact virtues of Japan. I believe it enhances the Daiwa investment products broadens your customer base. Securities brand. Suzuki: I believe Japanese people are the most kind-hearted in the world in terms of national character. Exercising social responsibility by Impact investing is extremely well-suited to Japanese people because they provide the opportunity to pursue not investing in undesirable social as well as financial returns. They are likely to companies spread more as they become known to people who have Fujisawa: The Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions not previously been involved in investing. entered into force August 2010. On July 30, 2010, Daiwa Asset Management publicly announced that it would prohibit the inclusion of securities issued by cluster munitions producers in active funds. This surprised me when I first heard it, but it’s great, isn’t it? Suzuki: We cannot invest in companies involved in unacceptable or banned products and services. We exclude such companies at the due diligence stage prior to underwriting and are putting in place procedures to ensure sales personnel do not recommend them to clients. Fujisawa: That’s terrific. For a country like Japan, which has the greatest financial assets, to create the safety valve of not directing money to companies that are not beneficial to society sends a strong message to the world. This is another way in which the Daiwa Securities Group is taking the lead. Suzuki: I think more companies are taking social responsibility seriously, but I am proud of our leading role. Fujisawa: The Daiwa Securities Group’s initiative is remarkable given the strong tendency of the Japanese, particularly in the financial and capital markets, to avoid uncharted territory. What has been the response within the company? It is generally said that middle-management opposes changes in corporate strategy. Suzuki: I believe and hope that there has been no opposition. I have long said that we should not engage Kumi Fujisawa in socially unacceptable businesses even if they are not Cofounder and Vice President of the think tank SophiaBank against the law or other rules, and I believe this way of Established Japan’s first investment trust rating company in thinking has permeated our company.

Suzuki: Female sales staff are highly effective in dealing with individual investors, who require meticulous service and explanations. Financial service companies have a reputation for being male bastions, but this is now completely untrue. Fujisawa: Has the increase in female employees been deliberate or spontaneous? Suzuki: Both, I think. We certainly deliberately set out to create a rewarding work environment. This led to greater engagement by female employees and a gradual increase in numbers. Fujisawa: What prompted you to create a female employee-friendly environment? Suzuki: A few things struck me poorly when I entered the company. One was the messy state of offices. Front office spaces were different, but back offices were in an awful state. I ordered a company-wide revamp when I took up the position of president. Fujisawa: Your female employees must be happy to have someone who cares about this leading the company. Suzuki: Another thing I didn’t like was that there was Shigeharu Suzuki no set time to leave the office.

Fujisawa: I am highly impressed with what I’ve heard today. Thank you very much. 8 SRI Highlights: The Role of Finance Just think about what you can achieve with your money The Nature of Money and Finance What is finance? production thanks to the accumulation of capital, Financial textbooks define finance as “making money leading to higher incomes and accelerating economic available.” But what significance does making money growth.

Ltd. work is. Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. Not only bonds—Daiwa Microfinance Fund launched We launched the Daiwa Microfinance Fund in February 2011. The fund directly invests in microfinance institutions (MFI) and in bonds issued by international institutions working to change MFI’s operating environment. The fund thus directly contributes capital to alleviate poverty in developing countries. It combines the advantages of a strong social contribution, convenience, and reliability—customers who buy shares in the fund are sent asset management reports, and day-to-day trading is possible. The fact that the fund targets investments that contribute to society makes it no less beneficial for investors compared to conventional foreign bond funds. It should be possible to use money flows to correct society’s flaws and change the world. Finance has that power. We are hoping to spread this idea among more people.

As a financial service company, we have also integrated our research analysis unit into our ESG unit in order to provide information useful for investing.

These principles are in accord with the Daiwa Securities Group’s principles and most of their spirit is already reflected in our practices. However, we continue to make a group-wide effort to become a higher-quality company trusted by society.

On February 15, 2011, Daiwa Securities Group employees exchanged opinions on why SRI has not taken off in Japan as well as future challenges and possibilities. * Positions are those held at time of discussion SRI a return to basics for valuing Tanaka: My approach to SRI incorporates an NPO perspective, as I am a director at an NPO bank in a companies; yet to gain popularity, private capacity. I also take into consideration the direct momentum effects on society. For the first time, we have been able to establish a fund that contributes directly to society by Moderator: What are your impressions of SRI in channeling capital straight to microfinance institutions. your work? I would like to create a structure in which we are able to Kikuchi: I have been involved in SRI since we contribute directly to social objectives through core established our Eco Fund in March 2006. The strongest operations, like this microfinance fund. impression I have of managing SRI funds is that it Yanagisawa: I believe institutional investors have constitutes a return to basics. It is a fund manager’s job become aware of concepts such as CSR and ESG to gauge companies’ value. Rather than just looking at through seminars for institutional investors and profits, SRI gives us the opportunity to revisit corporate IR officers. However, their views and what companies’ characteristics and strengths, which are the they put into practice differ widely. source of those profits. Saito: Right now, the sales teams are putting effort into Suzuki: I also see SRI as a return to basics. Among the selling microfinance funds. It seems that the importance variety of factors that need to be considered in of such funds is now much better appreciated. But it evaluating companies’ profit are ESG activities that seems that, in contrast to the sales staff’s high sense of could present risks. With investors now using a broader purpose, awareness of SRI is still limited among range of factors to evaluate companies, I think the individual investors. importance of environmental and social factors is growing. Sluggish Japanese issues one reason SRI not growing; this offers potential for breakthrough Moderator: Why do you think SRI hasn’t caught on in Japan? Yanagisawa: One possible reason, for products centered on the stock of Japanese firms, exists at a more basic level than SRI—the prolonged unpopularity of Japanese issues. Katsuya Kikuchi Senior Fund Manager, Equity Management Department, Daiwa Asset Management Co. Ltd. 17 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Kikuchi: Japanese stocks have been among the most Moderator: The word “SRI” gives the wrong sluggish in major global markets for the past five years. impression, as many people have been saying. I think it But a focus on SRI could trigger renewed interest. In gives the impression that you sacrifice your own returns Japan, the environmental and social components of to contribute to society. ESG still tend to be viewed in terms of costs, but it is Tanaka: None of the SRI funds I have designed have quite likely this is exactly where firms’ unrecognized even slightly sacrificed returns. Unfortunately though, efforts lie. The SRI perspective could be the catalyst for SRI funds as a whole have not performed well. Many an end to the despair enveloping Japanese companies. funds concerned with global warming set up before the Suzuki: ESG factors certainly come into play in the low global financial crisis have declined steeply since the valuations of Japanese issues.

Yanagisawa: We have the responsibility to provide Recently announced requirements by the Tokyo proper explanations to individual investors to help them Stock Exchange for reporting on governance and the understand financial products and make investment possible reform in the presentation of financial decisions. Yet the fact is that SRI is still not widely statements means new information will be available for understood or even known. evaluating companies. This should provide more fertile ground for investment decisions incorporating ESG considerations. Presentation of information, ambivalence of term “SRI”; further improvements necessary Suzuki: There is probably some ambivalence about the term “SRI.” I think it tends to lead to misconception that the products give more weight to social contributions and disregard investment returns, creating hesitation among investors seeking to maximize their investment gains. Naoko Saito Senior Managing Director, Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. 18 Still, if fund managers at representative institutional investors such as GPIF1 and influential pension funds refer to SRI factors when selecting stocks, I think it will have a domino effect and instantaneously change the environment. Suzuki: I believe most investors’ true opinion is that performance is everything in managing funds, but I think that investment gains are not limited to just performance, but also the positive feedback the investment creates. People that invest for such feedback are probably interested in generating positive returns for society rather than being purely money-orientated. I Hiroshi Suzuki think SRI will spread when investors consider profits Senior Researcher, Environment and CSR Research Section, that cannot be measured numerically. Capital Market Research Department, Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd. Saito: That said, it remains the case that investors exist Kikuchi: I have recently become painfully aware of the because there are profits to be made. On the other hand, need for a change in the way information is presented. we have recently witnessed the social phenomenon of For example, I feel investment sentiment has been people spontaneously sending school backpacks to frozen by overblown claims about the dire orphanages around Japan. I think this shows that people consequences for the earth of not reducing CO2 need to feel connected with others even in a so-called emissions. I believe information should be presented in fragmented society. By explaining in simple words to a way people can relate to—indicating how intertwined individual investors that connecting with society is a our daily lives and companies’ activities are with social contribution and that participation in society can global issues. occur through investment, we can probably create a win-win relationship, which will probably help Consideration of non-financial spread SRI. Tanaka: Customers can directly relate to the gains to expand SRI microfinance funds I am currently selling. I think there is extremely strong potential demand for the funds Moderator: Daiwa held a seminar for institutional among customers ranging from individuals with a investors and invited representatives from the Japanese strong interest in the market to business investors.

Yanagisawa: The guidelines relate to pension funds, much expected of financial which is, in a broad sense, workers’ capital. Aimed at institutions establishing workers’ governance over the funds, they call for ESG considerations to be incorporated into Moderator: The lack of financial education in Japan decision making, and performance monitored and means many people believe making money is the followed up. While most participants responded antithesis of contributing to society. However, the two positively, some were negative. Naturally, some asset are compatible and using money meaningfully can build management companies insisted that performance is a sustainable society.

The performance in a month or two. composition of stakeholders is unique in that the 19 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 financial sector is grouped separately from other companies. This stems from the idea that financial institutions, which are responsible for money flow, act as infrastructure. To me, this shows that there are extremely high expectations of financial institutions to give meaning to money flow. I received the extremely strong impression that actors from non-financial sectors such as government, NPOs and NGOs, consumer groups, and labor organizations expect financial institutions to redirect money flows and gradually change the world through proactive initiatives and the creation of frameworks such as impact investing. Shiko Yanagisawa 2 Multi-stakeholder Forum on Social Responsibility for a Sustainable Future: Please Managing Director, Global Equity Sales, see page 22. Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. Ltd. Examples of successful group However, I think we need to raise awareness even coordination; the shortcut to within the Daiwa Securities Group, as there are spreading SRI variations in the understanding of, and interest in, SRI even in our company. Moderator: What should the Daiwa Securities Group do Saito: I strongly feel that we need to make a to spread SRI? coordinated effort to create examples of win-win Kikuchi: I think it is extremely important to broaden investments generating profit for investors, employees, the range of products offered.

I think we should therefore effective way of communicating information. Also, we also facilitate positive communication between should provide basic information such as an investors and companies. explanation of impact investing rather than just product Yanagisawa: I think it is also important to offer information, using whatever means possible to investors information on companies that are at the coordinate information between group companies and leading edge of socially responsible activities, but steadily pump out information. whose initiatives are not widely known, and educate Tanaka: I want to continue steadily developing funds equity analysts who carry out corporate research. that benefit investors and play a useful role in business. Suzuki: In my opinion, when we provide information to institutional investors, we need to indicate how changes in society affect individual companies’ value. The most powerful way to appeal to investors would be to provide examples of successful investments in which positive social returns rebounded in investment gains. Still, because there are as many examples of failure as success, it would also be acceptable to urge customers to make such investments with an understanding of this overall picture.

Finance is closely intertwined with our daily lives. We come into contact with it every day, for example, through banks, securities companies, insurance companies, and state pensions. Despite this, there are likely few people concerned about the ways money entrusted to financial institutions (deposits, insurance, shares, pension reserves) is used. We undertake various educational activities to inform investors and depositors that money has meaning and the power to move society and companies to action. We use lectures at high schools and universities as well as various bodies’ venues for communicating with the public to teach financial literacy and the philosophy of finance, broadening understanding of SRI.

We consider strong trusting relationships with customers, shareholders, employees and society― as expressed by our corporate principles―foundational to the ongoing fulfillment of this mission and continuous growth. Role and Social Responsibilities of the Financial Industry The Daiwa Securities Group is a leader in the financial industry, and plays a vital social role by building a bridge between, on the one side, the need of companies to raise capital or the need of governments to finance public works projects, and on the other side, the need of individual and institutional investors, pension funds, and others for efficient investment. On the fund-raising side, the Group provides advice and assistance in implementation for companies raising money for capital expenditures and R&D, as well as for national governments, local governments, international institutions and public corporations seeking to raise funds for public works projects. It does so by issuing marketable securities such as stocks and bonds, and by creating other securitized products. On the investment side, the Group provides appropriate investment information and advice tailored to each customer's situation and goals. It offers a comprehensive and diverse line-up of financial instruments and services to meet the various needs of individual and institutional investors as well as pension funds. The Group links demand for funds to fund supplies through the financial and capital markets, primarily, and facilitates the smooth flow of money so that it can circulate as the lifeblood of the economy. This, in turn, helps to develop industries and resolve social issues. External Initiatives Using Finance to Resolve Social Issues The business sector plays an important role in enhancing the sustainability of society. Financial institutions have a social mission to make the most of their core capacities to contribute to sustainable social development. At the Daiwa Securities Group, we believe that our role is not only to maintain and develop an equitable and dynamic financial market, but also to reflect a socially conscious perspective in finance and facilitate the flow of money to build sustainable societies. On the basis of this philosophy, the Daiwa Securities Group is a signatory to UNEP FI,1 PRI2 and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), 3 fulfilling this role as an upstanding member of the international community. In January 2010, the Daiwa Securities Group became the first Japanese securities company to sign the United Nations Global Compact (GC), 4 a platform to help companies that have committed to sustainable and responsible business practices shape their policies. The Group pursues business 1 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents activities consistent with the UN Global Compact. Further, in line with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),5 the Group is endeavoring to develop products and services that help resolve social issues. 1 United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) UNEP FI is a partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme, which is a UN organization, and financial institutions around the world. Based on the recognition that the money handled by the financial industry has a major impact on the world, this initiative pursues better ways of doing business, taking into account the environment and sustainability, and seeks to spread and encourage this commitment. 2 Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) PRI is an investor initiative in partnership with UNEP Finance Initiative and the UN Global Compact. This initiative seeks to encourage and promote responsible lending and investing practices which take environmental and sustainability issues into account. 3 Carbon Disclosure Project This project is an affiliation of institutional investors concerned about climate change who demand that companies disclose information about their stance on environmental problems and initiatives addressing such problems. 4 UN Global Compact The UN Global Compact was established in 2000 under the UN Secretariat after an initiative launched in 1999 by then-Secretary General Kofi Annan. The membership consists of global corporate leaders who are expected to align their business practices with ten principles in the fields of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption in their business activities, in partnership with UN agencies, labor, and civil society. 5 United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) The MDGs consist of eight goals that 189 representatives from UN Member States, including 147 heads of state, participating in the UN Millennium Summit held in New York in September 2000, designated as 21st century goals for the international community, with a target date of 2015. 2 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR報告書2011 webサイ CSR REPORT 2011 トのみの掲載事項 Web-only contents CSR Report 2011 Management Report CSR Management Approach and Basic Stance The Daiwa Securities Group has four corporate principles: building customer trust, valuing human resources, contributing to society and earning sound profits. To live up to these principles, the Group strives to encourage a rich awareness of CSR among executives and employees. This is the key to ensuring that everyone at Daiwa acts in line with the greater good in all of their daily work. The Group is proactive in holding dialogues with external stakeholders, and reflects their feedback in its activities. CSR Promotion System The CSR Group of the Corporate Communication Department at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. compiles information in external meetings and actively holds dialogues to ensure that feedback from a wide range of stakeholders is reflected in the Group's activities. The section then shares this information in department head meetings and departmental liaison meetings at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and throughout the Group, and also treats CSR-related issues as business issues requiring solutions. The section also provides lectures on CSR during the Group's new hire training to increase awareness of CSR, and shares information on CSR activities with branches throughout Japan and major overseas sites.

The Group is developing an agile, efficient corporate governance system whose transparency meets global standards. Corporate Governance System With the aim of ensuring efficient management and thorough corporate governance, in 1999 the Daiwa Securities Group became the first publicly listed Japanese company to make the move to a holding company system. In addition, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. adopted a committee system to accelerate decision making. Under this system, directors entrust certain decision-making authority to executive officers; the supervising function of the Board of Directors has been reinforced through the establishment of the Nominating, Audit and Compensation committees; and management transparency has been enhanced. The corporate governance system of the Daiwa Securities Group consists of: ･The Board of Directors, which serves a supervisory function, and the Nominating, Audit and Compensation committees; and ･The Executive Committee, which serves as the executive body; and the Group Risk Management Committee, the Disclosure Committee and the Group IT Strategy Committee, which are subcommittees of the Executive Committee; and ･The Group Internal Audit Committee, which serves as the internal audit body reporting directly to the CEO. Although the chairman of the Board of Directors is also an executive officer, he does not have any specific duties as an executive officer.

Takashi Hibino 6 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Supervisory function The Board of Directors consists of 12 directors, including five outside directors.* The Board of Directors determines key management policy and supervises executive duties. In order to perform this supervisory role from multiple viewpoints in accordance with the demands of society, the policy for selecting new board members states that candidates must have a strong sense of ethics and demonstrate initiative and leadership. Additionally, external directors are experts in such fields as executive management and accounting. In addition, the supervisory function of Daiwa Securities Group Inc. is reinforced by the Audit Committee and the Office of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee, which consists of a majority of outside directors,* plays a pivotal role in the supervision of executive duties. The Audit Committee is assisted by the Office of the Audit Committee, which is an independent department. * Outside directors as defined by Article 2-15 of Japan's Companies Act. Executive body The Executive Committee, consisting of 14 executive officers, is operated by Daiwa Securities Group Inc. The Executive Committee discusses and makes decisions regarding executive management, including the business strategy of the Group as a whole and Group-wide management issues. The Executive Committee has been entrusted with the greatest possible level of decision-making authority by the Board of Directors and holds monthly meetings, in principle. Some of the executive officers of Daiwa Securities Group Inc. also serve as directors in major Group companies in order to secure efficient and effective department strategies based on the overall Group strategy and from the perspective of Group management. Preventing conflicts of interest between group companies Conflicts of interest between group companies can occur in situations such as intra-Group trading. The Daiwa Securities Group applies rules regarding conflicts of interest stipulated by Japan's Companies Act to Executive Committees. Conflicts of interest within the Group are prevented through a rule prohibiting an executive officer from voting when he or she is also the director of an interested group company. Internal Control With the implementation of the internal control and reporting system for financial reports, all Daiwa Securities Group companies have executed the documentation of standards in three areas: companywide control, business process control, and general IT control. Regulations for the internal control and reporting system and related regulations were amended accordingly. Based on these regulations, Group companies' internal control divisions take the lead in evaluating the effectiveness of internal control, while the evaluation results are confirmed in councils at each Group company and reported to Daiwa Securities Group Inc. After these reports are received, the Group Internal Audit Committee discusses them and makes decisions and, based on these decisions, the Disclosure Committee determines the effectiveness and validity of the system. Taking the report on the results into account, the CEO and the CFO draw up an internal control report and only then declare to investors and other stakeholders that financial reporting is accurate. In fiscal 2010, the Committee revised the internal management system regulations related to risk so that they would be more closely aligned with global standards. 7 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Risk Management Appointment of CRO and Establishment of GRM Department In April 2010, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. established the Group Risk Management Department to manage the Group's overall risk exposure more comprehensively and directly, and also created the position of Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to oversee the department. Business Continuity Plan In anticipation of possible damage to its sales branches or head office/head office functions and/ or data center due to social infrastructure shutdowns caused by earthquakes, fires, storm and flood damage, and abnormal weather, as well as serious outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as new strains of influenza, the Daiwa Securities Group drew up a business continuity plan (BCP) prioritizing important operations1 to be restored or continued in the event of a natural disaster, in order to keep the financial market functioning and protect customers' economic activities. In accordance with this plan, the Group will ensure the safety of customers and Group executives and employees and protect assets while continuing to pursue vital operations based on the public-interest aspect of its business as a financial services firm. Specifically, the Group has promoted the digitization of data necessary for its business operations to establish a state-of-the-art business continuity system in the financial industry. Equipped with Japan's highest-level backup center, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. has already completed the installation of thin client technology. 2 This enables the Group to easily switch to an alternate system in case the headquarters cease to function and thereby continue vital operations through a substitute office location. The Group immediately set up a crisis management headquarters after the Great East Japan Earthquake struck on March 11, 2011. The headquarters confirmed the safety of Group executives and employees and verified that all were unharmed, and also confirmed that there were no problems with setting up offices or system operations for the continuity of operations. By March 14, the following Monday, all branches were operating as usual, so that the Group was able to accommodate customers in afflicted areas who had lost their seals and Daiwa cards with services such as cash withdrawals. The Group will continue to enhance coordination between Group companies' BCP systems to prepare for accidents. 1 Priority operations to be restored or continued: 1. Market settlement of securities transactions contracted but not yet delivered 2. Payment operations 3. New orders from customers to sell or to liquidate long positions on margin transactions for the products below Domestic listed equities MRF (money reserve funds), MMF (money market funds), medium-term government bond funds Japanese government bonds for individual investors 2 Thin client: A technology for the storage and administration of the totality of data on a single server instead of 8 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents having individual employees control application software and files distributed among various terminals. This can streamline administration processes and costs while reducing operational risks. Information Security Management The Daiwa Securities Group has developed and maintains a sophisticated information security management system to protect its customers' personal information and other information assets from a wide range of security threats and handle this information appropriately. The Group has formulated a basic information security policy and a privacy policy to maintain its management system. In addition to technical information security measures, the Group implements security training for all executives and employees in accordance with the responsibilities of their posts. For group-wide organizational information security management, individuals responsible for information security at each Group company meet to discuss Group information security measures and report information security risks to the Group Risk Management Committee. In addition, to raise the level of information security, the Group operates in conformity with the Information Security Management System (ISMS). A number of Group companies have already obtained ISMS and Privacy Mark certification in accordance with their respective evaluation and certification systems. 9 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR Report 2011 Management Report Compliance Approach and Basic Stance Without stable, fair, and transparent financial and capital markets, economic prosperity and social progress are not possible. The Daiwa Securities Group takes its responsibility seriously to contribute to healthy markets which serve as vital social infrastructure. It works every day to accomplish this by fulfilling a market intermediary role. Most importantly, Daiwa recognizes that none of these vital functions are possible without a highly effective compliance framework and rigorous internal controls. Compliance Framework Daiwa Securities Group Inc. plays a central role in setting compliance policy for the entire Group. This is complemented by policies formulated by each Group company to comply with rules and regulations that apply to their specific line of business. For this reason, each Group company's compliance department plays a leading role in setting out detailed compliance regulations and measures. Daiwa Securities upgraded its internal administration supervisory system by ensuring that every single branch has a full-time position dedicated to this function. Moreover, to improve and enhance the quality of the company's sales operations to protect the interests of investors, the company took initiatives based on the PDCA cycle, augmented the manager confirmation system, and provided tools for sales employees. In addition, the company conducted a comprehensive inspection of internal rules and took steps to improve the effectiveness of sales branches while also alleviating their burdens. In its role as a gatekeeper for the market, the company also reinforced its initiatives to ensure market fairness and transparency, such as eliminating unfair trading and criminal elements. Daiwa Securities Capital Markets adjusted and reinforced its steps to accommodate the revisions made to Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The company adapted to regulations on disclosure of the sale of securities by revising client forms, reinforcing the management system and system for managing solicitation, strengthening the system for reporting to the Japan Securities Dealers Association, and revising the foreign securities account agreement. The company took steps to comply with the revisions to the procedure for changing the status of customers from professional investor to that of general investor by changing the application forms and authorization forms used when a professional investor returns to the status of a general investor, adjusted the deadline for the change, and devised new forms and revised forms to reflect the determination of the period to submit requests for a return to professional investor status. The company addressed regulations on alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by revising its regulations on dispute resolution and improving its system to address complaints, and also joined the Japan Securities Investment Advisers Association and concluded an agreement with the Japan Financial Services Association as part of its efforts to resolve complaints and other claims. As always, those responsible for compliance in each of the Group companies exchanged information in the corporate ethics liaison committee, and the Group's overall compliance framework was continuously maintained and promoted. 10 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Daiwa Securitiesʼ Compliance Framework Customers Person in charge of compliance (Head of Internal Administration Supervisors) Sales branches Compliance Department (compliance oﬃcer) Education and support Internal Sales supervisor administration supervisor Trade Surveillance Department Veriﬁcation, guidance and Reports oversight Information Security Office Branch inspection Sales branch employees Inspection Department Establishment of system to strengthen strategy for Asia Daiwa Securities Capital Markets is establishing and enhancing its global compliance system, with a particular focus on establishing a compliance system based on strengthening its strategy for Asia. In fiscal 2010, the company adopted a system of regional heads (RHs) who have the authority and responsibility to set up compliance systems in business regions. The company set up a Hong Kong control room to facilitate the establishment of a compliance system in the Asia and Oceania region, where business has expanded particularly rapidly, under the RH in charge of this region. In addition, the RH and CR for Asia and Oceania were assigned the following responsibilities when the positions were first created, but these operations could expand as business grows going forward. 1) Management of conflicts of interest in region 2) Management of insider information in region 3) Monitoring of proprietary account trading and employee trading in region 4) Operations related to reports on large shareholdings of stocks and other instruments 5) Compliance in research 6) Issues related to compliance in derivatives operations in Asia 11 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Systematic Measures to Avoid Involvement with Criminal Elements The Daiwa Securities Group avoids any involvement whatsoever with organized criminal elements. This is a key part of its commitment to earning trust and ensuring sound financial markets. The Group is taking a range of measures to reinforce its systematic measures for preventing any engagement with parties associated with organized crime in or outside of Japan. In 2008, the Group established a new basic policy governing its approach to avoiding involvement with organized criminal elements and began to execute it. The Group also follows the Guidelines for Corporations to Prevent Damage by Criminal Elements issued by the Japanese government in June 2007. In 2010, the Group established the Regulations Concerning Shut off of any Relationship with Criminal Elements, and ensures that these rules are scrupulously observed. In addition, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. took a central role in compiling information from Group companies, reviewing cases where contact may have been received from criminal elements, and holding interviews to assess the response. It also endeavored to improve effectiveness by exchanging information with public institutions to ascertain conditions and building up and establishing a database. With the JSDA's Regulations Concerning Shut off of any Relationship with Antisocial Forces, Daiwa Securities Capital Markets formulated new internal regulations and augmented and reinforced its system to ensure that its securities underwriting operations had no contact whatsoever from criminal elements. In addition, the company upgraded its system by setting up a database on criminal elements. Going forward, in addition to these measures to avoid involvement with criminal elements, the Group will strengthen its measures to avoid engagement with parties involved in unfair trading in the financial markets as well as those who may tolerate criminal elements. Basic Policy on Avoiding Any Involvement with Criminal Elements Basic Position To ensure fairness and the sound development of the securities market and protect our customers and staff, the Daiwa Securities Group is creating a framework to eliminate the influence of organized crime groups, gang members, corporate extortionists and other criminal elements and taking systematic measures to avoid all ties with such elements. 1. T he Daiwa Securities Group will not carry out any transactions whatsoever with criminal elements. 2. If it is determined that parties already having transactions with the Daiwa Securities Group are criminal elements, we will swiftly take appropriate measures to terminate dealings with them. 3. The Daiwa Securities Group will provide no funds to criminal elements. 4. T he Daiwa Securities Group will accept no unfair demands from criminal elements. If it is determined that an unfair demand has been made by criminal elements, we will take legal action in the civil or criminal courts against the party making the demand. 5. The Daiwa Securities Group establishes close cooperative relationships with outside parties such as the police force, the National Center for the Elimination of Boryokudan (organized crime groups), legal experts and others. 12 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Compliance Training Daiwa Securities Group companies provide regular training and testing to improve compliance awareness and ensure that all employees embrace Daiwa's commitment to corporate ethics. These efforts are the foundation of employees' own efforts to ensure total compliance. The Daiwa Securities Group holds numerous compliance training sessions, making full use of e-learning technologies. Daiwa Securities gives the All Branch Unified Compliance Assurance Test to all sales employees every six months. In addition, various training programs were given with an emphasis on knowledge of insider trading regulations, essential knowledge when working with customers deemed to be insiders, knowledge on management of corporate information and knowledge on sharing information. Retired police officers from the Trading Investigation Division came to the company to give talks with the aim of ensuring people knew what to do if they received any contact from criminal elements. In addition, new hires and newly appointed managers receive compliance education, training and group training, as well as a wide range of training emphasizing practical aspects. In addition to the training based on annual plans, Daiwa Securities Capital Markets provided training to employees in charge of reviewing advertisements and other documents, as well as company-wide training on firewall regulations. In addition, all employees (about 2,000) were given compliance training, including a knowledge test, using e-learning. Corporate Ethics Hotline Since January 2003, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. has been operating a Corporate Ethics Hotline through which employees can report problems in the workplace directly to a corporate ethics officer or an outside lawyer. When the hotline is contacted, the Daiwa Securities Group Inc. corporate ethics officer, in cooperation with the internal control officers at each Group company, carries out a factfinding investigation, while taking steps to protect the caller. The Corporate Ethics Hotline was contacted 18 times in fiscal 2010, three times fewer than in the previous fiscal year. The Group is conducting training to ensure anyone can use the Corporate Ethics Hotline without hesitation and is making efforts to respond as quickly as possible when calls are received. This has led to a broadening of the potential user base, and the hotline is now very well known within the Group and is considered reliable owing to the success of these efforts. Regardless of measures used to solve problems from here onward, the Group is taking steps to expand training about the hotline so that it can work more effectively than ever before as a deterrent to prevent problems before they occur.

As a member of the financial industry, the Group strives to attain a high level of information disclosure, to be a model for other publicly listed companies. Going beyond financial information, the Group is strengthening its disclosure of nonfinancial information related to social and environmental issues, progress on which is not necessarily represented by short-term financial indicators. Disclosure Policy ●We will observe the fair and timely disclosure of important financial, social and environmental information ( management-related information ) regarding the Daiwa Securities Group so that our stakeholders (including shareholders, investors and the communities we operate in) may understand and maintain realistic expectations of the Daiwa Securities Group. ●W e will comply with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and other laws and ordinances related to securities transactions and the various rules of the stock exchanges on which our stock is listed. ●We will endeavor to achieve fair disclosure both in terms of content and timing. ●W e will utilize various communication channels including presentations, telephone conferences, the Internet and printed materials in order to disclose information in a manner that is easy to comprehend for investors. ●We will consciously act as a leader of the securities markets in terms of disclosure and set the standards for all other listed corporations. ●W e have established the Daiwa Securities Group Inc. Disclosure Regulations, which define guidelines such as the setting up of a disclosure committee and the methods of disclosing management-related information, in order to fulfill the spirit of this Policy. Information Disclosure System Daiwa Securities Group Inc. has created Disclosure Regulations in order to achieve its Disclosure Policy. Its Disclosure Committee, a subcommittee of the Executive Committee, is responsible for final decisions regarding disclosure in accordance with these regulations. Group companies also create rules for controlling the release of management-related information, following a uniform disclosure system created for the entire Group. Group companies collect and report information to Daiwa Securities Group Inc. without fail, including posting management-related information contact lists on the in-house network. 14 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Flow of management-related information Information disclosure (excluding ﬁnancial information) Flow of ﬁnancial information Daiwa Securities Group Inc.

The Group uses a wide range of IR tools so that its information disclosure is fair, appropriate, and succinct, thus ensuring that there are no disparities in the information available to institutional investors and individual investors. Moreover, the Group regularly updates the content of its IR site and strives to make it as accessible as possible. Disclosure of Non-Financial Information The Group is committed to disclosing non-financial information to all stakeholders to promote understanding of the Daiwa Securities Group and ensure that the Group is accurately assessed. In fiscal 2010, the Group took the initiative in explaining its efforts to strengthen its business in Asia, its most important strategy, together with its financial information. In addition, in publications such as annual reports and business reports and during company briefings, the Group proactively discloses information on initiatives that serve as models for Japan's leading companies, such as the social impact of impact investment products, work-life balance, the promotion of success for women, and social contributions. In addition, the CSR report is distributed to everyone who attends the general shareholders' meeting to deepen understanding of the Group's social responsibilities. Annual Report http://www.daiwa-grp.jp/english/ir/annualreport/index.cfm 15 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR Report 2011 Social Report Relationship with Customers Approach and Basic Stance We understand that customer trust is the foundation of our business, and we always work to identify approaches that will truly satisfy our customers. At the Daiwa Securities Group, we have built the concept of hospitality into our understanding of service to give new life to customer relations. Our goal is nothing less than having the most satisfied customers in the financial services industry. Building Even Deeper Trust in Relationships with Customers Accountability to customers We strive to understand the customer's needs quickly, propose the best solution for each customer, and provide more-than-satisfactory services. We also work to provide customers with complete, appropriate explanations. Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Law, which went into effect in September 2007, prohibits solicitation that is improper in light of the customers' knowledge, experience, financial situation and objective. This law forms the basis of Daiwa Securities' approach, but the company also provides explanations that go beyond the legal requirements to demonstrate true hospitality in its product descriptions. When selling impact investment products that help resolve social issues, such as Vaccine Bonds and Water Bonds, Daiwa Securities explains how the customer will be contributing to society by buying the product, in order to deepen their understanding of social contributions. Active post-sales follow up A securities company's true relationship with the customer begins after a product has been sold. Follow-up is essential in maintaining and strengthening the trusting relationships formed with the customer. In particular, customers are dissatisfied and apprehensive when the value of a product that they have purchased goes down. Daiwa Securities constantly works to reinforce its relationship of trust with the customer by giving attentive explanations and relevant proposals that succeed in alleviating this dissatisfaction and concern. Providing information in seminars and on the web In addition to the investor seminars that Daiwa Securities holds once every month, usually attended by over 100 people, and the information on overseas and Japanese markets it provides on an ongoing basis, Daiwa Securities holds impromptu seminars on the foreign currency market when the market fluctuates sharply, as when the yen appreciated significantly. In January 2011, Daiwa Securities held its New Spring Follow-up Seminar, with about 3,700 customers attending. The company also proactively disseminated information on its website by holding live 16 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents seminars on the Internet and issuing reports released by investment trust companies. These initiatives are part of Daiwa Securities' efforts to ensure that customers can easily access information. The company will continue to actively hold seminars as part of its ongoing efforts to provide information, and will also provide timely content based on market conditions and trends. Follow-up services for impact investment products Daiwa Securities provides customers who buy Vaccine Bonds with the activity reports released by IFFIm, the issuer of these bonds. The company believes that it is also important to provide information on how the money invested in impact investment products, which enable customers to give back to society through their investments, is used to solve social problems. Initiatives in fiscal 2010 Beginning in fiscal 2010, some employees responsible for customer interaction at retail sites were assigned to follow-up services for the customers handled by the sales staff. This system increases contact with customers. Daiwa Securities always works to develop the structures needed to provide customers with fine-tuned services. Services accessible to diverse customers When Daiwa Securities renovates sales branches nationwide or plans new branches, it takes steps to ensure that its branches can be used by a wide range of customers, such as eliminating steps up and down on the floor and installing wide counters. In addition, the company explains services using written communication and introduces its Internet banking services to deaf customers. Daiwa's Point Program Daiwa's Point Program awards customers with points based on their transactions, which can be exchanged for products and cash vouchers or used to make donations to NPOs. Daiwa Securities launched a donation program for the Great East Japan Earthquake using points awarded through the Daiwa Point Program on March 18, 2011. Customers can donate as little as one point to the cause. Their donations were provided in full to victims of the earthquake through the NGO Japan Platform. Improving customer service quality at sales branches Many different types of customers visit Daiwa Securities' sales branches. This means that employees interacting with customers at its sales branches must have high-caliber service skills with an emphasis on attentiveness to the customer, in addition to specialized knowledge of the market and products. Daiwa Securities provides hospitality training when employees first enter the company to help them learn about its hospitality standards, which go beyond simply providing service. In addition to basic 17 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents training, the company gives more practical training involving role plays of various situations. In addition to group training, the company gives regular verification tests on an ongoing basis using its e-learning system. Daiwa Securities' head office staff conduct on-site checks every six months and provide guidance to achieve even higher quality. Initiatives Make Use of Customer Views Call Center initiatives Daiwa Securities' Call Center is staffed by 450 telephone service representatives (TSRs)* who take orders, describe products, and handle queries about clerical procedures or requests for sales literature. The Call Center is one of the main channels supporting the company's business model, which is driven mostly by the Daiwa Consulting and Daiwa Direct transaction channels. At the Call Center, employees have direct contact with customers, and so the Center plays a critical role in areas such as transaction channels, customer support and marketing that can lead to improved operations through customer feedback. The company implements training and regular level checks for TSRs* in order to maintain and improve call center operations to meet the demand for high-quality service. The Center uses the customer inquiries and opinions that it receives to analyze data and identify each cause when there are problems. By providing feedback and information to Daiwa Securities' head office and sales branches, the company seeks to improve services and customer interaction and raise customer satisfaction. * TSR (Telephone Service Representative) is the name typically used in Europe and the US to refer to telephone operators with specialized knowledge.

The Center shares the customer feedback it receives with Daiwa Securities' sales branches and head office and responds promptly and appropriately. The volume of calls and complaints received at the Center in fiscal 2008 increased compared to the previous fiscal year, which was primarily attributable to the deterioration of market conditions. However, in fiscal 2009 and 2010, the volume of calls and complaints has been declining. The Center takes customer feedback seriously, and the entire company works together to improve customer service.

Accordingly, we work to provide all investors with helpful information that is easy to understand.

We are also using a wide range of methods to reinforce communication with a wide range of investors. Investor Relations http://www.daiwa-grp.jp/english/ir/index.cfm Shareholder Reward Program Beginning in September 2010, we enhanced our shareholder reward program while continuing our reward program catalogue. We added more shareholder reward categories and made it easier for shareholders to apply to the program. 23 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR Report 2011 Social Report Relationship with Executives and Employees Approach and Basic Stance The Daiwa Securities Group believes that maximizing the motivation of every executive and employee will improve customer satisfaction and thus enhance shareholder value. We aspire to be a corporate group where executives and employees are highly motivated and their families and friends share in their pride to be part of the Group. We take a range of measures to achieve this goal. With the aim of making our employees the most highly qualified in the industry, we offer training for all occupational abilities and stages, and we focus on certifications and improving English skills with a support system that encourages the ambitions of every employee. In 2008, the Group issued Daiwa Spirit, a booklet about what it means to be a Daiwa professional. This was developed based on the corporate principles and expresses the basic philosophy and mental attitudes valued by the corporate culture since the foundation of the Group. Daiwa Spirit is shared with all Group employees and is expected to enhance employees' sense of unity and togetherness, and thus the Group's cohesiveness.

All new college graduates hired by the Group, including persons with disabilities, are brought on as full, regular employees. This helps to encourage new hires to feel a sense of trust and pride in the company and a sense of solidarity with their colleagues. In April 2011, the Group hired 446 new employees. Our approach to retaining talented people is simply to provide an environment in which diverse individuals can perform to their full potential. In line with the Group's strategy to strengthen our business in Asia, Daiwa Securities Capital Markets in particular is bolstering its workforce in Asia. Our hiring policy in Japan also takes in to account candidates' linguistic skills to secure personnel who will be able to perform on the global stage.

We hope to secure diverse personnel by recruiting year-round so that such graduates can be employed soon after receiving tentative job offers, regardless of whether they have prior work experience. These recruits receive the same level of training as new graduates. Support for the success of veteran employees The Daiwa Securities Group offers the Daiwa Master Program to actively support the success of highly motivated and skilled employees, regardless of their age. This system enables veteran employees nearing the mandatory retirement age of 60 who meet certain criteria to continue their employment until they are 65 years of age. We revised the system in 2009 to refine the criteria even further.

Recruitment of people with disabilities The Daiwa Securities Group has around 200 employees with disabilities working in a wide range of roles at its headquarters, in sales branches, and in call centers. The group started recruiting new graduates with disabilities as regular employees (general office staff) in fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2011, broadened recruitment into the career-track employee, regional career track employee, and customer service employment streams. We actively increased recruitment opportunities, holding briefings about the company for new graduates, participating in career expos, and implementing job placement support programs for disabled university students. Once people with disabilities are hired, we provide support for career advancement, for example creating opportunities for them to enter the career-track and regional career-track employment streams. The Daiwa Securities Group began hiring new graduates with disabilities as regular employees beginning in fiscal 2008. We hired 7 new graduates with disabilities in April 2008, 15 in April 2009 and 5 in April 2010. We seek to hire talented people, regardless of whether they have disabilities or not. Beginning with our 2011 new hires, we will hire persons with disabilities for career-track positions, regional career-track positions and customer service positions. The goal is to hire high-caliber employees, not just to meet Japan's legally mandated employment rate for persons with disabilities, thus providing a bigger stage on which persons with disabilities can advance their careers, take advantage of opportunities and stay highly motivated to succeed.

In particular, we believe that the first two years after joining the Group―when new graduates are just getting their start as full members of society and Group employees―is a critical period for a solid basic education. We offer extensive training programs during this period. Our varied training options ensure not only that employees acquire the fundamental skills needed for their jobs, but also that they learn about the Group's corporate philosophy and commitment to CSR. We continue to undertake initiatives to improve the English skills of employees. With globalization, the Group increasingly invests in overseas subsidiaries, and employees are more likely to be transferred within the Group. Thus, strengthening English skills is a crucial issue not only for Daiwa Securities Capital Markets employees, who often work in overseas-related operations, but also for Daiwa Securities employees focused on operations in Japan. We will continue to augment our efforts in this area in the future. Of course, we also believe that our employees must have a firm understanding of corporate ethics and compliance in order to ensure the development of sound financial and capital markets―a key issue for the Daiwa Securities Group. Accordingly, we offer regular training on information management and compliance. Education and training system The Daiwa Securities Group educates employees by providing training tailored to each position, based on the Group's shared policies. Each company provides its own training in light of the different skills required depending on the company's focus. However, the Group also strives to foster crosscutting ties and a feeling of solidarity by increasing the number of joint training sessions for the Group and opportunities for employees from Group companies to gather together while also raising the effectiveness of the training. For example, the Group offers selective management training for managers through programs such as the Daiwa Management Academy and Daiwa Leadership Program, and also provides joint training for mid-level employees to acquire business skills with programs designed to enhance their skills in the areas of presentation, coaching, negotiation, communication, logical thinking and facilitation. Daiwa Securities launched the Daiwa Mentoring Program in July 2009, a two-year intensive basic educational program for new hires. The company has introduced a tutor system in which each new hire is assigned to another employee who will be in charge of their education for the first year of their employment. The new hires are given focused education and training so that they can become independent in their first two years. Supporting employees trying to earn credentials In light of globalization and corporate strategies emphasizing Asia, the Daiwa Securities Group strives to improve employees' English skills and helps employees raise their TOEIC scores. We offer a test support system, such as e-learning accessible to all employees. In addition, we offer more practical 27 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents e-learning opportunities and recommend English conversation and language schools to intermediatelevel learners. The number of Group employees taking the TOEIC exam more than doubled in fiscal 2010 over the previous fiscal year. In addition, Daiwa Securities aims to have all employees acquire Associated Financial Planner (AFP) certification and to have the highest number of employees in the industry with the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) certification, the level above AFP. In addition, the company provides generous support so that employees can enhance their specialized skills and become professionals by, for example, subsidizing certification costs.

Accordingly, we implement a multifaceted evaluation system for managers in which subordinates and related departments assess job performance in the course of daily operations and gives feedback to the manager. This is intended to deepen self-awareness and mutual understanding and improve the Group's overall productivity. This system also takes compliance-related performance into account. In fiscal 2009, we revised the Group's human resources system. Our aim is to provide a benefits program that motivates employees at all stages of their careers, from entry and mid-level to veteran employees, to reach the next stage and attain positions with greater responsibilities. We will continue working to ensure that our personnel evaluation system is equitable by clarifying the expected responsibilities for every position. Creating a Workplace Supportive of Work-life Balance Encouraging work-life balance An advanced level of work-life balance is one of the human resource strategies advocated in the Passion for the Best 2011 medium-term management plan, and the Daiwa Securities Group promotes work-life balance as part of its general management strategy. Individuals optimize their own sense of worth by devoting themselves wholeheartedly in both their lives and their work. This commitment enables each person to realize his or her potential, and also ensures values diversity in the workforce. This conviction drives the Group in its pursuit of working styles that enable work-life balance and its efforts to create an environment in which both men and women can work in a variety of ways. Not only do we seek to establish a system that enables diverse work styles, but we also work to change employee awareness by encouraging employees to leave work before 7:00 pm and take all their paid holidays and by welcoming family visits to the workplace. We will continue promoting initiatives designed to attract the kind of high-caliber employees who build an enterprise that achieves great performance. Encouraging women to succeed We are trying to appeal more to women's individual interests, by introducing thriving female employees as role models in internal publications and providing opportunities for cross-company communication, in order to increase the number of women in management positions. These efforts have resulted in five female directors joining the board and women heading up about 10% of branches since fiscal 2009. The number of women transferring to the career-track employee and regional career-track employee streams has also increased significantly. In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in female employees aspiring to advance their careers by switching to career-track and regional career-track positions. In fiscals 2009 and 2010, 682 female employees moved to career-track positions. We will continue to expand the ranks of female managers, aiming to develop female leaders who will drive the future of Japan's financial industry. 30 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Working Hours and Paid Vacation Usage Rate Fiscal year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Annual regular working hours (hours) 1845.0 1837.5 1837.5 1830.0 1837.5 Average monthly overtime hours (hours)1 26.2 25.2 21.3 22.1 24.0 Paid vacation usage rate (%) 36 37 57 56 54 Paid vacation usage rate (%) 45 47 64 60 58 (including special summer vacation)2 * This data pertains to three Group companies. 1 Figures indicate employees at the three companies who are members of the Daiwa Securities Group Employees' Union. 2 In addition to annual paid vacation, the Daiwa Securities Group offers three days of special summer vacation.

Initiatives to improve employee health The Daiwa Securities Group believes that employee health is an indispensable asset for both the company and society. Accordingly, the Personnel Departments, General Health Development Centers and health insurance associations work closely together to improve employee health. The Group has set up a system that enables employees to confirm the results and analysis of their regular health checkups and full medical checkups online. The Group also uses in-house magazines and the intranet to provide employees with health information. Moreover, it also offers a walking program, a program encouraging employees to undergo cancer exams, and a smoking cessation program, and encourages female employees to have breast cancer and uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancer exams, and to get the cervical cancer vaccination. Beginning in fiscal 2009, employees whose health checks found problems receive a follow-up confirmation form (known as a yellow paper ) enclosed with the results of the regular health checkup. Those employees are required to visit a medical facility within two weeks and submit this form to a General Health Development Center with the doctor's comments. As a result, the majority of such employees now visit medical facilities. The Daiwa Securities Group has set up General Health Development Centers at the main Group offices. At the centers, in-house doctors provide medical services, while industrial physicians and health nurses provide consultations on general health. Psychiatrists and clinical psychotherapists offer consultations 32 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents on mental health issues. As a result of these efforts, employees' health awareness is high, and 99% of employees receive regular health checkups. We gave presentations on these results at symposiums held by the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Other companies were interested in our approach. Mental Health In August 2006, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. established the Health Support Promotion Department to help employees maintain their mental and physical health. The Health Support Promotion Department is staffed with two certified clinical psychologists who are available to provide consultations to support Group executives and employees, and their families. Moreover, we maintain arrangements with outside specialists so that Group personnel and their families can receive prompt attention anywhere in Japan. We also support employees' mental health by arranging talks in all branches and departments to broaden awareness of mental health issues. Human Rights Awareness In light of our Corporate Principles and the United Nations Global Compact (which the Daiwa Securities Group joined in January 2010, a frontrunner in the industry), we aspire to further improve our corporate culture, which emphasizes respect for human rights in our basic principles, and are further reinforcing human rights awareness activities. With the aim of ensuring accurate understanding of human rights issues and deepening awareness, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. established a Human Rights Awareness Promotion Committee in 1984. Organizations are set up underneath this committee, with all heads of Group departments and branches serving as leaders, to follow the committee's plans by conducting campaigns such as soliciting human rights slogans from all Group employees and their families, as well as incorporating information ensuring accurate understanding of human rights issues in new hire training and manager training. Once a year, all Group employees watch a video on human rights and then divide up into their divisions to discuss the issue from a variety of organizational perspectives. We will continue to promote human rights awareness to ensure fair, discrimination-free hiring and help to build a gender-equal society. Basic policy for initiatives addressing human rights and social integration issues (1) T he Daiwa Securities Group supports and complies with the protection of human rights as advocated internationally and does not infringe on human rights within the limits of its influence. (2) T he Daiwa Securities Group educates and instructs Group employees with accurate information on human rights and social integration issues. (3) A t the same time, the Group views human rights and social integration issues as our own problem, not somebody else's problem, and fosters a sensitivity that enables empathy with the pain of others. (4) We provide an equitable working environment free of discrimination that values people. (5) Each employee is a member of society unburdened by prejudice. Revised in May 2011 33 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Communication Communication with executives and employees At the Daiwa Securities Group, we believe that communication with executives and employees is vital in maintaining a healthy workplace environment. Communication takes place through interviews with the Personnel Department and a semi-annual self-assessment questionnaire. In addition to the union member questionnaire given by the Employees' Union, in fiscal 2010 we conducted a questionnaire on work-life balance. We provide opportunities for employees to share their views, and then reflect these findings when reviewing the adequacy of current programs and revising programs in the future. Number of Employees' Union Members (as of the End of Each Fiscal Year) （persons） Fiscal year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Employees' union membership 6,078 6,969 7,666 7,915 7,590 * Of the 9 Group companies (this does not include Daiwa Asset Management Co. Ltd., which has its own employees' union, and Daiwa Property Co. Ltd., which has no employee union). Communication between employees In October 2007, we introduced a club activity support program. This program was intended to help employees enjoy their time off, deepen their friendships with colleagues and give them more opportunities to share a sense of solidarity, as well as to provide work-life balance support and facilitate a full social life for employees. In fiscal 2009, we augmented this program. Groups that meet certain conditions are recognized as Daiwa Clubs and Daiwa Circles and receive subsidies covering some of their activity costs. Currently, 14 clubs and 9 circles are active in the Group.

The Daiwa Securities Group has been collaborating with the Student Company Program (SCP) at Ritsumeikan Senior High School since fiscal 2003. By fiscal 2010, Daiwa had dispatched 18 employees on over 83 occasions as outside directors to offer advice on the preparation of financial data and Student Company Program on company management. As of March 2011, 174 students have acquired the basic skills needed to earn a living by learning about corporate management, how the world works, the difficulties of decision making, the pressure of the bottom line, accountability and the importance of leadership and teamwork. （3）Global Leadership Forum for Junior and Senior High School Teachers This is a training program organized by Junior Achievement Japan for junior and senior high school teachers, which started in 2001. At this forum, teachers discuss the state of the global economy and brainstorm about how education should develop in the 21st century, stimulated by lectures given by guests from a wide range of perspectives, panel discussions, and case studies. The Daiwa Securities Group sponsored the forum from 2003 to 2007, and has cooperated continuously in related events. By fiscal 2010, a total of 3,182 teachers had participated in the forum. （4）Council for Economic Education Japan (CEE-Japan) CEE-Japan was established in January 2009 with the goal of providing economic education programs for school teachers. The Daiwa Securities Group is CEE-Japan's main sponsor, providing not only the inaugural funds but also ongoing support, together with seven other influential companies. Under a partnership between Junior Achievement Japan and the Council for Economic Education in the US, we seek to implement programs tailored for schools in Japan. In June 2010, we completed the economy and finance text, Life is a Series of Choices . This text was developed so that teachers could instruct students in workshops on economic concepts in a way that would be easy for them to understand. In August, methods for using this text were introduced at the Global Leadership Forum for Teachers 2010, which drew about 450 participants. In January 2011, 22 teachers attended a two-day workshop in Shinagawa, and 30 teachers attended a two-night, threeday workshop held in February with guest lecturer Professor Tawni Ferrarini from Northern Michigan University. Boards of Education in other regions also held workshops, attracting 75 teachers. By the end of March 2011, a total of 577 teachers had participated in workshops and forums. 37 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Results in Economic and Financial Education Activity Description Started Participants A program that gives high school Support for the Student Company students hands-on experiences with September 174 Program (SCP)* corporate management by simulating 2003 real-world business conditions Personal finance planning workshop teaching students about society and June Support for Finance Park* 23,936 economics by managing household 2005 finances.

The lectures are funded by Daiwa Eco Fund Trust fees. A subject is chosen as the theme for each year's lectures, with the four-year program giving the participant an overall picture of sustainability. In the monthly lectures, people active on the cutting edge of their field, including university professors, researchers, corporate managers, businesspeople, NPO/NGO leaders and government administrators, present the concepts and practice of sustainability to students in a succinct and clear manner. The lectures are translated into English and distributed to 191 countries and regions around the world through the JFS website. After the lecture, participants enjoy an introduction to sustainable mail order and online purchasing practices with an opportunity to sample fair trade products and sweets made at social welfare facilities. The four-year program concluded in September 2010. Following up on this program, a new social business college was opened the following month. Daiwa JFS Youth Sustainability College http://www.japanfs.org/en/pages/022654.html Holding Social Business College lectures The idea of social businesses, which aim to resolve specific problems affecting society as well as to generate sustainable profits, has gained attention. However, social businesses themselves are not yet widely known. At the Daiwa Securities Group, we regard providing a forum for discussion of sustainable business models and financing as highly important. In October 2010 we began the Social Business College series of lectures for university students and adults. We hold the lectures in cooperation with Music Securities, a First Social Business College lecture 38 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents next-generation financial business providing financing to social businesses via the Internet, and we publish the proceedings and case studies on our website. http://www.daiwa-grp.jp/csr/citizen/support/college/backnumber.html (available only in japanese) The second lecture, held on December 7, was conducted by Eriko Yamaguchi, CEO, Motherhouse. Ms. Yamaguchi spoke frankly about making bags―of a quality acceptable to customers in advanced nations―in the developing nation of Bangladesh (which was not being reached by international aid) and her efforts to establish the company's brand. The lecture was received enthusiastically, with the audience empathetic and asking real questions about Motherhouse's business model. Future lectures will also highlight social businesses with a unique business model. We plan to hold over twelve lectures during the two years of the series, ending in September 2012. 1st: October 28, 2010 Lecturer: Natsuko Shiraki, President, HASUNA Co., Ltd. 2nd: December 7, 2010 Lecturer: Eriko Yamaguchi, CEO, Motherhouse Co., Ltd. 3rd: February 14, 2011 Lecturer: Yoshiteru Takemoto, CEO, tobimushi Inc. Describing how money relates to daily life, and the philosophy of finance Finance is closely intertwined with our daily lives. We come into contact with it every day, for example, through banks, securities companies, insurance companies, and state pensions. Despite this, there are likely few people concerned about the ways money entrusted to financial institutions (deposits, insurance, shares, pension reserves) is used. We undertake various educational activities to inform investors and depositors that money has meaning and the power to move society and companies to action. We use lectures at high schools and universities as well as various bodies' venues for communicating with the public to teach financial literacy and the philosophy of finance, broadening understanding of SRI. We actively engaged in financial education in fiscal 2010, holding lectures for students and working adults (at community colleges and the Junior Chamber International Osaka) on a sustainable society and the significance of money.

Participants' reactions such as, It was the first time I heard that money can be used to change society, and I would have thought of a more useful way to use my money if I had heard these things when I was a child, reiterated the importance of our educational activities. 2.Encouraging Volunteerism among Executives and Employees At the Daiwa Securities Group, executives and employees participate in volunteer programs and other community action, and these experiences broaden their perspectives and values. This, in turn, has a good influence on both their work and their lives. Volunteer activities include both activities that the Daiwa Securities Group plans and runs on its own initiative and joint activities undertaken in cooperation with the community and NPOs. We strive to create an environment that makes it easy for executives and employees to volunteer by setting up a recognition program for volunteers, among other incentives. Aiming to encourage as many Daiwa people as possible to participate in corporate citizenship initiatives, we will continue to collaborate with external NPOs, strengthen internal communications about volunteering, and create more opportunities for executives and employees to get involved. Volunteer Awards At Daiwa Securities, outstanding activities by executives and employees are recognized with the President's Award. The company also introduced the Volunteer Award in fiscal 2007, which is given twice a year to employees and groups involved in ongoing community volunteer activities. In the second half of fiscal 2009, Daiwa Securities Capital Markets included an award for social contribution activities in its Passion for the Best Awards. Unfortunately, there was no winner of this award in fiscal 2010. Executives and employees involved in social contribution, donation and recycling initiatives Group executives and employees organize sign language classes, help clean up after community events and participate in various campaigns for reusing and recycling valuable supplies. One such campaign involves collecting used and unused stamps, prepaid cards, partially used postcards and similar items to donate to NPOs. We will work even harder in the future to encourage executives and employees who are moving as a result of a job transfer to ensure their books and other items can be recycled. 40 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Donations from executives and employees in fiscal 2010 totaled ¥440,094, 8% down from fiscal 2009. The number of people voluntarily taking part in sign language classes increased to 2,322 people in fiscal 2010, a 1.5 % year-on-year decrease, while the number participating in volunteer activities on weekends or after work increased 22% over the previous year to reach 384 people. Main activities in fiscal 2010 Sign language classes Since 2000, the Daiwa Securities Group has held sign language classes for beginners in the Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya regions. These classes are intended to raise understanding of people with hearing impairments and popularize sign language, and are open to the general public as well as the Group's executives and employees. In fiscal 2010, 2,287 people participated nationwide. In the classes, participants who are aiming to reach a higher level are given information and referrals to sign language circles. The company also hopes that ongoing sign language studies will broaden its use. If the World Were a Village of 100 People Workshop The Daiwa Securities Group joined other companies in sponsoring a workshop entitled If the World Was a Village of 100 People at three venues (in Tokyo on September 21, 2010, in Nagoya on February 3, 2011, and in Osaka on February 4, 2011). Participants, including 49 people from the Group, were given a card showing the population breakdown by classification and linguistic roots, and food was distributed to highlight the gaps between rich and poor. This gave participants a personal experience of the world's disparities and diversity. Neighborhood clean-up events by Daiwa Securities Business Center Under its good corporate citizenship program, the Daiwa Securities Business Center has, since 2008, carried out clean-up activities covering the area from near the headquarters building to Toyocho Station on the third Friday of every month. Participants believe that keeping streets clean is a way of giving back to the community. This campaign is held from 8:00 am until 8:20 am before office hours start, and it has become a regular event. Moreover, the company participated in the first community clean-up organized by the Koto Ward Town Hall. In April 2010, the president and many other executives and employees cleaned the streets from the town hall to the Toyocho Center Building. The company will continue to participate as much as possible in community clean-up activities, and will work with the communities administering these programs to help keep the streets clean. 3.Support for Culture and the Arts The Daiwa Securities Group provides ongoing support for a wide range of cultural and artistic activities. For instance, in 2010, we supported the Design to Change the World Exhibition (MayJune), where product designs and projects that resolve the variety of issues confronting people living in developing countries were displayed, as well as the Global Festa Japan 2010 (October), an event introducing efforts to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), one of which is to halve global poverty by 2015. The Group was also the special sponsor of the Twenty-Second Central Contest for Book Review Painting for the seventeenth year, a tradition that began with the sixth contest. This contest for 41 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents elementary, junior and senior high school students awards prizes by age group to drawings that express their impressions of a book they have read. Exhibits of the winning drawings were held at 12 Daiwa Securities branches. We also support traditional Japanese cultural forms such as shogi and go. In addition to sponsoring the top title matches in shogi and go, the Meijin Title Match (shogi) and the Honinbo Tournament (go), since 2005, the Group is also the special sponsor of the Daiwa Securities Cup shogi and go Internet tournament. In shogi, we support the Saikyo Tournament and the Women's Saikyo Tournament. In go, we support four tournaments: the Open, the Ladies and Grand Champion Internet Tournament, as well as the Amateur Championship. These matches take place on the Internet year-round, and viewers can also watch the matches in real time on the Internet. The matches, which begin at 8 p.m. on weekend evenings, attract a strong following among not only Japanese fans but also shogi and go enthusiasts in other countries. New series of television commercials, Playing for Change Playing for Change is a musical project that aims to create motivation, build connections and make peace in the world through music. Mark Johnson, a producer and engineer working primarily on the West Coast of the United States, launched this project. The experience inspired him to bring musicians from around the world into this performance and connect the world through music. Over 100 musicians from around the world who were virtually unknown at the time collaborated in this project. Well-known music appealing to all generations and the project's original music were arranged to be performed together by these global musicians, resulting in a project that has moved many people. Part of the project's revenue goes to the NPO The Playing For Change Foundation (PFCF), which uses the money to provide necessities to refugees in India and Nepal and to establish music schools and art schools in South Africa, among other projects. The Daiwa Securities Group, recognizing that the building connections around the world concept advocated by this project is consistent with its goal of providing financial services that link its customers to the world, is using footage from the project in its television commercials. 4.Financial Assistance to Communities on Both the Local and the International Level through Foundations and NPOs Daiwa Securities Health Foundation The Daiwa Securities Health Foundation was established in 1972, in commemoration of the Group's 30th anniversary, to support medical research. Since 1973, the Daiwa Securities Health Foundation has supported 30 outstanding research projects focusing on improving the health, medical care and welfare of middle-aged and older people. It has disbursed ¥30 million in grants of ¥1 million each year. Fiscal 2010 marked the 37th year of this program, with a cumulative total of 1,012 recipients receiving ¥977 million in total. In addition, the Foundation decided to disburse ¥10 million in reconstruction assistance to support research by individuals and organizations such as universities, institutions and hospitals into topics 42 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents such as medical activities in disaster areas and disaster medical care. Daiwa Securities Health Foundation (available only in Japanese): http://www.daiwa-grp.jp/dsh/index.html Daiwa Securities Foundation The Daiwa Securities Foundation was established in 1994 in commemoration of the Group's 50th anniversary, with the mission of building a better world. The Foundation provides yearly grants for volunteer activities in the fields of welfare and medicine, and carries out educational activities to encourage volunteerism. These activities are intended to improve the public welfare by fostering an environment conducive to volunteer activities. By fiscal 2010, the Foundation had given a cumulative total of ¥557 million in Volunteer Activities Grants to 2,400 organizations. In fiscal 2011, in particular, the Foundation provided ¥35 million in Disaster Volunteer Activities Grant to support organizations and groups involved in volunteer work responding to the Great East Japan Earthquake. Daiwa Securities Foundation (available only in Japanese): http://www.daiwa-grp.jp/dsf/index.html The Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation in the UK The Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation is a UK charity that was established in 1988 with a generous benefaction from Daiwa Securities for the purpose of supporting a closer relationship between Britain and Japan. Principle activities include the following: (1) M aking grants available to individuals, institutions and organizations to promote ties between the UK and Japan in all fields of activity (2) Enabling British and Japanese students and academics to further their education by providing opportunities for joint research and supporting exchanges and other bilateral initiatives (3) A warding of Daiwa Scholarships for British graduates to study and undertake work assignments in Japan (4) Organizing a year-round program of events to increase the understanding of Japan in the UK Daiwa Foundation Japan House, the London-based headquarters, acts as a center for Anglo-Japanese relations in Britain by offering a wide range of seminars, exhibitions and book launches as well as meeting rooms for Japan-related activities and facilities for visiting academics. The Foundation is represented in Japan by its Tokyo Office, which provides local assistance to Daiwa Scholars (foreign students), administers grant applications from Japan and collaborates with other institutions that promote Anglo-Japanese relations. Since its inception, 135 students have been accepted from the United Kingdom. In addition, the Foundation has provided grants for a total of 2,517 projects, with grant-in-aid exceeding ¥2,075 million (as of March 2011). The Foundation has also decided to establish a £250,000 scholarship fund for Japanese students whose schoolwork and lives were affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake and are seeking to study for a period at an educational institution in the UK. 43 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents The Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation in the UK: http://www.dajf.org.uk/index_j.asp Daiwa Securities Group Tsunami Reconstruction Fund We established the Daiwa Securities Group Tsunami Reconstruction Fund on March 9, 2005 to provide recovery assistance to regions damaged in the Sumatra Earthquake and Indian Ocean Tsunami which occurred on December 26, 2004. Beginning in fiscal 2005, this fund provides long-term support for recovery over a ten-year period, disbursing ¥10 million annually for a total of ¥100 million. Established within the Asian Community Trust (ACT), the Daiwa Securities Group Tsunami Reconstruction Fund provides grants to local NGOs that offer assistance in the fields of mental health care for children, utilization of microfinance and provision of education opportunities for children in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and India, the three countries hardest hit by this disaster. Leveraging expertise in their respective areas, Asian Community Center 21 (ACC21), which functions as the executive office for ACT, undertakes program selection and activity monitoring, while the Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., acts as the custodian of this fund. There are three key characteristics to this fund. First, it provides long-term recovery assistance measures rather than offering temporary donations. Second, it utilizes financial systems to provide assistance through charitable trusts, microfinance and other avenues. And finally, the monitoring done by ACC21 makes it possible to assess every detail of the activities being conducted. The Asian Community Trust: http://www.acc21.org/act/english/act-aen-index.html Donations from SRI Fund's Trust Fees Daiwa SRI Fund Financial Assistance Program The Daiwa SRI Fund Financial Assistance Program gives grants to Japanese NPOs that provide support in fields involving human life (the human security field). Rather than supporting general projects and events, the program supports the human resource development of the NPOs that administer such activities. Aiming to build the capacity of NPO staff to address daily human security issues, the program subsidizes personnel and education costs. It is operated in collaboration with the NPO Civil Society Initiative Fund with donations from the trust fees of the Daiwa SRI Fund. Fiscal 2011 recipients of the Daiwa SRI Fund Financial Assistance Programs (available only in Japanese): http://www.civilfund.org/fund23.html Support for Kopernik Kopernik is a US-based NPO established in 2009 with the aim of improving quality of life and reducing poverty in developing countries; it went into full operation in Japan in 2010. Kopernik has developed a scheme that enables contributors in developed countries to select NPOs in a developing country and a product that they need (simple water purifiers, solar lamps, etc.) to donate. The status of the activities carried out by the NPOs receiving the donation is shown on the website, and the transparency of the donation's use is ensured. 44 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Some of the donations made by the Daiwa Eco Fund are used to cover Kopernik's administrative costs. Daiwa Asset Management and Daiwa Securities select the products and the recipients to receive donations in light of their consistency with the principles of the Daiwa Eco Fund. The way the donation will be used is clear and NGOs active on the ground can be supported directly, which means that we can give back to the community efficiently and accurately. Support for ISEP The Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies is an independent non-profit research organization established in 2000 with the aim of realizing sustainable energy policy. The organization is carrying out natural energy projects funded by citizens, such as Japan's first locally-financed wind turbine, named Hamakaze-chan. Donations from trust fees of the Daiwa Eco Fund were used to pay for the cost of preparing the Renewables Japan Status Report 2011, published by the organization in March 2011. This report earned high praise from related government agencies, researchers, universities and NPOs, and we are confident that supporting its ongoing publication is a very worthwhile endeavor. Daiwa CI Biodiversity Conservation Fund (DCBCF) The Daiwa CI Biodiversity Conservation Fund was established in November 2007 to work with the global environmental NGO Conservation International (CI) to carry out biodiversity conservation activities in the vicinity of World Natural Heritage sites in seven countries that have been selected from 34 areas called biodiversity hotspots.* The Daiwa CI Biodiversity Conservation Fund is operated with donations from the trust fees of the Daiwa Eco Fund. * Hotspot: Places where biodiversity is rich but greatly threatened (34 places). This term was coined by British biologist Norman Myers in 1988 to designate areas that should be given priority in conservation and preservation efforts. Daiwa-Russell-GEF Asia Project to Support the Transfer of Environmental Technology The Daiwa-Russell-GEF Asia Project involves the compilation and distribution of handbooks containing basic technologies from among those environmental technologies possessed by Japan that can be fully developed and operated using the materials and human resources of developing countries. The project is operated in cooperation with the Global Environmental Forum, operates a project funded from the trust fees of the Russell Global Environmental Technology Fund. In September 2010, the project issued the Handbook on Sewage Treatment Technology for Developing Countries, using Thailand as a model. Public Engagement Participation in Multi-stakeholder Forum on Social Responsibility as steering committee member The Multi-stakeholder Forum on Social Responsibility for a Sustainable Future, in which many bodies participate as equals, was established in 2008 with the aim of building a coordinated response to problems in society that cannot be solved by government alone. Katsuya Kikuchi, Senior Fund Manager, Daiwa Asset Management, participates in the forum, which includes business and consumer associations, labor unions, NPOs and NGOs, and government, as a representative of the financial sector and steering committee member (as of March 2011). In the forum's first two years, discussions centered on factors needed to create a safe and stable sustainable society. Hereon, the forum plans 45 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents to devise a coordinated strategy to create a safe and sustainable future and work on concrete actions spanning four issues: developing social infrastructure to nurture humanity, creating a society in which everyone can live together, participating in the resolution of global-scale problems, and developing sustainable communities.

Invests only in Japanese stocks to support strong Japanese companies and invigorate the Japanese economy. ■Future support Interest in building a sustainable economy has grown since the earthquake and accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant brought into focus sustainable energy and regional economies that take into consideration the surrounding environment and communities. We strive to offer companies and investors information spanning a wide range of perspectives such as the environment and CSR. There are many additional ways, such as the Daiwa Institute of Research's policy proposal, for the Daiwa Securities Group to contribute through capital markets. We plan to share our experiences in the reconstruction of Sumatra, using knowledge gained in our project supporting reconstruction after the 2004 tsunami2. We also plan to encourage employee's activities long-term by providing employee volunteer information through our intranet. 2 Daiwa Securities Group Tsunami Reconstruction Fund The Asian Community Trust: http://www.acc21.org/act/english/act-aen-index.html Initiatives Outside Japan Participation in Wall Street Run & Heart Walk 2010 in the US The Wall Street Run & Heart Walk 2010 is a charity event held to support the American Heart Association, which is engaged in efforts to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease and stroke. Cardiovascular disease and stroke are the first and third most common causes of death, respectively, in the US, with almost 1 million deaths per year attributable to these causes. On June 24, 2010, 15 employees of Daiwa Securities Group in Participation in charity run 47 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents the US and their families joined several thousand staff from other financial institutions for this event.

The first is Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, which is famous world-wide for its pediatric medical care. The company will also support Little Havens, a hospice for children that offers respite care, eases symptoms, and provides end-of-life care to children not expected to reach adulthood due to life-threatening illness. The Charity Committee sets up a system for funding, donations and staff enabling the company to accurately support needs. In fiscal 2010, events will be held throughout the year to support these two organizations. 48 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR Report 2011 Environmental Report Environmental Initiatives Approach and Basic Stance The natural environment is the very foundation of human life, so protecting it is essential to sustainable societies. We strive to help resolve environmental issues through our business by investing in the development of products that can reduce society's environmental impact, and also by making investments that help to make environmental technologies and infrastructure more widely available. We are working to establish a system that efficiently collects data on Daiwa's environmental impact. We are also focused on raising employees' environmental awareness to empower them to reduce environmental impact in daily business operations. Environmental Management All Daiwa Securities Group companies carry out environmental management. In the monthly meetings of the Environmental Management Council, the managers from each company work together by compiling data and exchanging information. The Daiwa Institute of Research Business Innovation has earned ISO14001 certification. Initially this certification was only for the telecom business, but the scope was expanded to cover the entire headquarters of the company beginning in April 2010. We use forums such as councils to consider ways in which we can continue to develop group-wide environmental management systems. We will continue to reduce energy consumption and track data on CO2 emissions, use of copy paper and paper for forms, the amount of waste generated, and recycling amounts, and continually work to reinforce our efforts. CO 2 Emissions Energy consumption at the Daiwa Securities Group's domestic offices (on a CO2 emissions basis) rose 4.7% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. This was primarily due to Japan's revised Act on the Rational Use of Energy, which now requires that data include the electricity, gas and crude petroleum used in air conditioning by tenants in office buildings in Japan which are subject to the revised Act (Daiwa Securities Headquarters building, Eitai Daiya Building, and Osaka Mitsui Bussan Building, and Daiwa Securities branches). Calculated as before, electricity consumption would have decreased 1.6% from the previous year. Electricity consumption at overseas offices increased due to the increase in the number of offices covered by changes in the report boundary, but electricity consumption per office decreased 9.7% from the previous fiscal year. 49 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Energy Consumption FY 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Domestic offices Electricity (1,000 kWh) 88,728 92,659 97,722 104,750 108,6281 Natural gas (1,000 m3) 691 644 517 423 6961 Gasoline (kiloliters) 1,046 1,032 1,029 1,062 1,137 Heavy oil (kiloliters) 34.1 23.7 4.3 1.4 8.61 Diesel fuel (kiloliters) 0.1 0 0.1 0 0.2 Overseas offices Electricity (1,000kWh) 7,718 11,640 11,130 13,137 1 Energy consumption increased significantly due to Japan's revised Act on the Rational Use of Energy, which now requires that data include tenant energy consumption for air conditioning in the three office buildings and other facilities in Japan which are subject to the revised Act. * This data pertains to consolidated Group companies. * At overseas offices, only electricity consumption was calculated.

CO2 emissions per employee is calculated by dividing the Daiwa Securities Group's total emissions by the number of domestic employees, and increased 400kg year on year. This is because the revised Act on the Rational Use of Energy now requires the inclusion of data on electricity, gas and crude petroleum use by office building tenants. 50 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CO2 Emissions per Employee (Domestic) （Unit: 1,000 kg-CO2） FY 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Per employee 4.5 4.3 4.2 4.6 5.0 Number of domestic employees 11,924 12,943 13,652 13,477 12,868 Other Environmental Impacts Changes in Potable Water Consumption Potable water consumption （Unit: 1,000 kl） FY 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Consumption volume 274 268 243 198 177 * This data pertains to consolidated Group companies.

Initiatives to Reduce Environmental Impact Upgrades to building equipment to conserve energy When Daiwa Securities upgrades equipment such as air conditioners, power supply units, power conversion equipment, and water supply and drainage units in its branches, the company requires that products meeting the highest ( top runner ) standards are adopted to ensure that equipment with low environmental impact is installed. Top runner standards were recommended in Japan's Act on the Rational Use of Energy, which requires that manufacturers clear benchmarks ensuring that energysaving products are manufactured. The top runner concept calls for manufacturers to strive to improve their technologies and create products and equipment that surpass the energy efficiency of products and equipment currently on the market. Eco activities expanded (Daiwa Securities Business Center) The Daiwa Securities Business Center started the Eco Promotion Committee in 2008 and began to work on eco initiatives. Each year, the Business Center sets its own targets for reducing electricity use and paper use to raise awareness among individual employees and motivate them to create and implement 52 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents ingenious solutions. In fiscal 2010, the third year, the Daiwa Securities Business Center set a target of reducing paper use by 10% over the previous fiscal year and achieved a 9.1% reduction, but paper use has been cut by a cumulative 28% since this program started. Information on the volume of paper ordered, electricity consumption and hours of electricity consumption, as well as status updates on internal initiatives, are listed monthly, quarterly, biannually and every fiscal year on the intranet as part of the company's efforts to raise awareness of employees. Shortening work hours by encouraging executives and employees to leave before 7:00 p.m. Encouraging executives and employees to leave the office before 7:00 p.m. in the interest of work-life balance means that lights and heating/cooling are needed for shorter periods. This, in turn, helps to reduce environmental impact. 53 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR Report 2011 Economic Report Delivering Economic Value to Stakeholders Revenues in the Economic Report For the purpose of this Economic Report, revenues represent the total of all revenues received by the Daiwa Securities Group (consolidated) in fiscal 2010—operating revenues, non-operating income and extraordinary gains.

Executives and Employees The distribution of economic value to executives and employees is the figure for personnel expenses (including reserves for salaries and bonuses, as well as welfare program costs and social insurance contributions). Daiwa has built a fair compensation system that is highly acceptable to all, in order to improve employee motivation and maximize the value provided to all stakeholders. Society Regardless of the ups and downs of the business cycle, we aim to provide stable funding for our corporate citizenship activities. See Corporate Citizenship Initiatives and Expenditures in the Relationship with Society section for a breakdown of these expenditures. Shareholders In fiscal 2010, the Group paid an interim dividend of ¥3 per share and a year-end dividend of ¥3 yen per share, for a total annual dividend of ¥6 yen per share. Creditors The Group pays interest to creditors. Government According to the Daiwa Securities Group's financial accounting, the tax amount paid is the sum of current income taxes, deferred income taxes, and other taxes and duties including consumption tax.

For this reason, every year we ask for the opinion of a third party, an outside stakeholder, when we publish the CSR report. Toshihiko Goto has shared his opinions of the 2011 report. Mr. Goto is Chief Executive of the NPO Sustainability Forum Japan. We will study and share his opinions both internally and externally to improve our activities. This feedback will be reflected in our future initiatives and in the CSR reports for subsequent fiscal years. Third-party Opinion The Japanese people are thinking entirely differently about how best to approach national, economic and social issues since the Great East Japan Earthquake struck on March 11. We have indeed entered a period of paradigm shift. For the business world to adapt and be responsive to changes like these is the very definition of CSR, and the financial services industry is expected to be fully engaged and contribute to the protracted reconstruction ahead of us. At the same time, the emerging markets and developing countries that will be important business targets going forward are entering a completely new stage in CSR. The launch of the ISO 26000 guidance standard on Toshihiko Goto Chief Executive, NPO social responsibility in November 2010 was symbolic of this progress. It Sustainability Forum Japan. was developed with the participation of experts from 99 countries, mostly emerging and developing nations, but I am afraid that Japanese companies are still moving too slowly on ISO26000. The Daiwa Securities Group is endeavoring to take its employees' awareness to the next level with cutting-edge initiatives such as SRI funds and impact investment bonds. However, the social responsibilities (SR) in emerging economies and developing countries are extremely varied and wideranging. Staff, including at subsidiaries, outside of Japan must not only be aware of SR through products, but must also address SR issues independently in the area where they work. It is basically impossible for CSR staff at the head office to respond directly to every issue―rather, an adequate response requires a system that involves all employees. Ideally, every employee would take the initiative in addressing the seven core subjects of the ISO 26000 in their private lives as well as in their work. These seven core subjects are organizational governance, human rights, labor practices, the environment, fair operating practices, consumer issues, and community involvement and development. I believe that the functions of the head office's CSR division should be at the center of strategic management, and now is the time when the Daiwa Securities Group, and many other Japanese companies, must rethink their approach, reconsidering how they will build such functions and how they will improve CSR capacity on the frontlines. I also think that this can lead to business opportunities. The Group's current CSR initiative that encourages more employees to take up volunteer activities is a very effective way to enhance CSR capacity. 58 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents I think that, as a general statement of intent, the president's message takes the high road, but the key is the extent to which specific measures are established and implemented. The editorial policy states that the report focuses on areas the Daiwa Securities Group particularly wishes to communicate in an easy-to-understand highlight edition. This is a completely different concept from typical reports, and certainly represents a noteworthy effort. In this report, the Group focuses on SRI, and I think this is appropriate since this is part of the Group's core business and its status as a leader in this field. However, as noted in the report, SRI accounts for a very small percentage of overall investing in Japan, with a three-digit difference compared to the US and Europe. I hope that the Daiwa Securities Group will develop an indicator for assessing the extent to which SRI concepts are being realized in its mainstream business overall. The Daiwa Securities Group has decided to convey comprehensive information based on the GRI in its full edition. The issue of how the highlight edition and the full edition can be used together and how the synergies can be enhanced has yet to be clearly addressed. While the report states that it aims to convey comprehensive information based on the GRI Guidelines, it highlights descriptions by stakeholder. These descriptions by stakeholder are typical of the Japanese format and are not used much internationally. However, a link to a comparison chart with the GRI Guidelines is provided to satisfy both the domestic and international audiences. I also appreciate that explanations of technical terms are provided even in sections only available in the full edition. Of note, the Daiwa Securities Group has revised its basic policy on human rights. However, it seems to continue to focus on discrimination. The Ruggie Report has provided the direction and guidance for human rights in ISO 26000 and the new OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, revised in May 2011. In his role as the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General on human rights, Professor John Ruggie presented this report to the UN Human Rights Council. Human rights are defined very broadly in the UN's protect, respect and remedy framework, proposed in the Ruggie Report. Awareness of human rights that enables people to empathize with another person's pain is important as a personal quality, but the key issue is to be aware of the kinds of human rights problems happening around the world. I believe that the Group's basic policy will have to be revised again soon to reflect this. In regard to environmental issues, building a sustainable society has been at the top of the agenda of every Japanese organization since the disasters of March 11. I have great hopes that the Daiwa Securities Group will establish its 2020 goals and 2050 vision. As I wrote at the beginning, CSR is entering a new stage. The key terms are due diligence, stakeholder engagement, human rights and ethics, and the value chain, but I did not see these terms appearing often in this report. I believe that the Daiwa Securities Group should use this key language, particularly in times of such intense change. Finally, the Daiwa Securities Group does not yet have a basic policy on the environment, a document which every global enterprise should have. I recommend that the Daiwa Securities Group promptly consider formulating its own. 59 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents Response to Third-party Opinion We truly appreciate Mr. Goto's evaluation of our activities, which represent our strategy to expand in Asia, based on a global framework. By making impact investments one of our key business areas and involving many executives and employees in this area, we are striving to boost familiarity with CSR. We are proud that the Daiwa Securities Group is playing a pioneering role in Japan in this field. That said, we do recognize that we need to make further efforts to reach the level demanded in this global world, as outlined in the ISO26000 and the Ruggie Report. We released our human rights policy this year, and have taken the first step in addressing human rights issues other than discrimination. Koichi Matsushita In addition, we are considering adopting a new framework for environmental Executive Managing Director management. As part of our business expansion in Asia, we have also started initiatives to raise employees' sensitivity by providing information on social problems in countries and communities, hoping that this would lead to business such as impact investment. These are all important CSR issues as well as fields in which our efforts have lagged, so we have decided to put more efforts in this area. We will continue to devote resources to impact investment, and are developing products to aid the recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake. Still, as Mr. Goto pointed out, this still occupies a modest share of our overall earnings. We will strive to develop indicators and make products like these mainstays for the Group. 60 Daiwa Securities Group CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR REPORT 2011 Web-only contents CSR Report 2011 Third-party Evaluations Dow Jones Sustainability World Indexes Member 2010/11 The Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) is a stock index of companies with sustainable practices selected by Dow Jones & Company, Inc. of the United States and Sustainable Asset Management (SAM) of Switzerland.
