Compared with 2008, the Nordic system price was of Directors 22 per cent lower and the German spot price 41 per cent lower, while a comparison with the period 2004-2008 shows that the price reduction was 2 per cent for the Nordic region and 15 per cent for Germany. However, the incorporation of new activities from the swap trade with E.ON AG and the consolidation of SN Power as a subsidiary gave positive result contributions. The operating revenue increased somewhat as a result of these transactions. In 2009, Statkraft reduced its hydropower production in Norway to a level more in line with annual mean production. The activity level in the organisation was very high in 2009, and several projects have moved decisively towards realisation. The Group has secured a solid potential for further growth however, the investment level depends on the owner’s willingness to strengthen Statkraft’s equity. In recent years, Statkraft has greatly emphasised the development of growth opportunities, and the Group is now entering a new phase with stronger focus on efficient project realisation. IMPORTANT EVENTS On 31 December 2008, Statkraft took possession of assets in hydropower, gas power and district heating through an asset swap with E.ON AG. Substantial resources were allocated to the ­integration of these new power plants in 2009. In total, the transaction increased the Group’s production capacity by 2433 MW, or about 20 per cent. In January, Statkraft increased its shareholding in SN Power from 50 to 60 per cent through a combination of a purchase of shares from Norfund and a private placement in SN Power in the amount of NOK 2 billion. The transaction increased the Statkraft Group’s production capacity by 621 MW, primarily hydropower. Hydropower In June, Statkraft acquired 95 per cent of the shares in Yesil Enerji from the Turkish company Global Investment Holdings. The acquisition gives Statkraft the rights to six hydropower projects in Turkey with the potential to generate a total of about 2 TWh annually. Three new hydropower plants came online in 2009, Rødberg, Sylsjø and Håvardsvatn, with an annual total mean production of 44 GWh. Småkraft commissioned seven new power plants in 2009, with a total annual mean production of 106 GWh. In October, Tata Power and SN Power signed a cooperation agreement with the aim of developing new or buying existing hydropower plants totalling 4000 MW in India and Nepal by 2020. Of this, 2000 MW is expected to be realised by 2015. In the second quarter, Statkraft established an office in Lyon in France to prepare for many of the French hydropower licenses coming up for tender in the years up to 2030. Wind power The Forewind consortium, consisting of the partners Statkraft, Statoil, RWE npower and Scottish and Southern Energy plc., was awarded the Dogger Bank zone by the UK authorities in January 2010. The zone is located in the North Sea, between 125 and 195 kilometres off the coast of Yorkshire, and is the largest zone awarded in the third licensing round for development of offshore wind farms in the UK. The development potential is 9 GW. Statkraft owns 25 per cent of the consortium. Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors 05 In March, Statkraft purchased 50 per cent of the shares in Statoil’s project for the construction ARVID GRUNDEKJØN of the Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm off the Norfolk coast in the UK. The wind farm, which will be completed in 2011, will comprise 88 turbines and have a total installed capacity Chairman of the Board and Chair of Statkraft’s of 315 MW. The expected annual production for the project is 1.1 TWh. ­Compensation Alltwalis Wind Farm in the UK came online in December. The wind farm in Wales has a total ­Committee, board ­member since 2004 of ten turbines and an installed capacity of 23 MW. The Totoral wind farm in Chile, where SN Power owns 80 per cent, was officially opened in January 2010. The wind farm consists of 23 wind turbines with a total installed capacity of 46 MW. Two partially-owned companies in the UK, where Statkraft owns 50 and 33.9 per cent respectively, received their licenses in January 2010. The projects have an installed capacity of 18 and 52.5 MW. The licenses are valid and in force. Statkraft Agder Energi Vind DA in Norway, where Statkraft owns 62 per cent, was granted a license for a wind farm in Rogaland in December. The project has an installed capacity of up to 150 MW. The license has been appealed. In the fourth quarter, Statkraft SCA Vind AB in northern Sweden was granted licenses for the construction of six wind farms with a total installed capacity of 1140 MW. The licenses have been appealed. In August, Statkraft and the Swedish forest industry company Södra signed a letter of intent relating to renewable energy. In October, the companies entered into a cooperation agreement, which includes Statkraft buying 90.1 per cent of Södra’s wind power development company in southern Sweden. The portfolio contains projects in various stages of development, with an overall potential of about 634 MW of installed capacity. The first project was granted a license in October, but the license has been appealed. Gas power As a result of the merger between Essent and RWE, the power purchase agreement between Knapsack Power GmbH and Essent was terminated on 11 November with effect from 31 December 2009. The intra-group power purchase agreement was also terminated. The terminations will result in streamlining of the operations. The investment in Naturkraft has been written down by NOK 213 million in total in 2009, and by NOK 610 million since the power plant started production. The write-downs are due to the significantly diminished expectations for future spark spread, the margin between gas and energy prices, and the EUR becoming weaker vis-à-vis NOK. This has partially been offset by the power plant proving to be more flexible than assumed, so that more marginal periods with positive spark spread can be exploited. German gas power had some downtime in 2009, both scheduled and unscheduled, resulting in relatively low production compared with total capacity. In addition, the low spark spread has contributed to relatively low production from the German gas power plants. Other technologies Energy production at Statkraft’s first solar park, Casale, started in December. The park, which lies south of Rome, has an installed capacity of 3.3 MW, and can produce 4.5 GWh. In September, Statkraft and the Italian company Solar Utility SpA signed an agreement relating to the acquisition of eight ready-to-build solar power projects in the Puglia region in south-eastern Italy. The projects, scheduled for realisation in 2010, have a total capacity of almost 20 MW. The osmotic power prototype at Tofte was officially opened in November. The construction of the prototype demonstrates that the technology works in an industrial plant. Power agreements Statkraft and Boliden Odda have entered into a comprehensive agreement that was finalised in the second quarter and became effective as of 1 July. As part of this agreement, Statkraft and Boliden Odda signed two long-term industrial power agreements for the period 2009–2030. The agreement for delivery of around 20 TWh is the largest industrial power agreement Statkraft has entered into since 1998. Statkraft SF owns the power facilities in Tyssedal, but the waterfall rights and power plants are leased out to AS Tyssefaldene on terms set by the authorities. In line with the agreement, Statkraft acquired Boliden’s 39.88 per cent 06 Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors shareholding in Tyssefaldene, which increased Statkraft’s shareholding to 60.17 per cent. BERIT RØDSETH The remaining shares are owned by Eramet through the company DNN Industrier AS. Member of Statkraft’s In 2007, Statkraft and the Swedish paper producer SCA entered into an agreement which Audit Committee, includes a ten-year power delivery of 500 GWh per year to the paper mill Ortviken Pappersbruk. board member since 2007 This power delivery started in June 2009. The financial crisis in the autumn of 2008 put the negotiations with the power-intensive industry relating to long-term power agreements on hold. With the exception of the agreement with Boliden Odda, no major long-term power agreements were entered into in 2009. However, the demand to cover the need for short-term trading solutions has been substantial. Statkraft offers a solution to the power-intensive industry to cover this need, called energy service. This solution entails that Statkraft handles the companies’ delivery of spot power quoted on Nord Pool, handling of the companies imbalances vis-à-vis Statnett as well as the need for short-term financial or physical hedging transactions. In Statkraft’s total short-term industrial portfolio, eleven power-intensive companies, owning a total of 16 plants, have entered into energy service agreements. The total annual consumption of these companies is about 9 TWh. In December, the Peruvian authorities and SN Power signed a power sales agreement relating to the delivery of about 9 TWh over 15 years from 1 July 2014. The agreement is contingent upon the Chevez power plant being built and completed by that date. An investment decision is expected by the fourth quarter of 2010. Other In September, Trondheim Energi AS and TrønderEnergi AS agreed on the principles for a grid merger in Sør-Trøndelag County. The companies have started commercial negotiations with a shared intention of merging the grid companies Trondheim Energi Nett and TrønderEnergi Nett. The negotiations will continue in 2010. At the end of 2009, Fjordkraft AS bought 100 per cent of the shares in Trondheim Energi ­Kraftsalg AS from Trondheim Energi AS. In November, Christian Rynning-Tønnesen was appointed Statkraft’s new President and CEO, to replace Bård Mikkelsen, who will resign in accordance with his employment contract. ­Rynning-Tønnesen has previously worked in Statkraft and comes from the position of chief executive in Norske Skog. He will become President and CEO of Statkraft on 1 May 2010.

Further information on these items 15 can be found in the section “Items excluded from the underlying profit” later in the report. 12 9 At the beginning of the year, Statkraft had a total installed production capacity of 14 857 MW, of which 2433 MW was added through take-over of power plants from E.ON on 31 December 2008. 6 The increase is mainly in hydropower and gas power. From 2009, SN Power was consolidated as 3 a subsidiary, this increasing the Group’s production capacity by an additional 621 MW as a result. 0 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Annual profit The profit before tax for the year was NOK 10 654 million (NOK 11 960 million), EBITDA Net proﬁt while the profit after tax was NOK 6468 million (NOK 8097 million). However, 2008 was a histori* Unrealised changes in value and signiﬁcant non-recurring cally good year, with both high power prices and high capacity utilisation.

The Group’s production capacity increased by about 25 per cent in 2009. Return on investment Measured in ROACE – operating profit/loss compared with average capital employed – the Group achieved a return of 15.2 per cent in 2009 (26.6 per cent). The decline of 11.4 percentage points is due to both higher average capital employed and lower operating profit. The return on equity was 10.2 per cent after tax (15.6 per cent), and the return on total assets after tax was 5.8 per cent (9.9 per cent). The reduction is attributable to lower earnings, as well as higher average equity and total capital as a consequence of the E.ON transaction and the consolidation of SN Power. 1 Comparative figures for 2008 are shown in brackets. Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors 07 Operating revenues Gross operating revenues increased by 2 per cent to NOK 25 675 million (NOK 25 061 million). ELLEN STENSRUD The average system price for the year on the Nord Pool power exchange was 35.0 EUR/MWh Deputy chair, (44.7 EUR/MWh) and the average spot price on the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Germany board member was 38.9 EUR/MWh (65.8 EUR/MWh). Compared with the historically high prices in 2008, the since 2007 decline was 22 and 41 per cent, respectively. Compared with the average prices for the years 2004–2008, however, the decline was less substantial, 2 per cent in the Nordic region and 15 per cent in Germany. The Group produced 56.9 TWh (53.4 TWh) in total. Hydropower production increased by 2.7 TWh, of which 2.0 TWh relates to SN Power, which has been consolidated as a subsidiary since 2009. In addition, European hydropower production outside of Norway increased by 4.2 TWh as a result of new production capacity from the asset swap with E.ON AG. Lower prices and reduced demand from energy-intensive industry reduced hydropower production in Norway by 3.4 TWh. New gas-fired power plants in Germany and higher production at Kårstø in Norway increased gas-based power production by 0.7 TWh. Wind power production was somewhat higher than in 2008. Lower prices resulted in net physical spot sales falling by NOK 2204 million to NOK 10 464 million. The revenues from the hedging activities and trading and origination compensated for most of the decline and increased by NOK 433 million and NOK 1171 million, respectively. The realisation of EUA and CER contracts worth about NOK 800 million in Germany in December is a significant factor in the improvement of revenues from trading and origination. These revenues are offset by reduced unrealised gains for energy contracts slightly exceeding NOK 600 million. Revenues from grid and end-user activities were on a par with 2008, but the income from the d ­ istrict heating activities increased by NOK 134 million as a result of new assets in Sweden from the asset swap with E.ON AG. Power sales to the industry under politically determined contracts amounted to 8.8 TWh, resulting in an estimated revenue reduction of NOK 981 million compared with selling the same volume at spot price. Other operating revenues amounted to NOK 960 million for the year (NOK 856 million). The increase is mainly from revenues from Tyssefaldene. Energy purchases totalled NOK 4825 million (NOK 4416 million). The increase is primarily related to new district heating plants in Sweden from the asset swap with E.ON AG and the ­purchase of gas for the gas-fired production. Transmission costs in connection with transport of power totalled NOK 1054 million (NOK 1326 million). The decline is due to lower power prices and production volumes in Norway. This is offset to some degree by new production capacity in Sweden. Net operating revenues amounted to NOK 19 796 million (NOK 19 319 million). Operating expenses The operating expenses were NOK 9849 million in 2009 (NOK 7290 million), an increase of 35 per cent from 2008. In excess of 60 per cent of the increase is related to added activities. The Group is in a strong growth phase, resulting in an increase in salary costs and other operating costs in the other activities. Salary costs increased by NOK 663 million to NOK 2517 million, of which the added activities contributed slightly less than 60 per cent of the increase. Many exploration, engineering and development projects have resulted in an increase in the number of full-time equivalents. ­General wage increases and provisions for pension liabilities explain the rest of cost increases. The increase in depreciation of NOK 775 million from 2008 is mainly related to new assets and the consolidation of SN Power. In total, depreciation for the year amounted to NOK 2635 million. Property tax and licence fees increased by NOK 89 million to NOK 1166 million for the year. Property tax in Sweden increased as a result of new assets, while a lower calculation basis reduced the tax burden in Norway. Other operating expenses amounted to NOK 3530 million. Of the increase of NOK 1030 million, about 55 per cent comes from new assets from the E.ON transaction and the consolidation of SN Power. The remaining increase is mainly from increased costs in power plants operated by 08 Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFIT, third-parties, a pre-engineering study in Albania, terminations of power sales agreements and UNDERLYING OPERATIONS* the repair of Baltic Cable.

The decrease in this item in 2009 is attributable to the fact that at the end of 2008, the 44.6 5 per cent shareholding in E.ON Sverige AB was swapped for wholly owned assets within hydro0 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 power, gas and district heating.

The 2008 accounts included the profit shares from E.ON Sverige AB of NOK 1315 million for the period up to 18 June, when the board o f Statkraft resolved to proceed with the asset swap with E.ON AG. Profit shares after this date were included in the calculation of gain and recognised in the income statement upon the completion of the transaction on 31 December 2008. Settlement took place in the second quarter of 2009. Financial items Net financial items amounted to NOK -327 million in 2009 (NOK -2222 million). The financial expenses were reduced by NOK 828 million compared with 2008. Interest charges fell by NOK 471 million as a result of lower market interest rates. In 2008, the Group’s hedging transactions in EUR and bank deposits in foreign currencies yielded a loss totalling NOK 746 million, while they yielded a profit in 2009. This profit has been classified under other financial income. Skagerak Energi has added NOK 383 million to the Group’s financial expenses in the form of loan losses and exercising of guarantee liabilities in connection with Cinclus Technology AS. Financial income increased by NOK 1067 million compared with 2008. The increase is attributable to dividends from E.ON AG of NOK 1093 million. In addition, bank deposits in currency and hedging transactions in EUR have resulted in a currency gain of NOK 482 million. Average liquidity was higher in 2009 than in 2008, while falling market interest rates generated a reduced yield from the portfolio. The Group has four loan portfolios in NOK, SEK, EUR and USD, respectively. The portfolios are exposed to both variable and fixed interest rates, with exposure to variable interest rates amounting to 67 per cent. The average current interest rates in 2009 for loans denoted in NOK were 4.1 per cent, in SEK 2.3 per cent, in EUR 3.9 per cent and in USD 4.8 per cent. Debt in USD is related to project financing in SN Power. Statkraft has used hedge accounting in 2009 to reduce the volatility in the income statement. A larger share of the debt in EUR has been hedged against market rate changes. Statkraft has entered into agreements with its financial counterparties for the settlement of interest and currency rate changes in value that limit counterparty risk resulting from derivative contracts to one week’s changes in value (cash collateral). Statkraft places significant amounts in banks and securities at times, particularly ahead of major payments. Counterparties are continually followed up to reduce the risk of losses.

HALVOR Unrealised changes in the value of energy contracts amounted to NOK -2813 million (NOK STENSTADVOLD 4283 million). The Group’s contracts are, for example, indexed against various commodities, Chair of Statkraft’s ­currencies and indices. At the end of 2009, the falling USD exchange rate and rising price for Audit Committee, board member ­oil-related products compared with the gas price in particular resulted in unrealised losses for since 2003 the contracts. In addition, several major contracts were realised in 2009. Unrealised changes in value of associates and joint ventures amounted to NOK 547 million (NOK -753 million). Unrealised changes in value for financial items amounted to NOK 5977 million (NOK -3102 million), and are primarily related to currency effects. This applies to currency effects on internal loans, the shareholding in E.ON AG, debt denoted in SEK and EUR as well as currency hedging contracts. Of the unrealised changes in value for financial items, a currency gain on internal loans amounted to NOK 4163 million. The gain arose mainly as a result of the strengthened NOK ­compared with EUR. Statkraft Treasury Centre (STC) provides loans to the Group’s companies in the companies’ local currency, of which a large percentage is in NOK. STC, which prepares its accounts in EUR, accordingly reports significant currency effects in its income statement. A contra item is recognised in equity for the foreign currency effects on the consolidation of STC. Unrealised changes in value related to the E.ON AG shares which can be attributed to currency factors are shown as currency loss under financial items and amounted to NOK -3440 million in 2009. The Group’s debt in EUR, which is lower than the cost price of the E.ON AG shares, has a currency gain which partly offsets the currency loss on the shares. Debt in SEK and EUR resulted in an aggregate currency gain of NOK 3031 million for 2009. The unrealised changes in value result from a stronger NOK compared with SEK and EUR over the course of the year. Unrealised changes in value for currency hedging contracts were positive and amounted to NOK 1408 million at the end of 2009. The reason is that the NOK has strengthened compared to EUR and SEK during the period. Statkraft uses currency hedging contracts to hedge future cash flows, and the contracts are mainly related to power sales denoted in EUR. Changes in value for interest rate and inflation derivatives amounted to NOK -173 million in 2009, of which NOK -103 million is related to reductions in the value of the inflation derivatives. Non-recurring items excluded from the calculation of the underlying profit amounted to NOK -1878 million (NOK 25 433 million). The amount in 2009 is related to write-downs as well as the settlement with E.ON AG, while the amount in 2008 is substantially related to gains from the sale of the shareholding in E.ON Sverige AB. As a result of lower prices and foreign currency changes, the investment in Naturkraft AS has been written down by NOK 213 million in 2009. In total, the investment has been written down by NOK 610 million. The district heating plants in Sweden, two German biomass plants and one hydropower plant in the UK were written down by NOK 189 million in total in 2009. The write-down was due to better ­knowledge of the plants and therefore a better basis for estimating future cash flows as well as continued difficult market conditions. The La Higuera hydropower project in Chile has been written down by NOK 107 million as a result of delays and increased construction costs. The profit on the sale of shares in E.ON Sverige AB was recognised as income as of 31 December 2008. The final settlement was completed in 2009, and NOK 149 million has been recognised as financial income which is excluded from the calculation of the underlying result. In the second quarter, loans from Statkraft AS to subsidiaries in connection with the sale of and the settlement for the shares in E.ON Sverige AB were repaid and replaced with internal loan agreements. The loans were denominated in EUR, which had a development which differed from that of SEK and NOK, resulting in a currency loss of NOK 1518 million. The currency loss has been r­ ecognised under financial expenses as realised, but it is excluded from the calculation of the underlying profit. The currency loss had no cash flow effect. 10 Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors Taxes The tax expense on the underlying profit amounted to NOK 4186 million in 2009 CASH FLOW 2009 (NOK 3863 million), which corresponds to an effective tax rate of 39 per cent (32 per cent).

Changes in value for derivative positions, cash collateral, shares in E.ON AG, as well as currency conversion of property, plant and equipment and debt resulted in a positive change of NOK 1876 million. Dividend received from associates amounted to NOK 1083 million (NOK 2579 million). The net change in liquidity from the activities was thus NOK 12 714 million (NOK 11 499 million). Investments amounted to NOK 4678 million (NOK 3046 million). In addition to maintenance investments, the largest items were the purchase for NOK 469 million of 50 per cent of the LONG TERM LIABILITIES, shares in Statoil’s project to develop the Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm and the DEBT REDEMTION PROFILE ­purchase of 95 per cent of the shares in Yesil Enerji of Turkey for NOK 523 million.

The high cash reserve is partly due to raising of new debt to meet future needs for capital. Interest-bearing liabilities were NOK 45 660 million at the end of 2009, compared with NOK 40 791 million at the start of the year. The interest-bearing debt-to-equity ratio was 41.3 per cent, compared with 36.1 per cent at year-end 2008. The increase of 5.2 percentage points is due to a INTEREST-BEARING combination of increased debt and lower equity.

STATKRAFT’S ACTIVITIES Statkraft is Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy. The Group produces and develops hydropower, wind power, gas power, district heating and solar power, and is a significant player in the European energy exchanges, with specialist expertise within physical and financial energy trading. Statkraft has invested significantly in the innovation and development of marine energy, osmotic power and other new, environmentally friendly energy solutions. The Group has a large number of grid and end-user customers in Norway, and is the largest supplier of power to the Norwegian processing industry. Outside of Europe, Statkraft is engaged in energy production and development of new production through its subsidiary SN Power. The Group also holds 12 Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors interests in other energy companies, both in Norway and the other Nordic countries, as well as Bertil (PERTTI) a shareholding of 4.17 per cent in the German energy company E.ON AG. tiusanen To ensure a good structure for continued growth and profitability, the Group’s operational Board member structure was reorganised in the summer of 2008. The new organisational structure was chosen since 2009 to accommodate the major changes arising from increased growth and internationalisation. The organisation provides flexibility and dynamics whereby new priorities and growth areas can be given visibility and be established as separate business units with clear responsibility for delivering results. The Group reports in accordance with how the Group management makes, follows up and evaluates its decisions. The segment structure is presented on the basis of the internal management information which the management periodically reviews and uses for resource allocation and goal attainment. Statkraft’s business is organised into six segments – Generation and Markets, Wind Power, Emerging Markets, Skagerak Energi, Customers and Industrial Ownership. Areas not shown as separate segments are presented under the heading Other. This includes Southeast Europe Hydro, Solar power, Small-Scale Hydro, Innovation and Growth and the 4.17 per cent share­ holding in E.ON AG. Generation and Markets segment is the largest segment, responsible for the operation and maintenance of hydropower plants and gas power plants in Europe, as well as physical and financial trading in energy and energy-related products in Europe. These business units are organised into one segment due to the close integration between operations, maintenance and energy optimisation. The production plants are generally flexible and include 182 wholly and partially-owned hydropower plants, five gas-fired power plants and two biomass plants. Total installed capacity is 12 956 MW. In addition to own power generation, extensive trading is ­performed in standardised and structured power contracts, gas, coal, oil and carbon quotas. Statkraft owns two-thirds of a 600 MW subsea cable between Sweden and Germany through the company Baltic Cable AB. The Wind Power segment is responsible for the development, construction, operation and ownership of onshore and offshore wind farms in Norway and Europe. Responsibility for development and commercialisation of offshore wind power technology also rests with the segment. Development and construction projects are currently being implemented in Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The segment has four wind farms in operation, Smøla, Hitra and Kjølle­ fjord in Norway and Alltwalis in the UK. The combined installed capacity of these wind farms is 268 MW. Further investments in wind power in Norway will take place through the company Statkraft Agder Energi Vind DA, where Statkraft owns 62 per cent and Agder Energi 38 per cent. The Emerging Markets segment is responsible for the management and further development of ownership interests outside Europe, and currently consists of the ownership interest in SN Power (60 per cent from 13 January 2009), where Norfund owns the remaining 40 per cent. In addition, Theun Hinboun Power Company (THPC) (20 per cent shareholding) is managed on behalf of Statkraft SF. THPC is not included in the segment’s financial figures. At the end of last year, SN Power had ownership interests in 17 hydropower plants in South America and Asia, as well as in one wind farm and one gas power plant in South America. The power plants have an installed capacity of 649 MW (SN Power’s share). In addition, SN Power is also currently constructing and refurbishing 610 MW of capacity together with its partners. THPC owns one 210 MW hydropower plant which will be upgraded to 220 MW, and has two further hydropower plants with a combined installed capacity of 280 MW under construction in Laos. SN Power has been consolidated as a subsidiary since January 2009, while recognised as an associate in 2008. The Skagerak Energi group constitutes a separate segment. The activities are concentrated around power production, district heating and grid activities. Other activities involve fibre, natural gas distribution and electrical contractor activities and settlement activities. The company is owned by Statkraft (66.6 per cent shareholding) and the local authorities in Skien (15.2 per cent), Porsgrunn (14.8 per cent) and Bamble (3.4 per cent). The production assets cover 45 wholly and partially-owned hydropower and district heating plants with a total installed capacity of 1359 MW. The company has about 179 000 distribution grid customers. The Customers segment comprises the distribution grid, district heating and power sales activities that are performed by Trondheim Energi. The segment has about 96 000 distribution Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors 13 grid customers and 82 000 electricity customers. The district heating system in Trondheim and Klæbu has a total installed capacity of 297 MW, and supplies around 750 business customers and hilde m. tonne 7000 households with district heating. In Sweden, the segment has an installed district heating Board member capacity of 211 MW which it supplies to about 1450 customers. The segment also covers property since 2009 management. The Industrial Ownership segment is responsible for managing and developing Norwegian shareholdings where Statkraft has industrial ambitions. The segment comprises the companies Fjordkraft, BKK (49.9 per cent shareholding) and Agder Energi (45.5 per cent shareholding). The former company is included as a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements, while the other two companies are reported as associates. The Other segment includes the business units Southeast Europe Hydro, Solar Power, ­Small-Scale Hydro, Innovation and Growth, along with the 4.17 per cent shareholding in E.ON AG, and Group functions and eliminations. In 2008 it also included the investment in E.ON Sverige AB (44.6 per cent shareholding). The shareholding was sold to E.ON AG on 31 December 2008. Statkraft received assets and 4.17 per cent of the shares in E.ON AG in settlement. From 2009, the shareholding in E.ON AG is being reported under the Other segment. Strategy and vision Vision As a leader in renewable energy in Europe, Statkraft will meet the world’s need for cleaner energy. Strategy Statkraft’s strategy aims for continued profitable growth, both nationally and internationally, within environmentally friendly and flexible energy production. The Group has built up a large portfolio of projects, and will now focus on realising this portfolio. The strategy indicates three main directions for further development. π Industrial developer in Norway Statkraft is the most important player in the work to supply Norwegian households and businesses with clean energy, and will be an active driving force in the development of the energy industry in Norway, and through this effort create profitable jobs and contribute to meeting the need for more clean energy. The substantial assets related to the hydropower plants must be prudently managed. The ambition is to grow further through the development of new hydropower, wind power and ­district heating, as well through meeting the industry’s need for long-term energy agreements. π European flexible power producer Statkraft must develop integrated market operations ­further by establishing a strong position within flexible power assets in western Europe. Existing power plants must be expanded and upgraded, and the flexibility in the power plants must be exploited to supply the market with green power when fluctuations in demand and prices make this attractive. Specialist expertise in market analysis, power ­optimisation, trading with energy production, as well as operations and maintenance must be exploited and further developed. π Green global developer There is a great need for development of renewable energy in order to meet the world’s energy and climate challenges. This creates commercial opportunities, and Statkraft strives to establish a strong niche position within international hydropower and ­renewable energy sources. Corporate governance Statkraft’s corporate governance shall contribute to sustainable and a largest possible permanent value creation in the Group. Efficient and transparent management and control of the business will form the basis for creating long-term values for the owner, employees, other stakeholders and society in general, and will help build confidence among stakeholders through predictability and credibility. Open and accessible communications shall 14 Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors ensure that the company has a good relationship with society in general and the stakeholders THORBJØRN HOLØS who are affected by the company’s business in particular. Employee-elected Statkraft’s policy for corporate governance establishes the respective roles of the owner, board member, board member board and operational management. Statkraft applies the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corposince 2002 rate Governance (NUES) within the framework established by the company’s organisation and ownership. Recommendations related to equal treatment of shareholders, freely negotiable shares and general meeting are not relevant for Statkraft, which is not a listed company and has the Norwegian state as its only owner. Statkraft has an audit committee, consisting of three board members, which prepares the board’s processing of tasks related to financial reporting, internal control and audit. A compensation committee, consisting of the chair and two other board members, prepares the board’s processing of issues related to wages and other benefits for the CEO. Matters of principle related to salary levels, incentive schemes, pension terms, employment contracts, etc. for the Group management are also dealt with in the committee. Under certain conditions this also applies to other Statkraft employees. The work of the board of directors There were two changes to the board’s composition in 2009. The members Aud Mork and Egil Nordvik were replaced by Hilde Tonne and Bertil (Pertti) Tiusanen. The board of Statkraft AS is also the board of Statkraft SF. The board held 13 board meetings throughout the year. In 2009, the board reviewed the Group’s strategy. In addition to monitoring the daily operations, a significant part of the board’s work in 2009 was related to Statkraft’s financial platform and the appointment of a new CEO to replace Bård Mikkelsen. The board emphasised finding a new chief executive for Statkraft with solid energy sector competence, experience from international business activities and proven good results. Christian Rynning-Tønnesen will take up the position on 1 May 2010. Risk management and internal control The key risk factors for Statkraft are connected to ­market operations, financial management, operating activities and framework conditions. The international growth contributes to increased project risk, both in the concept and implementation phases. How we handle risk is important to value creation and forms an integrated part of all business activities. This is followed up in the respective units through risk monitoring procedures and risk mitigation measures. In addition, the mandate, competence and capacity of the Group risk function has been strengthened in 2010. There are substantial volume and price risks related to power production and trading. ­Precipitation and winter temperatures are of great importance to the Nordic power market, resulting in major fluctuations for both prices and production volumes. In addition, power prices are influenced by the price of gas, coal and oil, as well as CO2 quota prices. In addition, gas power production is directly exposed to both gas, oil and CO2. Statkraft manages this market risk by trading in physical and financial instruments in several markets. The increased integration of the energy markets is of great significance for business models and risk management, and great emphasis is placed on seeing the different markets in an overall context. Internal authorisations and limits have been established for all trading, and these are subject to continuous f­ ollow-up. The central treasury department coordinates and manages the financial risk associated with foreign currencies, interest rates and liquidity. The most important instruments in managing this area are forward currency contracts, interest swap agreements and forward interest agreements. Foreign exchange and interest rate risk are regulated through mandates. Furthermore, limits have been established for liquidity and counterparty risk. Both market risk and the other financial risk, as well as exposure connected to the issued mandates, are followed up by independent middle office functions, and are regularly reported to Group management and the board. The operational risk is mainly handled by means of detailed procedures, emergency preparedness plans and insurance. A comprehensive system has also been established to map, record and report unsafe conditions, undesirable incidents and injuries, and these are continuously analysed. Other risk is primarily related to general framework conditions and political decisions. Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors 15 C ­ limate changes can present both threats and opportunities, and are of importance for all the ODD VANVIK risks described above. Statkraft is therefore very concerned with the potential consequences of ­climate change. Employee-elected board member, ­member of Statkraft’s board is committed to further strengthening the internal control in the Group. Statkraft’s CompensaConsequently, a management system has been established that gathers all governing docution Committee, board member since 1993 ments and facilitates a more efficient, systematic and uniform management of the Group, ­incorporating adequate formalisation, documentation and compliance. Systems for internal ­control over financial reporting have also been established to contribute to reliable financial reporting. SUSTAINABLE VALUE CREATION Ethical business operations and anti-corruption work The Group’s business principles (”Statkraft’s code of conduct”) were revised in 2009. The principles were revised to better reflect the Group’s international scope, developments in the relevant legislation and expectations from the owner and other key stakeholders. Statkraft’s code of conduct defines the framework for ethical conduct and promotes awareness of ethical issues. The code of conduct is supported by more detailed guidelines and tools. At the beginning of 2010, Statkraft became a member of the UN Global Compact, and the code of conduct has been formulated to include Global Compact’s ten principles. The importance of the code of conduct is emphasised by the fact that all employees must actively confirm that they have familiarised themselves with the document, while compliance and follow-up is reported regularly. Education and dilemma training are key aspects of the work in connection with ethics. A series of dilemma training sessions and courses were held for managers and employees in 2009. A new anti-corruption manual will be launched in the spring of 2010. The manual contains an overview of relevant statutory rules, internal procedures as well as specific examples and challenges in connection with corruption. The manual will be supplemented by an interactive education program for all employees. Corresponding measures are being developed for other sections of the code of conduct. Statkraft encourages its employees to discuss ethical issues and to report any breaches they discover. The Group audit is an independent notification channel with a right and duty to report to the board. No whistleblowing cases were recorded in 2009. Environmental impact No serious environmental incidents were recorded in the Group in 2009, but 118 less serious environmental incidents were recorded. Most of these were in connection with minor and short-term breaches of the river management regulations and minor oil spills, and had little or no environmental impact. Development projects in Statkraft are planned and carried out in accordance with the requirements in the International Finance Corporation’s standard relating to sustainable behaviour. For the environment, this entails impact analyses as regards environmental impact and systematic handling of environmental aspects through the entire project process. In 2009, impact analyses were initiated for the Devoll project in Albania and the Çetin project in Turkey. Statkraft’s emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to 1 600 000 tonnes in 2009 (1 605 000 tonnes). The Group buys climate quotas in the voluntary CO2 quota market to neutralise ­greenhouse gas emissions from fuel consumption, business travel and accidental emissions. In 2009, Statkraft consumed 1359 GWh of electricity. All electricity consumed in the Group has been certified as renewable in accordance with RECS (Renewable Energy Certificate System). Statkraft generated 39 700 tonnes of hazardous waste, which was handled in accordance with applicable regulations. The bulk of this volume is residual products from the district heating plant in Trondheim. A major project aiming to develop a comprehensive environmental management system was concluded in 2009. The results from the project include Group-wide guidelines for environmental management in Statkraft with description of requirements related to mapping of environmental risk and impact. The Group was recertified in accordance with the environmental management system ISO 14001:2004 in 2009. For the time being, the activities outside of Scandinavia are not encompassed by the certificate. 16 Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors EMPLOYEES At the end of 2009, the Group had 3378 full-time equivalents (2633). During the past year, the increase in full-time equivalents was 28 per cent. Of the new full-time equivalents, 466, or 63 per cent, were added in connection with the consolidation of SN Power. The Group now has employees in 19 countries, and 28 per cent of the staff work outside Norway. The average age among Statkraft’s employees is 45 years, while average seniority is 12 years. In 2009, the staff turnover rate in Statkraft was 2.3 per cent. Several different surveys indicate that Statkraft is an attractive employer. In Universum’s annual survey among graduate students, the engineering students ranked Statkraft fifth among Norway’s most attractive employers, while the economics students ranked Statkraft in 25th place. Also in 2009, Statkraft was ranked one of Norway’s best places to work among businesses with more than 250 employees (questionnaire survey carried out by Great Place to Work Institute Norway). Statkraft strives to attain an even gender distribution in the Group, and more women in managerial positions. In 2009, 22 per cent of the Group’s employees were women and the percentage of women in managerial positions was 23 per cent. The percentage of women on the board of directors is 44 per cent. The board follows up the work to achieve an even gender balance, including compliance with statutory requirements relating to gender distribution in the boards of subsidiaries and companies where Statkraft has major ownership interests. Statkraft strives to attain a diverse working environment and promotes equal treatment in its recruitment and HR policy. Employees and others involved in Statkraft’s activities must be chosen and treated in a manner which does not discriminate on the basis of gender, skin colour, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, nationality, social or ethnic origin, political conviction, trade union membership or other factors. Each year, Statkraft evaluates its organisation and management as regards strategy, competence, organisational aspects and working environment. The results from the evaluation in 2009 were, as in previous years, very positive and indicate that Statkraft’s employees are satisfied and motivated in their jobs. HEALTH AND SAFETY There were a total of eight fatalities in connection with the international development projects in 2009, and another fatality in the period to mid-March 2010. This poses a challenge for Statkraft, and comprehensive HSE measures have been implemented to avoid future accidents. One contractor employee in Turkey and one person from a local community in Peru died in INJURIES AND SICKNESS ABSENCE ­connection with consolidated operations, and seven contractor employees died in connection with associated project activities – five in India and two in Laos. LTI, TRI Sickness absence Five of the deceased worked at SN Power’s Allain Duhangan project (India). Four of the fatal 20 8% accidents took place in the first quarter of 2009, while the fifth took place in March 2010. As a consequence of fatal accidents, a new project manager was appointed in April 2009, and inter15 6% national experts in tunnel construction and HSE have become closely involved in the project. 10 4% Two contractor employees died during project work in Theun Hinboun Power Company (Laos) and one at Yesil Enerji’s project in Cakit in Turkey.

In addition, 19 lost-time injuries were recorded among Statkraft’s contractors. Increased focus on reporting and analysis of incidents, near-misses and unsafe conditions, as well as stricter requirements for investigation of serious conditions are assumed to be the causes of the positive development. Measures and efforts to minimise the number of injuries will continue to have high priority. The Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors 17 Group has an expressed objective of learning the lessons from injuries, near-misses and unsafe conditions. In 2009, 5597 unsafe conditions and near-misses were recorded. ASTRI BOTTEN Absence due to illness in Statkraft was 3.3 per cent in 2009 (3.9 per cent). The company has LARSEN a target of absence due to illness of less than 4 per cent. All Norwegian companies in the Group Employee-elected have entered into Inclusive workplace (IA) agreements, with active follow-up of absence and board member, ­member of Statkraft’s close cooperation with the company health service. Audit Committee, board member since 2002 OUR ROLE IN SOCIETY Statkraft is working to develop new production capacity which can contribute to long-term, ­reliable energy supply and we want to be a positive contributor in the societies in which we operate. We welcome a positive and open dialogue with all stakeholders and are working to develop the company in a manner which increases the value for the owner and the local ­communities and countries in which we operate. Statkraft’s economic value creation amounted to NOK 19 743 million in 2009. Of this, NOK 3740 million was returned to the owner as dividend and group contribution, while taxes and fees to the state and municipalities amounted to NOK 6202 million. Statkraft’s total investments in 2009 amounted to NOK 4907 million (excluding loans given), of which NOK 2355 million was in Norway and NOK 2552 million abroad. Of these investments, 50 per cent were in connection with expansion of production capacity. Statkraft’s contribution to society includes knowledge enhancement and results created through innovation. We want to be a driving force in Norway’s growing renewable energy and environment R&D sector. Our priority areas within R&D are channelled through three R&D programs within the areas marine energy, hydropower and customer activities. The budget for Statkraft’s innovation projects in the period 2009–2011 is about NOK 500 million. FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS Statkraft’s existing activities in Norway are influenced by framework conditions such as tax regulations, changes in the grid tariff regime, revisions of minimum waterflow provisions and other decrees from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, in addition to limitations in the transmission grid, general support schemes and regulations for the industry. The framework conditions can influence Statkraft’s production, income and profitability. Correspondingly, Statkraft is exposed to framework conditions and regulations through its activities in the EU and emerging markets internationally. The EU’s renewables directive will have a great impact on Statkraft in the coming years. The directive sets binding goals for 20 per cent of total energy consumption to come from renewable energy by 2020. The European power prices alone cannot make new renewable technologies profitable. Most countries have therefore introduced subsidy systems to ensure growth for these technologies. The subsidy systems are national and vary significantly in both design and subsidy levels. There are two main subsidy systems: power transport tariffs and green certificates. Statkraft is exposed to subsidy schemes for the development of clean energy in a series of markets. Both known technologies such as land-based wind power and new technologies such as offshore wind, wave and tidal power are dependent upon financial support for realisation. Uncertainty related to the future scope and size of the various national subsidy systems is greatly emphasised when making investment decisions and will in the longer term be decisive for the development of new technologies. The development of Europe’s climate and energy policy makes Statkraft’s advantages in environmentally friendly and flexible power production increasingly profitable. This applies to the further development of an integrated European energy market, the European CO2 quota trading system and the goal of achieving 20 per cent renewable energy consumption. More wind power and other non-flexible power production increases the need for flexible production capacity. Outside of Europe, long-term prosperity development and climate challenges will drive demand for more clean energy. 18 Statkraft annual report 2009 report from the board of directors ALLOCATION of profit In the fiscal budget for 2010, the dividend from Statkraft to the Norwegian state has been set at NOK 3740 million, equalling 76 per cent of Group profit after tax and minority interests, adjusted for unrealised gains and losses. The dividend will be paid from Statkraft SF. In order to provide Statkraft SF with sufficient ability to pay dividend, the board proposes the following allocation of the net profit in Statkraft AS. Amounts in NOK million Net profit in Statkraft AS’ company accounts 3 476 Allocation of profit for the year: Group contribution from Statkraft AS to Statkraft SF 7 420 Transferred from other equity 3 944 The parent company’s distributable equity was NOK 16 570 million at year-end. OUTLOOK Statkraft is a leader in renewable energy in Europe with production and trading both in the ­Nordic countries and on the Continent. Through SN Power, the Group has established a solid foothold within renewable energy in South America and Asia. Substantial uncertainty remains as regards the activity level in the power-intensive industry, both in the Nordic region and on the Continent. Forward prices for 2010 indicate a somewhat higher price level than in 2009. Little precipitation in the fourth quarter of 2009 and at the beginning of 2010 indicates that the hydropower production may be somewhat lower in 2010, while the current price situation for gas could provide a basis for slightly higher gas power production. The organisation has been strengthened in 2009 as a result of the large number of new projects. Overall, the result for 2010 is therefore expected to be on a par with 2009. Statkraft has developed a major portfolio of projects which support the Group’s threefold strategy; industrial developer in Norway, European flexible power producer and green global developer. This strategy supports Norway’s environmental ambitions, the EU’s climate goals and the need for a sustainable development facing countries in South America and Asia. The current market is still characterised by the effects the financial crisis has had for many players. This paves the way for some interesting opportunities for Statkraft, with its strong industrial position. The majority government’s political platform, presented in October 2009, stated the following: ”the government will facilitate Statkraft’s further development as a driving force within renewable energy”. On 4 February 2009, the board presented Statkraft’s strategic platform with the associated financial plan to the Ministry of Trade and Industry in the form of an recommendation for strengthened equity and reduced dividend levels. It is of great importance to the company to achieve clarification as regards the capital situation.

In exchange for shares in E.ON Sverige AB, Statkraft received renewable and flexible power production assets and shares in E.ON AG. The swap deal had a total value of NOK 45 635 million. On the completion date of 31 December 2008, Statkraft’s shareholding in E.ON Sverige AB and a Swedish hydropower plant were exchanged for a third of E.ON Sverige’s hydropower production capacity (40 hydropower plants), five Swedish district heating plants, two gas-fired power plants and 11 hydropower plants in Germany, three hydropower plants in the UK and shares in E.ON AG. Statkraft also received a structured gas storage contract and a power delivery agreement. Statkraft increased its total production capacity by around 2500 MW, and gained 217 new employees for the Group, primarily in connection with the acquired business in Germany and district heating business in Sweden. Following the deal, Statkraft became one of the four largest power generators in Sweden. Increased flexible power production in Germany and the UK reinforces Statkraft’s position as a significant player in Northern Europe and provides the company with a solid platform for future growth in these core markets. Prior to the transaction, E.ON AG owned 55.365% of E.ON Sverige AB, while Statkraft AS owned 44.631% and other shareholders owned 0.004%. The transaction triggered a major increase in the value of Statkraft’s investment in E.ON Sverige AB, and at the same time converted these values to a 100% shareholding in strategic assets in core markets. In addition, some of the value was transferred to shares in E.ON AG, corresponding to around EUR 2180 million.

The voting rights in the companies that were acquired correspond to the shareholdings. The swap deal took place at fair value and cash was not included in the settlement with the exception of the final settlement of NOK 2602 million which was settled in 2009. The purchase price allocation was made by the Group’s own specialists and management, in collaboration with external experts. The total value of the swap deal was NOK 45 635 million. The calculation of the fair value of assets and liabilities included in the swap deal was allocated as follows: Assets Balance sheet Excess Recognised Recognised fair value on the fair fair value value – preliminary NOK million acquisition date value – final 31 Dec. 2008 Goodwill 235 151 386 425 Property, plant and equipment 4 859 12 273 17 132 17 132 Investments in associates and joint ventures 196 196 181 Other non-current financial assets 21 285 1 840 23 125 23 125 Non-current assets 26 575 14 264 40 839 40 863 Cash and cash equivalents 339 339 339 Receivables 3 464 3 464 2 883 Inventories 73 73 73 Derivatives 1 350 358 1 708 1 708 Current assets 5 226 358 5 584 5 003 Acquired assets 31 802 14 622 46 424 45 866 Other interest-free liabilities 555 555 405 Deferred tax 128 106 234 115 Liabilities 683 106 789 520 Net value of acquired assets 31 119 14 516 45 635 45 346 Costs in connection with the swap deal amounted to NOK 100 million, which were mainly expensed. Goodwill arising on the purchase amounted to NOK 386 million with NOK 151 million derived from the district heating business in Sweden and NOK 235 million from the hydropower and gas power plants in Germany and the UK. Other goodwill was related to synergies and expected future earnings capacity that had been identified without being able to link the value to other intangible assets, as well as the recognition of deferred tax liabilities at nominal value. If the swap deal with E.ON AG had been completed on 1 January 2008, the consolidated sales revenues would have been NOK 30 812 million, and the net profit NOK 7681 million. Management has adjusted for the following matters to arrive at these pro forma figures: • added sales revenues and the result for the acquired entities in Sweden, Germany and the UK as well as estimated amortisation on the fair value adjustments • added its share of the dividend from E.ON AG for 2008 • excluded the share of profit from the investment in E.ON Sverige AB • excluded the profit from sale of shares under the terms of the swap deal with E.ON AG • adjusted for costs in connection with the acquisition 34 Statkraft annual report 2009 group financial statements Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report 05 CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES Shares in consolidated companies Registered Shareholding Name office Country Parent company and voting rights Statkraft Energi AS Oslo Norway Statkraft AS 100.00% Baltic Cable AS Malmø Sweden Statkraft Energi AS 66.67% Statkraft Carbon Invest AS Oslo Norway Statkraft AS 100.00% Statkraft Financial Energy AB Stockholm Sweden Statkraft AS 100.00% Statkraft Germany GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft AS 100.00% Statkraft Markets GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft Germany GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Markets Hungaria LLC Budapest Hungary Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft South East Europe EOOD Sofia Bulgaria Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Markets GmBH Slovakian branch Bratislava Slovakia Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Romania SRL Bucharest Romania Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Energy Austria GmbH Vienna Austria Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Markets BV Amsterdam The Netherlands Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Markets Financial Services GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Holding Knapsack GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Knapsack Power GmbH & Co KG Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft Holding Knapsack GmbH 100.00% Knapsack Power Verwaltungs GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Knapsack Power GmbH & Co KG 100.00% Statkraft Holding Herdecke GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Trading GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Germany Drei GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Germany Vier GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Statkraft Germany Fünf GmbH Düsseldorf Germany Statkraft Markets GmbH 100.00% Yeşil Enerji Üretim Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş.

The aim is to achieve a more flexible and dynamic organisation where new priorities and growth areas can be highlighted and achieve visibility as separate business units with clear performance targets. At the same time, the organisation model creates a foundation for an effective management and control structure. Generation and Markets The Generation and Markets segment is the largest segment, responsible for the operation and maintenance of hydropower plants and gas power plants in Europe, as well as physical and financial trading in energy and energy-related products in Europe. These business units are organised into one segment due to the close integration between operations, maintenance and energy optimisation. Wind Power Wind Power is responsible for developing, constructing, operating and following up the ownership of onshore and offshore wind farms in Norway and the rest of Europe, as well as developing and commercialising offshore wind power technology. Emerging Markets Emerging Markets is responsible for managing and further developing ownership positions outside Europe, and mainly comprises the investment in SN Power. In addition, Theun Hinboun Power Company (THPC) is managed on behalf of Statkraft SF. THPC is not included in the segment’s financial figures. Skagerak Energi Activities in Skagerak Energi are followed up as a joint activity by management and reported as a separate segment. This segment focuses on the generation and sale of power and district heating, and distribution grid activities. Other activities involve fibre, natural gas distribution and electrical contractor and settlement activities. Customers Customers comprises the distribution grid, district heating and power sales activities performed by Trondheim Energi. Industrial ownership Industrial Ownership is responsible for managing and further developing Norwegian shareholdings where Statkraft has industrial ambitions. The segment comprises Fjordkraft, Bergenshalvøens Kommunale Kraftselskap (BKK) and Agder Energi. Other Other includes the business units Southeast Europe Hydro, Solar Power, Small-Scale Hydro, Innovation and Growth, along with the shareholding in E.ON AG, group functions and eliminations. 36 Statkraft annual report 2009 group financial statements Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report Accounting specification per segment The Statkraft Group had the following accounting figures in the most important segments.

Statkraft annual report 2009 group financial statements 37 Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report 07 SALES REVENUES Statkraft optimises its hydropower generation based on an assessment of the value of available water in relation to actual and expected future spot prices. This is done irrespective of contracts entered into. In the event that Statkraft has physical contractual obligations to supply power that deviate from actual output, the difference is either bought or sold on the spot market. Necessary spot purchases are recorded as a correction to power sales. Physical and financial contracts are used to hedge underlying production in the form of purchase and sales positions. Sales positions are taken to hedge the price of a specific part of the planned future output. Purchasing positions are taken to adjust the hedging level if asTotalptions change and Statkraft considers its hedged position to be too high. All contracts are recognised as adjustments to the underlying revenue from production based on the margin between the contract price and the spot price (system price for financial contracts).

The corresponding figure for 2008 was 2460. The increase in the number of employees is a result of the acquisition of SN Power as well as the fact that the Group is in a growth phase with many exploration, engineering and development projects. This, together with an increase in the number of employees following the swap deal with E.ON AG on 31 December 2008, explains the general increase in costs. Pension costs are described in further detail in Note 12. Statkraft annual report 2009 group financial statements 39 Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report 12 PENSIONS DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES Occupational pension schemes in the Group Employees in the Group’s Norwegian companies participate in public service occupational pension schemes in accordance with the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund Act, the Norwegian Public Pension Service Pension Fund Transfer Agreement and the regulatory framework governing public service pensions. 2641 employees and 1260 pensioners were covered by benefit schemes as of 31 December 2009. Skagerak Energi holds its pension plans in a separate pension fund. Fjordkraft AS employees are members of BKK’s pension fund. With the exception of Småkraft AS, the rest of the Norwegian companies in the Group operate their pension plans through the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund (SPK). SN Power has pension schemes in the SPK and in Nordea Liv. Pension payments from the SPK are guaranteed by the Norwegian state (Section 1 of the Norwegian Pension Act). The occupational pension schemes cover retirement, disability, surviving spouse and child’s pension. The retirement schemes provide pension benefits amounting to 66% of pensionable income, up to 12G (12 times the National Insurance Scheme’s basic amount). Pension scheme benefits are coordinated with the benefits provided by the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. The majority of the companies also offer early retirement from the age of 62 under the Norwegian early retirement pension scheme. Companies with schemes in the SPK pay an annual premium and are responsible for the financing of the scheme. The SPK scheme is not asset-based, but management of the pension fund assets (fictitious assets) is simulated as though the assets were invested in government bonds. In this simulation it is assumed that the bonds are held to maturity. The pension assets are guaranteed by the Norwegian state. Up to 35% of the pension fund assets can be invested in the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, which is a real fund where yields are linked to the market situation. Employees who leave the company before pensionable age receive a deferred pension entitlement. In schemes that are part of SPK, participating companies are not responsible for these obligations. Deferred entitlements in Skagerak Energi's Pension Fund and for Fjordkraft AS in BKK’s pension fund are carried forward as a pension fund liability. There are separate fund-based benefit schemes for the employees in Germany and the UK who were transferred in connection with the swap deal with E.ON AG. The schemes include retirement, disability, spouse and children’s pensions. Unsecured pension obligations In addition to the above, some Group companies in Norway have entered into pension agreements that provide all employees whose pensionable incomes exceed 12G with a retirement and disability pension equivalent to 66% of that portion of their pensionable income exceeding 12G. Some members of the Group management have spouse and children's pension agreements. In addition, Statkraft has a survivor's pension scheme, which is a continuation of the Statkraft Pension Fund. This scheme ceased to exist in 2003. The pensions are funded out of the company’s operations. Employees who leave the company before pensionable age receive a deferred pension entitlement for the scheme above 12G. Actuarial calculations The present value of defined benefit pension liabilities and the current year’s accrued pension entitlements are calculated using the accrued benefits method. The net present value of pension benefits accrued at the balance sheet date adjusted for expected future salary increases until pensionable age is based on best estimate assumptions as of 31 December 2009. Calculations are based on staff numbers and salary data at the end of the year. Actuarial gains and losses in 2009 are mainly due to updated assumptions, membership, actual wage increases and return on assets. Explanation of the background for selected assumptions/risk table The discount rate is set at 4.4% for Norwegian pension schemes and is calculated as a weighted average of the risk-free interest rate until the time when payments are expected to be made. Salary adjustments for Norwegian schemes are mainly calculated as the total of the expected nominal salary increase of 1.75%, inflation of 2.25% and career progression increase of 0.25%, with some minor adaptations. For the majority of the Norwegian schemes, adjustment of current pensions follows the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme's basic amount (G). For demographic factors the K2005, GAP07 and IR73 tariffs are used to establish mortality and disability risks. The stipulation of parameters which apply to foreign defined-benefit schemes is adapted to local conditions. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES Group companies in Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Belgium operate defined contribution schemes in accordance with local legislation.

The market value of these properties has been assessed at NOK 212 million, and the book value is NOK 16 million. Market value has been established on the basis of financial considerations in the form of cash flow analyses performed by an independent broker in 2009. This was primarily based on local market knowledge gained from reviewing the individual properties’ abilities to generate current and future rental income, along with the properties’ development potential, location, condition and knowledge of the buyers’ required rate of return. Property, plant and equipment includes leased waterfall rights where power plants are owned and operated by the lessee. At the end of the lease agreement, Statkraft has mainly the right to acquire the plant facilities at a technical value. 19 ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES Companies recognised in accordance with the equity method.

Most of the financial instruments can be categorised into the two main categories of financial activities and energy trading. Financial instruments used in financial activities primarily consist of loans, interest rate and currency swaps, forward interest agreements and forward exchange contracts. Financial instruments in energy trading mainly consist of financial and physical agreements relating to purchase and sale of power, gas, oil, coal, CO2 quotas, contracts with volume options, as well as embedded derivatives in physical energy sales agreements. In addition to the above, other financial instruments exist in the form of accounts receivable, accounts payable, cash, short-term financial investments and equity investments. A range of financial instruments are used within the area of finance as part of a financial hedging strategy without, however, satisfying the formal requirements for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39. The hedged items are often assets in foreign currency, future cash flows or financial instruments valued at amortised cost with equal effective interest over the term of the instrument, while hedging instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in value recognised through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of financial instruments will result in a significant degree of volatility in the income statement without fully reflecting the financial realities. Hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS has been used in certain cases. This applies to selected loan arrangements where the interest rate has been swapped from fixed to floating rates (fair value hedging), to the hedging of net investments in a foreign unit and to cash flow hedging. Financial derivatives and changes in value for these are presented in separate lines in the balance sheet and income statement. Significant use is made of financial instruments in energy trading activities. A number of financial instruments are also in use as part of a financial strategy where the Group continuously optimises future income from parts of the expected production volume. Hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 is not used as this will not necessarily be able to show the underlying economic reality for the entire portfolio. Some energy derivatives are embedded derivatives that are components of physical contracts that are not as such covered by IAS 39. Energy derivatives are valued at fair value with changes in value being recognised through profit or loss. In light of the significant volumes associated with such contracts, changes in value of the contracts will result in major volatility in the balance sheet and income statement, without this fully reflecting the underlying business. Energy contracts and changes in value for these are presented in separate lines in the balance sheet and income statement. Statkraft annual report 2009 group financial statements 53 Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report 30 HEDGE ACCOUNTING General description of hedge accounting at Statkraft Fair-value hedging Three loan arrangements are treated as fair value hedges. Issued bond loans have been designated as hedging objects in the hedging relationships, and the associated interest swap agreements have been designated as hedging instruments. The opportunities for further hedge accounting through fair value hedging are assessed on an ongoing basis as new borrowings are taken out and hedging contracts are established, as well as by continuously assessing the hedging efficiency of the hedging relationships. When hedging efficiency can be documented, hedge accounting will normally be used. Hedging of net investments in foreign entities Some investments in subsidiaries of SN Power have been subject to hedge accounting. One hedging relationship remains as of 31 December 2009. Cash flow hedging Some of the project financing in foreign subsidiaries has been swapped from floating interest to fixed interest. The opportunities for other hedge accounting are assessed on an ongoing basis on the finance side. Hedge accounting will normally be used in cases where the efficiency of hedging can be documented. As regards energy production, Statkraft has concluded that hedge accounting does not necessarily provide sufficient equalisation in the recognised result. Consequently, no on-going assessment is made of opportunities to document hedge accounting connected to power production. Detailed description of fair value hedging The hedging objects are issued fixed-interest bonds with a total nominal value of EUR 1200 million. The hedging instruments are interest swap agreements with a nominal value of EUR 1200 million, entered into with major banks as the counterparties. The agreements swap interest rate from fixed to floating 6-month and 3-month EURIBOR. The hedging relationships have been established to reduce interest risk. The critical terms of the hedging object and hedging instrument are deemed to be approximately the same, and 90–100% hedging efficiency is assumed. The inefficiency is recognised in the income statement.

The fair value of other energy derivatives has been calculated using valuation techniques and discounting of expected future cash flows. Below is a description of assumptions and parameters that have been applied in the determination of fair value. Electricity price Energy exchange contracts are valued at official closing rates at the balance sheet date. The closing rates are discounted. Other bilateral electricity contracts are valued on the basis of a market price curve. Closing rates on energy exchanges are used for contracts with terms between 0 and 5 years. For time horizons exceeding 5 years, the price is adjusted with expected inflation in line with the inflation target of the central banks. Some contracts are linked to area prices. These contracts are valued using the official closing rates on energy exchanges. Separate models are used for regional prices without official closing prices. If the contracts extend beyond the horizon quoted on energy exchanges, the price is adjusted for the expected rate of inflation. Raw materials Statkraft has gas contracts where the references for the contract price include the price development of gas, coal and oil products. Several energy contracts have contract prices which refer to the price development of various commodities. These are valued using forward prices from relevant commodity exchanges and major financial institutions. If quotes are not available for the entire time period, the commodity prices are adjusted for inflation based on the most recent quoted price in the market. CO2 CO2 contracts are priced based on the forward price of EUA quotas and CER quotas. Statkraft uses the closing rate on commodity exchanges to price CO2 contracts. For post-Kyoto contracts, the price in the last traded contract is used in the valuation of the contracts. Foreign currency Several energy contracts have prices in different currencies. For these contracts, relevant market prices have been obtained from Reuters and major financial institutions. If there are no quotes for the entire time period in question, the interest parity is used to calculate exchange rates. Interest rates The market interest rate curve (swap interest rate) is used as a basis for discounting derivatives. This is obtained from major financial institutions. In cases where the credit risk is relevant, the interest rate curve is adjusted upwards. This applies to all external bilateral contracts classified as assets and liabilities. 54 Statkraft annual report 2009 group financial statements Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report Fair value of currency and interest rate derivatives The fair value of interest swap agreements, currency swap agreements and forward currency exchange contracts is determined using valuation techniques where expected future cash flows are discounted to present value. Expected cash flows are calculated and discounted using observed market interest rates for the various currencies (swap interest rate curve) and observed foreign currency rates. The valuation of forward currency exchange contracts is based on observed exchange rates, from which the forward exchange rate is extrapolated. Estimated present value is subjected to a test of reasonableness against calculations made by the counterparties to the contracts. Fair value of financial investments Certificates and bonds Certificates and bonds are valued at quoted prices. Shares Equity investments are valued at quoted prices where such are available and the securities are liquid. Other securities are valued using valuation techniques and by discounting expected future cash flows. Fair value of equity investments in the CO2 fund Equity investments in the CO2 fund are voluntarily designated at fair value through profit or loss and are valued using valuation techniques and by discounting expected future cash flows. Assumptions concerning the number of quotas that will be distributed by the fund are a discretionary estimate. The price assumption is described under CO2 above. Fair value of long-term liabilities, first year’s instalment on long-term liabilities and certificate loans The fair value is calculated on the basis of valuation techniques where expected future cash flows are discounted to present value. Expected cash flows are calculated and discounted using observed market interest rates and exchange rates for the various currencies (swap interest rate curve) adjusted upwards for credit risk.

Level 2: Other data than the quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for assets or liabilities either directly, i.e. as prices, or indirectly, i.e. derived from prices. Level 3: Data for the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data.

Market risk is the risk that a financial instrument’s fair value or future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices. Market risk primarily relates to electricity price risk, CO2 prices, gas price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Risk management at Statkraft focuses on portfolios of contracts rather than on specific contracts in accordance with IAS 39. Internal guidelines for market exposure have been established for all portfolios. Responsibility for continual monitoring of granted mandates and frameworks lies with independent organisational units. The frameworks for trading in both financial and physical contracts are continually monitored and regularly reported. The following section contains a more detailed account of the various types of market risk, and how these are managed. DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS PORTFOLIOS AND THE RISK MANAGEMENT OF THE PORTFOLIOS Nordic hydropower The Nordic hydropower portfolio is intended to cover hydropower production in the Nordic region and its associated risk. All financial and some physical contracts are recognised at fair value. The physical contracts that are valued at fair value are contracts with volume options and embedded derivatives. Net exposure in this portfolio is derived from continually updated production forecasts, purchase and sale commitments under long-term physical contracts, as well as contracts traded via energy exchanges and bilateral financial contracts. The physical sales commitments include statutory-priced industrial contracts, long-term sales contracts, concessionary power obligations, as well as miscellaneous free power and compensation power contracts. The majority of the statutory-priced industrial contracts will 56 Statkraft annual report 2009 group financial statements Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report expire prior to 2011. The long-term contracts have varying terms, but the longest runs until 2030. Concessionary power agreements run in perpetuity. For certain of these sales obligations, the price is indexed to other market risks such as metals and foreign currency (embedded derivatives). The financial contracts are both contracts traded via energy exchanges and bilateral contracts. These generally have terms of less than five years, though some financial contracts run until 2020. Some of the perpetual concessionary power agreements have been renegotiated to financial settlement for shorter terms. Statkraft is exposed to both price and volume risk, because both future price and water inflow are unknown. Mandates are based on annual volume thresholds and the ratio to available production. The objective of the portfolio management is to optimise portfolio revenues and in addition reduce the portfolio risk. The risk is quantified using simulations of various scenarios for relevant risk factors. Continental assets The assets in this portfolio are Baltic Cable AB, the gas power plants and other continental assets. The purpose of the portfolio is to manage energy production in continental Europe, including the gas-fired power plant at Kårstø, as well as associated risks. The contract portfolio consists of financial and physical contracts relating to these assets. All financial contracts as well as several physical contracts are recognised at fair value. The Group has shareholdings in five gas-fired power plants, four in Germany and one in Norway, and has in this connection entered into long-term supply contracts for natural gas. The purchase price for these contracts is indexed to coal and oil. The duration of the agreements differ. The gas agreements are mainly considered to be for own use except for contracts where the gas is resold and are therefore recognised at fair value in accordance with IAS 39. The financial contracts in the portfolio are forward contracts for electricity, CO2, oil products, gas and coal. The price development in the spot market for electricity, gas, the underlying commodities that are included in the indexing of the gas contracts, and CO2 therefore affect the earnings of the gas-fired power plants. Statkraft engages in trading in accordance with the applicable mandates by locking in earnings when electricity prices are attractive relative to gas prices plus CO2 costs. In addition, Statkraft also engages in financial trading to maximise the revenues from Baltic Cable. The market risk in the portfolio is derived from the future market prices for electricity, CO2, gas, coal and oil products. Mandates are based on annual volume thresholds and available production. The objective of the portfolio management is to optimise portfolio revenues and in addition reduce the portfolio risk. The risk is quantified using simulations of various scenarios for relevant risk factors. Trading and origination Statkraft has various portfolios for trading and origination that are managed independently of the company’s expected electricity production. Trading teams have been established in Oslo, Trondheim, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Düsseldorf. The portfolios act in the market with the aim of realising gains on changes in the market value of energy and energy-related products, as well as gains on non-standardised contracts. All trading and origination contracts are recognised at fair value in accordance with IAS 39.5 and 39.6. The trading activities involve buying and selling standardised and traded products. Electricity and CO2 products, as well as green certificates, gas and oil products are traded. The contracts in the trading portfolio have durations ranging from 0 to 5 years. Origination portfolios include both standardised products and structured contracts. Structured products may be energy contracts with a special duration, long-term contracts or energy contracts in different currencies. The portfolio also trades in transport capacity across national boundaries and includes virtual power plant contracts. Quoted, traded contracts such as system price, regional prices and foreign currency are generally used to reduce the risk involved in trading in structured products and contracts. The majority of the contracts in the portfolio have a duration of up to five years, though some contracts run until 2018. Statkraft has allocated risk capital for the trading and origination business. Clear guidelines have been established for the types of products that are allowed to be traded. The mandates for trading and origination activities are adhered to through specified limits for Value-at-Risk and Profit-at-Risk. Both methods calculate the maximum potential loss a portfolio can incur, with a given probability factor over a given period of time. Credit risk and operational risk are also quantified in connection with the allocated risk capital. FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK In relation to financial activities, Statkraft is exposed to two main types of market risk; foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. Statkraft’s methods for managing these risks are described below. Foreign exchange risk Statkraft incurs currency risk in the form of transaction risk mainly in connection with energy sales revenues, investments and dividend from subsidiaries and associates in foreign currency. Balance sheet risk is related to shareholdings in foreign subsidiaries in Belgium, the UK, Sweden, Turkey and Germany as well as in SN Power which uses USD as its functional currency. There is also balance sheet risk in connection with investment in some associates. The operational currency for Statkraft's trading on energy exchanges is EUR, which means that all contracts that are entered into via energy exchanges are denoted in EUR and are thus exposed to EUR. A corresponding currency exposure is incurred in connection with energy trading on other exchanges in other currencies than EUR. Statkraft hedges its currency exposure related to cash flows from energy sales of physical contracts and financial trading on energy exchanges, investments, dividends and other currency exposures in accordance with the company's financial strategy. Exposure hedging is achieved by using financial derivatives and loans in foreign currencies as hedging instruments. Few of the hedging relationships fulfil the requirements of hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39. Compliance with the limit for currency risk is followed up continuously by the independent middle-office function. Responsibility for entering into and following up positions is subject to divisions of responsibility and is allocated to separate organisational units. The currency exposure in relation to established frameworks in the finance strategy is regularly reported to Group management via the CFO. Interest rate risk Most of Statkraft’s interest rate risk exposure relates to the loan portfolio. An interest rate management framework has been established based on a mix between fixed and floating interest rates. The objective is to ensure that most of the net loan portfolio Statkraft annual report 2009 group financial statements 57 Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of Cash Flow Statement of Changes in Equity Notes Auditor's Report is exposed to floating interest rates, but that up to 50% of the loan portfolio can be exposed to fixed interest rates. As a rule fixed interest rates shall apply for a period of more than five years. The strategy for managing interest rate risk is established based on an objective of achieving the most cost-efficient financing, coupled with the aim of a certain stability and predictability in finance costs. A management framework has also been established to limit the interest rate exposure in currencies other than NOK. The currency positions that are to be entered into are assessed on an ongoing basis, given the market conditions observed for the currency and the overall exposure that exists for that currency. Compliance with the limit for currency risk is followed up continuously by the independent middle-office function. Responsibility for entering into and following up positions is subject to divisions of responsibility and is allocated to separate organisational units. The interest rate exposure per currency in relation to established frameworks in the finance strategy is regularly reported to Group management via the CFO. Use of interest rate and foreign currency instruments Statkraft uses interest rate and foreign currency instruments in its management of the company’s interest rate and foreign exchange exposure. Interest rate and currency swaps, forward interest rate agreements and forward contracts are used to achieve the desired currency and interest rate structure for the company’s loan portfolio. Forward currency contracts are also used to hedge cash flows denominated in foreign currency. 33 ANALYSIS OF MARKET RISK Statkraft’s main activities are the generation and trading of electrical power. In a market in which hydropower plays an important role, and where the supply of water varies a great deal from year to year, price and generating capacity will also vary considerably. As regards the gas power business, Statkraft is exposed to the price difference between the gas price and CO2 and energy price (“clean spark spread”). Statkraft makes considerable use of forward contracts and other financial instruments to optimise its revenues. Market risk connected with energy optimisation thus covers volume risk, electricity price risk in the spot market and risk connected with positions in financial instruments. Market positions are also taken in connection with the Trading and Origination portfolios. Statkraft quantifies risk as deviations from expected post-tax results with a given confidence level. Market risk is included in these calculations, which are used both in the follow-up of the business areas/portfolios and at Group level as part of reporting to Group management and the board. Statkraft’s targets for market risk shall have a 95% probability of covering all potential losses (deviations from expected results) connected with the market risk of positions at the balance sheet date during the course of a year. Uncertainty in the underlying instruments/prices and their interrelatedness are calculated using statistical methods. The time period for the calculations is one year. For contracts with exposure of more than one year, only the uncertainty relating to the current year is reflected in the calculations. The exposure can take the form of actual exposure or an expected maximum utilisation of frameworks. The model also takes into account covariation, both within the individual areas and between the areas. Total market risk as of 31 December 2009 was calculated at NOK 1213 million, where the main risk relates to energy optimisation. Reduced market risk for energy optimisation explains most of the change from 2008. The risk related to energy optimisation varies substantially over a period of time as a result of uncertainty and the energy price level and production volumes. The reduction in the risk for energy optimisation from 31 December 2008 to 31 December 2009 must be seen in the context of lower expected revenues and the fact that the downside risk has been reduced. The diversification effect emerges as the difference between total market risk in the specified areas and total market risk, where the correlation between e.g. energy prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates is taken into account. There is a minor reduction in diversification effects measured in NOK, but as the reduction in market risk before diversification effects is significantly higher, the diversification effect increases as a percentage.

CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of a party to a financial instrument inflicting a financial loss on the other party by not fulfilling its obligations. Statkraft assumes counterparty risk in connection with energy trading and physical sales, when placing surplus liquidity and when trading in financial instruments. It is assumed that no counterparty risk exists for financial energy contracts which are settled through an energy exchange. For all other energy contracts entered into, the limits are stipulated for the individual counterparty using an internal credit rating. The counterparties are allocated to different categories. The internal credit rating is based on financial key figures. Bilateral contracts are subject to limits for each counterparty as regards volume, amount and duration. Statkraft also has a separate category for counterparties with which the Group will not engage for ethical reasons. In order to reduce credit risk, bank guarantees are used in some cases when entering into agreements. The bank which issues the guarantee must be an internationally rated commercial bank. Parent company guarantees are also used. In such cases, the parent company is assessed and classified in the normal way. Subsidiaries will naturally never be rated higher than the parent company. In connection with bank guarantees and parent company guarantees, the counterparty will be classified in the same category as the issuer of the guarantee. Statkraft has netting agreements with several of its energy trading counterparties. In the event of default, the netting agreements give a right to a final settlement where all future contract positions are netted and settled. Placement of surplus liquidity is mainly divided among institutions rated BBB+ or better. For financial instruments, loss exposure is calculated in the event of breach of contract by the counterparty. Statkraft has entered into agreements relating to interim cash settlement of the market value of financial instruments with most of its counterparties (cash collateral), significantly reducing counterparty exposure in connection with these agreements. Statkraft has good follow-up routines for ensuring that outstanding receivables are paid as agreed. Customer lists sorted by age are followed up continuously. If a contractual counterparty experiences payment problems, special procedures are applied. The risk of counterparties not being able to meet their obligations is considered to be limited. Historically, Statkraft's losses on receivables have been limited. The individual counterparty exposure limits are monitored continuously and reported regularly. In addition, the counterparty risk is quantified by combining exposure with the probability of the individual counterparty defaulting. The overall counterparty risk is calculated and reported for all relevant units, in addition to being consolidated at the Group level and included in the Group risk management. Statkraft's gross credit risk exposure corresponds to the recognised value of financial assets, which are found in the various notes to the balance sheet. Statkraft has provided parent company guarantees for subsidiaries and associates (Note 39). The maximum credit risk exposure does not exceed the already recognised value of financial assets. Gross exposure to credit risk in financial assets is partly reduced through collateral. To the extent that relevant and substantial collateral has been provided, this has been presented below.

Cash collateral is settled on a weekly basis and will therefore not always be settled on 31 December. There could therefore be an outstanding credit risk at the year-end. Frameworks for exposure to individual counterparties have been adopted in the case of short-term financial investments. All cash and cash equivalents are receivables due from banks. LIQUIDITY RISK Statkraft assumes a liquidity risk because the term of its financial obligations is not matched to the cash flows generated by its assets, and because of variations in security requirements linked to both financial contracts in the forward market (energy exchanges) and cash collateral requirements. Statkraft has good borrowing opportunities from the Norwegian and European money markets and in the banking market. Drawdown facilities have been established to secure access to short-term financing. Statkraft’s drawdown facilities are large enough to cover outstanding certificate liabilities at any time. A guarantee framework has been established to cope with significant fluctuations in the collateral required for financial contracts in the forward market required by Nord Pool. Statkraft has a liquidity capacity target of between 1.5 and 4.0. Liquidity capacity in this context is defined as cash and cash equivalents, plus committed drawdown facilities, overdrafts and projected receipts for the next six months divided by projected payments for the next six months. The finance department prepares the liquidity forecasts, which are important for daily liquidity management and for planning future financing requirements. The liquidity reserve is a tool for the finance department’s risk management and functions as a buffer in relation to the liquidity forecast. The liquidity reserve consists of the company’s cash and cash equivalents, committed drawdown facilities and overdraft facilities. Cash and cash equivalents are intended to cover normal fluctuations in the company’s cash flow. Committed drawdown facilities will be Statkraft’s buffer against unforeseen events with significant cash flow consequences. An individual target figure for shortterm liquidity capacity, which reflects Statkraft’s ability to cover its future obligations, is included in the Group’s balanced scorecard.

Tools for long-term management of capital structure primarily are primarily comprised by the draw down and repayment of long-term liabilities and payments of share capital from/to the owner. The Group endeavours to obtain external financing from various capital markets. The Group is not subject to any external requirements with regard to the management of capital structure other than those relating to the market’s expectations and the owner’s dividend requirements. There were no changes in the Group’s targets and guidelines governing the management of capital structure in 2009. The most important target figure for the Group’s management of capital structure is long-term credit rating. Statkraft AS has a long-term credit rating of A(negative outlook) from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 (stable outlook) from Moody’s. In the short and medium term, Statkraft's goal is to maintain its current rating, and BBB+/Baa1 as a minimum. In the longer term, the goal is to achieve a stable A-level rating with both Standard & Poor's and Moody’s.

If the invoiced amount is lower than the revenue ceiling, this results in surplus income, while if the invoiced amount is higher this generates a revenue shortfall. Revenue surpluses/ shortfalls will even out over time as actual invoicing is adjusted. Revenues are recognised in the accounts based on actual invoicing.

For information about salaries and payroll costs for the Group management and the board of directors, see Note 36 in the Group accounts. 03 PENSIONS Group pension schemes The company is obliged to operate an occupational pension scheme under the Norwegian Act on Mandatory Occupational Pension Schemes. Statkraft AS operates an occupational scheme for its employees through the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund (SPK) which meets these requirements. The benefits include retirement, disability, surviving spouse and child’s pensions. For individuals qualifying for the full entitlement, the scheme provides retirement and disability pension benefits amounting to 66% of pensionable income, up to a maximum of 12 times the National Insurance Scheme’s basic amount (G). The company’s employees are also entitled to retire early under the early retirement (AFP) scheme from the age of 62. Pension benefits from the SPK are guaranteed by the Norwegian state (Section 1 of the Pension Act). Statkraft pays an annual premium to the SPK and is responsible for the financing of the scheme. The SPK scheme is, however, not assetbased. Management of the pension fund assets (fictitious assets) is simulated as though the assets were invested in long-term government bonds. In this simulation it is assumed that the bonds are held to maturity. Unsecured pension liabilities Statkraft has in addition to the above schemes entered into agreements that provide employees whose pensionable income exceeds 12G with a retirement and disability pension equivalent to 66% of that portion of their pensionable income exceeding 12G. Agreements have also been entered into that provide some members of Group management with a surviving relative and child pension. In addition, Statkraft AS has a surviving relative scheme, which is a continuation of the Statkraft Pension Fund. This scheme ceased to exist in 2003. These pensions are funded out of the company’s operations.

The accounting treatment adopted for these depends on their purpose as described in the accounting policies note.

Interest rate derivatives, including the interest portion of interest rate and currency swaps, are used to manage the company’s interest rate risk and are recognised as hedging instruments. These are recognised at cost, which is zero, in the balance sheet. Unrealised losses on the part of the loan contract that is swapped are offset against non-recognised, unrealised gains on fi­ xed-interest loans. The fair value stated in the table does not include accrued interest. The currency component of the interest rate and currency swaps is recognised at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. The change in value recognised in the income statement is offset by a comparable change in value of underlying loans in the same currency. The currency futures are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, presented gross and included in the accounting lines Other interestfree liabilities and Receivables 21 RELATED PARTIES Statkraft AS owns shareholdings in a number of companies. For further details, see Note 9. Transactions with these companies are concluded on market terms and conditions.

We place great emphasis on operating and developing our company so that it generates value for the owner, countries and local communities in which we operate. This means always acting responsibly and being a positive contributor in the communities where we have a presence. This section of the annual report documents our actions and results within areas such as business ethics, environment, health and safety and HR.

Our plants normally have a signifi­Statkraft cant impact on the environment and local communities – creating both opportunities and challenges. We channel our efforts and improvement work towards those areas where we have the greatest impact on our surroundings, where the risk of taking a wrong turn is the greatest and the potential consequences are most serious. Environmental impact Our activities are based on the utilisation of natural resources to produce power. Statkraft mainly produces renewable energy without emissions of greenhouse gases. However, all energy production impacts the environment, for instance through interventions in nature and various types of emissions. We show consideration for the environment and work systematically to resolve environmental issues in all activities and processes, including planning, development and operation of power plants. Anti-corruption and good business ethics Statkraft has grown significantly in recent years and is now active in more than 20 countries. At the same time, anti-corruption legislation has been significantly strengthened. This reinforces the need for systematic anti-corruption work and a good understanding of ethical issues, regardless of geographical and organisational boundaries. Health and safety must always be taken into account The growth and increasing diversity within the Group creates more complex challenges for embedding a culture of conduct which always puts health and safety on the top of the agenda. We work to maintain such a culture among employees, contractors and partners. Integrated risk and opportunities Statkraft sees both risks and opportunities related to corporate responsibility. The risk perspective helps us uncover weaknesses and implement mitigation measures. We also believe that accountability and a long-term approach builds trust and creates new opportunities. We therefore greatly emphasise developing systems for project and risk management so that risk and opportunities are identified in a timely fashion. This enables us to embed corporate responsibility more firmly in our day-to-day operations.

Statkraft’s Code of conduct responsibility clearly states that Statkraft will operate in a sustainable manner and develop the company in a manner that generates value for the owners, as well as in the countries and communities in which we operate. Our corporate responsibility work is based on national legislation and internationally recognised principles and guidelines. We also emphasise clear and transparent reporting of our goals and results. Responsibility, principles and management systems Corporate responsibility is a line responsibility, and all employees must act responsibly in their daily work. Statkraft’s Code of conduct describes the fundamental principles for corporate responsibility and ethical conduct in Statkraft. National legislation and international principles Statkraft complies with applicable Norwegian laws and regulations and applicable laws and regulations of the countries where we operate. Furthermore, we use relevant internationally recognised standards as the basis in our work to ensure that our activities are sustainable as regards the environment, health and safety, ethical conduct, human rights or other areas related to corporate responsibility. Supplier follow-up Statkraft’s procurement guidelines ensure equal treatment of suppliers and contain clear requirements as regards environment, health and safety. Particularly important and vulnerable deliveries are subject to more rigorous follow-up through several supplier links. Sustainable project developement Statkraft participates in a number of power development projects, mainly outside of Norway. Statkraft seeks to develop profitable power plants which will generate lasting economic, social and environmental value to the local communities. Sustainability reporting Statkraft communicates with its stakeholders in an open, accurate and timely manner. Our sustainability reporting is based on the recommendations of the Global Reporting Initiative. Responsibility, Corporate responsibility is a line responsibility, and all employees must act principles and responsibly in their daily work. Statkraft’s Code of conduct describes the fundamental principles for corporate responsibility and ethical conduct in ­management ­systems Statkraft. Follow-up of corporate responsibility Each business unit in Statkraft has an independent responsibility for handling and follow-up of corporate responsibility related to its own activities. Group staff units are responsible for supporting and following-up the business units within business ethics, health and safety, environment and HR, including development, maintenance and implementation of principles and guidelines, as well as facilitation in connection with reporting and follow-up of results. The staff units also have an advisory role vis-à-vis the business units. Statkraft’s Code of conduct The basis for Statkraft’s corporate responsibility and ethical conduct is described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct. More detailed descriptions of Statkraft’s corporate responsibility, and how it will be exercised, can be found in the associated principle Corporate responsibility Statkraft sustainability report 2009 05 documents and guidelines. All documents form part of Statkraft’s management system. Corporate responsibility is included on the Group’s score card and reported regularly to the Group management and board. Sustainability aspects included in the revised project management tool The development of updated project management tools to support Statkraft’s development projects started in 2009. The tools will cover the various phases of a project and clearly define checklists and milestones for all sustainability areas, including anticorruption, human rights, health and safety and social responsibility. Recertification in accordance with ISO 14001 In 2009, the Group was recertified in accordance with the environmental management system ISO 14001:2004, but the activities outside Scandinavia are not currently included in the certificate. The plan is to achieve certification for all parts of the Group from 2011. Health and safety management A system for managing the Group’s health and safety work, based on the guidelines in OHSAS 18001, was implemented in 2009. Common indicators and uniform reporting and follow-up of nonconformities are key system elements. Statkraft complies with applicable Norwegian laws and regulations and National legislation and applicable laws and regulations of the countries where we operate. international principles Furthermore, we use relevant internationally recognised standards as the basis in our work to ensure that our activities are sustainable as regards the environment, health and safety, ethical conduct, human rights or other areas related to corporate responsibility. Laws and regulations Statkraft complies with applicable Norwegian laws and regulations and applicable laws and regulations of the countries where we operate. If there are differences between applicable laws, regulations and Statkraft’s governing documents, we follow the norm which set the highest standards of behavior. We use and apply internationally recognised standards Statkraft is growing internationally, and some of the growth takes place in areas where the standards for sustainable conduct differ from the standards in our domestic market. This is challenging and sets high standards for employees, contractors and partners. To ensure that the company operates in a sustainable manner, we use and apply internationally recognised standards and guidelines as the basis for our work. Statkraft is a member of the Global Compact and follows the ten principles regarding human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption, as well as the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Our work in development projects emphasise the International Finance Corporation’s standards as regards sustainable conduct. International forums Statkraft is active in several international fora in the area of climate and energy policy, for example the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the International Hydropower Association (IHA) and Eurelectric. Statkraft is also a member of Transparency International, an organisation dedicated to fighting corruption all over the world Corporate responsibility Statkraft sustainability report 2009 06 Supplier Statkraft’s procurement guidelines ensure equal treatment of suppliers and follow-up contain clear requirements as regards environment, health and safety. Particularly important and vulnerable deliveries are subject to more rigorous follow-up through several supplier links. Supplier requirements Statkraft wants to primarily use suppliers that have been approved in the Scandinavian energy industry’s qualification scheme, Sellihca, which includes about 2000 approved suppliers. All suppliers are treated equally, in accordance with the requirements incompetition legislation and our own ethical guidelines. Our decentralised operational structure makes it natural to use local suppliers for some deliveries. Statkraft’s suppliers are familiarised with our Code of conduct and ethical guidelines during tender processes and when signing contracts. These define clear requirements and standards as regards environment and health and safety. Follow-up of suppliers Particularly important and vulnerable deliveries are subject to more rigorous follow-up through several supplier links in the form of company visits and unannounced inspections. A project is underway to further improve the integration of corporate responsibility in all phases of the procurement process. A comprehensive systematic approach will ensure that the correct requirements are applied to Statkraft’s suppliers in all phases of the procurement process, from pre-qualification to follow-up and supervision.

Statkraft seeks to develop profitable power plants which will generate lasting economic, social and environmental value to the local communities. Project planning and implementation All power developments impact the environment and local communities, and the potential negative consequences must be weighed against the positive in all such projects. Power development projects in Statkraft are planned in cooperation with local authorities and experts within areas such as environment, health and safety and social impact. The International Finance Corporation’s performance standards relating to sustainable conduct. are emphasised and set as requirements for several of our projects. The requirements of the standards include carrying out social and environmental impact assessments. In the development of hydropower projects, we also apply the International Hydropower Association’s Sustainability Guidelines and Assessment Protocol to measure the projects’ sustainability performance. Corporate responsibility Statkraft sustainability report 2009 07 Sustainability Statkraft communicates with its stakeholders in an open, accurate and reporting timely manner. Our sustainability reporting is based on the recommendations of the Global Reporting Initiative. Dialogue with stakeholders Statkraft’s Code of conduct mandates that we communicate with our stakeholders in an open, accurate and timely manner. The Group principles specify that environmental and social consequences of the activities must be communicated. Sustainability reporting therefore represents an important and integral part of the company’s annual report. ­Statkraft is engaged in dialogue with many stakeholders, including employees, owners, customers, suppliers, local and regional authorities, voluntary organisations and media. Such dialogue may include: • hearings and information meetings in connection with development projects • regular meetings with local stakeholders in areas where Statkraft is active • project co-operation with voluntary organisations and R&D environments • various questionnaire surveys • internal information meetings and cooperation with trade unions Using GRI as a basis Statkraft’s sustainability reporting is based on GRI’s recommendations for voluntary ­sustainability reporting, including GRI’s ten reporting principles. The principles describe a process to clarify what should be reported and how this reporting should be carried out. Statkraft has developed guidelines for the company’s sustainability reporting which h ­ ighlight all important sustainability aspects in the Group and take into account the requirements and expectations of our most important stakeholders. Statkraft’s sustainability report reflects the most important sustainability issues on the Group level. More detailed information about individual projects and local issues and activities can be found on our website. Verification of sustainability information Statkraft’s information relating to sustainability is to be transparent, relevant and reliable. The company’s external auditor has therefore reviewed the company’s sustainability reporting for 2009, and the management systems and processes on which the reporting is based. The auditor’s work is based on the attestation standards SA 3000 and the AA1000 Assurance Standard (version 2008), where the latter in particular has been developed for attestation of sustainability reporting. The standard not only focuses on the actual report, but also includes an analysis of the management systems and processes which are of key importance to the company’s management of sustainability issues, and which underpin the report. AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard (2008 version) describes principles related to materiality, completeness and involvement of stakeholders. We believe that the reporting practice used in Statkraft fulfils these principles. Result of the verification The auditor’s conclusion from the verification work is set out in the auditor’s statement. In addition, the auditor makes comments and recommendations regarding Statkraft’s further work on sustainability reporting. Anti-corruption work Statkraft sustainability report 2009 08 Anti-corruption Ethical and responsible conduct is of essential importance in Statkraft. work We have established regulations, management structures and training which aim to ensure verifiable ethical conduct in all parts of our activities. A comprehensive integrity program was initiated in 2009, including a revision of the Group’s business principles and the development of a manual and training program in anti-corruption for all employees. Revised business principles – Statkraft’s Code of conduct The Group’s business principles (now ”Statkraft’s Code of conduct”) were revised in 2009. The principles were revised to better reflect the Group’s international scope, the development in the relevant legislation and expectations from the owner and other key stakeholders. Statkraft’s Code of conduct defines the expectations for ethical behaviour and promotes awareness of ethical issues. The Code of conduct is supported by more detailed guidelines and tools. At the beginning of 2010, Statkraft became a member of the UN Global Compact, and the Code of conduct has been formulated to include the Global Compact’s ten principles. Statkraft’s Code of conduct applies to all companies in the Statkraft Group and all individuals employed by Statkraft, regardless of location. The importance of the code of conduct is emphasised by the fact that all employees must actively confirm that they have read the document, while compliance and follow-up is reported regularly. Reference is made to Statkraft’s Code of conduct in all relevant contracts, be they with partners in joint ventures, suppliers, contractors, agents, consultants or partners in mergers and acquisitions. In 2009, SN Power developed and adopted its own Code of conduct. The document encompasses the same topics and maintains the same level as regards the requirements set as Statkraft’s code of conduct, procedures and guidelines. New anti-corruption handbook A practical anti-corruption handbook for employees will be launched in the spring of 2010. The handbook contains an overview of relevant rules and regulations, internal procedures as well as specific examples and challenges in connection with corruption. Interactive training program The development of an interactive anti-corruption training program for all employees was initiated in 2009. By means of practical assignments, the training program highlights relevant corruption issues, using the anti-corruption handbook as a reference. Corresponding training programs are being developed for other areas. Closer follow-up of ethics A new ethics indicator was included in the Group scorecard as of the first quarter of 2010. The indicator will, among other things, reflect the degree to which ethics incidents are recorded and followed up, and highlight the percentage of employees who have read Statkraft’s Code of conduct. No cases reported in 2009 Statkraft encourages employees to report all censurable issues. The Group audit is an independent notification channel with the right and duty to report to the board. No reported cases were recorded in 2009. Human rights / ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Statkraft sustainability report 2009 09 Human rights Statkraft supports and respects, within its sphere of influence, the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, and ensures that it is not complicit in human rights abuses. Companies and human rights Human rights are a set of obligations directed at states, not companies. However, we now know that companies can play a crucial role to play in the protection of human rights. A number of human rights are relevant to Statkraft, for example internationally recognised labour rights, -including the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation gender equality and non-discrimination as well as health and safety for all employees and others involved in Statkraft’s activities. Follow-up of human rights in Statkraft Statkraft greatly emphasises the effects our activities have for society. Potential effects are therefore assessed for all projects to avoid or reduce negative consequences. Statkraft’s commitment to contribute to respect and support human rights is described in Statkraft’s Code of conduct and other governing documents. We emphasise All power production influences the environment through interventions in nature and emissions. However, we greatly emphasise environmental environmental considerations and systematic handling of environmental issues in the considerations development and operation of our power plants. Objectives and obligations Statkraft works to ensure sustainable utilisation of natural resources and we strive towards achieving outstanding environmental performance, locally and globally. We use leading international practice as the benchmark for the work we do and the performance we aim for. We use international recognised standards as the basis for the planning, implementation, measuring and reporting of our environmental work. Environmentally friendly energy The production of environmentally friendly energy is Statkraft’s most important environmental contribution. In 2009, 89.1 per cent of Statkraft’s energy production was based on renewable sources. Statkraft is Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy. Greenhouse gases and climate measures Our production of renewable energy is part of the solution to the climate challenges. We also work to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from our activities. In 2009, the sources of these emissions were gas power plants, district heating plants, transport (fuel consumption in own activities as well as business travel by car and airplane) and accidents (halon and SF6 emissions). Nature management Protection of biodiversity through environmentally adapted operation of the power plants is an important part of Statkraft’s environmental work. Energy and resource consumption In 2009, Statkraft consumed 1359 GWh of electricity, excluding energy loss in transformer stations and power lines. The energy consumption related to pumped storage power and electric boilers, 908 GWh, has been included in this figure. All electricity used to operate plants and offices has been certified as renewable in accordance with RECS. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Statkraft sustainability report 2009 10 Waste management In 2009, Statkraft generated approximately 39 700 tonnes of hazardous waste. Most of this (39 355 tonnes) is slag, filter dust and filter cake from the district heating plant in Trondheim. All hazardous waste is treated in accordance with applicable regulations. Pollution Pollution from our activities is mainly related to NOx emissions from gas power plants and district heating plants and emissions of SO2 from district heating plants. Environmental incidents Environmental incidents are recorded systematically and reported every month to the Group management and to the board. No serious environmental incidents were recorded in 2009. Objectives and Statkraft works to ensure sustainable utilisation of natural resources and obligations we strive towards achieving outstanding environmental performance, locally and globally. We use leading international practice as the benchmark for the work we do and the performance we aim for. We use international recognised standards as the basis for the planning, implementation, measuring and reporting of our environmental work. Overall guidelines The Environment group policy defines overall guidelines for our environmental work. The policy establish that environmental considerations must characterise all activities, that we must achieve outstanding environmental performance and that we must have a Groupwide environmental management system. This is how we work with environmental issues Our work is based on the precautionary principle and we prepare analyses of environmental risk prior to all activities with a potential negative effect on the surroundings. A major project aiming to develop a comprehensive environmental management system in Statkraft was concluded in 2009. The results from the project include Group-wide guidelines for environmental management with description of requirements related to mapping of environmental risk and impact. In 2009, the Group was recertified in accordance with ISO 14001:2004. For the time being, the activities outside of Scandinavia are not encompassed by the certificate. The plan is to achieve certification for all parts of the Group from 2011. The responsibility for environmental performance lies with the line management and is followed up in all tiers of the organisation. The HSE Group staff has the overall responsibility for the Group’s environmental work, Environmental group policy and Environmental group procedures, further development of the environmental management system and reporting of environmental performance on group level. The HSE Group staff also contributes expertise, advice and recommendations to all parts of the Group to ensure maximum environmental performance. Statkraft is also active on other external arenas, both nationally and internationally, to highlight the company’s environmental profile and to influence processes of importance for future framework conditions. An example of this is the work in the International Hydropower Association (IHA) to develop criteria for sustainable development and operations of hydropower plants. Environmental considerations in project development and procurement Power development projects in Statkraft are planned and carried out in accordance with the requirements in the International Finance Corporation’s performance standards relating to sustainable conduct. For the environmental area, this entails impact analyses (Environmental Impact Assessment, EIA) as regards environmental impact and systematic handling of environmental aspects through the entire project process. In 2009, several such EIA processes were initiated, for example in Albania and Turkey. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Statkraft sustainability report 2009 11 Environmental performance requirements are set for all purchases. The requirements are incorporated in supplier contracts and environmental performance is followed up on a regular basis. Environmentally The production of environmentally friendly energy is Statkraft’s most friendly energy important environmental contribution. In 2009, 89.1 per cent of Statkraft’s energy production was based on renewable sources. Statkraft is Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy.

We trade EUAs (European Union Allowances) and ERUs (Emission Reduction Units). Furthermore, we participate in projects under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean 40 Development Mechanism and JI (Joint Implementation), and buy emission permits directly from such projects. We are also active in the US emission trading market through trading 20 of RGGI allowances (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiatives). We also offer RECS certificates (Renewable Energy Certificate System), a scheme where the customers can buy energy 0 05 06 07 08 09 that is guaranteed to be renewable in return for higher payment.

We also work to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from our activities. In 2009, the sources of these emissions were gas power plants, measures district heating plants, transport (fuel consumption in own activities as well as business travel by car and airplane) and accidents (halon and SF6 emissions). Increased emissions with increased activity The marked increase in the scope of the activities in recent years has resulted in increased emissions – the CO2 emissions in 2009 amounted to 1 600 100 tonnes. The Group buys climate quotas in the voluntary CO2 quota market to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from those of our activities which are not subject to mandatory quota schemes. This applies to fuel consumption, business travel and greenhouse gas emissions as a result of accidents, and amounted to 9400 tonnes of CO2 equivalents in 2009. Gas power plants CO2 emissions from gas power plants amounted to 1 516 500 tonnes. District heating Incineration in district heating plants resulted in the emission of 74 200 tonnes of fossil CO2. The discharges come from nonrenewable waste and some oil. Accidental emissions Minor spills of the greenhouse gases halon and SF6 can result from our activities, and halon also depletes the ozone layer. Halon and SF6 emissions in 2009 corresponded to 3700 tonnes of CO2 equivalents. Transportation Transport contributed 5700 tonnes of CO2 equivalents. We want to reduce the amount of business travel and are facilitating video and conference calls. We also have a program to reduce CO2 emissions from our vehicles. Research into emission of greenhouse gases from water reservoirs Since 2003, Statkraft has been involved in international research into emission of greenhouse gases from water reservoirs. This effort is especially directed towards establishing an internationally recognised measuring method for calculation of net emissions of the greenhouse gas methane. In 2009, studies were made in two older and one planned reservoir in Laos (Theun Hinboun), under the auspices of Statkraft. Preliminary results indicate that manmade emissions from the reservoirs are very small. Customer programs for more efficient use of energy Statkraft’s power sales units offer products, information, advice and tools which support efficient use of energy to both corporate and household customers. For the household customers, we market energy conservation measures in the media and on our website. For corporate customers, our services include web-based tools for overview and planning of optimum energy use. Measures in many areas The climate challenges require both political decisions and practical action on all levels. In addition to contributing through its own activities, Statkraft also wants to participate actively in social and political processes and make a difference for the better. Below is a list of specific climate-related initiatives in 2009 in which Statkraft participated: • KlimaGevinst (ClimateGain) – recommendations for an action plan for how business and industry can contribute to develop the low-emissions society, prepared by 14 Norwegian companies. • Green box Energy Camp – 48 of Norway’s foremost experts gathered to develop projects which can give major, rapid climate effects within 2020.

Comprehensive measures in and around river systems and plants The many environmental activities in connection with river systems include river adaptations, adding suitable spawning and growth gravel, replenishing fish stocks, building fish ladders and improving weirs and minimise the effect of migration barriers. In addition to measures imposed by the license terms, Statkraft implements voluntary measures, often in cooperation with local stakeholders. Statkraft operates seven cultivation facilities, and is a major producer of fish for stock replenishing in Norway. In 2009, we planted 957 000 salmon, sea trout, char and brown trout in Norway and Sweden. In addition, almost 2 million fish eggs were planted. Statkraft is also engaged in extensive monitoring of fish stocks, carries out fish biology studies and operates two of Norway’s three salmon gene banks. Through the Elvelangs project, which will run from 2007 to 2012, Statkraft uses NOK 15 million to improve conditions for fish and outdoor activities in several of the Norwegian river systems where Statkraft is the water flow regulator. The project consists of more than 50 different measures. Examples of activities in 2009 which illustrate the scope of nature management measures: • Follow-up of studies in 20 Norwegian salmon river systems • Benthic fauna studies in five rivers with power plant gates • Reindeer tagging • Revegetation (sowing) of landfills in connection with plants • Assessment of environment and reputational risk in connection with hydropower plants in all of Statkraft’s Norwegian, German and Swedish river systems • Opinions for water area and measure plans in five water regions in Norway, as well as three in Sweden and Germany in connection with the EU’s water framework directive • A research and fish planting project in lake Bjornesfjorden on the Hardangervidda mountain plateau, which has run for several years, was concluded following the documentation of sustainable conditions for trout, 40 years after the spawning grounds were destroyed when the lake was emptied ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Statkraft sustainability report 2009 14 (Altadammen) Increased sea eagle activity on Smøla in spite of killed sea eagles In 2009, seven sea eagles were killed in assumed collisions with wind turbines on Smøla. In total, 28 sea eagles have been killed since the wind farm started operations in 2002. However, recorded observations made by NINA (the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research) show that the number of sea eagle territories in use on Smøla has increased following the completion of the wind farm, and that the centre of gravity for the breeding has moved away from the wind farm. No case against Norway The Norwegian Ornithology Society brought a case against Norway through BirdLife International before the Bern Convention for breaching the purposes of the convention. An investigative inspection took place at Smøla in June, where all affected parties were present together with an expert nominated by the Bern Convention and representatives from the convention’s secretariat. Based on the report from the inspection, the Bern Convention decided not to open a case against Norway, but it has submitted a set of recommendations to the Norwegian authorities. Statkraft is engaged in extensive R&D activities at the wind farm on Smøla in connection with sea eagles and measures to reduce the risk of collisions with rotor blades and towers. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Statkraft sustainability report 2009 15 Energy and resource In 2009, Statkraft consumed 1359 GWh of electricity, excluding energy loss consumption in transformer stations and power lines. The energy consumption related to pumped storage power and electric boilers, 908 GWh, has been included in this figure. All electricity used to operate plants and offices has been certified as renewable in accordance with RECS. A project carried out in 2009 at the Nore and Aura power plant groups has identified an energy savings potential for Statkraft’s power plants in Norway of 30 GWh, mainly through automatic management of lighting, heat and ventilation.

Most of this (39 355 tonnes) is slag, filter dust and filter cake from the district heating plant in Trondheim. All hazardous waste is treated in accordance with applicable regulations. In addition, about 5000 tonnes of other waste was generated, most of which was recovered (materials and heat recovery). The final light fixtures with PCB capacitors in the Norwegian business were phased out in 2009. As the first in Scandinavia, the canteen at the main office was certified with the Svane environment brand in 2009. This has resulted in a significant reduction of waste from packaging.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Statkraft sustainability report 2009 16 Pollution Pollution from our activities is mainly related to NOx emissions from gas power plants and district heating plants and emissions of SO2 from district heating plants. The operation of gas power plants and district heating plants causes NOx emissions. The emissions increased in 2009 due to the fact that we took over two new gas power plants through the E.ON agreement. District heating plants also cause SOx emissions and discharge of spill water. The activities can also result in some accidental emissions of gases, primarily halon and SF6. There is also some risk of oil spills from vehicles, construction machinery and production equipment. Noise can occur locally in connection with transport and operation of plants, and there are some thermal discharges to water in connection with gas power plants. In 2009, emission of 105 kg of SF6 and 183 kg of halon were recorded. In addition, several minor oil spills were recorded, but none of them had any significant negative environmental effects.

Environmental Environmental incidents are recorded systematically and reported incidents every month to the Group management and to the board. No serious ­environmental incidents were recorded in 2009. However, 118 less serious environmental incidents were recorded. Most of these were in connection with minor and short-term breaches of the river management regulations and minor oil spills without significant environmental impact. EMPLOYEES Statkraft sustainability report 2009 17 Very good feedback The employees, of today and tomorrow, are Statkraft’s most important resource. The describing Statkraft Group works systematically to make Statkraft an exciting, attractive and developing workplace. We received very good feedback on this work in 2009. In the survey “Great as an attractive and Place to Work”, Statkraft came fourth among Norwegian employers with more than 250 developing place to employees. In another reputable survey, technology and economics students ranked Statkraft fifth and 25th, respectively, on the list of Norway’s most attractive employers. work Statkraft as employer The Group gained 217 new employees on 1 January 2009 as a result of the E.ON transaction. One year after the take-over, a large majority of our new colleagues report that they are very satisfied with having Statkraft as their employer. In 2009, Statkraft was ranked as Norway’s fourth best place to work and this year’s “up-and-comer” in Universum’s annual Graduate Survey. Organisation and management Statkraft conducts an annual survey concerning the organisation and leadership. The results from the survey for 2009 were good, and indicate that Statkraft has satisfied and motivated employees. Statkraft has special management programs, including systematic manager and follow-up. Gender equality and diversity In line with increased internationalisation of Statkraft, we strive for a higher percentage of female employees and increased diversity among our employees. In 2009, the percentage ÅRSVERK I KONSERNET of women was 22, and the Group’s employees represent 38 nationalities. Antall 4 000 Expertise development Having the right, high-level expertise is an important success factor.

The engineering students ranked Statkraft fifth (15th place in 2008), while the economics students ranked Statkraft as the 25th best employer, (43rd place in 2008). These results mean that Statkraft is the most attractive energy industry employer for graduate students in Norway. More than 800 students participated in the Universum Graduate Survey. Statkraft’s two-year trainee program is an attractive option. It is also an important instrument in ensuring future access to the right, high-level expertise. In 2009, a total of 29 trainees were at work in different parts of the Group. From 2010, the trainees program will be tailored to the company’s international development. Several of the trainees will work outside of Norway, and all gatherings and courses will be held in English. Norway’s fourth best workplace In 2009, Statkraft was ranked Norway’s fourth best workplace among enterprises with more than 250 employees. The study was prepared by Great Place to Work Institute Norway. Statkraft received high scores in all main areas; community, pride, credibility, fairness and respect. In the credibility area, Statkraft stood out with clear communication of its vision and strategic objectives. Statkraft also achieved good results in the Universum Professionals survey, which measures popularity among employees with an average 5.5 years work experience. Among technologists, Statkraft was ranked the eleventh most popular workplace, while economists ranked Statkraft 17th in Norway. Collective and individual variable salary Statkraft has established collective variable salary schemes. The schemes vary in the various companies and disbursement is based on different indices which may reflect factors such as operational performance and health and safety performance. The collective variable salary scheme disbursed NOK 13 000 30 000 per employee in the various Group companies in 2009. In addition, a scheme involving individual variable salaries has been implemented in the Norwegian part of the parent company and in Trondheim Energi. This is based on the achievement of set goals in addition to compliance with Statkraft’s values and requirements for managers, and has an upper limit for each individual employee of 10 per cent of base salary. SN Power has established a simular scheme where the upper limit for each individual employee is set to 10-20 per cent of base salary. Organisation and Statkraft conducts an annual survey concerning the organisation and leadmanagement ership. The results from the survey for 2009 were good, and indicate that Statkraft has satisfied and motivated employees. Statkraft has special management programs, including systematic manager and follow-up. Excellent results from the organisation and leadership survey Statkraft evaluates its organisation and managers annually, focusing on strategy, objectives, expertise, ethics and corporate responsibility, organisation and working environment. The overall result is reported to the corporate management and board through the group scorecard. In 2009, the survey was conducted for the entire Group (except Fjordkraft) and the results were very satisfying – 4.1 on a scale of 1 to 5. The response rate of 94 per cent was a new record. The results indicate that Statkraft’s employees are satisfied, motivated and proud of their employer. EMPLOYEES Statkraft sustainability report 2009 19 Follow-up and evaluation of leaders A total of 116 leaders participated in one of the Group’s two leadership programs (Just and Next). The programs are undergoing continuous development and are adapted to new challenges, including those that result from the international growth. The company also has a separate training module for project managers, and employees completed this module in 2009. Statkraft has developed an enhanced scheme for systematic and comprehensive evaluation and follow-up of leaders, covering both performance and behaviour. The scheme has been implemented in parts of the organisation and the scope will be further expanded in 2010 Gender equality In line with increased internationalisation of Statkraft, we strive for a and diversity higher percentage of female employees and increased diversity among our employees. In 2009, the percentage of women was 22, and the Group’s employees represent 38 nationalities. 22 per cent women 22 per cent of Statkraft’s employees are women, and 30 per cent of the new employees in 2009 were women. The percentage of women in management positions is 23 per cent. None of the five members of the Group management are women. The percentage of women on the board of directors is 44, and three out of six shareholder-elected representatives and one of three employee representatives are women. The average salary for women is 94 per cent of the average salary for men, reflecting the fact that Statkraft has more men than women in senior positions. UTDANNING UTDANNING More diversity in the Group Allmennutdanning 11% As of 31 December 2009, the Group had employees in 19 countries, representing 38 Uregistrert 25 % nationalities. More diversity among the company’s employees will strengthen us in our international development, for example by providing us with necessary expertise as regards legal matters and administration processes, language Teknisk utdanning/ fagbrev 25% and local customs. The average age among Statkraft’s employees is 45 years. Average lenght of service is 12 years, Høyere while utdanning (>3 år)the 25% employee turnover was 2.3 per cent in 2009. Høyskole (1–3 år) 14% Expertise Having the right, high-level expertise is an important success factor. We development strive to secure this when recruiting new employees, and we facilitate continuous development of the expertise of each individual employee. Good expertise mix Statkraft has an expertise mix well adapted to the Group’s activities. About 39 per cent of the employees have university or college degrees and about 25 per cent are skilled workers with trade certificates. To maintain the current high operating expertise, we must ensure sufficient recruitment of skilled workers to the Group’s power plants. Statkraft has therefore over a number of years offered apprentice programs, and 93 apprentices were employed in the Group in 2009. EDUCATION EDUCATION Secondary school 11% Undisclosed 25 % Technician/master craftsman 25 % University (>3 years) 25% College (1-3 years) 14% EMPLOYEES Statkraft sustainability report 2009 20 Development of expertise is a key issue The Group’s international growth creates a need for new expertise. Statkraft has therefore developed a training concept where both shorter and longer courses are offered in a number of areas, an example being language and cultural differences, as well as technical courses in subjects such as optimisation of operations and environmental management. Employees are also encouraged to seek external training as required. The individual employee’s need for training is followed up in the annual goals and development dialogue. In 2010, Statkraft will start the implementation of e-learning as a training channel. First up is a training module presenting Statkraft’s Code of conduct, with which all employees are obliged to comply. Other modules will deal with topics such as anti-corruption, health and safety and the environment. HEALTH AND SAFETY Statkraft sustainability report 2009 21 Safety is at the Safety is at the top of the agenda for Statkraft. We work systematically top of the agenda to avoid injuries. If, accidents should occur, they must be recorded, analysed and followed up. HSE is an integrated part of the Group’s continufor Statkraft ous efforts to build expertise, and a more comprehensive web-based HSE course is under preparation to address this. Statkraft had eight fatalities in connection with activities where Statkraft were involved in 2009, two of them in consolidated operations. In addition, there was one fatal accident in March 2010. 24 lost-time injuries (LTI) were recorded in Statkraft in 2009, resulting in an LTI rate of 3.8. The HSE results have seen a positive development in recent years, but we are far from the goal of zero injuries. Safe and healthy workplace Statkraft is working actively to achieve our goal of zero injuries in a working environment that promotes health. The health and safety aspects must be identified and assessed prior to all operations and maintenance activities. The concern for health and safety is an important element of project development and in choosing partners and suppliers. All injuries and hazardous conditions are recorded, analysed and followed up in a systematic manner. Fatal accidents There were a total of eight fatalities in our international construction projects in 2009. In addition, there was one fatal accident in March 2010. One contractor employee in Turkey and one person from a local community in Peru died in connection with the consolidated operations, and seven contractor employees died in connection with associated project activities five in India and two in Laos. Injuries and hazardous conditions Statkraft’s Code of conduct establishes that we must work to achieve a healthy working environment with zero injuries, and that we will not engage in any activity that endangers life or health. Through a systematic effort, the Group has halved the injury frequency for own employees over the last three years, but 53 injuries in 2009 show that major challenges remain. The injury frequency for contractors is higher than the injury frequency for own employees. Safe and healthy Statkraft is working actively to achieve our goal of zero injuries in a workworkplace ing environment that promotes health. The health and safety aspects must be identified and assessed prior to all operations and maintenance activities. The concern for health and safety is an important element of project development and in choosing partners and suppliers. All injuries and hazardous conditions are recorded, analysed and followed up in a systematic manner. Organisation of the HSE work All employees are responsible for ensuring that work is carried out in a safe manner and in accordance with internal and external requirements. The HSE Group staff has been significantly strengthened over the course of 2009. In addition, several business areas have their own HSE staffs. HSE is a key element in the cooperation between the employee organisations and the management, for example through established working environment committees and safety delegates. Common management system for health and safety Over the course of 2009, a common management system for health and safety was developed in Statkraft, based on the international OHSAS 18001 standard. The work to implement the system throughout the Group will continue in 2010. This will ensure a HEALTH AND SAFETY Statkraft sustainability report 2009 22 uniform methodology and approach to HSE, regardless of unit and geographical location. Emergency preparedness plans have been prepared for all work sites and regular emergency drills are held to ensure efficient handling of emergency situations. HSE training for all employees Expertise and training related to desirable HSE conduct is a key factor in achieving zero injuries. Basic HSE training is integrated in both the introduction for new employees and management programs. A mandatory web-based HSE course has been developed for all employees and contractors engaged in operating and construction activities. Safety delegates and members of the Working Environment Committee attend 40-hour HSE courses with regular updates. A more comprehensive HSE e-learning module is being prepared and will be implemented in 2010. In 2009, the BBS concept, Behavioural Based Safety, was tested in some parts of the organisation. The concept entails job observations followed by safety conversations. The project has received positive feedback and will be continued and expanded in 2010. Safety also for third parties In 2008-2009, a preliminary project was implemented which assessed the risk in 1500 river system plants in Norway. Riskreducing measures were recommended for 432 of the plants, and these will be implemented over the next four years. Typical measures will be signposting, deployment of rescue equipment and building handrails. One fatal accident was recorded for third parties in consolidated operations in 2009. At Arcata power plant in Peru (owned by SN Power), a member of the local community drowned in an intake duct. Fatal There were a total of eight fatalities in our international construction proaccidents jects in 2009. In addition, there was one fatal accident in March 2010. One contractor employee in Turkey and one person from a local community in Peru died in connection with the consolidated operations, and seven contractor employees died in connection with associated project activities five in India and two in Laos. Two fatalities in consolidated operations One fatal accident took place at Yesil Enerji’s project in Cakit in Turkey, where Statkraft has an ownership interest of 95 per cent. The accident took place in July and a driver employed by a sub-contractor died. In addition, a person from the local community drowned in a duct in the Arcata power plant in Peru (SN Power). Seven fatalities in associated activities Five of the deceased were contractors at SN Power’s Allain Duhangan project (India). Since construction started in 2006, a total of 16 work related fatalities have taken place at the Allain Duhangan project. The fatal accidents in 2009 all took place in the first quarter, while the most recent fatal accident was in March 2010. The plant is located in difficult and rugged terrain, and rockslides and avalanches are common. SN Power, where Statkraft has an ownership interest of 60 per cent, has an indirect ownership interest of 43 per cent in the project. Both Statkraft and SN Power have made it clear to the Allain Duhangan project that the HSE situation is unacceptable. As a consequence of the many fatal accidents, a new project manager was appointed in April 2009. In addition, international experts in tunnel construction and HSE became more closely involved in the project. HEALTH AND SAFETY Statkraft sustainability report 2009 23 FATALITIES Two contractor employees died in accidents in Theun Hinboun Power Company (Laos). Both Number accidents took place in connection with transport. 10 8 Preventive work Most of the fatalities were related to transport activities. Work routines in connection 6 with transport have therefore been made more stringent in all projects. Statkraft works 4 continuously to achieve increased understanding for and compliance with safety 2 requirements in all companies and development projects the Group is involved in. The health and safety work is followed up directly in the projects and through Statkraft’s 0 06 07 08 09 representation in the boards for the companies this applies to. Associates SKADER Consolidated operations 20 15 Injuries and Statkraft’s Code of conduct establishes that we must work to achieve a hazardous 10 healthy working environment with zero injuries, and that we will not engage in any activity that endangers life or health. Through a systematic effort, conditions 5 the Group has halved the injury frequency for own employees over the last 0 three years, but 53 injuries in 2009 show that major challenges remain. The 05 06 07 08 09 injury frequency for contractors is higher than the injury frequency for own H1: Antall fraværsskader per million arbeidstimer H2: Antall skader per million arbeidstimer employees. 24 lost-time injuries in 2009 The LTI rate (number of lost-time injuries per million working hours) was 3.8 in 2009, compared with 4.6 in 2008, while the TRI rate (number of injuries per million working hours) was 8.4 in 2009, compared with 12.1 in 2008. Increased attention from the management and personal commitment, as well as a clear goal of zero injuries, are assumed to be the reasons for the positive development. In addition, there has been more focus on reporting and analysis of both incidents and hazardous conditions, as well as stricter requirements related to investigation of serious conditions. In total, 24 lost-time injuries, 229 absence days due to injuries and 53 injuries were recorded in 2009. In addition, 19 lost-time injuries were recorded among Statkraft’s contractors. The injury frequency for the Group’s contractors was 6.7 in 2009, and we are now strengthening the follow-up of safety among our contractors, both in the consolidated and INJURIES associated activities. 20 See graph Injuries 15 The Group’s HSE performance for own employees has improved significantly in recent years, but measures and efforts to minimise the number of injuries will continue to have 10 high priority. We have an expressed desire to learn from injuries and hazardous conditions. 5 The safety culture in the Group must therefore be characterised by transparency, cooperation and willingness to comply. In 2009, 5597 hazardous conditions and near0 misses were recorded in the Group. An effort is now underway to ensure that the recording 05 06 07 08 09 LTI: Lost time injuries per million hours worked and follow-up of incidents involving safety hazards take place in a uniform manner. TRI: Total recordable injuries per million hours Furthermore, the concern for personal safety will be more clearly incorporated in all project worked development processes. Low and stable absence due to illness Absence due to illness in the Statkraft Group has been stable in recent years and was in 3.3 per cent in 2009. The objective is to keep the absence due to illness below 4 per cent. All Norwegian companies in the Group are so-called IA companies, which entails active follow-up of absence and close cooperation with the company health service. role in society Statkraft sustainability report 2009 24 Development in Statkraft wants to be a positive contributor in the communities where a manner which we are active.

We want to be a driving force in Norway’s growing renewable energy and environment R&D sector. Focus on the energy sources of the future The innovation work in Statkraft is directed towards projects which will provide us with more knowledge which can increase value creation and help enable us to meet the world’s need for pure energy in the future. Our priority areas within R&D are channelled through three R&D programs within marine energy, hydropower and customer activities: • The hydropower program The keywords for the hydropower program established in 2009 are commercial management and further development of hydropower. R&D funds totalling NOK 20 million annually for up to ten years will be allocated to various projects. • The marine energy program This program was established in 2007 and will tentatively continue until 2012 and include projects within offshore wind power, tidal power and wave power. The program is carried out in cooperation with technical universities in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. • The Customer program The customer program was established in 2009 and primarily concerns development projects related to cost-effective interaction with customers, product and portfolio development and scaleable business models. Statkraft also participates in five new research centres for environmentally friendly energy, focussing on hydropower, bio-energy, marine energy, wind power and gas power (CCS – carbon capture and storage). In addition, the various business units have independent R&D projects. Innovation work in Statkraft takes place in close cooperation with partners and research institutions. The budget for Statkraft’s innovation projects in the period 2009–2011 is about NOK 500 million. Opening of the world’s first osmotic power prototype Important milestones were reached in several innovation projects in 2009. The opening of the world’s first osmotic power prototype at Tofte outside of Oslo took place in November. The plant produces electricity by utilising the energy that is produced when freshwater and salt water are mixed. Osmotic power is a renewable and emission-free energy source which Statkraft has researched for more than ten years, and which may make a significant international contribution to environmentally friendly energy production. The global potential for osmotic power has been estimated at 1600-1700 TWh annually – corresponding to 50 per cent the EU’s total energy production. The plant at Tofte has limited production capacity and is primarily aimed at testing and development. In a few years time, we aim to build a commercial osmotic power plant. Investing in tidal power Tidal power is an important part of the R&D program for marine energy. For several years now, we have invested in tidal power through our involvement in Hydro Tidal Technology in Harstad. In 2009, the company received NOK 23 million in subsidies from Enova, the Norwegian state agency for promotion of green energy solutions, triggering the completion of the Morild II prototype, which is scheduled to start operating in 2010. At the end of 2008, Statkraft established the consortium Thetis Energy Ltd. together with two local partners. The objective is to establish a tidal power plant off the coast of Northern Ireland. role in society Statkraft sustainability report 2009 26 In 2009, Statkraft also invested in the company Atlantis Resources, one of the world’s leading tidal power developers. (Model of Morild a tidal water turbine) Statkraft involved in the world’s largest offshore wind power project In January 2010, Statkraft, Statoil, RWE npower and Scottish and Southern Energy plc., through the Forewind consortium, won the assignment of developing wind power on the Dogger Bank field on the UK shelf in the North Sea. Innovation and development is scheduled to run until 2014, when the first investment decision is expected. The lessons learned from this project may be important in the future development of wind power on the Norwegian Shelf. role in society Statkraft sustainability report 2009 27 Reputation Statkraft works to strengthen its reputation and promote the Statkraft brand. This year’s reputation surveys show substantial improvement. During the course of the year, the Group ran several brand-building ad campaigns in Norway. Why do we spend money on building our reputation and brand? Statkraft wants to be perceived as a leading commercial player in the work to meet the world’s need for pure energy. Through goaloriented communication and brand building, we are working to increase knowledge about and recognition of the Group’s role, activities and results.

What is the Statkraft Fund? The Statkraft Fund has been established to support socially beneficial purposes. The Fund awards disburses up to NOK 5 million annually to volunteer organisations, foundations or similar upon application from the recipient or initiative from Statkraft’s management. Recipients in 2009 The recipients of the Statkraft Fund 2009 are active in areas important to Statkraft – namely the development of sustainable energy and environmental solutions. Ungt Entreprenørskap (Young Entrepreneurship) Young Entrepreneurship received NOK 1.5 million from the Statkraft Fund for its project “SMARTere energi”. The objective is to get 10 000 mid-level primary school pupils to think new, develop opportunities and create solutions related to the topics cleaner energy and sustainable development in the school year 2009/2010. CARE Norway The aid organisation CARE Norway received NOK 1 million for its work in climate-adapted projects. CARE Norway will use the money to establish microfinancing groups, and offer training in development and operation of climate-adapted solutions. Norwegian Church Aid Norwegian Church Aid received NOK 0.5 million for the Water Program in 2009. The awarded funds will be spent on development of water projects in villages and areas where lack of clean water is critical. The Ny-Ålesund Symposium In addition, the Ny-Ålesund Symposium received NOK 2 million from the Statkraft Fund as a result of an earlier allocation. The symposium gathers researchers, politicians and business leaders from all over the world to discuss climate and environmental issues under the Arctic skies of Svalbard. Sustainability statement Statkraft sustainability report 2009 29 Sustainability The purpose of Statkraft’s Sustainability Statement is to describe statement Statkraft’s sustainability performance clearly and correctly. Guidelines for sustainability reporting Statkraft has guidelines which describe the sustainability reporting, and all relevant units report their sustainability performance in accordance with these guidelines. Emphasis is placed on ensuring that all information is complete and correct, but some of the material may be uncertain. Scope of the statement The sustainability reporting generally follows the Group’s accounting principles for the treatment of subsidiaries, partially owned power plants and associates. Sustainability data are collected for all companies in which Statkraft holds a majority stake, and the sustainability data are then presented in the statement in their entirety. As a general principle, all presented sustainability data must be prepared on a Group-wide basis. However, this is not possible for some indicators. These instances are explained in the note to the respective indicator. The notes also clarify individual concepts, explain significant, annual changes and describe any changes to calculation methods.

Auditor’s commentary and recommendations In addition to the independent auditor’s report on the Statkraft Sustainability Report 2009 (the Report) included in the Statkraft Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2009 (www.annualreport2009.statkraft.com) we provide the management of Statkraft with a management letter including observations and recommendations based on our work. According to the requirements of the AA1000 Assurance Standard a summary of our comments and recommendations to the Statkraft management and certain complementary formal information is summarized below. Comments and recommendations As in previous years, Statkraft’s sustainability reporting for 2009 integrates sustainability information in the annual report. The reporting is for the first time web-based. A shorter printed version has been prepared to comply with the minimum requirements by law. The printed version also includes the Statkraft Sustainability Statement for 2009 demonstrating that sustainability has a high priority at Statkraft. The sustainability reporting for 2009 provides a comprehensive picture of how Statkraft works with sustainability and describes relevant initiatives and actions taken in 2009. The reporting supports Statkraft’s vision of meeting the world’s need for pure energy and the company’s values – competence, responsibility, and innovation. The reporting also demonstrates how Statkraft follow-up on their business principles for HR, health and safety, the environment, and corporate social responsibility. The sustainability report for 2009 only to a minor extent presents specific targets on sustainability issues. We recommend Statkraft to report more extensively on targets and performance against such targets in coming sustainability reports. 2009 was marked by continued international growth and integration of new units related to the E.ON transaction. This represents challenges with regard to include new employees and units to the Statkraft values, corporate business principles and management processes. In our opinion, this process has been thorough and the integration has had a good start. This is supported by the results from our site visits and document reviews carried out. Such integrations processes take time and we notice that Statkraft continue its effort in this area. We have noted that that the company has allocated increased resources on, among others, HSE and corporate social responsibility over the last two years, and we believe that this is important to be able to meet the challenges created by increased international activity. Ensuring that governing documents in relation to social responsibility are available and understood throughout the organization, especially in units outside of Norway, should still be a high priority. Social responsibility and ethical conduct is of fundamental importance and provides challenges for a company like Statkraft, for which an increasing part of the activities are developed in the areas of the world where these issues are particularly important factors. We perceive that there has been considerable focus on development and updating of governing documents, and that Statkraft in 2009 and into 2010 has launched several initiatives at corporate level to ensure a good platform for ethics and anti-corruption work in Statkraft. We support this focus and recommend those efforts to be continued and designed so as to ensure compliance with both Statkraft’s policies and external regulations in the field in all aspects of Statkraft's business. Statkraft has in 2009 updated the procedure for collection of information and data in the area of sustainability, based on the Global Reporting Intitiative’s sustainability reporting guidelines for the energy industry. The reporting process is slightly modified, includes some new indicators and involves a number of new units in Statkraft. This presents challenges in relation to ensuring completeness and high quality of the reporting. We perceive, however, that Statkraft is committed to ensure quality in its reporting on sustainability, and expect that this work will remain a priority. Formal information and limitations Information presented above is a summary of issues addressed in our management letter to the management of Statkraft. The full management letter is intended for the management of Statkraft who is familiar with the context, decisions and subjects dealt with in the Report. Management also knows the engagement letter directing our engagement. The objectives and terms of our engagement are stated in our assurance statement referred to above. While we recognize that stakeholders of Statkraft may find information in this document useful, and while we have no bias towards any particular outcome, we do not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than Statkraft, for information provided in this document. As requested by AA1000 Assurance Standard we note that we are independent of Statkraft and that we comply with all relevant legislation and requirements on independence. Both the company and Deloitte have extensive measures in place to safeguard auditor’s independence and we comply with such measures. We also note that Deloitte and the team that provided this assurance engagement to Statkraft possess the necessary competency. ! ! Deloitte AS Karenslyst allé 20 !

The Report is part of the Statkraft Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2009 on the Internet (www.annualreport2009.statkraft.com). The Report includes the Sustainability Statement published also in the printed Statkraft Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2009. The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of 6WDWNUDIW$6 ³the Company´ . Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on emerging best practice and standards for independent assurance on sustainability reporting, including ISAE 3000, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board as well as on the principles of AA1000 Assurance Standard issued by AccountAbility. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the Company and included those subject matters on which we have concluded below. Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have performed interviews with management responsible for sustainability aspects at corporate and at selected reporting units represented by the Emden gas power plant, the Kungsbacka district heating plant, and the head office of WKH&RPSDQ\¶V subsidiary SN Power. We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to conclude with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than if an audit-level engagement had been performed. Separate from, and not impacting, our conclusions stated below we have SURYLGHG³$XGLWRU¶V commentary DQGUHFRPPHQGDWLRQV´. Conclusions In conclusion, in all material respects, nothing has come to our attention causing us not to believe that: x Statkraft has established systems to identify, manage and to involve stakeholders on material aspects related to sustainable value creation, as described in the Report, in accordance with the principles of AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard. x Statkraft applies procedures to identify, collect, compile and validate data and information for 2009 to be included in the Report, as described in the Report. Data presented for 2009 is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately presented in the Report. x The management systems referred to above have been implemented and locally adopted as necessary at the reporting units that we have visited, as specified above. Data for 2009 from these units has been reported according to the procedures noted above and is consistent with source documentation presented to us. x Statkraft applies a reporting practice for its sustainability reporting aligned with the GRI reporting principles. The GRI Index presented in the Report appropriately reflects where information on each of the elements and indicators of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines is to be found within in the Statkraft Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2009 on the Internet (www.annualreport2009.statkraft.com).

Global reporting initiative (GRI) Statkraft sustainability report 2009 30 Global reporting Clean energy must be sustainably produced. We greatly emphasise the initiative (GRI) importance of operating and developing the company in a manner which generates value for the owners, countries and local communities in which we operate. This means always acting responsibly and being a positive contributor in the communities where we have a presence. This section of the annual report documents our actions and results within areas such as business ethics, environment, health and safety and HR. What is GRI? GRI develops industry-adapted guidelines for sustainability reporting. The guidelines define essential reporting principles and a number of indicators for all sustainability areas. Statkraft’s GRI-index Since 2002, Statkraft has issued information about sustainability strategy and performance in connection with the company’s annual reports. From 2004, the reporting has been based on GRI’s guidelines. What is GRI? GRI develops industry-adapted guidelines for sustainability reporting. The guidelines define essential reporting principles and a number of indicators for all sustainability areas. GRI develops tools for sustainability reporting The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent organisation which, since its establishment in 1997, has worked to create a more standardised format for corporate sustainability reporting. The latest version of GRI’s guidelines (G3) for sustainability reporting was issued in the autumn of 2006. In 2009, guidelines specially prepared for the energy industry (Electric Utilities Sector Supplement) were approved. GRI starts by defining ten reporting principles. Four of these deal with establishing the scope and contents of the report, while the remaining six address the quality of the information presented. Furthermore, GRI defines a number of indicators, distributed between core and additional indicators, for enterprise profile, economy, environment, working conditions, human rights, society and product responsibility. Description of follow-up and management mechanisms is also requested for all areas. Different levels for sustainability reporting GRI facilitates sustainability reporting at different levels – A, B and C – where A is the highest level. In addition, the reporting level is marked with a ”+” if the reporting has been verified by an external third party. Global reporting initiative (GRI) Statkraft sustainability report 2009 31 Statkraft’s Since 2002, Statkraft has issued information about sustainability strategy GRI-index and performance in connection with the company’s annual reports. From 2004, the reporting has been based on GRI’s guidelines. The reporting for 2009 is based on GRI’s industry supplement for the energy industry, Energy Utilities Sector Supplement. Statkraft’s sustainability reporting is at level B+, and in Statkraft’s opinion, the Group’s reporting practice is in accordance with GRI’s 10 essential reporting principles.
