Trust is built through permanent and open dialogue of interested stakeholders and sincere understanding of the problems and needs of the widest community. At the same time, through numerous activities in various fields of community life we strive to expand and promote that dialogue. Social responsibility for us means not only expertise, professionalism and preservation of independence and credibility of the institution, nor is it only the care for our employees, but it also means the influence that the National Bank of Serbia has in promoting true values. We have engaged in the promotion and development of financial literacy of the population, starting from school children to other levels of population. Also, we are working on financial education of participants in the financial system of the population as loan beneficiaries, entrepreneurs, farmers and businesspeople. The Financial Services Consumer Protection Centre of the National Bank of Serbia will continue to provide active assistance to citizens in exercising their rights, understanding and using the services of the financial sector. We will work on further development of the financial market. This is the reason why the Centre for Financial System Development has been established. The Visitor Centre of the National Bank of Serbia as a specific educational and exhibition centre with the standing museum exhibition, periodical exhibitions and supporting educational and interactive offer, has opened its doors to the citizens, museums, artists and other cultural workers. The Centre has become a place where cultural, historical and artistic values are presented – everything that represents valuable spiritual heritage and contemporary creativity. During 2010 we carried out numerous humanitarian activities and we are very proud of the fact that our employees are happy to take part in those activities. Within collective voluntary actions, the National Bank employees socialised with students from the Primary school for children with difficulties in intellectual development Anton Skala and helped them in arranging and decorating the school yard. Also, they participated in arranging the cinema hall at the Centre for Mentally Challenged Children and Youth in Sremčica. We are active in the field of environmental protection as well. The National Bank of Serbia, as one of the founders and an active member of the United Nations “Global Compact” initiative in Serbia, fully supports the ten principles of the “Global Compact” relating to the protection of human and labour rights, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. The existence of such an initiative not only allows the affirmation and the development of the concept of social 2010 responsibility operations, but also provides an opportunity to business entities that are members of the Global Compact to learn from the experiences of others and share the social responsibility good examples from practice. Within this initiative, the National Bank of Serbia has established many partnerships and implemented joint projects. The National Bank of Serbia will continue to actively promote and expand the boundaries of social responsibility and thereby win a wider circle of allies and the people who share our views.

The National Bank of Serbia has a total of 2,159 employees (source: Human resources, dated 31 December 2010). 6 the NATIONAL social responsibility BANK 2010 of SERBIA NATIONAL BANK OF SERBIA – 126 YEARS SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT In order to promote and develop the organisational culture, an event called The Bank Day was occasioned to mark 126 years since the opening of the first counter of the Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia. The 160th anniversary of the birth of Đorđe Vajfert, the Governor of the National Bank of Serbia with the longest term in office and the title of the honorary governor, but also a great enthusiast and a visionary, the man of exceptional energy and great entrepreneurial spirit, was marked last year. A series of events that marked his life and work was organised throughout last year. Let us recall, following the liberation from the Turks, the reestablished Serbian state embarked on setting up the cornerstones of the new cultural and state institutions, namely the National Library (1832), the Lyceum – the precursor of the professional university institution (1838), the Society of Serbian Letters – that later became the Academy of Sciences (1841), the National Museum and the National Theatre (1868). Throughout this period of re-establishing the national foundations, the Serbian financial system had no national legal tender and as many as 43 foreign currencies were in circulation. What became more and more apparent was the need to establish a central bank. In 1854, an article entitled “Current Monetary Crisis” was published in the “Srbske Novine” newspapers, in which the necessity of establishing such an institution was highlighted. Still, three decades passed for this initiative to become reality. It was only in 1884 that an institution under the name the Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia was founded. The bank’s organisation was modelled after the National Bank of Belgium, which, at the time, was considered a role model for modern organisation of a banking institution. The bank established its Shareholders’ Committee, the Head Committee, the Managing Committee, the Supervisory Committee, and the Discounting Committee, as well as the position of Governor (the first Governor was Aleksa Spasić, until then the Minister without the portfolio) and the position of a Vice-Governor. 2010 social responsibility 7 the NATIONAL social responsibility BANK 2010 of SERBIA SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF SERBIA The 2010 Report on Social Responsibility of the National Bank of Serbia is the fourth consecutive report published by our institution. The report covers activities carried out in the field of social responsibility and explains the approach that our institution has in terms of social responsibility. It is submitted to the professional public along with an annual economic report on the activities and results of work in 2010 as well as to all members of the Global Compact in Serbia. The report is also available on the website of the National Bank of Serbia (www.nbs.rs). The National Bank of Serbia in 2010 tried to further improve activities creating a positive impact on its work, social and general environment and, in relation to that, to increase the engagement of its employees. As one of the most prominent institutions in the country, the National Bank of Serbia wants to serve as a role model and to encourage similar behaviour by other institutions and companies in Serbia, especially those coming from the financial sector. Strategic and operational priorities of the National Bank of Serbia in 2011 will be focused on the continuity of good practice and further development through:  further strengthening of institutional capacity of the National Bank of Serbia,  the adoption of a development strategy,  developing social responsibility,  enhancing efficiency and rationalisation of operations,  additional operational risk management system building in the National Bank of Serbia,  promotion of the National Bank of Serbia as a research centre. Strengthening social responsibility To strengthen social responsibility the following activities will continue:  financial education of the population (school children and citizens),  financial education of participants in the financial system (loan users, entrepreneurs, farmers and businesspeople),  improving the protection of financial services consumers,  establishment of a Centre for Financial System Development, and 2010  providing continuous contribution to the financial market development. social responsibility Promoting the concept of social responsibility among employees by improving internal communication In accordance with the objective set forth by the law and functions, and based on the principles of the Global Compact , the activities of the Communications Division / Internal Communication and Social Responsibility Section are focused on promoting the concept of social responsibility and implementation of activities with which the National Bank of Serbia makes a positive impact on the working and social environment. 9 the NATIONAL BANK social responsibility of SERBIA 2010 In the next two years, in addition to further development of the employees’ volunteering programme, one of the priorities will be working on the development of organisational culture by fostering cooperation, trust, sense of security and personal responsibility of each employee and manager for their activities. To promote the development of organisational culture, the Department of Internal Communication and Social Responsibility will direct special attention to improving and encouraging the use of constant internal communication channels through constant exploring of employees’ attitudes and needs, conducting educational activities for children of employees and organising events for employees. Improvement of social responsibility by promoting the National Bank of Serbia as a research centre will continue in 2011 by organising research seminars both for employees and for students from economics faculties as well as for professional public. In this regard, ten research seminars were organised during 2010, and they were held by eminent speakers from prestigious financial and educational institutions. In order to improve cooperation with the professional public, the decision was also made regarding the conditions and method of awarding donations aimed at stimulating scientific research in the areas of monetary economics, supervision of financial institutions and financial stability. Donations in the form of cash prizes may be granted to young scientists from the country and the region, on the basis of a competition announcement by the National Bank of Serbia for the best scientific research in the above-mentioned areas. In order to acquaint the widest domestic public with basic methods of implementing monetary policy, the National Bank of Serbia has developed a Monetura social game, which in a fun and imaginative way introduces its participants into the world of creating and implementing monetary policy, in accordance with the challenges they may face every day. In 2010, the employees completed the final review and the circulation of the first Monetura came out of the printing house. The game is designed for the employees at the National Bank of Serbia, as well as for students of economics and other faculties where banking and finance subjects are studied, as well as for all those who would like to, through fun and socialising, get more familiar with this interesting issue. The game will also be available to employees in other central banks who will, thanks to the bilingual explanations, be able to use it without any restrictions. 2010 The plan is to promote Monetura as a tool for internal communication among social responsibility employees as well as an educational tool for students of secondary schools of economics and university students of economics faculties in Serbia. 10 the NATIONAL social responsibility BANK 2010 of SERBIA MEMBERSHIP IN THE UNITED NATIONS “GLOBAL COMPACT” After the establishment of the “Global Compact”, on 6 December 2007, the National Bank of Serbia, as one of the founders and an active member of this initiative, continued with its commitment to the promotion and affirmation of the most massive voluntary association in the world (with over 8,500 members from more than 130 countries), dedicated to promoting corporate social responsibility. “Global Compact” requires from its members to adopt, support and promote the ten universal principles in the protection of human and labour rights, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. During three years of work in Serbia, the number of members increased to 70. Apart from large companies, members are also representatives of small and medium-sized companies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), business associations, academic institutions, cities and trade unions. In 2010, as part of the “Global Compact”, many activities were carried out, the most important ones being: a press conference organised to mark the beginning of the project Managing personal finances , the Annual Global Compact Conference in Serbia on labour rights, presentation of “Global Compact” at local and regional conferences, the signing of a protocol on cooperation with the Association of Directors of Secondary Schools of Economics and organisation of the Annual Assembly. Also, working groups for social inclusion and persons with disabilities, anti-corruption, corporate social responsibility in banking and finance, education and development of corporate social responsibility, environment, media and support in emergency situations held regular meetings. At the eighth annual meeting of the “Global Compact” local networks held in New York from 23 to 25 June 2010, the “Global Compact” Network in Serbia, whose active member is also the National Bank of Serbia, was named one of top three networks in the world for the year 2009. The recognition was awarded for the overall activities, as well as for work on promoting the “Global Compact” in Serbia and represents an incentive for further improvement of the network's work. In addition to the annual meeting of local networks of the organisation, a Summit of Leaders was also held to mark the tenth anniversary of this largest voluntary initiative in the world. In 2011, the primary driving force of all activities will continue to be support to member states in implementing the ten “Global Compact” principles, with particular emphasis on principles relating to the environment. Great attention will be devoted to the expansion of membership and giving support to more active participation of individual members, the organisation of thematic seminars and workshops, the work of existing and establishing new working groups and supporting members in developing the Progress Report. As Chair of the Working Group for Corporate Social Responsibility in Banking and Finance, the National Bank of Serbia, together with other working group members worked on the designing and realisation of two projects in the field of financial education as a primary objective of this group. 2010 Within the project of cooperation with secondary schools with an educational profile Banking Clerk , the third/fourth grade students from those schools were provided with social responsibility one-week/two-week practice in the branches of member banks, a visit to the National Bank of Serbia and the Institute for Manufacturing Banknotes and Coins, thematic lectures for students and teachers of this profile, as well as participation of representatives of member banks at the final examination. The cooperation was formalised by signing a cooperation protocol between the Association of Directors of Secondary Schools of Economics and the “Global Compact” in Serbia and will be continued in 2011. In cooperation with the Croatian Banking Association, members of this working group decided to organise and launch a free interactive workshop for the citizens of 11 the NATIONAL BANK social responsibility of SERBIA 2010 Serbia under the title “Managing personal finances”. In addition to financial education as one of the goals of these workshops, close attention should be paid to the mutual cooperation among member banks as well as business subjects in the organisation and realisation of this project, that puts the client and the client's education in focus, whose aim is not only better understanding of financial services but also strengthening confidence in the banking sector. The project was launched to help citizens, through training and counselling, to efficiently manage their household budgets. A total of 24 workshops have been organised so far (20 in Belgrade, two in Niš and Novi Sad, and two on Kopaonik Mountain). The workshops gathered more than 300 citizens. The participants graded the organisation (location, time, space), comprehension and the manner of presentation as well as usefulness of the workshops with the highest grades. The greatest benefit from the workshop for the people was a better overview of expenses and incomes in personal/household budgets, a new look at the planning and implementation of goals, new insights into the possibilities of saving, a realistic understanding of financial options and, at the very end, future improvements in personal/household budgets. A new series of workshops in other cities in Serbia is planned for 2011. More information about the activities of the “Global Compact” in Serbia can be found on the website www.unglobalcompact.rs. Ten Principles of the Global Compact Ten principles of the Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption, are based on: • The Universal Declaration of Human Rights • The International Labour Organization Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work • The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development • The UN Convention Against Corruption.

The National Bank of Serbia with its participation and membership in the “Global Compact” acknowledges and affirms the values and human rights protection policy of the United Nations. Code of Conduct For the National Bank of Serbia the concept of corporate social responsibility does not exist as an isolated activity. We seek to integrate the parameters of responsible behaviour through our internal by-laws, and therefore through our daily activities of both the employees and the management. The Code of Conduct establishes the principles of professional conduct that the employees in the National Bank of Serbia are obliged to follow when performing the tasks entrusted to them, as well as criteria for evaluating the conduct – for the purpose of preserving and improving professional and moral responsibility of employees, their mutual cooperation and relations with third parties, as well as preserving and improving the reputation of the National Bank of Serbia and confidence in the National Bank of Serbia. While performing their duties, the employees should be guided by the following principles – they have to behave in a way that: provides the highest standards of professional conduct; provides commitment to tasks and loyalty in their performance; avoids the emergence of conflicts of interest; prevents damage to the reputation of the National Bank of Serbia; provides data protection, respecting the obligation of secrecy and prohibition of disclosing information. These Code determines the following principles: expertise,  conscientiousness,  legality in performing the duties,  prohibition of discrimination,  independence and autonomy,  business reputation,  relations with the media,  2010 confidentiality,  social responsibility data protection,  ban on accepting gifts,  conflict of interest,  prohibition of disseminating information,  engaging in activities outside working hours,  mutual respect and cooperation,  harassment, and  use of fixed assets.  13 the NATIONAL BANK social responsibility of SERBIA 2010 Also, the responsibilities of employees are established by the Code on responsibility of employees. The Code, in addition to disciplinary and material responsibility, also regulates the breach of duty of employment, including sexual, physical or psychological harassment of other employees, violation of rights of other employees and the like. During the year, we organised a series of activities that promote human rights of persons with disabilities, especially in terms of their integration into the community and their employment rights. LABOUR STANDARDS Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Our goal is to work together with employees to create constructive organisational culture that encourages interaction between employees and access to tasks that will help them to, apart from all working conditions and workers' rights guaranteed by the Labour Law, create a high-quality and motivating environment for work in which the rights and needs of employees are respected. In accordance with the regulations, the Plan of implementation of the risk assessment procedure at workplace and work environment in the National Bank of Serbia (G. No. 9374), on the basis of which teams were formed for risk assessment at the head office, branch offices and the Institute for Manufacturing Banknotes and Coins. In accordance with the Law on the Prevention of Mobbing at Work, the National Bank of Serbia notified in writing all employees on the prohibition of abuse and exercise of sexual harassment at work and abuse of the right to protection from such behaviour as well as about the ways of prevention and action. Bearing in mind the Law on Professional Rehabilitation and Employment of Persons with Disabilities, the National Bank of Serbia introduced its staff, twice in 2010 through the webhouse, with the rights of persons with disabilities, as well as with the manner and procedure for establishing such status. In addition, during 2010, a Decision on the special rights of persons with disabilities was passed, allowing employees with disabilities, based on the assessment work skills and vocational rehabilitation, wage compensation in the amount of 100% of the average monthly salary for the duration of their paid leave. The costs of assessment of work capacity and occupational rehabilitation are borne by the National Bank of Serbia. Special attention was paid to protect people with disabilities, through risk assessment at workplace and in the work environment in the National Bank of Serbia, as well as through the implementation of all measures prescribed by the decision establishing that the employee has the status of a person with disability. . Planned activities: We will continue informing the staff of the National Bank of Serbia about the rights of persons with disabilities and increasing the number of employees who will get such status. In order to improve expert and professional capacities of employees, ensure efficient and quality performance of functions under its jurisdiction and promotion of reforms, the 2010 National Bank of Serbia in 2010 offered its employees to attend studies of the first, second and third level, foreign language classes, training for the acquisition of different titles and social responsibility certifications, as well as participation in seminars, conferences, courses and workshops in the country and abroad. The National Bank offers its employees numerous benefits related to holiday, recreation, solving housing issues, New Year's gifts for children, jubilee awards, voluntary pension funds, insurance, presents for pensioners, etc. The plan is to expand this range of benefits through cooperation with hospitality organisations, so that more employees would have the opportunity to travel on holiday under more favourable conditions. Also, we plan to provide even more favourable credit conditions for solving housing problems, introduce paid annual medical examination and the payment of life insurance. . 14 the NATIONAL social responsibility BANK 2010 of SERBIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Electrical power consumption in the buildings of the National Bank of Serbia is given a lot of attention – incandescent light bulbs are replaced with energy saving ones. We regularly recycle consumable materials, including toner cartridges, paper and PET packaging. We support and promote projects that contribute to environmental protection, such as an invitation to action “Great Cleaning of Serbia” and “An Hour for Earth” – an appeal to save electricity. One of the voluntary actions that we organised for the employees named “Nature should be Guarded and Saved as Greenery Never Loses Value” did not only include children with special needs, but it also had an ecological character as the socialising was organised through the cleaning up of the yard, painting benches and planting new seedlings in the primary school Anton Skala in Belgrade. E-mails of every employee have a message written below the signature Think before you print , which refers to the necessity of thinking about resources such as paper that is used in everyday work. In that way, by introducing an electronic signature, classifying paper and recycling and using e-mail as a communication channel, we drew attention to environmental protection and saving paper in the internal as well as in the external communication, enhancing the image of the National Bank of Serbia as a socially responsible institution. The Social Responsibility Report for 2009 was printed on recycled paper. Planned activities: We will consolidate the waste separation programme and extend it to branch offices of the National Bank of Serbia. We will continue to implement measures for efficient use of resources as well as support and promote all activities related to environmental protection. ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. The National Bank of Serbia is continuously undertaking activities aimed at fulfilment of obligations under the Law on the Anti-Corruption Agency, the National AntiCorruption Strategy and the Action Plan for Implementation of the National AntiCorruption Strategy and quarterly reports to the Anti-Corruption Agency. 2010 social responsibility 15 the NATIONAL social responsibility BANK 2010 of SERBIA EMPLOYEE CARE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY In accordance with regulations, the National Bank of Serbia on 6 May 2010 adopted a Plan of implementation of risk assessment procedure at workplace and work environment in the National Bank of Serbia (G.

In cooperation with departments in charge, the Centre prepared the Draft Law on the Protection of Financial Services Consumers, whose aim is to provide security to financial services consumers, in accordance with the standards and the level of protection applied in the European Union, as well as to improve business practices and provide adequate information to citizens. Furthermore, a control survey, i.e., testing the conditions under which the market is offered financial services – current accounts and loans – was conducted. The aim of that survey is to objectively view the quality of offer of financial services on the market, i.e. transparency of conditions under which financial services are offered. The survey was conducted by the company for market research, public opinion and media TNS Medium Gallup. Complaint Procedures In the period from 1 January to 31 December 2010, the Consumer Protection Centre received a total of 1,574 complaints and early complaints against operations of financial institutions, which is insignificantly higher when compared to 2009. The Centre received 1,066 complaints, or 13.2% more than in previous year. The largest percentage of received complaints – 80%, related to the operation of banks, which was expected given the dominance of banks in the financial market and the fact that consumers mostly use banking services. A total of 850 complaints (9% more than in 2009) were addressed to banks’ operations. The majority of complaints concerned loans (58%), current accounts (19%) and payment cards (13%).

The majority of complaints related to the automobile liability insurance (63%), accident insurance (9%) and full insurance (8%). A total of 34 complaints concerned the work of other providers of financial services, which makes 3% of the total number of complaints. Early complaints In 2010 the Centre also received 508 early complaints, which is by 11.5% less when compared to 2009. Early complaints are considered to be those sent directly to the complaints team of the Centre without filing a previous complaint with a relevant financial institution. In compliance with the complaints procedure, the National Bank of Serbia forwarded all early complaints to relevant financial institutions. As in the case of complaints, most of the early complaints related to operation of banks (96%), namely in the segment of loans (49%), current accounts (23%) and payment cards (14%). Mediation In 2010, a total of 145 mediations of the National Bank of Serbia were scheduled, which is by 17% more than in 2009.

The increased number of conducted mediations indicates that both clients and financial institutions choose to resolve disputes peacefully since it is a faster, cheaper 2010 and more efficient way. Of the total number of completed mediation procedures, 53% were concluded in social responsibility settlement, i.e. an agreement between financial institutions and their clients. The largest number of mediation cases referred to part of a loan (50%), automobile liability insurance (16%) and credit cards (11%). Improving Regulations In order to better protect financial services consumers, increase transparency of conditions under which financial services are offered, and in order to adequately inform citizens, the Draft Law on the Protection of Financial Services Consumers was prepared and was sent on 1 February 2011 to the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia for 24 the NATIONAL social responsibility BANK 2010 of SERBIA adoption. Given the importance of rights and protection of financial services consumers and given the fact that the new Law on Consumer Protection (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 73/2010) does not regulate this matter, it was proposed to pass a law on financial services consumer protection that will regulate the protection of banking services consumers, services of financial leasing and beneficiaries of financial arrangements. The aim of this law is to promote good business practices and fair treatment of financial services consumers as well as compliance with European Union’s regulations, which will, by enhancing confidence in the financial sector, contribute to its development. Informing and educating financial services consumers Throughout the year 2010, the Centre received 404 queries from financial service consumers in relation to financial services and the rights of financial service users. The information was also offered verbally to 22,299 calls. Without calls that concerned service information, most of the questions related to banking services, currency exchange and insurance. A total of 1,046 were received electronically, with questions about foreign currency exchange rates, frozen foreign currency savings, enforced collection, payment operations and other service information. Education of citizens The National Bank of Serbia continued to provide information to citizens through its regional financial education offices. In the course of 2010, the regional offices were visited by 1,153 citizens. The largest number of citizens' questions referred to banking services (56%), notably to the method of calculating annuities on loans, refinancing of loans, savings, collateral security, information on arrears recorded in the Credit Bureau, the use of payment cards and ATMs, etc. Also, they were interested in the complaints procedure and used the opportunity to learn about the offers of various financial institutions via the internet and seek appropriate clarifications in relation to financial services that they are interested in. In addition, the organisation of panel discussions was launched in order to inform citizens more comprehensively about financial services. During November and December, four panel discussions were held, namely: in Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Niš, and Užice. The topics of the panel discussions were those that citizens were most interested in ( Housing Loans , Refinancing Loans , Credit Cards , How to Get a Car – Through a Loan or Lease? and How to Protect Your Rights ). Also, two new brochures were prepared for farmers – Agricultural Loans and Agriculture Insurance . Planned activities Upon the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Financial Services Consumers, the Centre for Financial Services Consumers will make proposals of by-laws arising from the Law on Financial Service Consumer Protection. The analysis of financial service offer will continue with the aim of objective 2010 assessment of the quality of financial services on the market. Comprehensive informing and educating of citizens will be in the focus in the coming period by organising panel social responsibility discussions throughout Serbia. 25 the NATIONAL BANK social responsibility of SERBIA 2010 EXHIBITION AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THE VISITOR CENTRE EXHIBITION ACTIVITIES Exhibitions, educational programmes and other cultural and educational events, organised for the general public by the National Bank of Serbia in 2010, were attended by 35,340 visitors.

On that occasion, employees of the Novi Sad Branch distributed New Year’s gifts to children. Also, children in the Centre for Mentally Challenged Children and Youth in Sremčica received New Year’s gifts that employees prepared within the traditional action Santa's Sleigh . At the end of March, the Easter humanitarian charity exhibition for employees at the National Bank of Serbia was organised. The exhibition was prepared by children from eight homes and centres for children with disabilities. A total of RSD 80,000 was collected from the sale of exhibits, outstripping the amount of funds collected over the previous years. Also, children with disabilities were enabled to visit the exhibition at the museum, to feel socially acceptable through contact with a larger number of employees. As each year there are more and more homes and centres involved, this event has become very important for social inclusion and development of children with special needs. Within socially responsible activities that we organise, the humanitarian activity “All fits well when coloured by heart” for mentally challenged children was carried out successfully with the Primary School Anton Skala . The aim of the action, in which a large number of employees was involved, was to collect clothes and shoes for pupils of that school. After the preparations were done, on 8 June, the first collective voluntary action for the employees of the National Bank of Serbia was organised, entitled “Nature should be Guarded and Saved as Greenery Never Loses Value”. The socialising with Anton Skala primary school children started with an appropriate programme prepared by the hosts for our colleagues, and continued with a five-a-side football match between pupils and our colleagues. The pupils also tried themselves in the disciplines of the game Savings Olympics , and then together we arranged the yard, planted flowers and painted the benches. Another voluntary collective action took place on 26 November in the Centre for Mentally Challenged Children and Youth Sremčica . Employees participated in arranging the cinema hall for whose renovation and necessary materials the National Bank donated funds. Within this year's operational plan to extend socially responsible activities in the branches, an action of collecting aid for beneficiaries of the “Drop-in Shelter” and “Safe Children’s Home” was carried out in Novi Sad. Employees of the Branch in Niš, in cooperation with the humanitarian organisation Food Bank , in late November collected food and clothing for members of the Association of Self-Supporting Mothers from that city. 2010 The Branch in Novi Sad organised a charity sales exhibition for employees in cooperation with the school Milan Petrović from Novi Sad, while the employees at the social responsibility head office, in cooperation with the humanitarian organisation Little Big People , carried out a humanitarian action of collecting New Year’s presents and clothing for three homes for children without parental care in Belgrade. In December, like in previous years, in cooperation with the homes and centres for children with special needs, and in cooperation with the Centre in Sremčica and the Association for Help to Persons with Special Needs Stari Grad, charity New Year exhibitions for employees of the National Bank of Serbia were organised. Around RSD 120,000 was collected from the sale of the exhibits. 36 the NATIONAL social responsibility BANK 2010 of SERBIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION At the level of seats of the National Bank of Serbia, since April 2008 employees have been collecting used paper, PET packaging and mixed waste in offices where they work.
