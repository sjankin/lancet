Newsletter STAPHYT Autumn 2011 Page 1 sur 1 GLOBAL COMPACT: STAPHYT IS FOLLOWING ITS GOALS ! 3 years ago, STAPHYT joined the United Nation Global compact program & principles. Since its creation, STAPHYT is dedicated to sustainable development, environmental issues and the well-being of its employees. The UN Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for STAPHYT that is committed to aligning its operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. This ever-increasing understanding is reflected in the growth of the Global Compact, which today stands as the largest corporate citizenship and sustainability initiative in the world -with thousands of participants and stakeholders from over 130 countries. By doing so, business, as a primary agent driving globalization, can help ensure that markets, commerce, technology and finance advance in ways that benefit economies and societies everywhere. Never before have the objectives of the international community and the business world been so aligned. Common goals, such as building markets, combating corruption, safeguarding the environment and ensuring social inclusion, have resulted in unprecedented partnerships and openness among business, government, civil society, labour and the United Nations. Many businesses recognize the need to collaborate with international players in the current global context where social, political and economic challenges (and opportunities) – at home or in other regions – affect companies as never before. Because we all are concerned ! Jacques Boisleux Olivier Marchioro Staphyt President Staphyt CEO http://www.staphyt.com/newsletter/newsletter11aj6f/newsletter11_completEN.htm 23/09/2011
