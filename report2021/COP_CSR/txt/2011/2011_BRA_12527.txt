Note that, as in the other industries, the progress in water and waste activities can represent an opportunity to contribute to the reduction of global emissions of greenhouse gases, since the option for treating sewage can reduce the formation of methane gas, a gas 21 times more potent that carbon dioxide in terms of potential rise in the planet’s temperature. On the other hand, the digestion of sludge generated from the sewage treatment, generates biogas that can be eliminated in burners or used to produce electricity. 88 89 GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES IN ASSOCIATION WITH society Eco-mobilization Throughout 2010, we developed several partnerships with the community and NGOs to the benefit of the environment. EN13 1 million trees in Cantareira The works involve planting native trees of the Atlantic In 2010, 723,000 seedlings of native species were permanent preservation areas (APPs), on the Cantareira Forest biomes, in approximately one thousand hectares, planted in 312 hectares around the Cachoeira, Atibainha, System watershed.
