Through the continual assessment of our commodity trading operations, global ofﬁces and business investees we look to build up a comprehensive understanding of our impacts and continuously strive to improve our environmental performance. Environmental Management System (EMS) committed to harnessing our potential to develop systems and technologies to help communities and other industries to do the MC has established an ISO 14001 compliant integrated same.

Currently the Company has taken the ﬁrst step towards this goal by offsetting all domestic emissions through carbon emissions Climate Change Global Consolidated CO2 Emissions MC recognizes that climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing the global community. We believe that, while Fiscal 2009 1,404,118 tackling this issue will depend a great deal on the development Fiscal 2008 1,350,647 and implementation of global climate regulatory frameworks, Fiscal 2007 1,991,207 business leadership and innovation will also be vital in the move 0 1,200,000 1,400,000 1,600,000 1,800,000 2,000,000 toward a lower carbon society.

It is thus important for the company to remain cognizant of the needs of our equally diverse stakeholders and to reﬂect these needs in our approach to business in general. Human Rights Supply Chains MC believes that respect for human rights is a key component MC also regards supply chain management as being a vital of CSR in the development of global business. Our Code of part of corporate responsibility.

We believe this helps to motivate our staff and helps us in recruiting, retaining and developing employees who can support our growth. Social Contribution Activities MC’s corporate culture is based on a fundamental desire to Picture Books for Children Oita International Wheelchair grow together with local and international communities and in Asia Marathon with this in mind, we are engaged in a variety of ongoing social contribution projects.

Each of these tokens is worth an additional corporate donation of 500 yen to selected welfare, educational and environmental NPOs. In the year ended March 2010, employees accumulated a total of 11,000 tokens based on which MC made corresponding contributions of ¥5.5 million. Moving forward, we are looking to extend this token scheme to include MC’s global network of ofﬁces and volunteers. 13 Creating Sustainable Corporate Value Sustainable Value for MC MC believes that in order to respond to the needs and expectations of our stakeholders, we need to strive to create sustainable environmental and societal value through our core business. In doing so, we will be able to generate true sustainable corporate value for the company well into the future. Each of our Business Groups plays a different, yet crucial role in helping the Company achieve this goal.

The remit of this new group is to Group strengthen MC’s efforts in the infrastructure business with particular focus on the global environment as one of our strategic domains. The world’s population continues to grow unabated and looks set to reach 9 billion by 2050, compared Climate Change with approximately 6.5 billion at present. Ensuring a continuous supply of energy and water for this rising population will be an important theme going forward. Sustainable Use of Resources However, the earth’s resources are ﬁnite and have already begun to show signs of its limitations. If the planet is to support these increasing constraints, it is imperative that we take steps to reduce our overall environmental burden by developing alternative forms of energy and using resources more efﬁciently. We must protect and improve the environment through new technologies and frameworks that give due consideration to climate change and preserving biodiversity. MC’s Global Environment Business Development Group aims to provide effective solutions to these issues through businesses. In the ﬁeld of electric power generation, in addition to ensuring a stable, long-term power supply, we are also promoting power generation using natural energy that emits no CO2 such as solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, and wind power. We are also involved in the production of sustainable biofuels, and the development and manufacturing of large-capacity lithium-ion batteries-the technology at the heart of electric vehicles. In addition to addressing sustainable energy issues we are also looking to ensure the stable and safe supply of water as demand increases along with the world’s population. We will contribute by building and enhancing infrastructure, including working with public-sector entities to develop water businesses. We actively engage in these and other businesses with the overriding aim of creating and increasing environmental value through projects that strive to TOPICS address the needs of the global community and create Energy-Saving Operating a more sustainable society. Company Established in Thailand In March 2010, MC established Global New Energy Co., Ltd. (GNE) in Bangkok, Thailand, as a joint venture with the Toyo-Thai Group. This joint venture was formed to develop an energy-saving business model centered on Asia and the Middle East. Essentially, the business aims to facilitate the reduction of CO2 emissions and energy consumption by rationalizing energy use in industrial sectors.

Alpac also focuses on contributing to local communities through job creation and diversiﬁcation. More than half of its 420 team members originate from local communities including aboriginal peoples. Overall, there are nearly 1,200 people in the local community whose work is directly or indirectly linked with Alpac. Power for Alpac’s mill is generated by burning biomass, such as wood waste, created in the pulp production process. Surplus power is then supplied to the Alberta power grid as green energy, where it is needed to meet increasing demands for energy and to reduce greenhouse gases. Alpac is also implementing an expansion project for biomass power by utilizing Federal Government subsidies under the “Green Transformation Program” which was announced in 2009. Alpac plans to continue supporting these efforts in order to help solve the pressing needs of the local community.

In particular, the advisory members urged us to: ■ Undertake environmental and CSR activities beﬁtting MC with a clear resolve. ■ Express our vision and overall direction for CSR and environmental affairs. ■ Establish mediumto long-term targets and take actions to achieve them. Following subsequent in-house meetings to address the points raised by the Committee, I felt strongly that the starting point should be for us to state our vision for how company ofﬁcers and employees approach CSR and environmental affairs, and make this clear both internally and externally. Based on this recognition, under the Midterm Corporate Strategy 2012, which was announced in July 2010, MC outlined its objective to create sustainable corporate value from three angles: sustainable economic value, sustainable societal value and sustainable environmental value. Hideyuki Nabeshima We have also updated our Environmental Charter, adding three new items to address global issues: climate change, Senior Executive Vice President CSR & Environmental Affairs biodiversity, and the sustainable use of resources. I see this as an important step for MC, reafﬁrming that the planet is our greatest stakeholder and underlining our commitment to help create a sustainable society through our business activities. 31 Performance Data Financial Mitsubishi Corporation and Subsidiaries-Years Ended March 31 (based on U.S. GAAP) Billions of Yen 2007.3 2008.3 2009.3 2010.3 Operating transactions and income Operating transactions ¥20,526.6 ¥23,103.0 ¥22,389.1 ¥17,098.7 Operating income 410.3 355.1 588.9 181.4 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 601.6 552.5 388.2 294.3 Net income 419.3 470.9 369.9 273.1 Net income per share (Basic) (yen) ¥248.52 ¥283.82 ¥225.24 ¥166.24 Net income per share (diluted basis) (yen) 247.17 282.55 224.75 165.86 Return on equity (ROE) (%) 15.9% 16.3% 14.1% 10.2% Assets and shareholders’ equity Total assets ¥11,423.9 ¥11,750.4 ¥10,918.0 ¥10,891.3 Shareholders’ equity 2,918.4 2,873.5 2,383.4 2,961.4 Ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets (%) 25.5% 24.5% 21.8% 27.2% Shareholders’ equity per share (yen) ¥1,728.59 ¥1,750.86 ¥1,450.72 ¥1,801.84 Status of Dividends Dividend per share (for the year, yen) ¥46.00 ¥56.00 ¥52.00 ¥38.00 Dividend payout ratio [consolidated] (%) 18.7% 20.1% 23.1% 22.9% ＊Operating transactions is a voluntary disclosure commonly made by similar Japanese trading companies, and is not meant to represent sales or revenues in accordance with U.S. GAAP. ＊The ﬁgures have been reclassiﬁed, in accordance with provisions of U.S. GAAP. ＊Net Income denotes net income attributable to Mitsubishi Corporation.
