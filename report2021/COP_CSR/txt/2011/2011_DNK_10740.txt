TDC’s employees deserve significant credit for all these achievements. It should be noted that during 2010, we have seen employee satisfaction reach the highest level recorded since the current employee survey was launched back in 2005 – and we will continue to strive to improve in this respect every year. Reaching strategic milestones Last but not least, in 2010 TDC successfully reached two significant strategic milestones. In October, TDC announced the divestment of its Swiss subsidiary, Sunrise, thereby completing the journey towards becoming a focused Nordic communications company. On 13 December, TDC’s majority shareholder, NTC sold 210 million shares in the company in one of the largest equity transactions in Europe during 2010. This reduced NTC's stake in TDC to 59.1% and allowed several hundred institutional investors across the globe as well as thousands of domestic retail investors to Henrik Poulsen invest in the Company. CEO & President TDC A/S For TDC, 2011 will be another year with a relentless, disciplined focus on operational improvements, continued investments in the innovation, infrastructure, brands, and the people that comprise TDC’s strong foundation and, not least, achieving the results in compliance with our commitment to our shareholders. 5 TDC Annual Report 2010 Highlights of the year Financial highlights Profit for the year from continuing operations, excluding Special items, increased to DKK 2,888m, up by 161m or 5.9% compared with 2009.

TDC has successfully defended or even grown its leading market positions over the years, and has higher shares of both the pay-TV and broadband markets than its core and Nordic peers. This has been achieved through a range of strong domestic brands covering all customer segments, channels and product categories in the residential and business markets, and through TDC’s undisputed position as the leading provider of technology platforms and infrastructure across all the major access technologies – copper, coax, fibre and mobile (GSM, UMTS and LTE). TDC is one of only two European incumbent operators to fully own a cable-TV network in its domestic market. 10 TDC Annual Report 2010 Outside Denmark, TDC has significant presence in the panNordic business market. With fully controlled subsidiaries in Sweden, Norway and Finland, TDC can offer pan-Nordic solutions to businesses and organisations across the Nordic countries and challenge the local incumbent operators by offering its corporate customers seamless business solutions, including hosting and systems integration solutions. Organisation and brands TDC has a customer-centric structure with five business divisions and a shared headquarters function to emphasise its focus on customer types and needs. Through a multi-brand strategy based on differentiated brands such as TDC, Fullrate, Telmore, M1 and YouSee, TDC products span all key telecommunications product segments in Denmark, with price positions ranging from nofrills to premium. Strong brand recognition is achieved in each of these market segments, and TDC distributes its products through an extensive distribution network, including TDC’s own shops, dealer network, account managers, call centres and websites. 11 TDC Annual Report 2010 Infrastructure Currently, TDC’s mobile network covers almost the entire Denmark has the highest broadband penetration in the population with GSM and EDGE, 94% of the population with world with 74% of all households and businesses 3G, and continuous HSDPA roll-out enabling download subscribing to broadband through xDSL, coax, fibre or other speeds of up to 42 Mbps is in progress.

Jacobsen Jan Bardino Bo Magnussen 226 TDC Annual Report 2010 Independent Auditor’s Report Independent Auditor’s Report To the shareholders of TDC A/S We have audited the Annual Report of TDC A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2010 which comprises the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Parent Company Financial Statements (“the Financial Statements”) and Management’s Review. The Financial Statements comprise statements of income, statements of comprehensive income, balance sheets, statements of cash flow, statements of changes in equity and notes for both the Group and the Parent Company. The Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. Management’s Review is also prepared in accordance with Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. Management’s Responsibility Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the Financial Statements in accordance with the above-mentioned legislation and disclosure requirements. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The responsibility also includes selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies, and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, Management is responsible for preparing a Management’s Review that provides a fair review in accordance with Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. Auditor’s Responsibility and Basis of Opinion Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Annual Report based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International and Danish Auditing Standards. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the Annual Report is free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Annual Report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Annual Report, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the Financial Statements and to the preparation of a Management’s Review that provides a fair review in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Annual Report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our audit has not resulted in any qualification. Opinion In our opinion, the Financial Statements provide a true and fair view of the financial position at 31 December 2010 of the Group and the Parent Company and of the results of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s operations and cash flows for the financial year 2010 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. Further, in our opinion Management’s Review provides a fair review in accordance with Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.
