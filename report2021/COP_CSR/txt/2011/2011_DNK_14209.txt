The G3 Guidelines are available for free downloading in several languages at www.globalreporting.org © 2011 GRI 1 Box 1—About our company Profile 1. Strategy and Analysis This section is intended to provide a high-level, strategic view of the organization’s relationship to sustainability in order to provide context for subsequent and more detailed reporting against other sections of the Guidelines. It may draw on information provided in other parts of the report, but this section is intended to produce insight on strategic topics rather than simply summarize the contents of the report. The strategy and analysis should consist of the statement outlined in 1.1 (…). 1.1 Statement from the most senior decision-maker of the organization (e.g., CEO, Chair, or equivalent senior position) about the relevance of sustainability to the organization and its strategy. The statement should present the overall vision and strategy for the short-term, medium-term (e.g., 3-5 years), and long-term, particularly with regard to managing the key challenges associated with economic, environmental and social performance. The statement should include: • Strategic priorities and key topics for the short/medium-term with regard to sustainability, including respect for the internationally agreed standards and how they relate to long-term organizational strategy and success; • Broader trends (e.g. macroeconomic or political) affecting the organization and influencing sustainability priorities; • Key events, achievements, and failures during the reporting period; • Views on performance with respect to targets; • Outlook on the organization’s main challenges and targets for the next year and goals for the coming 3-5 years; and • Other items pertaining to the organization’s strategic approach. [GRI G3: p. 20] Over more than 30 years, LM Wind Power has built the business on great technology and grown and developed to become the world's largest component and service supplier to the wind industry. As such, we have already contributed greatly to an industry which is widely believed to hold some of the solutions to the pressing global challenges of climate change, ensuring stable energy supply and meeting increasing energy needs. We are proud of that contribution and believe that it comes with an obligation and a responsibility. Profitable growth, integrity and caring for people as well as for the environment have always been at the core of our business approach, but there’s room for improvement. With the growth and maturing of our business over the years our ability to and need for working more systematically with sustainability across the group have increased. A strategic priority Our new corporate strategy which was launched in the summer of 2010, explicitly and deliberately addresses sustainability as a key component of achieving long term business success. It is not about philanthropy or making us look better than we are. It’s about confronting the environmental and social challenges we face in our business and achieving real change which we will manage and document through measured progress on key sustainability indicators. The keywords are humble, no-nonsense and business focused. In addition to putting sustainability formally into the business strategy and goals, 2010 offered several milestones for LM Wind Power’s sustainability efforts. Organization LM Wind Power’s sustainability organization that was formally established in 2010 is rooted in the executive management of the LM Wind Power group. A sustainability board, consisting of the VP Operations, VP Service & Logistics, Head of Global HR, VP Product Development and VP Global Communications, oversees the strategic development and ensures alignment and integration with the corporate strategy and business goals. The board members are responsible for key sustainability areas: Safety and Environment Operations, Technology Product Development, People HR. The sustainability board reports directly to the CEO and works closely together with a cross functional sustainability team with representation from HR, Legal, Product Development, Sales, Service & Logistics and Svendborg Brakes who coordinate the more operational aspect of our sustainability activities together with our local teams in the plants and offices around the world. © 2011 GRI 2 Safety, Environment, Technology and People Four focus areas frame our efforts: Safety, Environment, Technology and People. They are all interlinked and reflect that we have a holistic view on sustainability. Especially, Safety and Environment have received particular attention in 2010. Ensuring the highest safety and quality standards in our manufacturing and service operations enables us to meet customers’ expectations and not waste resources. It’s been said over and over but our people truly are our most important resource. As a manufacturing company, we face a permanent challenge of securing the highest level of safety for our people and building a strong and enduring safety culture. We are committed to improving our track record on safety and we have taken on the world’s leading safety consultants, DuPont, to help us achieve this and build an even stronger safety platform to take us into the future. Our overall target was a lost time accident rate of 5 in 2010. We didn’t meet that but we continue our efforts and the target is the same for 2011. We work on an organizational, structural and cultural level to meet this target. Improving Health and Safety standards is a key strategic priority both short and long term. We have sold more than 140600 blades which each year effectively replace more than 83 million tons of CO2. That is positive but manufacturing, assembling and transporting them require resources and energy and produces waste. In the Service & Logistics division, which for now represents a relatively small proportion of our business, the environmental impact stems primarily from travel, operation of equipment and transportation of equipment and people. Regardless of the source, we are committed to improving how we manage the environmental impact through the entire life-cycle of our products and services. Part of that is also looking at the products’ end of life. Over the coming years, several blades will need to be taken out of operation due to wear and tear during a typical lifetime of 20 years. We are investigating possible solutions that provide a more environmentally friendly alternative for disposal than landfill. We expect to launch this in Europe where the demand is greatest end 2011. On the operations side, one of the things we have worked focused on in 2010 is reducing waste from our plants. Through working with suppliers, optimizing processes and innovating to recycle more, we have reduced waste to landfill by 23% from 9576 t in 2009 to 7382 t in 2010 from our blade plants. Some plants even achieved zero waste to landfill in 2010, for example our plant in Goleniów, Poland. The basis for achieving this differs according to local regulations and systems. In addition to the environmental benefits, this has also provided financial benefits in terms of lower costs to landfill disposal. The waste factor is also in the process of being included in the development of new products as the first step towards implementing full life cycle assessments in our product development. Focusing on waste is important but a lot of other activities leave a carbon footprint. For now we are focusing on the emissions of which we are in direct control – like fuel, electricity and material consumption but we are determined to expand the scope to include transportation, business travel and suppliers to the extent possible and started up that work in 2010. Managing reporting To manage our continuous reporting and sustainability performance, we have implemented a best-in-class reporting software, SoFi developed by PE International. People from key functions, primarily in HSE, HR and Facility Management, across the world insert data at pre-defined intervals allowing us to monitor our performance on key sustainability indicators which we have defined according to the Global Reporting Initiative framework and relevance for our business goals. It's a learning process and the data gathered in this first round of reporting most likely reflect that. The 2010 report is short of targets as this is the first time we gathered specific sustainability data. We are now scrutinizing the data and expect to report our targets in the 2011 report and continuously on our website. As we mature and gain more experience with this new reporting, we are confident that the SoFi software will be an important lever for ensuring consistent and valid reporting over time. UN Global Compact Our sustainability efforts culminated with our commitment to the UN Global Compact in November 2010 which we see as an important strategic statement and driver for our further development towards improved sustainability. We hereby confirm our continued commitment to integrating the UN Global Compact principles into our operations and daily work. Our Code of Conduct directly relates to the areas covered by the UN Global Compact’s universal principles within human rights, labor, and anti-corruption. It specifies clearly that we do not tolerate any form of child labor, forced labor or corruption. All employees is introduced to the Code of Conduct as part of their induction and sign it. So do suppliers and partners. The environmental aspect is among other things governed by our global environmental management system ISO14001. We require all new sites to have the ISO 14001 certification within one year of operation start up. Furthermore, we have mandatory HSE assessments in place in the early stages of new product and material introductions as well as for building and expanding our manufacturing facilities. The growth in wind will increasingly take place in emerging markets and we are ready to expand our global footprint in line with our customers’ needs. When operating on new turfs the UN Global Compact principles become even more significant and we realize that we might need to do an extra effort to ensure that standards on human rights and labor conditions are respected at all times. We are preparing for that by stepping up our efforts to reinforce our Code of Conduct and raise awareness among our employees and stakeholders on our expectations. © 2011 GRI 3 2.

Governance, Commitments and Engagement Governance 4.1 Governance structure of the organization, including committees under the highest governance body responsible for specific tasks, such as setting strategy or organizational oversight. [GRI G3: p. 22] The highest governance body of LM Wind Power Holding A/S is the Board, consisting of representatives from our owners and the employees. The board establishes the main principles for the business operations e.g. how investments are undertaken. The Board also makes decisions on any arrangement that of size or nature is of exceptional importance to the company. The Board is responsible for the overall strategic management of the company and must oversee: • that thee accounting and presentation of accounts take place in a satisfactory way according to the company’s capital conditions, • that the necessary procedures for risk management and internal control are in place, • that the Board continuously receive the necessary reporting about the company’s financial conditions, • that the managing directors carry out their duties in a proper way and according to the guidelines of the Board, • that there’s a proper level of capital preparedness including sufficient liquidity to live up to the company’s current and future obligations when they are due.

[GRI G3: p. 23] As LM Wind Power Holding A/S is legally registered in Denmark, we follow the Danish Companies Act. This specifies that employees need to be represented in the highest level governance body. LM Wind Power employees are represented in the Supervisory Board of LM Wind Power Holding A/S with two members and two substitutes that are elected by the employees in Denmark. The employee representatives participate in quarterly meetings and can raise their concerns and questions directly with the owners of the Group. During the year 2010, there has been one employee representative in 2010 due to operational changes. However, in spring 2011 two new members and two substitutes were elected. In 2010, one of the topics raised in the Board was how to ensure a better working environment by reducing styrene emission levels in the blade manufacturing plants. In Denmark there are furthermore collaboration committees consisting of representatives from management and the employees. All operational changes or implementation of new technology which affect the employees need to be discussed in the collaboration committees. The structure of the committees' work is established in the collective agreement between the Confederation of Danish Employers and the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions.

[GRI G3: p. 22] The most significant change compared to previous reporting is that the GRI framework has been applied to ensure that the metrics are widely recognized to reflect sustainability performance and because the framework provides comprehensive guidance and support in reporting according to international standards which allows us to expand the scope of our reporting in line with the development of our organization. © 2011 GRI 8 Box 3—About our stakeholders 4. Governance, Commitments and Engagement Stakeholder Engagement The following Disclosure Items refer to general stakeholder engagement conducted by the organization over the course of the reporting period. These Disclosures are not limited to stakeholder engagement implemented for the purposes of preparing a sustainability report. 4.14 List of stakeholder groups engaged by the organization. Examples of stakeholder groups are: • Communities; • Civil society; • Customers; • Shareholders and providers of capital; • Suppliers; and • Employees, other workers and their trade unions. [GRI G3: p. 24] Customers Employees Suppliers Investor community incl. our owners Local communities 4.15 Basis for identification and selection of stakeholders with whom to engage. [GRI G3: p. 24] The stakeholders have been identified by the cross functional sustainability group, and endorsed by executive management, through review of unsystematic but continuous feedback/requests on LM Wind Power's sustainability activities and performance from all stakeholder groups. Furthermore, we structured our review around the key criteria: Who do we have a direct impact on? Who will expect us to take an active stand on sustainability? Who would share our interests in sustainability and can help drive our improvements? We have engaged directly with those who can help us make a difference in reducing our environmental impact, improve our working environment and boost our technology to make even more efficient products that help power a cleaner world. Especially our employees and our suppliers play an important role. We have several projects ongoing with suppliers to reduce material waste, improve working environment, reduce our energy consumption, upgrade the skills of our employees and boost our technology to make it more efficient and thereby contribute to making wind power more attractive. We will among other things engage with the investor community through our reporting and our annual Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact and continuously on our corporate website. © 2011 GRI 9 Box 4—Determining report content 3. Report Parameters Report scope and boundary 3.5 Process for defining report content, including: • Determining materiality; • Prioritizing topics within the report; and • Identifying stakeholders the organization expects to use the report. [GRI G3: p. 21] The performance indicators included in this first sustainability report using the Global Reporting Initiative framework have been determined through a process of systematic review of the business' current sustainability challenges and focus areas by the cross-functional team and the sustainability board. The selected indicators represent Human Rights, Social, Labor and Environmental performance and are for now solely based on the Global Reporting Initiative's suggested list of sustainability indicators. The majority of the indicators represent environmental performance. As a company operating in a green industry we see it as part of our responsibility to continuously make our products and operations more environmentally friendly. We aim to reduce our environmental impact through the entire life cycle of our products and services and that includes mapping the current impact and setting targets for our performance which we will do based on the data from 2010 that we collected for the annual report and this Communication on Progress. This is also closely linked to the Product Responsibility indicator which is a key indicator for LM Wind Power and one we expect to be able to expand our reporting on in line with our increased integration of life cycle assessment measures in our product development. Another key area is labor. We will track our performance on indicators related to working environment for our people. This relates to physical conditions and our drive towards an improved safety culture, and how we ensure people are motivated, encourage and able to utilize their potential and enjoy going to work. Finally, we want to improve on how we work with suppliers and anti-corruption. As an international company with many interfaces to the external world, we need to have a strong position on how we deal with practices that do not comply with internationally recognized standards. We want to ensure our Code of Conduct is enforced and highlighted to our employees and external partners and have initiated a formal training program that will reach our employees in the beginning of 2012. The performance indicators with comments are attached as a separate document as we have included more than the 10 this template allows for. We expect this report will be used by our management and owners, by our employees, customers, potential investors, and any other stakeholder with an interest in our business and progress towards increased sustainability. © 2011 GRI 10 Sustainability report 2010 using the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines Data on Performance Indicator 1: EC7 Procedures for local hiring and proportion of senior management hired from the local community at locations of significant operation.

This program includes a thorough introduction to the Code of Conduct. We are planning to do more to raise awareness about the spirit and guidelines of the Code of Conduct among our employees and will work across the group in 2011 to achieve this. Indicator 16: SO 4 Actions taken in response to incidents of corruption. Performance No incidents where employees were dismissed or disciplined for corruption. No incidents where contracts were not renewed due to violations related to corruption No incidents where LM Wind Power was accused of corruption by external parties. Comments LM Wind Power’s Code of Conduct specifies: “LM Wind Power’s dealings with its business partners shall be characterized by integrity and fairness. LM Wind Power shall not offer customers, potential customers, governments, agencies of governments, or any representatives of such entities, any rewards or benefits in violation of either applicable laws or reasonable and generally accepted business practices. Offering or providing, directly or indirectly, anything of value (except normal small gifts approved by the CEO of the LM Wind Power Group), including cash, bribes or kickbacks, to any stakeholder, including, but not limited to suppliers, customers or government officials in connection with any LM Wind Power procurement, transaction or business dealing is strictly forbidden. LM Wind Power employees must not accept or offer payments, gifts (except normal small gifts approved by the CEO of the LM Wind Power Group), or other kinds of reimbursement from or to a third party that could affect or appear to affect the objectivity in their business decisions. In the assessment of potential and current suppliers, the principles described in this Code of Conduct shall be applied.” Reports of violations of the Code of Conduct may be done anonymously and confidentially. It is the responsibility of the VP HR and Legal Counsel to investigate all reported violations. In 2011, a formal whistleblower system will be established along with training in the UK antibribery Act which we are covered by due to our British ownership. Indicator 17: PR 1 Life cycle stages in which health and safety impacts of products and services are assessed for improvement, and percentage of significant products and services subject to such procedures. Performance R&D Manufacturing & Production Use and service Storage, distribution and supply Disposal, reuse, recycling 100% of LM Wind Power’s products and services are covered by and assessed for improvements of health and safety impact in at least one life cycle stage. Comments LM Wind Power has not made a full Life Cycle Assessment of our products. However, we have various initiatives, processes and projects in place that focus on improving health and safety impacts at different parts of the product life cycle. Focus in 2011 will be to align these initiatives better across the various functions to move towards a full life cycle assessment approach within the next few years. Examples of current practices: All new materials or materials that will be used differently are subject to a mandatory HSE assessment by Global HSE where impact on the people working with the material and impact on the external environment are assessed in relation to legal requirements and cost. Our manufacturing sites and HSE department are continuously running projects to reduce the use or amount of chemicals in our manufacturing or replacing them with more environmentally friendly alternatives. In 2010 we tested a number of low styrene gelcoats to be able to implement a better solution in our plants. This was achieved in 2011 where we started global implementation. This initiative together with technical innovations on the mold and the spraying equipment will lower the emission of styrene in the plants by approximately 50%. The low styrene gelcoat is expected to be implemented in all plants by April 2012. Our R&D function is on a constant quest for more efficient products that increase the energy production and make wind power more attractive. Our acoustics experts are working on designing low noise blades to reduce the disturbance from turbines close to residential areas. We are testing various profiles and features and are gathering new knowledge that will soon go into the blades. The Service & Logistics division is investigating various ways of transporting more blades on a truck at the same time to reduce the fuel consumption and heavy traffic caused by huge blade transports. LM Wind Power is working with external suppliers on providing a blade disposal solution for worn out blades that is more environmentally friendly than sending them to landfill. For now, this will involve incineration which generates energy that can be produced for production of other materials or products. We are supporting and following research into potential blade recycling solutions to be able to provide the least environmentally damaging way of disposing of the blades. As the solutions available are highly costly, this is a longer term development focus.
