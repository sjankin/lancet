Principle 9): Encourage the development and diffusion of environment friendly technologies BHEL’s products, including clean technologies are regularly monitored against those of other leading similar equipment manufacturers and relevant international standards. Gaps, if any, are identified and developmental projects are undertaken to bridge them. BHEL has been actively developing and acquiring clean technologies for power generation over past three decades. BHEL initiated a coal research programme in the late seventies to develop technologies to efficiently utilize Indian Coal while minimizing the associated environmental impacts. These technologies enable BHEL’s customers to minimize the impact of power generation on the environment. Some of them are mentioned below:  Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) BHEL is one of the few companies worldwide, involved in development of technology. It is an advanced technology that represents the cleanest of currently available coal technologies. An IGCC power plant combines the benefits of two highly efficient and environmentally clean processes: coal gasification and gas turbine based combined cycle. The integration of these technologies yields high efficiency of the combined cycle design with low cost coal as fuel. Gasification also inherently reduces emission of Sox. Further as the coal gas is cleaned before being fired in the gas turbine, particulate pollutants in the exhaust gases are negligible. BHEL has entered into MoU with APGENCO in May’2008 to set up a 182 MW IGCC plant at the Vijayawada Thermal Power Plant. In this regard, BHEL is pursuing with the Government of India for an early sanction of Rs. 350 Crore grant to partially cover the additional cost, as earlier recommended and as extended by various Governments internationally, which could enable this project of international importance to take off at the earliest.  Supercritical Thermal power Plant – A Supercritical thermal power plant has higher efficiency compared to the conventional sub-critical cycle, thus offering the advantage of burning lesser fuel for the same output and with low emissions. For this, BHEL has entered into a technical collaboration agreement for Oncethrough supercritical boilers with M/s Alstom, France, one of the world leaders in this technology. For steam turbines, BHEL has an ongoing technical collaboration agreement with Siemens, Germany. BHEL is executing orders for 660 and 800 MW supercritical steam generators and turbo generators. BHEL has also developed equipment for 700 MW supercritical applications. • Advanced Ultra Supercritical (Adv-USC) Thermal Power Plant Technology Government of India has proposed the creation of a National Mission for Clean Coal (Carbon) Technologies, as the Ninth Mission under the National Action Plan on Climate Change. Development of Advanced Ultra Supercritical (Adv-USC) Technology for Power Plants is one of four Sub-Missions in the Mission, wherein the objective is to develop and establish an 800 MW Adv-USC demonstration power plant. The major benefits of Adv-USC technology are higher efficiency, lower coal consumption and less carbon di-oxide emission per MWe-hour power generated. The core group for the Mission comprises of Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), NTPC Ltd. and BHEL. For this, BHEL is actively pursuing work related to this area. • Advanced Class Gas Turbines BHEL has introduced Advanced Class Gas Turbine technology in the country in collaboration with General Electric, USA. The efficiency of an Advanced Class GT in the combined cycle mode is in the range of 56 57% under Indian conditions. Natural gas as fuel used in the gas turbine based combined cycle plants is the cleanest among the fossil fuels and produces the minimum pollution and carbon dioxide emission. • Sub-critical Thermal Power Plants with Enhanced Efficiency BHEL has been continually making efforts to improve the efficiency of thermal power plants. Since 1977, when 210 MW plants based on KWU technology were first introduced, the heat rate of BHEL's 210 MW and 500 MW steam turbines has reduced by about 5.4% and 3.1% respectively, resulting in reduced coal consumption. A new variant of 500 MW steam turbine has been introduced by BHEL wherein thermal performance of the cycle is about 0.6% better than that of the conventional cycle. A new cost effective and thermodynamically efficient plant with a unit rating of 600 MW has also been developed. • Hydro Power Plants BHEL is a leading manufacturer and supplier of hydro power plant equipment, including hydro turbines and hydro-generators. These are comparable to the best in the world in terms of operating efficiencies. The company is continuously expanding its range and is developing equipment to suit larger size power plants up to 250 MW.  Reduction of NOx and SOx Emissions Emissions of oxides from thermal power plants of nitrogen and sulphur are collectively called NOx and SOx, and are a health hazard. BHEL has developed in-house several technologies for reduction of emissions from thermal power plants. A Bypass Over Fire Air (BOFA) system has been successfully retrofitted at 250 MW Suratgarh TPP. Low NOx oil fired burners have also been developed. In addition, BHEL has developed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system which can remove NOx from the flue gas. Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) systems remove sulphur dioxide from the flue gas. BHEL has supplyied an FGD system for 250 MW Trombay thermal power plants in association with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan. Circulating Fluidised Bed Combustion (CFBC) power plants, which are suitable for high sulphur content lignite, are also part of BHEL's product range.  Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs) BHEL is the leading manufacturer and supplier of ESPs used for removing fly ash from the flue gas in the country, having efficiencies of over 99.9%.  Solar Photovoltaics (SPV) BHEL is one of the leading manufacturer and supplier of silicon solar cells in India. For this, the Company has manufacturing facilities for solar photovoltaic cells 8 modules at its Bangalore Unit with a capacity of 8 MW per annum. There is also an R&D facility, Amorphous Silicon Solar Cell Plant (ASSCP), located at Gurgaon. BHEL's solar modules have been contributing to the national effort for development of farflung/remote areas. BHEL has supplied and commissioned SPV plants of different ratings for WEBREDA in the Sunderbans/ Sagar Island to provide power to remote village communities. BHEL has also supplied solar PV plants for the Lakshadweep Islands and the Company has recently won a major turnkey contract in June 2011 for setting up an eco-friendly Grid-Connected Solar Power Plant of 5 MW capacity from KPCL.  Fuel Cells Hydrogen energy promises to the cleanest form of energy in the future. BHEL has been carrying out R&D on fuel cells for over two decades. Anti-Corruption Principle 10): Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery BHEL is committed to enhancing transparency in all its business decisions, including extortion and bribery. To achieve the objective, training programmes, seminars / conferences and interaction of Chief Vigilance Officer with the employees is a regular feature in the company. Main objective of the company is to curb corruption by focusing more on the preventive and educative aspects, rather than investigative / punitive measures. With a view to bring in transparency, Government of India has enacted “Right to information Act” giving right to all citizens of India to seek information besides other rights of inspection etc. BHEL has taken lead role in implementing all provisions of the act in letter and spirit. The organization has signed the ‘Integrity Pact’ with Transparency International on 16.12.2008. Three independent External Monitors (IEM) have since been appointed on 17.12.2009 with the approval of the Central Vigilance Commission. The intention is to make public procurement and contacting more transparent by binding both the parties to ethical conduct. This would enable a monitoring role for civil society – the ultimate beneficiary. During the year 2010-11, the provisions have been corrected to include more number of purchasing decisions in the ambit of the Integrity Pact. In order to prevent corruption, a host of ‘transparency measures’ have been initiated company wide, by leveraging various technologies. Some of these measures are:  Information relating to Rules/Procedures governing the registration of vendors, clearances of bills etc. is available on the BHEL / Units’ web site.  Vendor registration applications, vendor registration process and status of vendor registration process are available on the Company’s web site.  Purchase indent are raised On-line.  All tenders are hosted on the Company’s web site.  All details of purchase orders and contracts concluded are available on the Company’s web site.  All payments are made through the electronic mode.  Bill payment status of all vendor bills is constantly updated on the web site. As part of company’s endeavor to set high standards of conduct for its employees, a code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been laid down for all Board members and Senior Management Personnel. The code encompasses General Moral Imperatives, Specific Professional Responsibilities, and Additional duties/imperatives for them.
