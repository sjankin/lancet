THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2010 BY KJAER GROUP A/S HUMAN RIGHTS LABOUR RIGHTS ENVIRONMENT ANTI-CORRUPTION UN GLOBAL COMPACT – COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2010 P a g e |2 UN GLOBAL COMPACT – COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2010 MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Kjaer Group A/S is committed to the principles articulated in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). We have been proud signatories to this international voluntary initiative since November 2003. In 2007 Kjaer Group A/S further confirmed our support for a cleaner environment by joining UN’s environmental initiative, Caring for the Climate. The UN Global Compact establishes an important framework for the activities of Kjaer Group A/S and it is incorporated into the company’s governance framework: The Kjaer Group Way of Management (KWOM). In 2009, Kjaer Group A/S started facilitating the communication and interpretation of KWOM including the implementation of key policies and processes. This has resulted in a systematic approach and structure, which allows us to follow up on, improve and appreciate the achieved success. An example is the focus on implementing our Global Risk Management, Remuneration and HSE policies, which have given us insight and direction on how to improve our business in a sustainable way. Though we have not reached our overall targets yet, we are confident that if we carry on aiming at the target set in 2009, we will continue the growth of our business in a responsible manner, balancing the financial results with social and environmental responsibilities. We are optimistic about the opportunities for our business and the positive effects our approach will continue to have on people’s lives in the developing countries we are operating in. We strongly believe that the systematic approach we are practicing through KWOM will contribute to the development of international high standards in these emerging economies in the area of social obligations and environmental challenges. Thus, on behalf of Kjaer Group’s 250 employees, I reaffirm our commitment to compliance with the 10 Principles of the Global Compact. I hope you will find this Communication on Progress informative and I invite you to view the Kjaer Group website www.kjaergroup.com and our Annual Report 2010. Per S.
