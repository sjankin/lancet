As a result of this, there was a significant increase in number of visits to the web site during the year. From January 1st 2010 Air Greenland Travel returned to Greenland Travel. At the same time, Air Greenland opened a call centre, which handles support for the web site, customers from the business portal and direct sales over the phone.

We had planned to gain a good 23 connection to the global distribution systems GDS (Amadeus, Sabre etc.), where the agents could look forward to being able to book tickets with Air Greenland.

Charter After the company’s Boeing 757 was phased out, charter sales on the large aircraft have naturally been significantly reduced.

Expected growth The charter area is expected to achieve growth as a consequence of the continued, high level of exploration activity in the mineral sector as well as the scientific field. The offshore area is expected to grow and Cairn Energy is expected to have at least the same level of operations in 2011 as there was in 2010. This will contribute to a continued, positive development with regard to Air Greenland’s sub-contracting activity to the direct supplier of helicopter transport, Cougar Helicopters. In 2011 Air Greenland expects to contribute with charter flights with DHC 7s, to help with handling, hangar facilities, helicopter pilots, hotel accommodation and, for the first time, also aircraft mechanics. Air Greenland has decided that the offshore area is a natural field of business for the company and acknowledges that this will require considerable adjustments in the helicopter fleet, in competences and in the organisation. This will be a guiding 30 principle for the company’s business plans over 31 coming years to prepare Air Greenland, so that it can provide services to the oil companies that have been granted concessions in the assigned fields on the Greenlandic shelf. The increasing offshore activity has created an enormous need for expanding the existing SAR preparedness and this will require investments in new equipment. There should be no doubt that Air Greenland is ready to invest in modern SAR helicopters, provided there is consensus concerning the length, extent, finances and profitability of the future SAR preparedness. Air Greenland is active in making its competence and experience available to those authorities that are responsible for SAR preparedness in Greenland. The usual demand is expected from the regular, year-round customers Tele, DMI/Ice Centre and the health authorities. In the building and construction sector, there is high activity surrounding the construction of a hydroelectric plant in Ilulissat, where Air Greenland expects to carry out some helicopter work in 2011.
