Achieving sustainability requires hard work every step of the way. For Nissan, this means taking steps in the short term that build and reinforce sustainable business objectives over longer periods. During the financial and economic crisis in recent years, we have taken the needed short-term steps while keeping our eye on priorities for the medium and longer term. For example, we remain firmly committed to leadership in zero-emission vehicles and to affordable cars that will bring mobility to more people than ever. These objectives are linked. We know that as human populations and incomes continue to rise, people will seek the mobility that only cars can provide. Giving them access to mobility in ways that minimize the impact on the global environment is our duty as a responsible automaker. Sustainability comes from offering cars that are the most Carlos Ghosn environmentally friendly, most fuel-efficient and most affordable possible. President and Chief Executive Officer Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. In all that we do, we are guided by the desire to keep Nissan at the heart of the mobility society into the future. Nissan’s foundation for sustainable business has evolved over many years. In good times and bad, our desire to create attractive, appealing products and to contribute to society has never wavered. We are always working toward the future. (Edited excerpt from the 2010 Sustainability Report) What is CSR?
