co-creator of social, environmental, and economic development driven by the conscious decision to operate according to principles of sustainability. The strong commitment to sustainable development has been present since the early beginning of Trimo's work and is a vital part of the mission and organisational climate of the Trimo Group which is based on values: responsibility, partnership, innovation, passion, reliability, and trust. Sustainable development brings positive effects to: the natural environment, and to people be it employees, business partners, or the local and broader community; to the economic operation of our company, our suppliers, and our customers. Trimo ensures a balance of natural, social, and business interests by providing for social responsibility, environmental management, and commercial competitiveness. 1 More information: http://www.trimo.eu/company/sustainable‐development/for‐sustainable‐operation/ 5 Leading with vision, inspiration and integrity We understand management as an important step on the path towards the sustainable development of Trimo companyand the Trimo Group. The dynamics of changes in the business environment are increasing, which also increases the number of possible ways to achieve goals. Fast decisions in various operating processes are necessary, which also require many individuals – managers who can make fast decisions in line with the company’s vision and strategic goals. The success of the company cannot be ensured by employees who merely possess the necessary business competencies. They also have to be genuinely involved in the company and be able to take initiatives. Employees also confirm this as an increasing number of people want to play a more active role in the operating processes. They want to co-create an ethical way of operating that complies with their values. Management is, therefore, also important for the personal and professional development of employees. Management development The participants of a 2-year management development process created TLAK Trimo Leadership Alumni Klub. This way we contribute to the development of managers in the Trimo Group. We are aware that management competencies can be used for the growth or manipulation of people. The difference lies in values. That is why we put ethics on the top of our list of values. Trimo managers are developed to be evolutionary leaders guided by a clear vision and strong values. Trimo wants managers with complete personalities and developed and reasonable, emotional and spiritual intelligence. Trimo is aware that the role of a manager continually develops and is never be completed. That is why we see inspiration for this in the awareness to complete our mission and develop new ways for cooperation that will benefit the whole community. Organisational formations for integrating knowledge of the Trimo team By integrating vision and value we encourage the workforce's transformation into organisational formations that will be capable of linking together the knowledge of the whole Trimo team. Trimo is raising awareness of the fact that we are all part of a system, and we have an effect on it with our thoughts and actions, and the system can affect us. If everyone thinks positively, and searches for opportunities together, then everybody will grow. That is why we organise different meetings to exchange experience, knowledge, and good practice. All participants helped to cocreate our strategic conference in 2010 , and we organised the conference for managers of subsidiaries in a similar way. This year, we also included persons employed in Akripol into our traditional annual training for all employees. Together for sustainable development of Trimo The common thread to activities and meetings during the year was maintaining a clear direction and finding opportunities for renewing a business model focused more on creating increased added value. We worked on the ability to make the 6 right decisions, in time, in order to direct activities according to market needs. Fast knowledge transfer and a combined search for new ways of operating, which includes all employees in the process, and encourages the creation of new ways of co-operating and developing an organisation, will increase the realisation of new ideas. Such forms of cooperation will also continue in the future as we are strengthening the awareness of co-dependency, and will be able to realise our mission only when we focus on the same goal as a team. 7 Creating added value for customers In Trimo a complete solution consists of building long-term cooperation, a partnership, and mutual trust. We offer loyalty and an open model of cooperation to our business partners. Trimo’s slogan “Complete solutions” is included in every level of our operation. It does not merely consist of expanding the product and service range for the customer, it also presents a specific business model which – unlike numerous other producers of construction material enables Trimo to offer solutions to customers for a complete range of services – from encouragement to search for ideas, to actual ideas and their development, design engineering, technical support, production, assembly, and servicing. Management of the complete supply chain gives Trimo a chance to transfer ideas and best solutions and experiences through the whole process back to development and design of optimised initial solutions. This provides a complete solution for the customer, that is also optimal and most favourable. Trimo has one of the most comprehensive set of certificates and sales permits in this specific marketing segment. Besides from the evidence of compliance with the harmonized standards and the most important signs of quality required by regulation such as FMA and LPCB which meet the highest demands made by insurance companies for the most demanding projects, by following stringent requirements of quality control and monitoring2, in 2010, we obtained the certification of the SBSC Association,3 which allows the use of our products in buildings that require good anti-theft security. In quality development, Trimo actively participates in the professional EPAQ4 association that offers customers an above standard quality of products and services. We successfully completed the certification process and obtained a mark of an above standard quality for the entire Trimoterm A12T and B12T product families. In 2010 Trimo company has not been aware of any complaints of disregarding rules, or concerning codes on product and service information or marking.5 Marketing Marketing is aimed at activities that enable efficient implementation of strategic business plans and raise Trimo's reputation and recognition with the target public. Marketing activities are aimed at long-term, two-way, relationships, which 2 GRI: PR3 3 Svensk Brand & Säkerhets Certifiering AB (SBSC) 4 Eueopean Quality Assurance Association for Panels and Profiles (EPAQ 5 GRI: PR4 8 strengthen the meaning and role of the Trimo brand, and support Trimo’s sales and other activities, and ensure products and services enter the market. Trimo respects the laws, standards, and voluntary codes regarding market communication, including advertising, promotion, and sponsorships. There were no violations of these.6 Trimo has not received any complaints on violations regarding customer privacy and loss of customer information.7 Trimo has not been imposed with fines for breaching laws and regulations regarding product and service supply and use.8 Sales network9 Apart from the parent company in Slovenia, Trimo's sales network is also comprised of subsidiaries, representative offices, and agents. Trimo is directly present in 25 European and Near East markets. Production plants are located in Slovenia (Trimo, Akripol, and Tinde), Russia, Serbia, and the United Arab Emirates. Great Britain, Germany, Russia, Croatia, Poland, Spain, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia are representedby Trimo through sales companies. Trimo also spread their operations through representative offices (two representative offices in Slovenia and one in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Austria). In developing recognition of the corporate brand and sales of products, we also co-operate with agents in the Netherlands, Greece, Turkey, France, Lithuania, Macedonia, Switzerland, and Algeria. In 2010 Trimo expanded the sales network mainly by establishing new sales partnerships. It is with our direct presence that we react to the dynamic and unpredictable global environment. We are always searching for new opportunities and challenges. Sharing processes and knowledge with Trimo's sales network staff (external and internal training, annual sales network meetings, round tables, portal Trimonet) is a means of caring for its good organisation, connection, and solidarity. It is also a way of establishing cultural dialogue, and updating the local representatives on new products, results, guidelines, and the developed strategy. 6 GRI: PR6, PR7 7 GRI: PR8 8 GRI: PR9 9 GRI: 2.5 9 Picture e 1: Sales network n Sales o of new pro oducts New prroducts ha ave an imp portant co ontribution n to sales growth, accquisition of new custom mers, and entering new marrkets.

Customer satisfaction20 We have been assessing customer satisfaction, according to key groups, for several years, namely for: • large customers, • container customers, and • architects and designers. Trimo knows that satisfied and loyal customers are not just long-term partners – they also provide word-of-mouth marketing, and that is why Trimo measures the effectiveness of this market communication strategy. Trimo performs activities to improve satisfaction based on analyses of satisfaction measurements and personal interviews with customers; and creates increased added value for the customer through the process of improvements. Graph 1: Customer satisfaction with the Trimo brand, 2006 until 2010 100% 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Very good Good Medium Poor Very poor No answer The general assessment of customers for 2010 is high, with 87 percent customers of the opinion that their cooperation with Trimo was good or very good. For the key advantage of business co-operation with Trimo, customers pointed out product quality, and technical support. Research and development activities Despite the economic crisis in 2010, research and development activities still had an important role in Trimo’s business strategy to ensure competitive advantage and create added value for our customers. Investments in development remained at a similar level as 2009. The economic crisis still had an influence on the range of development projects, which made us 20 GRI: 4.16, PR5 13 even more focused on those with added value, fast market entrance, and the best ratio between required investments and return. Our mission in 2010 providing original and complete solutions in steel buildings – was also achieved by expanding the culture of innovation in Trimo, and strategic investment into development. Sustainable development is a key component of the development strategy Development activities in the field of sustainable development, and related responsibility for a sustainable future, remain a vital part of our development strategy, especially in the form of an important addition to our range of products and commitment to create complete solutions for our customers. Further cooperation in the associations, Planet Positive and UNGC, shows our continued clear commitment towards realising sustainable construction of modern buildings and sustainable operations.21 This way we are also abiding by the UNGC principles on a preventive approach to environmental issues, encouraging increased responsible environmental management, and developing and expanding environmental-friendly technology. The development of new products and technologies is based on sustainable development by protecting the environment and nature. Safety and environmental references are considered in developing products, systems, and technology. Development of new products New products present an important contribution to sales growth, finding new customers, and entering new markets. They are an important tool for differentiating and avoiding competition in prices in times of recession. They have been an integral part of the business strategy of Trimo company and Trimo Group, for years22 and are our driving force for development and result in innovative solutions, approaches, and concepts; thus developing a culture of innovation. We are successfully developing and realising new products as well as personalized project development solutions for individual customers. Development projects in 2010 and 2011 In 2010, the structure of development projects included more than 50 percent of development assignments in new products and systems, in accordance with the long-term strategy. In the past year, we maintained a high share of product improvements with the purpose to find new market opportunities and quickly adapt to customer needs. The share of process improvements decreased, while the percentage share of basic surveys slightly increased. 21 More on sustainable development as a vital component of Trimo's development strategy in Trimo's Annual Report for 2008. 22 See previous Annual Reports 'development of new products and services', and 'development strategy (2001 – 2009)', sections. 14 Graph 2: Structure of development tasks in 2010 13 % 9% 52 % 26 % NEW PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS IiMPROVEMENTS OF EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS OF INTERNAL PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES BASIC RESEARCH Development of new products, technologies, and processes are managed according to the project approach.23 In 2010 16 larger development tasks, and several smaller development projects, and preliminary development tasks, were active. The success of a development task and consequently the development of new products, depends on shortening the process from the start of development to marketing new products. This has become especially important during economic crises. New approaches, new work methods, and focusing on key development tasks, has helped us shorten the average time needed for development tasks in 2010. Graph 3: Comparison of duration of development tasks in 2009 and 2010 in days24 350 295 300 270 250 240 220 200 150 100 50 0 Time to Market Time to Customer 2009 2010 In 2010, for four development projects and the study of early stage researchers we received funding of 1,064,449 €25 through various calls for applications. Qbiss One26 In 2010, the modular façade element Qbiss One was i supplemented by a new version, Qbiss One F27, which is a smooth façade with minimalist joints. This new element convinced architects at Foster+Partners, one of the most prominent architectural firms, to use the new Qbiss One element at the construction of the 23 For more see: Trimo Annual Report for 2008. 24 TTM: time-to-market, TTC: time-to-customer. 25 GRI: EC4 26 GRI: 2.2 27 More information at: http://www.qbiss.eu/data/dat/Qbiss_One_brochure_English.pdf 15 new manufacturing plant of the prestigious McLaren Company. This proved that Qbiss One F is a highly-aesthetic and multi-functional façade system, aimed at the most common reference buildings and most demanding customers. We finished several projects that will have an impact on their surroundings through its façade. E-construction site and e-technology used in assembly E-construction site and e-technology used in assembly are development projects which introduced elements of modern e-communication and information technology to the field of monitoring and managing the construction process and assembly. These projects helped us achieve control and information management throughout the process. They enable us to achieve our main goals, i.e. to speed up construction, and ensure a more efficient assembly. New hidden joint In early 2010, we completed the development of a new generation of invisible joints that have higher load-bearing capacity, optimized details, and improved aesthetics. Throughout the year, this was one of the best-selling Trimo products. Products from the Trimo EcoSolutions family28 Development of new products, solutions, and technology was also implemented in 2010 towards developing new solutions that can contribute to increasing the energy efficiency of modern buildings. This year we also continued with developing and marketing the Trimo EcoSolutions product family, which offers sustainable solutions for modern sustainable construction and architecture of buildings.29 The adoption of the new Slovenian Rule book on efficient energy use in buildings (PURES) and similar trends in Europe gives us even more possibilities to use alternative energy sources. In this year, we mainly expanded the range of solutions of integrated solar systems that uses both photovoltaic systems as well as solar energy collectors, and recuperator units. We developed a solution for off-grid installation of photovoltaic cells.Highly efficient, hybrid, solar system includes the development of a system enabling use of solar energy that satisfies even the most demanding customers with its versatility. In the development of highly insulated thin-layered panel, on the basis of insulation element developed by the CBS Inštitut, we developed a system solution which will be in 2011 presented as a highly efficient, and flexible façade system, with high thermal insulation. The CBS Institute is part of the Trimo Group For more than 5 years the CBS Institute has been a part of the Trimo development story for complete construction solutions.30 28 GRI: EN26 29 More on Trimo EcoSolutions product family: Trimo's Annual Report 2008. In January 2009 we introduced the new products of the Trimo EcoSolutions family at one of the largest international construction fairs Bau in München – the products Trimo EcoEnergy and Trimo EcoClean. 30 More information in: Important business events in subsidiaries in 2009 and Trimo's Annual Report 2008. 16 Plans for 2011 In 2011 we will continue with development projects for active building envelopes and sustainable development, including the use of alternative energy resources in building envelopes and environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, construction solutions; and new materials emphasising high insulation, sound and fireprotection, and expanding the range of solutions for the 'Qbiss' brand. We are developing products at a higher technological level In 2010 we continued to focus our knowledge into developing new (complex) products at a higher technological level. This includes solutions for new products of the Qbiss family. Tests required on the products’s health and safety effects are done during the product and technology development stage, in production and assembly, under conditions for corrosion, which are provided for the customer.31 In 2010, we met all legal requirements in this area.32 31 GRI: PR1 32 GRI: PR2 17 Important business events of subsidiaries in 2010 Trimo’s Key business events in 2010 subsidiaries Akripol, d.d.

Our operations are guided by long-term social responsibility towards people and the environment. Our operations are guided by our values41 based on high ethical standards, respecting human rights42 and each individual as a free-thinking person. In that way, every person can express their full potential in accordance with their capabilities and interests. Our growth in the development area is aimed at developing high-tech products and technologies. From a geographical perspective our operations are strong in Europe and the wider environment.43 This demands that we ensure the necessary competencies for our current and future company and Group development needs, in employee management. As we enter different cultural environments we are aware that we not only have to understand business opportunities, but primarily understand and respect the ground values of these different environments and adhere to the principles of human rights. 44 We respect human rights and the employment standards contained in the United Nation Global Compact45 and Global Reporting Initiative46 in our operations. We develop processes in employment management in accordance with the recommendations and best practices described in the EFQM47 model. In 2010, our generally established recognition as a good employer was increased since we were ranked among the seven best employers in the class of large companies at the Golden Thread project made by the Slovenian newspaper 'Dnevnik'.48 Employee distribution and categorisation The personnel structure for employees is adapted to the strategic needs of the company, and that is why we employ and develop colleagues in the department for development, management of engineering projects, and international sales. 40 GRI: 4.16 41 More information in the section: Introducing Trimo company and the Trimo Group; Vision, mission, values; and in the Annual Report for 2008. 42 We are members and co-founders of the Slovenian United National Global Compact (UNGC). 43 See Introduction of the Trimo Group. 44 More information: Assuming responsibility for sustainable future.

In the management structure the percentage of women is higher. In the Group the ratio of male to female is the same as in the parent company. Due to the type of our work, we employ mainly technical skills, primarily dominated in number, by men. The average age of Trimo employees is 40. In 2010 staff turnover in Trimo was 13.1 percent, in the Group it was 23 percent.50 Staff on fixed term contracts have the same rights as staff on permanent contracts51 in company Trimo. These rights are established in the working agreement, but do not include extra pension insurance for fixed term contract staff. Employees in the Group have the same rights as employees in the parent company, with regard to the local Employment Acts, which comply with non-discrimination principles,52 freedom of association, collective agreements,53 prohibition of child employment,54 and various forms of prohibition of forced or mandatory labour.55 In employing and managing people in other cultural environments we have to pay special attention to the human rights of indigenous populations and learn about their cultural customs and habits, to prevent a breach of their basic human rights56 from our lack of knowledge. 49 GRI: LA1 50 GRI: LA2 51 GRI: LA3 52 GRI: HR4 53 GRI: HR5 54 GRI: HR6 55 GRI: HR9 56 GRI: HR9 24 Qualification structure The qualification structure of employees in Trimo is gradually improving.

Attracting and selecting suitable employees Scholarships provide the personnel department a method for attracting necessary staff, especially from the technical sectors (civil engineering, construction, architecture, electro technology, information technology). Scholarships are awarded to students on under-graduate and Master’s courses, studying in Slovenia and abroad. In 2010, Trimo company supported a total of 32 students. Graph 7: Scholarships by area in percent 10% 34% 31% 22% 3% MECHANICAL ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING CIVIL ENGINEERING COMPUTER SCIENCES AND IT Scholarship holders are enabled to have summer and obligatory training; we also offer professional help by mentoring them in seminar papers, Diploma papers, and Master’s dissertations. Scholars also receive funding for language courses during their study period to enable faster inclusion into international processes within the Trimo Group after they complete their studies. 25 We establish contact with students through the Trimo international Research Awards competition.57 Development of employees’ competencies Employees’ competencies are systematically upgraded in accordance with the strategic directives of the Trimo Group and the established needs of employees for managing processes in the demanding global environment. The starting point for developing employee competencies is not only mastering expert knowledge in individual areas, but it also includes a developed competencies model58 and Trimo values.59 In 2010 Trimo performed 82 percent of Trimo dialogues.60 61 Trimo has included the whole team into the training process. In 2010 we spent an average of 23 hours on training.62Training Plans for employees were prepared using strategic points for competencies development, which was improved with proposals from Heads of departments and employees, as established at the Trimo 2-way meetings. An important area that we paid special attention to – due to more challenging market conditions – was raising employee competencies in sales. Besides trainings and workshops, this area will continue to develop especially in the direction of individual coaching workshops. Colleagues also trained in various specialised areas, management, computer courses, language courses, quality, health, and personal growth. Graph 8: Training in Trimo company by area in percent63 1% 2% 9% 20% 68% MANAGEMENT SKILLS TRAINING AND OTHER COMPUTER COURSES FOREIGN LANGUAGES OTHER (QUALITY, HEALTH, AND PERSONAL GROWTH, etc.) In Trimo company over 91 percent of training is organized internally, with internal or external trainers. Other training is external, organised in Slovenia or abroad. Employees participate in different trade-fairs, conferences, and symposiums, where they frequently give talks and presentations. 57 More information in the section: Nutruing creativity and innovation; Trimo Research Awards 58 More information in Trimo Annual Report for 2008. 59 More information: Vision, Mission, Values 60 More information in Trimo Annual Report for 2009. 61 GRI: LA12 62 GRI: LA10 63 GRI: HR3 26 Colleagues are increasingly encouraged to engage in e-learning.64 In 2010, we implemented trainings via WebEx for the first time and had 19 trainings for our colleagues in subsidiaries abroad. In 2010 we also did traditional training for all employees in which the General Manager and members of senior management present the Trimo Group’s strategic goals for different departments. The goal of the above-mentioned training is to introduce employees to global business conditions and changes that need to be made, in order to achieve Trimo’s strategic goals. Trimo employees are encouraged and financially supported to achieve higher education levels. In 2010, 21 employees were enrolled in study programs with Trimo’s support. Some staffing processes developed in the parent company are gradually transferred to companies within the Group. We are gradually introducing Trimo dialogue and work atmosphere assessment. We developed a one-week training program in Trimo company for training new employees on the market net. In 2010 we implemented 4 introductory training programs for new employees on the market net. We organised 5 large training events (Trimo Group Management Meeting, Market net meeting, Qbiss conference, Qbiss training, and 10 Trimo CRM trainings) for sales staff on the market net. We implemented an internal competition, Gazele, to encourage sales achievements; we gave an award to the best sales person, the fastest-growing market, and the best sales team. Trimo uses the Trimo competencies model in developing competencies.65 We discover employees’ potential through their achievements, expressed ambition, and invested energy for developing their career path in areas of interest to Trimo. We enable employees to take advantage of additional training, mentoring, coaching, and the increasingly demanding business opportunities, to gain the required experience for assuming work positions with more responsibilities. The basis for employee rewards and promotion is increased gross added-value per employee, and an individual’s contribution to achieving the targets. Men and women have the same options for promotion in all departments and work positions. The senior management structure of Trimo includes 45 percent women, and the board is chaired by a woman.66 Employee’s salaries and other benefits We have been keeping fair ratios of salaries and benefits for employees and specialist groups at different levels. The system monitors results achieved that is, 64 More information: Annual Report 2009 65 Competencies include knowledge, skills, and motives. Trimo's model of competencies presents skills. 66 GRI: LA13 27 the contribution of an employee to the added value and successful operation of the company. Tariff classes of the collective labour agreement are considered when assessing the ratios for starting salaries; basic salaries of employees are higher than starting salaries. There is no differentiation between men and women in salaries; they are set according to the same measures67. The starting salary for business executives depends on the average salary, according to the collective labour agreement, which ensures mutual dependence in raising or lowering salaries. The average gross salary in Trimo company in 2010, was 1,898 €; the Slovenian average was 1,491 €, the average in the sector was 1,287 €. We paid holiday allowance to our employees in accordance with the collective labour contract of operations, and a bonus of 100 € for those who did not take any sick leave in 2010. Care for health, safety and well-being of the employees The health of employees is an important area to which we pay much attention by implementing various activities for improving work conditions, organised sports, and social activities.68 In the Trimo Group we ensure a safe and regulated work and natural environment to stakeholders.69 Every company in the Group is committed to ensuring the necessary resources (personnel, finance, etc.) for a safe and healthy system of work operation, and to implement health and safety measures at work that prevent the risk of injuries and health problems. We ensure the necessary notification of employees; we introduce instructions, organise work as regulated, and ensure work conditions for a safe and healthy work-place. Sick leave In 2010, total sick leave was 4.51 percent, an increase of 1.13 percent points compared with last year. This is mainly due to sick leave during pregnancy (0.53 percent), and some long-term illnesses.70 67 GRI: LA14 68 In accordance with ISO 14001 the Board appointed an agent to manage environmental protection, safety at work, fire safety: Danijel Zupančič, MSc, who is otherwise the Deputy General Manager for the Technical Sector. An environmental safety team was also appointed for specialist and operative support. It is comprised of specialists from individual sectors (safety at work, dangerous substances, human resources, natural resources, energy, etc.). 69 These are employees, customers, suppliers, and visitors. 70 More information: Annual Report 2009. 28 Graph 9: Sick leave in Trimo company by year, and causes 5,00 4,50 0,25 4,00 4,00 3,50 3,50 3,50 3,50 3,50 0,08 0,17 3,00 0,24 0,24 Percent 2,50 4,05 2,00 3,19 3,20 2,70 1,50 3,07 1,00 0,50 0,20 0,36 0,31 0,21 0,00 0,07 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Care and escort, non-work related injury Illness Accident Plan Safety of the employees In the Trimo Group, we take care of the safety and health of our employees by reducing risks, improving working conditions, supervising the compliance with the rules of safety and health at work, and monitoring indicators and measures to reduce or prevent occupational injuries. Trimo’s71 environment and security policy recognises a clear commitment to a healthy and safe working environment which is also expressed in the declaration by the Management Board on Health and Safety at Work. Trimo also implements a health and safety at work program using a systematic and transparent method in accordance to the principles of the standard OHSAS 1800172. The work program for 2010 was dedicated to reducing risks from accidents at work, and a healthier way of life for employees. Smoking is not forbidden only in Trimo company, but also in some subsidiaries. This enables us to lessen the number of smokers and promote a more healty way of life. Important indicators, the severity of injuries and sick leave as a result of accidents at work, are achieved in accordance with our objectives. Important activities performed in 2010 include: • training of works council members, • revision of Regulations on allowances for special burdens at work, adverse effects of environmental and occupational risks, adverse environmental effects, and occupational risks in Trimo company (coordinated with the trade union and works council),73 • revision of shortened versions of safe work instructions, and some processes that are connected with ensuring safety at work, • revision of risk assessment with a statement on safety (coordinated with the trade union and works council)74 • employee access to the intranet portal ‘Safety and Environment’ • 974 hours of employee training on safety and the environment,75 71 Environmental and safety policy is available on the intranet under the section Sustainable development. 72 Trimo introduced it in 2003 and it is integrated into the system of the company’s Procedure Manual. 73 GRI: LA9 74 GRI: LA9 75 GRI: LA8 29 Safety indicators76 Table 1: Goals and achievements for 2010 using 3 safety indicators 2010 GOAL ACTUAL [injuries/million working injury frequency77 hours] < 14 18.04 seriousness of injury [lost days/injury] < 15 10.75 sick leave78 [lost hours/working hours] < 0.20% 0.1679 Comparing “the number of injuries at work / 1000 employees“ indicator in Trimo with steel production and construction sectors in Slovenia (for accidents at work, travelling to and from work, work-related travelling, and non-work related injuries) shows that Trimo's safety indicators out-perform those of the two sectors.

We will give priority to technical measures and the development of secure technologies over measures that require protective equipment and represent a barrier at work to employees. In all manufacturing companies and construction sites, we will increase employees’ attention to safe work and healthy working conditions by educating them and offering them a practical training. Concern for the health of employees is part of Trimo safety policy. Well-being of employees Satisfied employees are creative in the workplace and make a larger contribution to the company’s success. That is why we have a number of activities to ensure their well-being, an easier work organisation, and better work motivation. • In work areas – if the nature of the job allows it – we enable employees to work from home, and thereby organise their personal and professional obligations more easily. 76 GRI: LA7 77 Frequency of injuries was calculated on the basis of total hours. The company Trimo VSK had 0 accidents at work in 2010. 78 Sick leave is calculated on the basis of total hours. The company Trimo VSK had 0 percent sick leaves due to 0 accidents at work in 2010. 79 Only absence for accidents occurring in the work place is considered, not including accidents occurring on the way to/ from work or after working hours. 30 • Employees in production processes are provided with a weekly laundry for their work clothes. • Since 2004 Trimo pays 20 € every month per employee into a third pension fund (to which employees contribute a share). • We ensure good quality, hot meals for employees working at Trimo company, headquarters. • Employees can take vacations in Trimo’s holiday homes at the coast, or at thermal spas. • Trimo people and their family members participated at the nation-wide campaign ‘Let’s Clean Slovenia in a day’. • At the closing New Year’s ceremony we awarded the best colleagues for achievements in different areas, 3 best promoters of innovation, 2 groups that had the tidiest and most organised workplace, and awards for boldest ideas. • We held an award ceremony for employees who celebrated their 10th, 20th, and 30th work anniversaries. • In Trimo company Father Frost handed out gifts for employees’ children for New Year. • We organised a pre-New Year meeting for retired employees – former employees of Trimo company. Communications with employees In 2010 we strengthened the communication with employees at the Trimo Group80 level. During the economic and financial crisis we regularly inform staff of the circumstances and the situation of company Trimo and the Trimo Group. We focused almost 40 percent of our funds intended for public relations on internal communication in company Trimo. Relationship between staff and the Management Board81 Employees can state their opinions and points of view directly to the Management Board at regular meetings and annual dialogues. They meet with management at annual training sessions and other joint events. The General Manager talks to staff in person when extending their contract from a fixed period contract to a permanent contract. Managers also attend informal meetings with staff. The trade union, SKEI, operates in Trimo company, which includes 39 percent of all employees and an 11-member works council. Two staff representatives are also members of the Supervisory Board. Employees can communicate their opinions through them and give proposals regarding their position in Trimo company. Good dialogue has been established between the Management Board of Trimo company, the trade union, and the works council. At meetings, the Management Board informs employees about current events, important changes in operation, and measurements concerning employees. Representatives of both bodies inform the Management Board about their positions and proposals for improving work conditions and ensuring staff rights in accordance with the Labour Acts. 80 More information: Annual Report for 2008, page 89. 81 GRI: LA5 31 Organisational climate and employee satisfaction Results of the SiOK research In 2010 we measured the satisfaction of our employees and the organisational climate of Trimo for the 11th time within the scope of the SiOK.82 The survey shows that employees mark the organisational climate in Trimo, and their own satisfaction, much higher than the Slovenian average. The organisational climate measurement in 2010 showed that it was lower by 0.03 percentage points compared to last year, which is encouraging considering the stricter operating conditions. Climate results are monitored in all organisational units, and we inform employees of the results via internal media. The Heads of individual departments present the results for their departments to colleagues, and they prepare an action plan for improvements together.

The results of the research, which is also called ‘The employer of the year’, show above-average results in terms of large companies that are involved in the measurement of the following groups of questions: Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Personal Growth and Development. This is certainly due to various approaches and strategies of the company to develop innovative business system. Personal growth and development results show that Trimo invests a lot in the growth and development of employees, which is in accordance to the social responsibility and sustainable development strategies.

It is challenging to recognise and effectively manage risks and accept risk in business decisions. Hereby, we consider both external factors (the situation of the macro economy, economic environment in international markets) and internal risk factors (business processes). The risk management process has five steps (assessment, evaluation, management, monitoring the risk, future risks). Assessment – risk identification and management84 The Trimo Group manages 45 different risks divided into three main groups: business risks, financial risks, and risks in operation. All risks are listed below according to groups and measures for managing individual risks.85 Business risks Measures for risk management in 2010 are presented within the six identified risk groups. Sales-development risks 1. Risk of increasing competition appearing in various markets, customer variety, spreading the marketing network, adequate cooperation with suppliers 2. Risk of obsolete products development and positioning of new products; ensuring increased sales share in markets, managing the product portfolio 3.

Due to an unbalanced currency position Trimo is exposed to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. Key foreign currency pairs in 2010 were the EUR and CHF. • Interest rate risk is defined as uncertainty associated with future values of interest rates which directly define the amount of obligations arising from long-term debt. In 2010 Trimo possessed twelve long-term and six short-term loans in its portfolio. They were bounnd to the value of reference (variable) interest rates. In 2010 the rate of low reference interest rates continued. Due to the extended financial crisis there has been no danger of major increase of the variable interest rate that is why the risk of a change in the interest rate was not insured in 2010. • Credit risk represents the risk that a customer involved in a financial instrument contract will not fulfil its obligations which will result in a financial loss for the company. The insurance instruments used by Trimo for insuring against credit risk comprise guaranteed advances for larger transactions, the insurance of foreign receivables with the SEC, concurrent collection of receivables, and the use of bank guarantees and documentary letters of credit. In 2010 we achieved 71 percent of total sales in the foreign markets. Open foreign receivables on 31 December 2010 were insured via the Slovene Export Corporation of 57.4 percent. • Insolvency risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulties in collecting financial assets required for the fulfilment of financial obligations. Insolvency risk is actively managed by the Company using basic tools for balancing insolvency risks: cash flow planning, solvency reserves, regulation of asset and liability maturities, dispersal of sources of finance, regular payment of receivables, estimated loans with banks enabling a dispersal of funds in accordance with needs. Trimo estimates that its assets and liabilities are not exposed to the aforementioned risks. In 2010 the payment deadline for our customers was, compared to 2009, extended on average by seven days with payment deadlines increased by thirteen days for domestic customers and the same deadline for foreign customers. On average our suppliers received payment four days earlier than the company did from its customers in 2010. • Risk of financing structure is the risk of (non-) balanced or (non-) optimal financing funds, according to their duration (long-term / short-term funds) and financing origin (equity / debt). 86 More information in the section: Other disclosures – Financial instruments in the Financial Statement of the parent company 40 Trimo manages this risk by ensuring compatibility between the duration of financing funds, control over the extent and cost of borrowing (through analysing debt ratios and credit portfolio management), and the corresponding dividend policy and ownership structure management. The exposure to this risk is assessed as moderate. • Risk of property damage is the risk of sustaining damage to property due to the destructive effects of natural forces, or other incidents. Trimo manages this risk by assessing facility exposure to such risks, establishing corresponding preventive measures, performing emergency drills, and concluding relevant insurance contracts. The exposure to this risk is assessed as moderate. • Risk of financial loss due to operating downtown is the risk of interrupting the manufacturing process or operations due to property damage. Trimo manages this risk by insuring economic damage resulting from interrupted operations, and taking organisational and technical (preventive) measures to alleviate the consequences of operating downtime. The exposure to this risk is assessed as low. Risk monitoring In the Trimo Group risk is constantly monitored and controlled via operators of individual risks within various organisational units in the Trimo company and its subsidiaries that are in charge of this management. Monitoring of business and operational risks is divided between organisational units, that is, within the responsibilities and authorisation of companies within the Trimo Group. The parent company’s Department of Economics and Finance monitors financial risks. These risks are centrally monitored by the parent company at group level. Even the commercial insurance in larger amounts is centrally coordinated at group level. Risk assessment Risk assessment is a mechanism which helps evaluate the probability of risk and the consequences if that risk actually does emerge. Risk assessment is used as part of risk predictions and is part of the preparation for risk management. We use different methodologies to assess risks according to their type. We use the AUVA87 methodology for the assessment of risk in health and safety at work. The methodology, which is in compliance with EFQM business practices, is used to assess project risks. In 2010 we paid more attention to assessing project risks on the operational level in the Trimo company. There have been no risks and financial consequences due to climate changes in 2010.88 87 Arbeitsplatzevaluierunggefahrenermittel&beseitigen 88 GRI: EC2 41 Scheme 1: Matrix for operative assessment of project risks High 5 Mediocre High High High High Very high 4 Mediocre Mediocre High High High Mediocre 3 Low Mediocre Mediocre High High Verjetnost Low 2 Low Low Mediocre Mediocre High Very low 1 Low Low Low Mediocre Mediocre A B C D E Very Large, Very Small, medium, large, very small moderate manageable critical, influential dangerous Consequence Risk priorities in 2010 The priority in 2010 for the Trimo company was project risk for commercial projects. We dealt with project risks especially in the operative level and increased the monitoring of factors for project risks and the effect of different processes on the course of a project. We added project risks to the company level (risk of lack of competencies of the members of the project team) and set the operator responsible for management of a recognised risk. Future risks In 2010 we re-identified expected key risks for the period from 2011 to 2013. We identified 24 key risks from a total of 45 risks. Risks, which we will focus more activities on, by 2013, are: Business risks 1. Sales-development risks: risks of obsolete products, price risks 2. External risks: risk of changes in the macro-economic operating conditions in individual markets 3. Procurement risks: risk of unexpected price changes, risk of new materials 4. Investment-technology risks: risk of effective and timely introduction of new technologies, risk of (non-) protection of manufacturing technologies, 42 patents, and know-how, risk of realising investments within the planned value, quality, and deadline 5. Personnel risks: risk of poor qualifications of personnel, risk of lack of competent personnel, risk of key personnel loss Operating risks 1. Production risks: risk of poor product quality and protection (certificates) management, environmental risks (explosion, fire, emissions, spills), and risk of work conditions, safety and health at work 2. Project risks: risk of delay of individual project stage, and delayed project completion, risk of (lack of) quality project implementation, risk of nonpayment 3. Risks arising from IT operations: risk of (un)reliable hardware equipment, risk of confidential information leak and trade secret disclosure, natural disaster Financial risks Financial risks include currency, credit, financial solvency, and interest-rate risk. 43 Buildin ng partnerrships89 Trimo develops partnerships with aall stakeho olders.

These included 21 universities, 17 institutes, 58 departments for development from other companies, 23 suppliers, and a large number of independent researchers and designers. We cooperated with external partners in 85 percent of all development projects, almost 58 percent were partners from other countries, which means 8 percentage points more than in 2009. We develop cooperation with knowledge centres through other forms of cooperation such as Trimo Research Awards,91 cooperation in joint tenders for applications in development ( for example: ARRS, Eureka, Competence Centres, Economic Centres), sponsoring students in their activities, enabling visits and tours of production facilities, our specialists functioning as guest speakers at universities or members of specialised associations.

Trimo is a member of EFQM, 2 colleagues are evaluators of business excellence for the European Award, and one colleague is an EFQM Valued Assessor. Trimo is a member of the EFQM Pact that has the mission to develop good practices in various processes. Other members of the EFQM Pact include BMW, Philips, Bosch, Unilever, Solvay, EDV, Grundfoss, and TNT. Suppliers In 2010, our basic purchasing activities were focused on implementation level, accelerated negotiations, provision of credit limits, and fast stock turnover. Besides the parent company, the central purchasing control includes also other manufacturing companies of the Trimo Group. The prices of key materials, such as sheet metal, black metallurgy, and chemistry, increased in 2010, while insulating materials remained at the same level as the year before. In the entire chain, we were very well inter-connected which can be seen in the reduction of raw material stock levels and days of money deposits. With our strategic suppliers, we improved the functional and aesthetic qualities of the existing products, and carried out an extensive research and selection of material suppliers for the new facade system. We implemented 30 development / educational round-table discussions with the existing suppliers, and 45 presentations of new materials and systems. We continued to upgrade online operations with suppliers and internal stakeholders and ensure maximum efficiency of human resources. Local participation of suppliers represents a 51.17 percent share, especially of local container production, service activities (assembly), and partly due to iron industry purchases by designated Slovenian salespeople. 93 More information: www.ninesigma.com. 46 Graph 17: Purchase movement of Trimo according to the geographical structure94 11% 51% 38% SLOVENIA REST OF THE EU OUTSIDE THE EU Shareholders We published the Trimo company and Trimo Group’s Annual Report for 2010 for our shareholders.

As a socially responsible company Trimo opts for environment and people-friendly products, production programs, and technology processes. The examples of our commitment are: the participation in the initiative ‘Cradle to cradle’ (C2C), the production of life cycle analysis (LCA) for key products of Trimoterm and Qbiss families, and Trimo’s solar power plant on the roof of our company. We define sustainable development as achieving commercial, social, and ecological sustainability, and develop it in accordance with our values and with the help of Trimo’s key competencies and a clear vision. The results of social and ecological sustainability are shown in the previous sections of this Annual Report. As members of the UNGC we respect their 10 principles (on human rights, labour standards, environment, transparency, and anti-corruption).99 Environmental protection in Trimo company and the Trimo Group In the Trimo Group we opt for environmentally and people-friendly products, production programs, and technological processes, and act according to the aim of complete solutions, with consideration of a high level of safety and risk reduction for customers and shareholders. We spread this responsibility into subsidiaries; especially in the production companies.100 In development we consider the complete life cycle of a product, including its wear and tear. Technology transfer and construction of new manufacturing companies are based on the criteria of European legislation, to minimise effects on the environment. They do not present a high risk for shareholders regarding environmental demands. We implement emission monitoring and separate waste collection in all production companies. The Trimo Group spreads the culture of constant improvement and raises the awareness of the importance of responsible environmental operations in local and global sense. Trimo companies and Akripol have an integrated operating system according to ISO 14001 standard. This operating system will be gradually transferred to other subsidiaries. Our actions prove that we follow UNGC101 principles. In accordance with Trimo’s policy and strategy we are committed to achieving high goals regarding environmental protection and sustainable development. Our product portfolio includes products which are at least 99 percent re-cyclable.102 Trimo’s offer of complete solutions also includes the option and implementation of 99 More information: Annual Report for 2009. 100 Trimo VSK, Trimo Inženiring and Trimo FZE. 101 th This part focuses on “environment‐related” UNGC principles; 7 principle: Business should support the preventive approach to th th environmental challenges; 8 principle: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; 9 principle: encourage development and diffusion of environmentally-friendly technologies. 102 GRI: EN2 51 environmental-friendly solutions that contribute to added value for the customer and to sustainable development of the planet. These products are called EcoSolar103 panels with built-in PV modules for generating electrical energy from the sun, PV control panel integrated into Trimo roofs, panels for heating sanitary water with solar energy, noise-reducing panels, self-cleansing panels Trimo EcoClean, Trimo EcoEnergy that reduces building overheating in the summer with its reflectivity, and thereby reduces the level of energy needed for cooling.104 The scope of the environmental management system in Trimo is conducted by the Deputy General Manager for the Technical Department, Danijel Zupančič, MSc, who is also the representative for Environmental Management. He is in charge of the environmental and safety team, which is an advisory body that ensures the development of the whole department, and implementation of the strategy on sustainable development.105 The most important elements of this strategy are waste reduction, the introduction of full recycling approaches or an approach that leads to ‘cradle to cradle’ concept106, the rational use of natural resources, the use of renewable energy, and the development of such products and technologies that are in balance with natural processes and do not cause lasting consequences for the planet. In 2010 governance over the environmental management system was successful in all key areas. Important operations and achievements in 2010 include:107 • 26 percent reduction of municipal waste compared with 2009. • Increased share of recyclable waste, and transfer in the form of secondary or primary raw materials (94.4 percent of all waste). • Use of packaging material per product unit is reduced. • Electricity used per one unit of Qbiss One line product is reduced108 • The CO2e footprint for Qbiss One and Trimoterm – LCA modular elements is reduced. • We organised the 11th traditional Trimo Environment Day as we joined the nation-wide campaign ‘Let’s Clean Slovenia in a day’ • We purchased approximately 55,000 tons of materials needed for production.109 In 2010 we spent 18,320 € on the costs of investing in environmental management system, and thereby exceeded legal obligations in individual areas.110 The effects of the implemented environmental protection program and sustainable development were higher than the funds invested. 103 GRI: EN26 104 GRI: EN6 105 The environmental and safety team is comprised of specialists from individual departments (health and safety at work, dangerous substances, personnel, natural resources, energy, etc.) GRI: LA6 106 »Cradle to cradle« means the production of a new product form a discarded product. 107 GRI: EN27 108 GRI: EN5 109 GRI: EN1 110 GRI: EN30 52 We join ned the na ation-wide e campaign n ‘Let’s Cllean Slovenia in a daay'.

The amounts of dangerous waste116 are relatively low in Trimo and it represents 0.23 percent of all waste. Water use117 Trimo’s environmental protection program includes caring about rational use of natural resources tap water being the most important. Water used in 2010 was slightly less than in 2009. Water-use per employee in 2010 was 0.90 m3 / month118. Water is used only for sanitary needs and in the kitchen. It is not used in technological processes and that is why there is no waste water from technological processes.119 All waste water is conducted to the public central waste water plant, Trebnje.120 The environmental protection program includes control over the internal sewage system where special attention is paid to the separation of light oils. Use of heating gas-oil (HGO)121 Trimo’s use of natural resources includes HGO. The majority of its use is related to the heating system during winter. We monitor the absolute consumption, and the usage per unit of heating volume. The goal of the annual HGO consumption is set according to the average winter temperature and the roof and façade production plan.

It includes the electricity consumption for production processes, ventilation, airconditioning, and heating and lighting. In 2010 the electricity used was below the goal123. Trimo’s solar power plant operated the whole year and generated over 31,000 kWh of green electrical energy.124 Emissions of harmful substances into the natural environment In accordance with regulations Trimo implements regular measurements on emissions of harmful substances into the natural environment (monitoring), that is for emissions of particles, fumes, and noise emissions into the natural environment. In 2010 we performed regular emission measurements of harmful substances on the existing technological equipment. All results are below legally permitted limits. We regularly perform monitoring of emissions in all combustion plants. These plants are in accordance with legally permitted limits.125 We control the emissions level of vaporous organic substances (VOC) from the polishing appliance – which is operated by our contractual partners to make sure that they do not exceed permitted values.

Trimo’s responsibility is also displayed in the implementation of a CO2e footprint for the main Trimoterm and Qbiss related 123 For electricity use according to years see Annual Report for the environmental management system and safety and health at work system 2010 at: http://www.trimo.eu/company/sustainable-development/for-sustainable-operation/. 124 For the production of green electrical energy according to years see Annual Report for the environmental management system and safety and health at work system 2010 at: http://www.trimo.eu/company/sustainable-development/for-sustainable-operation/. 125 GRI: EN20 126 GRI: EN16, EN17, EN18, EN 29 The CO2e data includes emissions for all 6 green house gases in accordance with the Kyoto protocol. 55 products in the complete supply chain (LCA). In 2010, with the help of measures to reduce emissions of a CO2e footprint we achieved a CO2e footprint reduction of approximately 3 percent. We also monitor CO2 emissions occurring from the activities in the production factory on the basis of energy product use, emissions, and calculations. In 2010, absolute emission increased due to large production volume.127 Emissions by employees (arrival at work, work-related travelling, etc.) are not included in these calculations.

A great majority of employees participated in the nation-wide clean-up action ‘Let’s clean Slovenia in a day’. We collected 28 m3 of waste in the surrounding of Trimo and forests. We estimate that 55 percent of waste will be further processed. 127 See graph: Absolute CO2 emission (kg) – company’s operation. 128 For more information see: http://www.trimo.si/mediji/sporocila-za-javnost-66/?y=2009&m=05. 56 Plans for 2011 PLAN TRIMO COMPANY TRIMO GROUP BUSINESS INDICATORS FOR 2011 TOTAL REVENUES in million € 105.0 174.6 Index 2011/2010 111 104 ADDED VALUE PER EMPLOYEE in € 50,000 34,000 Index 2010/2009 117 112 TOTAL CAPITAL in million € 48.8 47.8 Index 2010/2009 104 107 AVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES 464 1,050 Index 2011/2010 97 93 In Trimo company and the Trimo Group we are determined to achieve the set goals by positive energy and responsible work and thus, in accordance with our motto “Energy + Responsibility = Richness”, create richness for all Trimo’s stakeholders in all areas. 57 GRI ASSESSMENT129 GRI Indicator INCLUSION PAGE Strategy and Analysis Statement from the most senior decisionmaker of the organization about the relevance of sustainability to the 1.1 partly 16 organization and its strategy. 1.2 Description of key impacts, risks, and opportunities. partly 69 Organizational Profile 2.1 Name of the organization. full 5 Primary brands, products, and/or services. 2.2 partly 46,51 Operational structure of the organization, including main 2.3 full 6,12 divisions, operating companies, subsidiaries, and joint ventures. 2.4 Location of organization’s headquarters. full 5 Number of countries where the organization operates, and names of countries with either major operations or that are 2.5 full 45 specifically relevant to the sustainability issues covered in the eport. 2.6 Nature of ownership and legal form. full 8 Markets served (including geographic breakdown, 2.7 full 38,47 sectors served, and types of customers/beneficiaries).
