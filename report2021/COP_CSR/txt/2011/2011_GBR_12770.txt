The Notable C OP Programme was introduced in 2004 to highlight and recognise outstanding C ommunications on Progress (C OP). C OPs featured in the Notable C OP programme are selected because of their adherence to the C OP policy and because they represent illustrative and inspirational examples of communicating progress.
