In accordance with IAS19, the rates were determined by monetary zone by referring to the return on premium private bonds with a maturity equal to the term of the plans, or the return on government bonds when the private market has insufficient liquidity. The return on plan assets is determined based on the allocation of the assets and the discount rates used. The principal rates used by the Group are as follows: 2010 2009 United United United % Euro Zone United States Kingdom Euro Zone States Kingdom Discount rate 4.5 5.0 6 5 5.5 5.75 Expected rate of return of investments 4.5 to 4.90 7.5 7 4.5 to 5.85 7.5 7.25 Weighted average rate of return on plan assets 4.86 4.61 Weighted average rate of salary increases 2.57 2.8 The discount rate used for length-of-service awards in France was 4.5% in 2010 (5% in 2009). Additionally, had the discount rate been by 25 basis points lower than the rate actually applied, the total obligation of the Group as of December 31, 2010 would have been by €8 million higher. The recognized actuarial gains or losses correspond to experience adjustments (differences between assumptions used and actual data) and changes in assumptions. In 2010, the actuarial gains or losses resulting from experience adjustments were 3.3% of the projected benefit obligation (2009: 1.25%).

Around 15 applications were shortlisted – up to three in each of the five categories, these being the economic, human (social and societal), environmental and biodiversity contributions to sustainable development. The Essilor Vision Foundation stepped up its action in 2010 by broadening the reach of its Adopt-aSchool and Kids Vision for Life programs. For the Adopt-a-School program, several dozen new teams were created across the United States comprising more and more volunteers, among them Essilor of America employees and customers plus other company stakeholders. The Kids Vision for Life program, already firmly established in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, benefited in 2010 from the participation of Alcon and additional team members, turning this huge metropolitan area into a sort of “Vision capital.” The program continued its expansion throughout the state of Texas by launching initiatives in two other large metropolitan areas – Austin, the state capital, and Houston, the fourth largest metropolitan region in the United States by number of inhabitants. 3.

It recycles all input materials that can be realistically recycled, sometimes in very significant proportions (e.g. 95% for elastomeres used for the production of gaskets). For reasons of quality, recycled organic raw materials cannot be used in the manufacture of ophthalmic lenses, but can be used for other types of products.

In 2010, the calculations for the two first categories have been performed and their translations in terms of CO2 equivalent show in indicator EN17. The indicator EN17 also shows the measurement of emissions linked to occupational transportation recorded for a population of about 1,500, around 700 of whom are considered “frequent travelers”. Differences in infrastructures and geography between countries and continents do not allow any reliable extrapolation to a larger scope at this point. This type of measurement will therefore be extended. The use of corrective lenses does not require any energy source. Their end of life impact is negligible.
