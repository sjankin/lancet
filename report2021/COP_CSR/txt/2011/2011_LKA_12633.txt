In a developing country like Sri Lanka, ICT plays a major role. Our contribution to the nation had always been significant since we managed to set high benchmarks in the field.

We are experts in customizing the global technologies to suit the local scenarios. E‐WIS signed the Global Compact in July, 2003 as the first ICT Company in Sri Lanka to recognize the importance of ethical business practices and to adhere to a standardized approach to set and achieve goals. This in return benefits the organization, stake holders and the country as a whole. Apart from commercial purposes, we always contribute to the well‐being of the society as a socially responsible corporate citizen. All our CSR initiatives are geared towards linking the gap between the rural and the urban with a digital bridge aiming at prevention of brain drain from rural to urban. We “go green” with our environmentally friendly carbon credit programs and recycle programs and we manage our resources to get the maximum utilization. We believe that our commitment towards Global Compact is a responsibility that we must undertake to drive our company and its stake holders to success while serving the country.
