Reaching one billion new consumers through the universalisation of beauty is the group’s strategic objective for years to come. This great project of ours is accompanied by our commitments to show exemplary corporate conduct, meet demanding targets to lighten our environmental footprint, find new ways to consume more sustainably, and contribute to the wellbeing of communities. In other words, our corporate citizenship is inseparable from who we are and what we do, and our core purpose goes to the heart of what it means to be a human being. The use of cosmetics creates a sense of wellbeing, and enables individuals to express their personality and build self-esteem. When individuals share this sense of self and wellbeing with others, the social bonds that are essential to quality of life are strengthened and reinforced. This is L’Oréal’s true purpose, and the focus of our activity. A vision of universal beauty L’Oréal’s vision depends first and foremost on meeting ambitious economic goals, which provide the basis for achieving sustainable growth and delivering the group’s financial results. The ambition to win over a billion new consumers is a significant increase in our scale of operations, effectively doubling our existing consumer base. L’Oréal’s adventure is beginning a new chapter, to universalise beauty and this mission offers our group tremendous, long-term prospects for growth. Attracting a billion new consumers means reaching out to extremely diverse groups and populations by offering products tailored to specific needs and contexts but which also reflect a universal vision. Universalisation certainly does not mean uniformity. On the contrary – for L’Oréal, beauty for everyone means beauty for each person. Our research teams, present in every continent, are radically transforming in order to create products for a diverse world, using their expert knowledge of local needs and customs to offer beauty that is perfectly suited to many different consumer aspirations across the world. A human adventure At the heart of our ambition is a human adventure, which is based on our belief in individual talent and the recognition that our company is built from the talent and enterprise of many individual men and women. Equally important, our group is founded on strong values of social responsibility, respect, a pioneering spirit, boldness, integrity and excellence. These attributes are valued by potential young recruits to our company, reflecting L’Oréal’s recent ranking as 11th among all global companies that they aspire to join. L’Oréal’s human resources strategy has been recognised in several countries, particularly in France, where the group was awarded the 2010 Human Capital Trophy for the quality of its initiatives. It is this human adventure that lends strength, coherence, originality and above all, great vitality to our corporate ambition to serve two billion consumers in the coming years. Inseparable from this is our dedication to becoming a model of responsible, shared and sustainable development. Our efforts to date have placed L’Oréal among the 100 most sustainable companies in the world for the fourth year running. To become the model corporate citizen of our ambition, we have identified four key priorities. Behave ethically and responsibly in every daily activity We know that the sustainability of our company depends greatly on maintaining relationships of trust with all our internal and external stakeholders, including shareholders, private and public partners, and consumers. Each expects exemplary conduct from L’Oréal. This is why we are constantly striving to add to employee and stakeholder awareness and knowledge of ethics and corporate responsibility. At our last Ethics Day event, which we organise every year, more than 16,000 employees took part in our online seminar during which they communicated directly with myself and other senior management, asking more than 800 questions. We are convinced that tomorrow’s leaders will be companies that have integrated ethical considerations into corporate strategy as well as daily business activities. Promote the diversity of human capital We fimly believe that diversity, which forms part of our business culture, creates value because it brings greater creativity, greater performance and a better understanding of our consumers. Our first Diversity Overview Report for France, published in 2010, shows the wide scope of our engagement. Our goal is to extend this internationally and to establish across the entire group initiatives to promote, measure and recognise efforts in diversity management. Invent new approaches to environmental sustainability The world leader in beauty has an absolute duty to help to preserve the beauty of the planet and environmental sustainability is a key commitment for L’Oréal. Even though the cosmetics industry has a limited environmental footprint, for many years L’Oréal has been proactive in driving forward major programmes in resource efficiency, biodiversity and protection of the biosphere. As a result, we are well on the way to achieving extremely stretching targets to reduce our CO2 emissions, water consumption and waste production – by 50% in each case, from 2005 to 2015. Already, at the halfway stage, we have reduced water consumption by 19%, CO2 emissions by 27% and waste volumes by 23%. We are equally convinced that sustainable innovation is the pathway towards better, responsible consumption. Our laboratories have for many years embraced this strategy, which encompasses all the lifecycle stages of our products. We continue to invest in eco-design, the eco-evaluation of our ingredients and green chemistry. We are incorporating more and more renewable raw materials with a low environmental impact and today 40% of our raw materials are of plant origin. Share the benefits of sustainable growth For 12 years, our corporate citizenship has developed and grown. Led by the L'Oréal Foundation (the second largest Foundation in France in terms of funds), our programmes have had a real impact in three key areas: science, education and solidarity. Many of the programmes focus on occupational integration, rehabilitation and restoring self-esteem and dignity to individuals. This, for us, is the true meaning of beauty for everyone. Our sustainability strategy is built on five key principles: Integrating sustainable development within the group’s global strategy. Our corporate governance is fully aligned with this ambition, and in 2010 the Strategy and Implementation Committee of the Board of Directors became the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee. The change reflects the Board’s commitment to ensuring that all necessary means and resources are directed towards the broad range of challenges associated with sustainable development A long-term vision. This is demonstrated in the actions and commitments of our teams : 20 years’ effort in environmental protection; 30 years’ research effort into alternative methods to avoid animal testing; more than 12 years’ partnership with UNESCO to promote the role of women in science and create a better world. These programmes and investments are sustained and long-term in order to maximise their positive impacts Engagement by our employees on a daily basis, at every level and in every area, complemented by a network of employees specifically focused on sustainable development Achieving continuous progress through concrete goals, efficient initiatives and measurable, sustainable change Systematic evaluation of global performance across a broad range of economic, human, environmental and societal indicators. At the heart of all the group’s activities, there is a profound desire to engage everyone in a sense of mission to achieve our goals: to offer men and women everywhere the best cosmetics in terms of quality, efficacy and safety, and meet their needs and aspirations for beauty in all its diversity. L’Oréal’s engagement draws on a vision of corporate responsibility in which economic success, human progress and social development go hand in hand. Providing access to products that add to quality of life, while safeguarding the planet’s natural capital and contributing to society, are the key ways in which L’Oréal can create value to benefit everyone. Contributing to a more beautiful life and a better world is L’Oréal’s constant ambition.

UNGC COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS ETHICS PROGRAMME It means growing responsibly As we progress in our ambition to win the trust and confidence of a billion new consumers in the next 10 years, a responsible approach becomes even more essential. In emerging markets we see an increasing aspiration for a western lifestyle, and the economic and societal benefits associated with it. This trend worries some stakeholders To respond to this key challenge, L’Oréal is embedding sustainable consumption at each stage of the life cycle of its products: Through sustainable innovation that integrates ethical policies and advanced research in the selection of new ingredients and the development of eco-design and the use of green chemistry Responsibly managing our production, packaging and supply chain to significantly reduce our environmental and societal impact wherever we operate. Our 2015 targets are ambitious: 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emission, waste and water consumption per finished product. Our fair trade policy and commitment to local communities are fully integrated into our business decision making process.

Our 2015 targets are ambitious: 50% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, waste and water consumption per finished product. Our fair trade policy and commitment to local communities are fully integrated into our business decision making process. The other question some stakeholders ask is: “Are you destroying local cultures in emerging nations by transferring / imposing our Western model?” L’Oréal strongly believes that innovation must be conceived close to where consumers are living, and must be responsive to their perceived needs and aspirations. The best way to achieve sustainable consumption is to: Deliver on performance and quality, based on the best global practices Take into account local cultural habits; for example, in India, the kajal, used in traditional make-up, is a great source of inspiration for us in developing new products. We are particularly vigilant to take care of the local natural and societal environment that drives the way consumers choose and use cosmetics. Corporate Consumer Responsibility Policy At L’Oréal, we apply our 'Corporate Consumer Responsibility' Policy in every activity – from research and innovation to sourcing and production, and from marketing to consumer relations. From a global perspective, it is essential to understand that companies cannot meet the challenge of sustainable consumption alone. Consumers have a major role to play, along with the rest of society, to ensure that what is consumed today does not exceed what the world can provide tomorrow.

ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT Rewarding the loyalty of L’Oréal shareholders Since the Annual General Meeting of 27th April 2010, L’Oréal is one of the few CAC 40 companies to offer a loyalty bonus. A preferential dividend of +10% is thus offered to all holders of registered shares whether directly or managed for at least two years*, to reward those who support the company over the long term. Shares held in registered form enable L’Oréal to get to know its shareholders better, and to offer them more advantages. The number of shareholders signing up for registered shares has increased very sharply over the last two years. * The preferential dividend is subject to a limit of 0.5% of the share capital per shareholder. The first preferential dividend will be paid in 2012 on the dividend for 2011, for shareholders who have continuously held registered shares – whether directly or managed – from 31st December, 2009 until the payment date of the dividend after the Annual General Meeting of 2012.

FOLLOW UP OF ETHICAL CONCERNS L’Oréal’s Code of Business Ethics The Code of Business Ethics, available in 43 languages, is the reference document for ethics within AT L’ORÉAL.COM... L'Oréal. OUR CODE OF BUSINESS It applies to all employees, officers and directors of the group and subsidiaries worldwide. All ETHICS employees receive their own personal copy. EXTERNAL LINKS... The Code of Business Ethics was first issued in 2000. In 2007, the Code was updated with the help of employees from 22 countries via international working groups in Asia, Europe, North America and UN GLOBAL COMPACT Latin America. The Code was then validated by each Country Manager, Human Resources Manager and local counsel to make sure it was applicable locally. To underline the importance of this document, L’Oréal’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer both signed the foreword, and the introduction is signed by the entire Management Committee. The Code of Business Ethics is regularly reviewed in order to improve it, if necessary. Employees are encouraged to give their feedback on the Code. Country Managers are responsible for ensuring that the Code of Business Ethics is respected at local level. The Group Director of Ethics The Group Director of Ethics reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Further information: interview with Emmanuel Lulin, Group Director of Ethics. The role of the Group Director of Ethics includes promoting and integrating ethical best practices across the group, providing help in ethical decision-making, training employees and addressing any possible complaints. The Group Director of Ethics regularly measures and assesses results and provides periodic reports to the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee. The Group Director of Ethics has access to all the information and documentation relating to L’Oréal’s activities and can call upon all the company’s resources to carry out his mission. The Office of the Group Director of Ethics is ISO 9001 certified. Ethics Correspondents Ethics Correspondents support Country Managers in deploying L’Oréal's Ethics Programme and serve as a local ethics resource for staff. With 17 additional appointments in 2010, the worldwide network of Ethics Correspondents means that 93% of employees have a local correspondent. Open Talk Employees are encouraged to raise any concerns with their management. Additional resources are available in certain countries such as Human Resources, Ethics Correspondents, staff representatives, grievance procedures or helplines. Employees may also contact the Group Director of Ethics via a dedicated and secure website. A strict non-retaliation policy applies for all concerns raised in good faith. Ethics and performance management L’Oréal employees are appraised not only on their results but also on the way in which such results are obtained. Two ethical competencies are now part of L’Oréal’s appraisal system worldwide – ‘Act/Lead with human sensitivity’ and ‘Obtain results with integrity’. Ethics and restructuring L’Oréal’s sustainable growth is the best guarantee for its employees. In order to achieve this objective, L’Oréal must continually adapt to its environment. This can give rise to restructuring, particularly given the current difficult economic climate. Any decision likely to affect the job and working life of employees is taken only after careful consideration. Our values of respect and integrity guide us in such situations. We communicate clearly and regularly to make sure that our employees are fully informed, and ensure an on-going dialogue with our employees and staff representatives. When redundancies prove unavoidable, we aim to maintain employment by supporting employees in their professional reorientation, in particular through internal redeployment or solutions adapted to each individual situation. Ethics training The Ethics Training Programme is part of the induction of new joiners, and there are also seven other specific modules, including for country managers, procurement teams and recruitment. External initiatives L’Oréal has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since June 2003 and is a member of the French network of the Global Compact (Forum des Amis du Pacte Mondial).

RATINGS AND AWARDS Open Talk The Ethics Open Talk website, which is provided for employees to share any ethical concerns, is now available in 5 new languages: Indonesian, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew and Hindi (16 languages in total). “L’Oréal for Ethics” Excellence Bursary This bursary is for students who are studying ethics in their vocational training. The winners are selected on academic excellence and the quality of an essay submission. In 2010, the theme was “The importance of ethics for business leaders of tomorrow.” Romanian student Alexandru Szel was one of two students who won the 2010 L'Oréal for Ethics Excellence Bursary awarded this year by the group. Alexandru is entering his third year as a student at Babes Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca and he was strongly recommended by his teacher, Mr Imre Ungvari Zrinyi, following his genuine interest in the “Ethics in Economy” course. Interview with Alexandru: When did your interest in ethics start? As a student, my first contact with ethics in the economy was in the second semester of my first year, as we had an optional subject called Ethics in Economy, which I had decided to follow. It was really interesting as we had to watch a TV show called Business Responsibility on the financial TV channel 'Money Channel', and write our impressions of it. During the seminars we had to watch different types of films on the subject of ethics and draft presentations about it. It seemed very interesting to learn about important companies and how they include ethics in their business and how you have to lead a company so that it operates responsibly in society. I've learned interesting facts from this course and I have to admit that I really started to be interested in this subject. What does the L᾿Oréal for Ethics Excellence Bursary represent for you? I didn't think I would win this bursary as the competition was strong. For me, this bursary represents a great chance to broaden my knowledge of ethics in business and I take this opportunity very seriously. Now, I can really say that ethics has become a part of my life. What are your future plans regarding the study of ethics, having been awarded this bursary? As I wrote in my application, there are several possibilities to attend ethics courses. With the help of my ethics teacher, I have found a summer school on Finance, Economics and Ethics, in Salerno, Italy, where I will learn more about the connection between the financial crisis and ethics. More precisely, there will be a series of workshops on investigating possible guidelines for future socio-economic models and on the proper role of finance in these new models, looking at ethics as a new emerging concept of value. The workshops will try to find answers to questions such as: Are there any tools and ways to give more importance to the ethical nature of finance? How should the financial tools aimed at supporting ethical business be used? What might be the role of the new media in this process? Starting in September, I will study for half a year as an Erasmus student at Corvinus University, Budapest, and there I will have the possibility to take up further courses on Corporate Responsibility, Ethics in Marketing, or Civil Service Ethics. It is also one of my plans to attend ethic courses during my master’s degree. In your essay you emphasised the characteristics of an ethical leader. What makes a great ethical leader? It's important to note that the ethical climate of a workplace matters to employees. The leaders of corporations have a responsibility to be leaders in the community as well. In other words, a great business leader should have a sense of social responsibility. A great ethical leader should be ethical in all areas of life, and be capable of leading a company in such a way that all of the stakeholders are satisfied and the company should be profitable, capable of developing and acting responsibly in society. The ethical leader will always have an advantage.

SUSTAINABILITY COMPOSITION OF BOARD OF STRATEGY DIRECTORS SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS BOARD COMMITTEES PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ECONOMIC AFFAIRS IN CLOSE-UP: SUNCARE PRODUCTS ETHICS An independent, available and vigilant Board of Directors UN GLOBAL COMPACT The L’Oréal Board of Directors considers that the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code of December 2008 are in line with the company’s corporate governance approach. This Code is CORPORATE GOVERNANCE therefore used by the company as its reference when drawing up the Chairman’s Report on the conditions in which the Board’s work is prepared and organised (pages 110 to 113 of the 2010 > BOARD OF DIRECTORS Reference Document). > BOARD COMMITTEES General management’s functions RATINGS AND AWARDS In 2006, the Board of Directors appointed Mr Jean-Paul Agon as Chief Executive Officer, and in order to prepare for the future of the company and ensure a smooth transition in its management, wished at the time to separate the role of Chief Executive Officer from that of Chairman of the Board of Directors, which was entrusted to Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones. Since then, the Board has noted firstly that this arrangement has been satisfactory, particularly in view of the quality of the relationship between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, and secondly that this measure proved very useful during a period of economic crisis. At its meeting on Thursday, 10th February 2011, the Board of Directors, which noted the quality of the results for 2010, decided to reunify the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, considering that the environment was once again favourable. When Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones, in accordance with his original intention of stepping down as Chairman at the age of 65, decided to place his office at the disposal of the Board on 17th March 2011, the Board appointed Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of L’Oréal. Mr Jean-Paul Agon has been Chief Executive Officer of L’Oréal since 2006. Sir Lindsay OwenJones, who continues to be a member of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the L’Oréal Foundation, has been appointed Honorary Chairman. Directors with a complementary range of experience The directors of L’Oréal come from different spheres; they complement each other in terms of their diverse professional experience and expertise, and they have a good knowledge of the company. The directors are present, active and closely involved. These are all assets for ensuring the quality of the Board’s deliberations and the preparation of its strategic decisions. The directors are independent in their thinking, have a duty of vigilance, and exercise complete freedom of judgement. This freedom of judgement enables them in particular to participate in a totally independent way in the work of the Board and its Committees. The Board of Directors of L’Oréal comprises 14 members: the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, six directors from the majority shareholders, three of whom represent Mrs Bettencourt’s family group, and three of whom represent Nestlé (the two Vice-Chairmen of the Board being chosen from among these members), and six independent directors: Annette Roux, Charles-Henri Filippi, Xavier Fontanet, Bernard Kasriel, Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière and Louis Schweitzer. Mr Ladreit de Lacharrière has been a director of L’Oréal for more than 12 years, but his professional experience and his freedom of judgement, combined with his good knowledge of the company, make a considerable contribution to the Board’s discussions and decisions. Systematic annual self-evaluation Every year, the Board reviews its composition, organisation and modus operandi. It considers the avenues of possible progress and makes any improvement that it considers appropriate. The Board met five times in 2010, with an average attendance rate of 98.5%. In 2010, the Board of Directors devoted one whole day to analysing various strategic aspects and strategic monitoring, in the presence of several senior managers. This enabled the Board, for example, to gauge the importance, firstly, of new fields and challenges with regard to the Internet and digital media in the development of the group’s business activities, and secondly of the initiatives being taken in this area, particularly in consumer relations. Furthermore, the functioning of the Committees was found to be satisfactory, with extensive and thorough preparatory work. Finally, in 2010, the Board was provided with regular information on the group’s business activities, and, at the end of the year, the directors expressed new wishes in this area, and made proposals for subjects to be discussed at meetings in 2011.

They are SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS actively involved in preparing the Board’s work, and make proposals, but do not have any decisionmaking powers. PERFORMANCE SUMMARY The Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee ECONOMIC AFFAIRS This Committee clarifies, through its analyses, the strategic orientations submitted to the Board, and IN CLOSE-UP: SUNCARE monitors the implementation and advancement of significant operations in progress. It ensures that PRODUCTS the main financial balances are preserved. It reviews the main lines of development, options and strategic projects presented by the General Management, together with their economic and financial ETHICS consequences, acquisition opportunities, and financial transactions that may significantly change the balance sheet structure. UN GLOBAL COMPACT The Committee met four times in 2010. Along with the constant and close review of the group’s business activity and the analysis of markets and competitors, the Committee monitored the CORPORATE GOVERNANCE economic conditions during emergence from the crisis, after having (in 2009) noted the strategic decisions taken by the general management at a very early stage to tackle the difficult economic > BOARD OF DIRECTORS environment. Furthermore, the Committee was called on to study projected acquisitions. > BOARD COMMITTEES The Audit Committee RATINGS AND AWARDS This Committee is, in particular, responsible for monitoring the process of preparing financial information, the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, the auditing of the annual and consolidated financial statements, and the independence of the Statutory Auditors. Mr Charles-Henri Filippi, L’Oréal director and a financial expert, is the Chairman of the Committee. The Committee met five times in 2010. It reviewed the evolution of the main items of the profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. It considered that the work of the Internal Audit Department and the Internal Control process put in place,from the risk viewpoint, are improving in quality. After taking note of the French financial markets authority (AMF) Report of July 2010 on the functioning of Audit Committees, the Committee found that its work was carried out in a framework complying with AMF recommendations. The Committee examined the conditions of industrial and environmental risks management and of those linked to quality and safety in product design. It noted that the systems and processes put in place, which are based on a sound methodology, are comprehensive and satisfactory. Finally, the Committee is regularly informed of legal risks and of any litigation and, once ayear, meets the Statutory Auditors without the presence of the management. The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee This Committee makes proposals on matters including, in particular, the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, the amount of attendance fees to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting and the method of distribution of such fees, and the implementation of long-term incentive plans, such as those providing, for example, for distributions of stock options or for free grants of shares. The Committee met four times in 2010 to consider all these matters. In connection with the proposal made to renew the Chief Executive Officer’s term of office, the Committee proposed to the Board that his contract of employment should continue to be suspended, which was accepted by the Board. After the closing of accounts, it made proposals to the Board with regard to the remuneration of the corporate officers and the implementation of a plan relating to stock options and conditional allocations of shares to employees concerning a large number of people. The Board approved the Committee’s proposals, particularly with regard to the performance conditions to be achieved by the Chief Executive Officer (who must, furthermore, conserve some of the options that he exercises) and by the members of the Executive Committee. The Appointments and Governance Committee The Appointments and Governance Committee makes proposals to the Board on the choice of directors, examines the expediency of separating the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, clarifies the Board’s decision concerning the conditions in which the general management is exercised and the status of corporate officers, discusses the independent director qualifications reviewed each year by the Board, ensures that the Corporate Government Code to which the company refers is applied, and prepares for the Board’s decisions about updates to its Internal Rules. It also ensures the implementation of the succession plans for the corporate officers in the event of an unforeseen vacancy, and conducts the reflection process with regard to the Committees in charge of preparing for the Board’s work. The Committee met three times in 2010. When the Directors’s terms of office were considered for renewal, the Committee proposed that the Board should review the situation of each of its members on a case-by-case basis, in particular in light of the independence criteria set out in the Afep-Medef Code. In the 2010 Reference Document, the independent directors are clearly qualified as such, in light of the criteria adopted by the Board. The Committee also confirmed its wish to carry out a harmonious renewal of directors’ terms of office, and it made proposals to the Board in the framework of the Annual General Meeting. Finally, the Committee examined the evolution of the Executive Committee and the talent pool for the future, and stated its view concerning a possible succession plan. In view of the broad spectrum of matters entrusted to the Committees, the Board has modified the names of two Committees to better reflect the extent of their remits. The Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee In the framework of the strategic orientations which this Committee studies and validates, the Board is extending the Committee’s remit by ensuring that the company’s commitments in the field of Sustainable Development, in light of the challenges which are specific to the group’s business activities and objectives, are fully taken into account. In this framework, the Committee examines the means and resources put in place, and reports on them to the Board. The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee The Committee is extending its remit to include all aspects of Human Resources Policy, such as social relations, recruitment, diversity, talent management and securing employee loyalty. The Committee also ensures that best practices in ethical matters, as set out in the Code of Ethics, and the group’s key values, such as respect and integrity, are widely disseminated, known and practised.

It is dedicated to the predictive assessment of efficacy and safety in ingredients and products. It has doubled in size, its staff has increased four-fold and the centre’s production of biological tissues – skin and cornea – in accordance with the ISO 9001 quality standards now exceeds 160,000 units per year, compared with 70,000 in 2007.

EFFICACY ASSESSMENT NEW ROUTES TO INNOVATION NEW ROUTES TO INNOVATION RAW MATERIALS ECO-DESIGN ETHICAL, SAFE PRODUCTS EVALUATING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TOWARDS FAIR ACCESS L’Oréal is entering a new era of innovation in which TO RAW MATERIALS reconstructed skin is systematically used to assess the efficacy SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTION OF COSMETICS of its active substances and formulas. The variety of reconstructed skin models enables different efficacy-assessment IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR COLOURING models for ingredients and formulas to be developed, and their reliability is continuously increased through the use of the latest scientific techniques such as genomics and proteomics. The stock of knowledge and data on substances, and the predictive methods that R&I have at their disposal, add value in three ways. They are used to enable the safety assessment of ingredients and formulas, measure the efficacy of ingredients and select, rationalise and endorse the most promising design programmes for new active substances from the earliest stages. For over 20 years, the development of tissue engineering in particular has advanced in line with this dynamic, producing tools for the biological analysis of skin and supporting innovation. In fact, the reconstructed skin models represent a unique tool for predicting human physiological reactions by perfectly imitating the conditions under which the products are applied. In 2009, for example, the models enabled us to gain an objective view of the cosmetic efficacy of new essential oils such as lemon balm. Towards an integrated predictive efficacy-assessment strategy Specific measurement protocols are being developed by L’Oréal Advanced Research to create an integrated predictive-assessment strategy for efficacy. The ultimate objective is to achieve a sufficiently reliable level of prediction that will represent an alternative to clinical trials. In other respects, the dossier on the efficacy of the principle molecules developed by L’Oréal relies increasingly on the data gained from assessments carried out in accordance with in vitro protocols.

EFFICACY ASSESSMENT RAW MATERIALS NEW ROUTES TO INNOVATION RAW MATERIALS ECO-DESIGN ETHICAL, SAFE PRODUCTS EVALUATING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Innovation is based on a fund of advanced knowledge and is TOWARDS FAIR ACCESS TO RAW MATERIALS applied in three strategic phases: active substances, formulation SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTION and evaluation. OF COSMETICS IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR Advances in knowledge COLOURING In 2009, R&I completed the genome map of skin, based on reconstructed skin, in a joint project with Laval University in Québec and the Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris. This ten-year research programme achieved numerous advances in terms of knowledge and, in particular, the discovery of the skin proteome. In 2010, after 10 years of research and collaboration with the University of Cleveland, researchers identified one of the keys to young-looking skin: papillary fibroblasts, cells in the outer dermis of the skin that play a major role in skin regeneration. Papillary fibroblasts alter and disappear gradually with age, while the reticular fibroblasts of the inner dermis skin layers are preserved. This discovery enabled the researchers to select and patent a skin-repair substance, Rhamnose. The aim is now to build on this knowledge in order to refine the selection of new ingredients and maximise their cosmetic properties in increasingly tailored products. From design to formulation Virtually all L’Oréal’s ingredient-development programmes are part of a new approach extending from design to formulation. Several key initiatives have been implemented to achieve this: Development of a physical chemistry platform that enables the characteristics of new ingredients to be defined by generating as much data about them as possible, complementing the information provided by the suppliers Systematic use of IT modelling in advance of ingredient-design programmes Optimisation of design procedures from the early stages. Rhamnose Rhamnose, a plant sugar produced by certain Brazilian plants, such as Uncaria or trees such as Betula Pendula (Silver Birch), was selected and patented for its skin-repair effect. It is extracted using a hydrolysis process which preserves its natural origin and endows it with a favourable environmental profile. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in vitro on reconstructed skin models then confirmed in vivo by a proof of clinical concept study. This approach resulted in a gradual redefinition of the routes to innovation for each major category of ingredients.

TO RAW MATERIALS A constantly evolving portfolio SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTION OF COSMETICS Every year, L’Oréal introduces new raw materials into its portfolio either to enhance the quality or boost the performance of its products. At the same time, various other raw materials are removed if IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR their performance is considered inadequate or if new regulations are anticipated. This is why L’Oréal COLOURING eliminated triclosan, diethylphtalate and octamethylcyclotetra-siloxane (silicone D4) from its portfolio at a very early stage. Since 2009, L’Oréal no longer adds raw materials containing decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) to its portfolio. A portfolio evolving towards renewable, low-impact raw materials L’Oréal aims to increase the use of renewable raw materials in its products. In 2010, 40% of materials included in its portfolio were plant-based and 26% comply with the principles of green chemistry. This proactive approach has in some cases enabled plant-based alternatives to be sourced to replace petrochemical raw materials: 70% of the polymers recently registered are plant-based. Some synthetic polymers are therefore being replaced by polysaccharides. This approach is leading us to develop relationships with new partners, notably a group of suppliers in the food industry. R&I is currently working to identify alternatives to petrochemical substances that are lower-impact but equally effective by exploring the potential of molecules and solvents of natural origin. Raw materials impact assessment The Raw Material Sustainability Assessment (RMSA) is an impact evaluation and qualification framework for the whole life cycle of a raw material, and is based on our key criteria. Drawn up initially in 2006, it has already been applied to more than 100 new raw materials. It aims to present a clearer analysis of the global impact of each ingredient, and our suppliers are closely involved in this process. In 2009, this framework was extended to include a quantitative impact assessment and to take into account the challenges specific to each supply chain. In 2010, L’Oréal successfully assessed all new raw materials on the basis of this framework. This will now be extended to the plant-based raw materials already in use, with priority being given to the largest volumes and the ingredients for which potential challenges have been identified from the plant data sheets. By the end of 2011, 80% of our raw materials presenting a biodiversity issue will have been assessed. ST11, the first hair care probiotic To prevent the formation of dandruff and the scalp irritation frequently associated with this condition, L’Oréal laboratories have selected a new active substance, the probiotic ST11, the result of research work carried out in collaboration with Nestlé. Together, we are conducting long-term and in-depth studies into the major causes of dandruff, and its possible prevention by improving the scalp’s barrier function. This work has led to the creation of the nutria-cosmetic line Innéov Hair Health, a 50:50 joint venture with Nestlé.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TOWARDS FAIR ACCESS Systematic analysis of impact on biodiversity TO RAW MATERIALS Our systematic analysis of impact on biodiversity is based on two tools which enable: SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTION advance identification of potential issues linked to the use of a plant with respect to three OF COSMETICS key criteria (ecology, fair trade and society). The information is consolidated in our internal database. In 2010, the portfolios of raw materials of natural origin from the group’s recent IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR acquisitions were also analysed COLOURING minimisation, using the RMSA evaluation framework, of the impact of suppliers' practices on the relevant supply chains, focusing in particular on “respect for biodiversity”. If the use of a given plant in one of our raw materials is likely to have a negative impact on biodiversity, a plan of action is implemented to remedy this in conjunction with the supplier concerned, calling on the support of third parties if necessary. In 2010, our commitment to biodiversity was recognised in the publication of the study, “Business and Biodiversity” [ Entreprises & Biodiversité ] by the Gondwana agency. In November, a summary of this study was presented at the Pollutec exhibition during the 2010 Business and the Environment award ceremony. Palm oil The production of palm oil has led to large-scale deforestation in the primary forests of the southern hemisphere. Conscious of its responsibility to contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems, L’Oréal joined the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2006. The aim of this body is the creation of responsible supply chains. An internal interdisciplinary working group called Sustainable Palm Oil 2010 was created. L’Oréal uses a very small quantity (approximately 600 tonnes of palm oil annually, compared with the more than 40 million tonnes used globally), but was nonetheless committed to sourcing only certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) by the end of 2010. This objective was achieved by the middle of the year – ahead of our commitment. The certification chosen guarantees that the palm oil contained in our products comes only from plantations certified sustainable by the RSPO. The WWF recently included L’Oréal in its list of top ten “responsible palm-oil users”. Nerolidol Nerolidol is an important raw material in the denaturing of alcohol for formulas labelled “Ecocert organic” (claiming to be of natural origin). It is a co-product of the parquet sector, obtained from the distillation of the essential oil of cabreuva wood. The felling of this endemic tree is currently controlled in Paraguay. L’Oréal has asked its supplier, Robertet, to undertake a local audit to clarify the regulatory context and the procedures to be implemented to ensure compliance. Monitoring the certificates obtained from INFONA (The Paraguayan Ministry of Water Resources and Forests) now enables Robertet to verify the source of all batches of nerolidol supplied to L’Oréal.

CHALLENGES > NATURAL INGREDIENTS ECO-DESIGN ETHICAL, SAFE PRODUCTS EVALUATING Expertise in organic and natural products ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Since 2009, the formulation of products claiming to be natural , of natural origin or organic has been covered by a special charter that defines the categories of authorised raw materials (water, TOWARDS FAIR ACCESS raw materials of natural origin unprocessed or processed exclusively in accordance with processes TO RAW MATERIALS adhering to the principles of green chemistry), and promotes green chemistry or biotechnology processes. SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTION OF COSMETICS In collaboration with a COLIPA working group, L’Oréal has continued to work on defining the meaning of “natural and organic” in the cosmetics industry. This working group is closely monitoring IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR efforts to draw up a potential ISO standard which could establish a norm. COLOURING An increasing number of brands In 2010, several dozen formulas were labelled Ecocert organic and 58 new products were Ecocert-registered, including: Bioexigence, Biotherm, Garnier, Mixa, Mixa bébé, Narta, Sanoflore, Série Nature, The Body Shop, Ushuaia, Agnès b, L’Oréal Professionnel and the hair oil Delicate Care Organic Certified Oil de Matrix. In parallel with this development, numerous brands are gradually integrating more and more natural raw materials into their new formulations. This is the case at Garnier with the Fructis Style Pure Clean gel and also at Dop with the Green Fix de Vivelle gel. Certain formulas already on the market are also being reappraised in order to introduce ingredients of natural origin offering the same level of performance. A sugar that was one of the ingredients of a shower gel labelled organic , has subsequently replaced a fossil-based surfactant in all conventional shower gels, thereby helping to reduce both their environmental impact and their development costs while still offering the same performance. New plant-extracts R&I has also increased its research efforts into natural and organic cosmetics. A dedicated laboratory set up in 2008 aims to identify and promote skinand hair-friendly plant extracts that are just as effective as conventional cosmetics. The action of certain essential oils (the anti-ageing effect of essential oil of geranium, the soothing properties of lemon balm, etc) has been demonstrated in vitro on biological models (reconstructed skin). Biomass from thermal plankton L’Oréal’s biotechnology department in Tours, France, produces a pure biomass from thermal plankton believed to be impossible to cultivate, and research have developed and perfected this industrial tool with exemplary reproducibility. Using water, sugar and controlled plant extracts, a biomass is produced that is not found in its natural state except in a highly diluted form in hot springs. This is now being produced continuously, enabling fermenter energy to be reduced by a factor of ten and guaranteeing quality. L’Oréal’s cosmetics knowledge plays a key role in optimising the sensitivity to skin and the tolerance of organic or plant-based products.

This enables the quantity of waste generated per kg of product to be calculated very rapidly. In 2009, for example, the E factor of the synthesis of Pro-Xylane dropped from 13 to 6.6, which equates to a saving of more than 100 tonnes of waste Intensification of research and development efforts into biocatalysis, a key technology for the development of environmentally friendly processes, notably through the active participation of L’Oréal in the Toulouse White Biotechnologies project (French Programme “Future Investments” [“Investissements d’Avenir”]). Developing new ingredients This eco-design approach for ingredients directs and guides the development of formulations. In 2010, numerous international partnerships were pursued with a view to developing new ingredients in accordance with the principles of green chemistry. For example, participation in the Industries and Agro-Resources Cluster (IAR) project “Synthons”, and the ANR programme, “Sustainable Chemistry – Industry – Innovation (CD2I)”, was aimed at the development of green technologies and green processes using biomass. Collaborations with suppliers such as Roquette were also conducted for the same purpose. In 2010, L'Oréal’s commitment to green chemistry was recognised with an invitation to the Gordon Research Conference on Green Chemistry at Davidson College (USA, NC). Professor J. Warner, one of the co-founders of the principles of green chemistry in 1998, made reference to this commitment in the following terms: “By bringing natural materials and renewable feed-stocks into their science, L’Oréal is addressing the principles of green chemistry at the highest level. L’Oréal has an excellent internal Green Chemistry program that places them at the forefront of the industry”.

TOWARDS FAIR ACCESS TO RAW MATERIALS Changes to laboratory processes and methods For some years now, L’Oréal laboratories have been undertaking a massive revision of formulations, SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTION selecting those ingredients with the most favourable environmental profile and offering the same OF COSMETICS level of performance. This approach also helps in the development of new formulations, providing products with high environmental credentials that comply, where desired, with eco-labelling IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR requirements. COLOURING In order to ensure this, before a formula is designed the formulators refer to a variety of indicators that help define the environmental profile of each raw material and of the formula as a whole, taking account of the concentrations used. This approach to formulation became standard procedure in 2009. It was formalised in an eco-design charter for products based on the following criteria; biodegradability, non-ecotoxicity and respect for biodiversity. This charter sets out two approaches: a gradual progress approach and a militant approach. This charter is reflected, for example, in the highly biodegradable and non-ecotoxic ranges such as Rain Forest Ecoconscious or Earthlovers from The Body Shop, the shampoo and conditioner Fructis Pure Brillance from Garnier, or Dop Nature from Dop. Product performance and impact are increasingly being systematically tested on reduced samples using automated processes. This reduces the quantities of raw material used, accelerates screening rates and increases the number of ingredients assessed. This all reflects the increasing integration of corporate social responsibility into the work of the laboratories.

The predictive capability of these tools is increasing all the time, thanks to the development of technologies in tissue engineering, modern biology, mathematical modelling, computing power and the valuable stock of data built up over a century. This is a constantly growing body of knowledge, helped by a number of factors including information exchange between L’Oréal and other companies, the regulatory framework, developments in in vitro/in vivo correlations, product-use safety data and human tolerance studies. Thanks to this array of predictive methods, L’Oréal was able to meet the 2009 deadline set down in the regulatory framework of the 7th amendment to the Cosmetics Directive without any adverse effects on innovation or the safety of its ingredients and products. In continuing to upgrade and fine-tune these tools, the group plans to create an integrated safety assessment strategy attuned to the challenges of 21st century toxicology . In this context, progress has been made in the simulation of the first human application using a combination of predictive and in vitro tools. This involves a certain number of ingredients exclusively for cosmetic use. Employing a combination of predictive methods, the aim is to optimise the design of new ingredients and end products by assessing from the outset their innocuousness, in compliance with prevailing legislation. This ensures ongoing improvement of the methods used to make the initial selection of ingredients based on safety criteria.

Triclosan The objective of refraining from the use of triclosan has been achieved, and this policy will be systematically applied to products resulting from the group’s future acquisitions. Heavy metals Since 2007, L’Oréal has deployed extremely sensitive equipment to enable the detection of traces of heavy metal down to just a few ppm. This equipment has enabled an analysis of the entire portfolio of raw materials of natural origin and the building of a vast database. Now, through predictive calculation, the degree of unavoidable heavy metal traces in finished products can be established in order to guarantee that these remain below the authorised or recommended threshold. Nanotechnologies L’Oréal has limited the use of nanotechnologies to emulsions and pigments: Nanoemulsions are formed from water and oil droplets containing active ingredients that are released on contact when applied to the skin. They are reduced to nanometric size to increase the quality and efficacy of the formula. Mineral nanopigments are present in our natural environment. Titanium dioxide, an inert, nontoxic material, is the best known, due to its capacity to reflect UV light and protect human skin from the adverse effects of the sun. These nanopigments are nowadays a very effective complement for achieving high protection factors. The European NanoInteract programme has confirmed that titanium dioxide nanopigments are not present at the time of application as separated nanoparticles, but as larger aggregates, often several microns in size. Sunscreen filters In 2010, R&I continued its research into combinations of filters and photo-stabilising agents with Mexoryl technologies to achieve higher filtering capacity while reducing the final concentration of chemical filters. The Mexoplex technology has reduced the concentration of chemical filters by 18%, while maintaining the same level of effectiveness by incorporating a photo-stabilising emollient oil, developed in collaboration with the CNRS (the French National Centre for Scientific Research). This has been introduced into a Roche-Posay sun care product. Tests have also been developed aimed at measuring the impact of sunscreen filters on aquatic ecosystems. All products concerned will be assessed using this protocol. Hair colourants Finding less sensitising colourants is a focal aspect of R&I. At the same time, efforts have continued to rework formulas to optimise the technical performance of hair-colour products while minimising the concentration of colourants, particularly PPD and PTD. Aluminium salts L’Oréal has been working for several years on reducing the concentration of aluminium salts contained in deodorants and has invested in the search for alternative solutions delivering a similar level of performance. These efforts resulted in the launch of a number of ranges in 2009, notably those by Garnier, LaScad and Biotherm.

SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTION For the last 15 years, L’Oréal has relied on the expertise of its ecotoxicology laboratory, and on OF COSMETICS partnerships, to increase its screening and assessment capacity during 2009. Environmental assessment is one of the keys to L’Oréal’s eco-design approach because it ensures IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR COLOURING elimination, from the outset, of ingredients with an unfavourable environmental profile. A profile of a raw material's environmental impact, based on PBT (Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic) and vPvB (very Persistent and very Bioaccumulative) criteria, is established in every case well in advance. Environmental assessment relies in particular on in silico and in vitro tools applied in close collaboration with suppliers. More than 95% of the raw materials in the group's portfolio have been provisionally classified under the PBT – vPvB criteria. This is in progress for raw materials from the group’s new acquisitions. L’Oréal was heavily involved in the creation and subsequent development of the Animal Alternative Needs in Environmental Risk Assessment Project Committee at the HESI*. This international working group, whose first two conferences (in 2008, and in 2010) L’Oréal sponsored, is working on the development of alternatives to the standard tests on fish and amphibians. Together with the HESI, L’Oréal has invested in the development and recognition of the Fish Embryo Test (FET), currently undergoing validation at the OCDE, as a potential alternative to the standardised acute toxicity test on fish (OCDE N°203). In 2010, this work was covered in scientific publications in partnership with ECVAM**. Thanks to the development of predictive tools, the environmental profile of raw materials is available to formulators for the design of their products. The environmental quality of formulas is thus increasing each year. It is now possible to create environmentally friendly formulas without compromising on performance. All the raw materials registered by L’Oréal in 2010 have a favourable environmental profile or are of higher ecological quality than the previous versions. * HESI: Health and Environmental Sciences Institute ** ECVAM: European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2010 REPORT HOME GROUP DOWNLOADS CONTACT BUSINESS INNOVATION PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION TALENT COMMUNITIES DATABANK VIEWPOINTS Innovation / Evaluating Environmental Impact / Aquatic systems INTRODUCTION KEY ACHIEVEMENTS 2010 Aquatic systems MORE IN THIS REPORT...

IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR COLOURING In 2009, in partnership with external experts, the ecotoxicological laboratory continued to work on the development of methods for predicting the impact of ingredients and end products on aquatic systems in strong support of the eco-design of formulas. L’Oréal is heavily committed, together with other partners, in the development of the Fish Embryo Test as a potential alternative to the acute toxicity test on fish. This alternative method is in the process of being validated by the OECD. The R&I teams are also working to achieve a better understanding of the behaviour of those compounds contained in the group’s products, which are subsequently released into the environment as trace materials. A partnership with the Pasteur Institute in Lille was established to study this issue in more depth and to validate a sampling and analysis protocol.

This is all the more important when the plant in SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTION OF COSMETICS question represents a potential source of revenue and employment for local communities. IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR COLOURING Since 2005, L’Oréal has been developing tools to identify in advance potential fairness issues associated with the use of a given plant. L’Oréal uses the Sustainability Assessment framework when considering raw materials with potential biodiversity issues for inclusion in the portfolio. This framework includes the following criteria, which are evaluated by the supplier with respect to its individual supply chain: The importance of the plant in terms of local revenue and employment and the level of return allowed by the supply chain to the local community Recognition of traditional uses and know-how. These are taken into account in the management of all intellectual property aspects Access of local populations to raw material sources Any change in land use that may be caused by production of the raw material. Particular importance is placed on land initially used for food. In 2010, L’Oréal carried out a systematic study of the patents registered by the group to ensure that they respected traditional know-how and the free access of local populations to their resources. The same criteria were applied to supplier patents. L’Oréal considers the guarantee of a fair return to local populations essential to the sustainability of its supply chains. It is an integral part of a socially responsible and sustainable supply chain that meets the requirements of the Convention on Biological Diversity. In 2010, the signatory countries to the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the Nagoya Protocol, which aims to regulate access to resources in a given territory and to share the profits from the use of these resources in an equitable fashion. Each signatory country must put in place binding rules applicable for its territory. Although this Protocol will only come into force during 2011, L’Oréal is already particularly mindful of the future implications. The Emblica supply chain in India Emblica is a native species of south-east Asia, particularly India where it is widely used in traditional medicine. India is one of the countries to have put in place regulations concerning access to resources within its territory. L’Oréal has made contact with the National Biodiversity Authority in India, which has confirmed the legality of this resource with respect to prevailing national legislation relating to biodiversity.

Any commitment to use these ingredients is IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR undertaken for a period of at least two years in order to ensure consistency in production and COLOURING purchasing volumes. This applies to products launched by the group’s brands and which contain at least one raw material from the “Community Fair Trade” programme such as Ushuaia shower gels, Essential Repair from Pureology, Delicate Care shampoo from Biolage and Skinenergetic from Biotherm etc. The “Community Fair Trade” programme L’Oréal buys more and more raw materials from the 'Community Fair Trade' programme, and these are now incorporated into more than 200 formulas. Worldwide, L’Oréal doubled its use of fair-trade raw materials between 2008 and 2010. In 2010, L’Oréal Professionnel launched Oilixir, containing olive oil, under this programme and The Body Shop introduced an organic alcohol made from sugar cane. L’Oréal has intensified its partnership with Beraca involving socially responsible supply channels with two Amazon-sourced ingredients: açai extract and pracaxi oil. The supply of these ingredients is organised in close collaboration with the local communities that harvest them. In 2010, açai extract was introduced into the Fructis Color Resist range from Garnier. L’Oréal actively encourages its shea butter suppliers to enhance the sustainability of the supply chain in Africa and is proactive in the Global Shea Alliance, an international organisation of shea stakeholders which aims to create economically-viable production of shea, sustainable both in social and environmental terms. In 2009, Sanoflore was awarded Bio Solidaire certification for 36 raw materials. This certification recognises supply chains that prioritise the sourcing of local raw materials. Sanoflore is the first French organic cosmetic brand to highlight the local origin of its products in this way. The argan supply chain The group uses three cosmetic ingredients from the argan tree (oil, a leaf extract and a berry extract) in numerous haircare, skin-care and make-up products. These are purchased by L’Oréal, in partnership with one of its suppliers, (Laboratoires Sérobiologiques, Cognis France), and the French NGO Yamana, from six co-operatives in the Targanine EIG (Economic Interest Group) in Morocco. An important aim of this approach is to achieve better recognition of the value of this important natural resource in order to contribute to its conservation by improving the social and environmental conditions of production, developing by-products and increasing income opportunities for women in local communities. Thermoliss Richesse by Jacques Dessange, Nourishing Dry Oil by Mizani, the EverSlick range by L’Oréal Paris US, and l’Huile Universelle from Kérastase, all containing argan oil, were launched in 2010. Also in 2010, a new raw material from this supply chain – kernel powder – has complemented the existing range and will be exploited in Ushuaia products for its exfoliating properties.

SOCIETAL CONTRIBUTION OF COSMETICS Research in social sciences IN CLOSE-UP: HAIR The outsourced social sciences research centre is investigating the psychological and socioCOLOURING cultural processes at work in cosmetic use and personal hygiene routines. Since 2005, interdisciplinary research has been conducted (in the form of four theses and a postdoctoral study) in psychology, sociology and anthropology. Three international round tables have also been organised. These studies centre on the profound motivations underlying people’s interest in their appearance and their attitude to risk. They consider issues of culture, acculturation and social networks, based on data gathered from ten populations. Two theses and a post-doctoral study have since been completed, forming the basis of new protocols. This research has led to the development and validation of new psychometric tools which can be applied to other populations, providing measurement indexes relating to appearance, selfesteem and risk perception. Research into quality of life The BeautyQoL project The BeautyQoL initiative, an ambitious programme aimed at developing a new quality of life index specific to cosmetics, has been underway since 2006 in 13 countries and 16 cultures. It enables a comprehensive assessment of new products, drawing on aspects such as wellbeing, self-esteem and other psychosocial criteria. This tool will provide a new indicator in the development of products, factoring in consumer expectations, cultural variables and the environment. In 2009, the results of a study conducted in partnership with the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris, on cosmetic use in adult patients suffering from anorexia, were published as part of the proceedings of the 61st Institute of Psychiatric Services in the USA. The study was entitled: “Cosmetics care in anorexia nervosa: a few grams of eye shadow to relieve self-loathing”. Integrating diverse needs To gain a better understanding of skin and hair diversity throughout the world and to design products tailored to the needs of every individual, L’Oréal continuously conducts studies of local populations. In 2009, for example, a study aimed at determining hair colour and growth parameters was carried out by the hair product laboratories in 23 countries. In 2010, the make-up laboratory continued its work on gaining an understanding of skin colour around the world and has also completed other typological studies.

EHS policy and group EHS manual In 2010, we initiated a project to bring together in one place all the elements that support implementation of our EHS policy across L’Oréal’s worldwide sites. The result is our EHS manual – the first level of documentation in our EHS system. The manual outlines how EHS is organised and managed within L’Oréal, and sets out the measures to be applied by all operational sites under L’Oréal’s control. These include measures and targets for safety (zero accidents), resource efficiency, CO2 emissions, as well as EHS responsibilities, internal procedures and so on. This provides sites with a key tool to drive further improvements in EHS performance. The EHS manual is due to be launched in 2011 to all operational sites and will be extended to cover Research & Innovation sites and administration centres from 2012. Organisation of EHS There are clear accountabilities for EHS at every level. The Managing Director of the L’Oréal Operations Department is responsible for EHS and reports to the CEO. The EHS department is linked to each part of our operations through EHS managers. Each L’Oréal division has a dedicated EHS function. In a typical factory of 350 workers, there would be three to four full-time EHS staff. Factory managers’ and distribution managers’ remuneration is linked to EHS performance. Worldwide audit programme External experts regularly visit L’Oréal’s production and distribution sites to assess progress and risks. Third party audits are also carried out at supplier sites using the same standards that we apply to ourselves. Impact assessments The cosmetics industry has limited environmental risks, but as with any manufacturing operation, these do exist. Before building or renovating a factory anywhere in the world, and before introducing new manufacturing equipment and processes, L'Oreal assesses all the potential EHS impacts and develops mitigation strategies where required. EHS Policy training We provide targeted training in L’Oréal’s EHS Policy for line managers and EHS professionals across our group. The objectives are to: Identify and share our EHS vision, challenges and values across the group Identify the risks inherent in a role, task, behaviour or use of equipment and to implement tailored corrective solutions Enable managers to implement effectively our EHS Policy across teams. In Europe, 111 EHS specialists and managers with operational EHS responsibilities took part in our customised EHS Policy training, and 20 in Asia. From 2011, there will be a customised version targeted at all levels of line management. Training in EHS and leadership In 2010, 20 L’Oréal participants took part in two open seminars for site managers on EHS & Leadership, held at CEDEP, the collaborative learning community based on the INSEAD campus in France. The main objectives of the seminars were to change the mindset of managers on safety, build recognition of safety as a core issue for organisations and leaders, and improve the capacity of managers to instil and maintain safe behaviours over the long term. Environmental initiatives “We have done a tremendous job worldwide this year through our dedicated teams and transversal steering committees to improve environmental monitoring and prioritised environmental efforts alongside operational performance. As a result we have enhanced best practices in our drive to halve our CO2 emissions, our water consumption and our waste generation by 2015. We know that these are hard goals to attain, but we are already halfway and we will get there. Naturally, we are also thinking of further goals after 2015... and are very aware that the reduction of our environmental footprint will provide cost savings through operating efficiency and also drive innovation.” Miguel Castellanos, Director of Environment, Health and Safety, L’Oréal Safeguarding bees and biodiversity Bees are vital for pollination and biodiversity but populations around the world have suffered dramatic declines in recent years. The Chimex factory at Tours, France, has allocated 8,000 square metres of its land to wildflowers and other native flora, providing bees with an ideal habitat. Following an agreement with a beekeepers’ association, four hives have been set up as part of a programme to recolonise the local area. The factory is also providing funding so that a hive can be safely observed from a distance as part of an educational outreach programme with local schools.

SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS Original target TRANSPORT Our original target was a 70% improvement in our safety record by 2015 (base year 2005; TFc of 4.20), representing a TFc* of < 1.0. We have now decided to raise the bar even higher as part of our commitment to world-class performance. Revised target We are aiming for an 86% improvement in our safety record by 2015 (base year 2005; TFc of 4.20), representing a TFc of < 0.60. *TFc (Taux de réquence conventionnel; Conventional frequency rate) = number of lost time accidents per million hours worked by L’Oréal employees. Performance summary In line with the positive trend we have seen over several years, performance continued to be very good in 2010. Our accident rate fell by 23% compared with the previous year. TFc (Conventional Frequency Rate) – Factories and distribution centres Millions of hours without a lost time accident 12 factories and four distribution centres reached or passed the threshold of one million hours worked* without a lost time accident Four factories reached three million hours. *(L’Oréal employees and temporary workers) Zero accidents in 2010 61 (out of 110) factories and distribution centres recorded zero accidents – and our safety record in our distribution centres continues to improve significantly As well as a reduction in the number of accidents, it is also important to note that the accident severity rate continues to fall, showing a 73% improvement since 2005. Focus areas for 2011 The figures show excellent progress over several years but a deterioriation over the last three months of 2010 is also a reminder of the need to maintain our focus. This relates to a rise in the number of incidents at a newly acquired site, where the group EHS policies and procedures are still currently being implemented Another area of focus is lost time accidents of temporary workers in our factories. This rose by 50% compared with 2009. Controlling explosion and fire risks ATEX is a framework that reflects two European Directives on controlling explosive atmospheres, including standards of equipment and protective systems. Since 1997, we have had an internal directive which has been applied in all operational sites worldwide. This follows the spirit and major requirements of ATEX, as well as the American NEC 505 standard. Although our sites have a low fire risk, L’Oréal takes it extremely seriously. Our warehouse in Essigny, France, which stores aerosol products containing flammable gases, is considered a model across Europe for fire prevention measures.

SUPPLIER RELATIONS EHS manual PACKAGING This project aims to bring together all the elements that make up our EHS policy, in order to help our SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS sites to implement it worldwide. The manual complies with international standards, (including ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001), and provides a complete picture of L’Oréal’s goals for safety and the TRANSPORT environment. It summarises EHS roles and responsibilities in all the Group’s structures, as well as EHS directives – helping sites to achieve and maintain a high level of EHS performance. The manual will be published in 2011. Ergonomic Attitude programme In 2010, we extended a 2009 pilot, to develop a group-wide ergonomic programme called Ergonomic Attitude. The programme’s principal aim is to develop systematic, focused improvements within our work environments. A group steering committee oversaw the development of the strategy and identified initial focus areas. For each focus area, a workgroup was established, and in 2010 workgroups for computer workstations, packaging line design, best practice sharing, and training and awareness were initiated. In particular, good ergonomic practices were collected across L’Oréal’s sites and were published on the group EHS intranet, providing a platform for knowledge sharing across all sites. An Ergonomic Attitude awareness film was created at the end of 2010, which will be available for use by sites to support their development of ergonomic situation awareness and for launching the programme. 2010 was a great year for Ergonomic Attitude and 2011 promises to be even better. MESUR programme MESUR (Managing Effective Safety Using Recognition & Realignment) is a group EHS programme that develops the capacity of an individual to identify risk and act accordingly. MESUR is a programme developed by L’Oréal for L’Oréal. It uses a variety of best practices in Behaviour Based Safety, which are aligned with our safety culture and future vision. The programme requires management to systematically speak to employees about their safety. Employees are observed in day to day activities by management and are then engaged in discussion about their safety, their At Risk Practices and the potential for injury. Solutions are then developed with the individual, with a preference for immediate solutions. MESUR is designed to ensure that: Line management discusses safety with employees on a systematic basis, enabling employees and those with safety responsibilities to discuss best practice and identify improvements together The safety culture of L’Oréal develops to become an interdependent culture Low level signals (At Risk Practices) are identified and reviewed. This provides management with the opportunity to identify potential injury risks before an injury occurs. MESUR has been extended to all our operational sites. In 2010, 6,788 MESUR visits took place. These led to 14,210 actions for improvement, and 92% of these were completed. In 2011, it is planned to pilot an extension programme based on MESUR principles with all employees. SIO (Safety Improvement Opportunities) The aim of the SIO programme is to involve employees in sharing responsibility for safety matters and to create a culture of safety. The SIO programme promotes the need for employees to identify areas for improvement and reduce the risk of incidents. These might range from a missing floor tile, an issue with a safety device, or any other improvement that could prevent an accident. Progress is monitored through the Safety Culture rate – the total number of SIOs per million hours worked. Our 2010 performance shows the increasing involvement of our employees: A Safety Culture rate of 636 – a 75% increase on 2009 25,028 SIOs were identified in 2010 across all operational sites 89.3% of these SIOs were completed. Our next target is to close more than 90% of all SIOs identified during 2011.

MORE IN THIS REPORT... > HEALTH AND SAFETY INITIATIVES EHS Risk Audit SUPPLIER RELATIONS > AUDIT PROGRAMME Risk Audits are designed to ensure that procedures and methods being used by employees do not carry inherent risks. These audits are carried out by independent, recognised experts across our CARBON AND ENERGY international operations. A team of three or four auditors would typically evaluate a factory over four to five days, while one or two auditors would typically spend two to three days at a distribution WATER centre. WASTE AND RECYCLING In 2010, Risk Audits were carried out in ten factories, nine distribution centres and five administrative sites. ‘MADE IN CHIMEX’ EHS ‘Culture Audit’ SOURCING RAW MATERIALS This programme was set up in 2009 with a focus on leadership, visible EHS culture and industrial excellence. EHS ‘Culture Audits’ are triggered by a site’s performance and are conducted by SUPPLIER RELATIONS internal EHS specialists through group interviews involving 20% to 30% of the site’s employees. Before the audit, the site management is invited to carry out a self-evaluation using 16 key criteria PACKAGING (see example below). These are then evaluated during the audit, with the site management and workforce, in order to assess performance and identify opportunities for improvement. SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS In 2010, EHS ‘Culture Audits’ were carried out in 15 factories and eight distribution centres. TRANSPORT Examples of EHS ‘Culture Audits’ showing results over two years: Suzhou, Asia and Franklin, USA Suzhou factory, Asia Our Suzhou factory was one of 12 across L’Oréal’s operations that reached or passed the threshold of one million hours worked without a lost time accident for L’Oreal employees or temporary workers. Franklin factory, USA EHS Contractor Audits The vast majority of L’Oréal’s production output is made in our own factories and only a very small percentage is made by contractors. We have an audit programme specifically for contractors who manufacture and/or package our finished goods. This programme focuses on compliance with EHS regulation and risk control. Audit visits are carried out by independent, external auditors on L’Oréal’s behalf. In order to become a contractor of L’Oréal, there must be a positive audit result. In 2010, EHS Contractor Audits were carried out at nine contractor factories. See also: Social audits, which focus on suppliers’ labour standards. Other types of EHS audit Other types of EHS audit include insurance inspections (30 fire and environment inspections in 2010); certification audits (30 site audits in 2010, for ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001); and visits to assure the accuracy of our KPI data – for example, see databank section for this report. EHS Corporate Audit Committee The role of this Committee is to assure the governance, quality and effectiveness of our audit programme. The committee met twice in 2010, to discuss findings and recommendations from audits with zone management, and to define a three-year improvement action plan.

We value every initiative taken by every site across the world. Each saving is important in reducing our overall carbon footprint. For example: L’Oréal was ranked No. 1 in the annual Climate Our Yichang factory in China has reduced the electricity it uses for lighting by 45% (200810) as a result of progressive upgrades including the use of T5 fluorescent lamps Counts survey of In Piscataway, USA, our factory has reduced the amount of electricity used for lighting by companies who are 70%, by installing LED lamps and sun tubes, which make use of natural daylight. managing their climate impacts BUS (Better Utilities for Sustainability) The BUS project, a group-wide pilot project run by operations managers, is drawing on expertise DATABANK from across L’Oréal to identify methods, technical solutions and good practices in cleansing, CO 2 EMISSIONS SCOPE 1 cooling, air compression and other factory processes. CO 2 EMISSIONS SCOPE 2 To date, we have identified 11 good practices in water conservation and energy efficiency. The aim TOTAL CO 2 EMISSIONS is for these to become second nature and ‘non-negotiable’ across the group. ENERGY Halving CO 2 emissions at Vichy Our Vichy factory has already reduced its carbon footprint by 38% (2005–10). It is partnering with energy provider EDF on three new technology projects, with the aim of reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2011. Triple energy recovery: Energy from three processes (waste water, steam and compressed air) is recovered to heat water to between 12° and 60°C, which is then used for washing and cleaning. Steam is then used to heat the water to a required 70°C Free cooling: This applies an ancient principle in a new way: colder night air is captured and re-used for cooling, while in winter the heat generated from the production plant is used to maintain an even temperature Geothermal energy: The heat generated by the geothermal system enables water to be pre-heated in summer, air to be warmed in winter, and it also keeps an even temperature in the building. The cold water produced by the system is used for production processes and for cleaning the plant. L’Oréal’s wider carbon footprint By measuring carbon emissions through the whole lifecycle, from raw material extraction to product use and disposal, we are identifying where savings can be made and taking action where we can. Following a study of our eight product categories, we estimate that 12% of our entire footprint relates to raw materials, and 58% on average comes from the use of our products. ‘Green’ IT We are working to reduce our energy consumption and carbon footprint by implementing an environmentally friendly approach to the use of IT hardware and systems. This includes evaluating IT equipment for energy efficiency, recyclability (including consumable parts such as printer cartridges) and delivery terms (including packaging). For our major data centres, we select outsourcing partners with clear commitments and policies to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. Tools such as video conferencing and instant messaging have been deployed to workstations, and web conferencing is available to help reduce business travel and minimise our carbon footprint. The new multifunction office copiers now in use in all L’Oréal sites in the Ile de France region provide state-of-the-art functionality, enabling us to monitor our use of consumables and reduce this where possible. The machines provide double-sided printing, better recyclability and improved accessibility for people with reduced mobility, with easy-to-use buttons and levers.

Over the past five years (2006-10), by challenging every single water use and optimising water systems, we have reduced water use per finished product by 16.5% and cut absolute consumption DATABANK by 7.6%. This is in the context of a 10.8% increase in production over the same period. WATER CONSUMPTION WATER QUALITY Water use Most of the water used in L’Oréal factories is for cleaning production equipment and packaging lines to maintain our strict hygiene standards. This represents approximately 44% of all water consumption in our industrial sites. To meet our targets, we are aiming to reduce the amount of water used for cleaning without affecting quality. This is a major challenge, because cleaning is a complex process that takes place in different ways, depending on the equipment used and the formulas involved. We have developed a new method called OptiCIP, which enables us to take into account site specifics such as equipment and type of product, then apply the most efficient cleaning processes in our factories. In 2010, several factories ran pilot projects (including Warsaw, Poland; Solon and Florence in the United States; and Vichy, France), with initial findings showing significant savings of 50% and more on certain types of equipment. Implementation plans are now in place, with the aim of standardising the OptiCIP method by 2015. Use of rainwater, Fapagau, France Around 80% of the water used at our Fapagau perfume factory in France is for sanitary purposes and cleaning. After conducting a feasibility study, taking into account local rainfall intensity and available roof surface, we installed three storage tanks (with a capacity of 70 m3) to collect rainwater. The use of rainwater has enabled the factory to reduce the use of drinking water by 30% compared to 2009, contributing to conservation of ground water. Improving the cleaning process, Settimo, Italy Our factory in Settimo doubled its mascara production in 2010. To avoid water and energy increasing in direct proportion, we transferred technology from the chemical industry and now use a component that breaks down the remaining mascara emulsion. This reduces the amount of water and energy used in cleaning the production vessels, improved the efficiency of the cleaning process and delivered ergonomic benefits. Applying simple ideas, Ormes, France Factory teams in Ormes have invented a practical solution to an everyday challenge by finding a new way to clean and change the hoses on tanks and filling machines without compromising strict hygiene standards. The idea is a simple yet effective ’sock’ inside the hose, which requires less water, steam and detergent for cleansing. Wastewater In 2010, COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) of wastewaster before treatment was reduced by 4%, which corresponds to 17.5kg COD per tonne of bulk produced. Approximately half of L’Oréal’s sites have on-site wastewater treatment plants. These use a range of methods including physical, chemical and biological processes, or other technologies adapted to different wastewater characteristics and local discharge conditions. The COD of wastewater after on-site treatment was reduced by 11.2% to 1.2g COD per finished product. With the aim of minimising overall energy use and solid waste production while maximising residual treatment efficiency, L’Oréal supports European research including a project with the University of Newcastle, UK, which is looking into energy efficiency in wastewater treatment. Transparency in water reporting: Carbon Disclosure Project In 2010, L’Oréal became a Founding Responder to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) water reporting initiative. The CDP is a leading, independent, not for profit organisation that promotes transparency in climate change reporting. In 2010, the CDP expanded its scope to include water reporting. L’Oréal has provided a report to the CDP on water management strategies, including water consumption, water discharge and other initiatives being carried out by the group.

WASTE TREATMENT 96% of our waste is re-used, recyled or recovered More than 50% of our sites send zero waste to landfill Waste including returnable packaging per finished product reduced by 7.4% compared with 2009. Types of waste Waste is defined as any material leaving L’Oréal sites, other than products, and we distinguish different types of waste in accordance with European regulations. These include transportable wastes (including cardboard, paper, plastic, dirty packaging, pallets, and residues from manufacturing), returnable packaging for transport that circulates between our suppliers and our sites, and exceptional waste such as construction debris. Waste reduction Our priority is to avoid generating waste at all, whether this is unnecessary packaging, or residues from wastewater treatment. This is key to greater resource efficiency and sustainability. In 2010, we reduced waste per finished product by 7.4%, by re-using pallets, more eco-efficient wrapping and packaging, and reducing obsolete products. Joint projects to reduce waste In our Active Cosmetics Division, a production steering group led by a director meets every month to monitor progress on waste management projects. By working with all interested parties including suppliers, the Division has reduced the volume of waste per finished product by 8%, while reducing the volume of returnable packaging per finished product by 17%. We are in the early stages of a groupwide project looking at tertiary packaging and preventing waste at source. Drawing on specialist knowledge from suppliers and eco-design consultancies as well as our packaging, sourcing, production and environmental teams, we will be developing and piloting new indicators to drive our waste management performance. We will also be developing guidelines to help our teams with design and purchasing decisions, including the choice between returnable packaging or recycled and recyclable materials.

These include eco-design SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS processes that harness green chemistry and biotechnology in TRANSPORT order to minimise environmental impacts. Chemistry is both a science and an industry. It has always involved transformations of materials that have been essential throughout human history. ‘Made in Chimex’ provides customers with the assurance that sustainability factors have been taken into account during product design and manufacture, using environmentally friendly technologies and a clear understanding of the environmental footprint of individual products and ingredients. Environmental footprinting As one example, Chimex has studied the environmental footprint of the active anti-aging ingredient Mexoryl OLS (see below), measuring water consumption, the location of raw materials, packaging, carbon footprint and other factors. The chart shows how Chimex has progressively reduced the ‘E-factor’ for the ingredient Mexoryl since 2008 by using specialised processes – in this case, the volume of waste generated (kg per finished product). 'Made in Chimex' means understanding and addressing the footprint of an ingredient at each stage of the process. Research partnerships Chimex has developed research partnerships with a wide range of external organisations including CNRS, the Institute for Research on Catalysis and the Environment (IRCE), and the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Industries Chimiques (ENSIC) to further develop the ‘eco-design’ concept and it's application to environmental technology. Such partnerships are helping to develop more fuelefficient processes – for example, the replacement of conventional chemistry with bio-conversion. Benchmarking performance Chimex is working with leading corporate responsibility rating agency Vigéo to build a profile of its environmental and social performance. This profile enables Chimex to benchmark its performance within the industry and to examine its sustainability performance across interlinked and often complex issues. Engaging with sustainable development “By voluntarily evaluating its social and environmental performance, Chimex shows its commitment to placing corporate responsibility at the heart of its business strategy. The results obtained using our methodology demonstrate a convincing level of engagement with sustainable development, as represented by ‘Made in Chimex’.” Samuel Dufay, director, Vigéo Following the positive results achieved in this evaluation, Chimex is aiming for certification to the LUCIE standard in 2011. This standard, created by Qualité France Association and Vigéo, is based on the new ISO 20006 standard for social responsibility.

SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS Despite being a low volume purchaser, in 2008 we committed to playing our part in the protection of TRANSPORT biodiversity and forest ecosystems by sourcing all our palm oil from sustainable plantations. Since January 2010, 100% of our palm oil comes from sustainable, well managed plantations which have been certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). RSPO, of which WWF is a founding member, is a not for profit association of international stakeholders from across the palm oil industry. RSPO was formed to: Develop principles and criteria to ensure that palm oil production is economically viable, environmentally appropriate and socially beneficial Promote plantation management practices Improve land use planning processes for the development of new oil palm plantations Improve risk analysis and decision-making tools for banks and investors on palm oil development Investigate different chain of custody approaches, to create links between the oil palm plantations and the consumer. While recognising that as a small purchaser of palm oil we have a limited influence in this area, in 2010 we took our commitment a step further by joining the Derivatives Coalition Working Group, which is exploring a range of alternative, sustainable raw materials. In 2009, L’Oréal was recognised by WWF as one of the ten most responsible companies using this ingredient. A pioneering community fair trade programme Through its Community Fair Trade programme, The Body Shop sources the highest quality ingredients from 14 countries around the world.

Asia Pacific In November 2010, L’Oréal Asia Pacific invited more than 350 delegates, representing 140 companies – including suppliers of raw materials, packaging and industrial equipment, as well as most of our subcontractors in the region – to a supplier event in Hong Kong. The main objectives were to share L’Oréal’s vision in Asia for the next decade and to reward 12 suppliers for their recent outstanding contributions. In China, we organised four supplier seminars on compliance with RPP950 and REACh regulations on the use of chemicals. These sessions, funded entirely by L’Oréal, were held at supplier sites and involved Intertek, SGS and other accredited third parties. All of L’Oréal’s worldwide suppliers have now signed the RPP950 Commitment Letter, which outlines the banning of PVC. L’Oréal Nihon Purchasing also invited its point of sale and promotional suppliers and internal stakeholders to share L’Oréal’s group Policy. There was a special emphasis on social responsibility, and our consultants SGS gave our suppliers an overview of performance assessments and compliance with national standards, Chinese legal regulations and our Social Audit process. Engaging globally L’Oréal purchasing teams regularly take part in roundtable discussions with our suppliers of point of sale materials, through POPAI, the global association of retail marketing companies. Recent events have explored fair trade, ethics, design rights, and supplier relations. We also engage with our suppliers on the standards expected by L’Oréal, supplier selection, and the importance of meeting ethical and environmental standards in order to maintaining a successful, sustainable relationship with L’Oréal over the long term. Small, minority and women-owned suppliers Our purchasing of point of sale and promotional materials has recently been centralised across Europe and for some worldwide projects. We still maintain relationships with our small local suppliers, many of whom have more than ten years’ history with L’Oréal. In Russia, for example, 15 suppliers have been on our supplier list for the last 15 years. In the United States, our total spend on small, minority and women-owned suppliers for 2010 rose by 2.3% to $58,372m (up from $57,040m in 2009).

We are revising the assessment categories used during audits, so that it is clear when immediate action or continuous improvement is needed, depending on the type of compliance issue involved. When these developments have been completed, we will communicate our approach to our suppliers and aim to provide a Suppliers’ Principles Guide for publication in 2011. Child labour We want to help end the exploitation of children in the workplace and we actively seek out and favour business partners who share our values and our ethical commitments. In 2010, L’Oréal communicated a specific policy on child labour to suppliers.

L’Oréal Russia has stopped using PVC in its point of sale and promotional material. Promotional campaigns for Garnier and Vichy sun protection products used cardboard point of sale displays instead of metal, and identified clear savings in materials, water and CO2 emissions. L’Oréal Uruguay has harmonised the size of brochures and banners to reduce the amount of paper needed. All the point of sale materials for Série Nature are locally designed and produced on recycled paper. We are working with manufacturers in China and Indonesia to reduce the paper used to manufacture our paper bags and increase the proportion of recycled materials. In Japan, we only use Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper for point of sale printed materials and our point of sale displays use recycled materials for multiple use. Green purchasing initiatives in Taiwan include replacing PVC with PET, sourcing wood from well managed forests for our boutiques, and surveying suppliers about their use of FSC-certified materials. L’Oréal USA has successfully redesigned and standardised the pallets used to transport promotional merchandising. These are now made from recycled materials, and in three months, we have used 38% fewer pallets, saving the equivalent of 227 trees, and CO2 emissions from nine cars.

Recycled glass for Garnier, Biotherm and Vichy jars A joint development project with the company Gerresheimer has led to the production of recycled glass containers for Garnier, Vichy and Biotherm brands. It is a real technical breakthrough: recycled glass (using broken glass, called ‘cullet’) with the same good looks and clarity as non-recycled, sourced from mineral water bottles which are processed using new technology. The result is high quality glass containers and reduced environmental impact. The energy needed to melt the cullet in special ovens is less than that needed to transform sand and silica into glass – meaning 20% less CO2 compared to a conventional forge.

L’Oréal Paris provided them with a carbon calculator tool and expert training to help realise the new vision for POS displays – reducing the quantities of materials used, considering the use of low-carbon alternative materials and reducing the amount of electricity used by displays in store. Alexandre Baquet, Director of Merchandising for L’Oréal Paris, said: “The process of measuring our carbon footprint has helped us to identify our priorities for improvements in the materials we use and lighting. Since 2007, we’ve been making significant progress in reducing the electricity usage of our displays, but in 2009 we really broke the mould in terms of how we approach the issue. “While maintaining the high quality of our displays, we reduced the thickness of the materials, changed the displays to incorporate wood and optimised the lighting in order to reduce the total number of bulbs used. There was an immediate impact on the volume and weight of materials used and electricity consumption. “Contrary to received wisdom, reducing the environmental impact of our displays has also reduced our costs and stimulated innovation – the environmental impact has been improved while the unit price cost has lowered.” 2010: PEARL – reducing our carbon footprint by 46% In 2010, L’Oréal Paris redesigned its PEARL make-up display cabinet to achieve the following results: The back of the display cabinet, which was previously made of metal, has been replaced with wood. The total amount of metal used in the cabinet has been reduced by 50% The plastic drawers have been redesigned, and are now 50% thinner, without harming the aesthetics the unit now uses low-energy lamps, which have been repositioned to enable a 50% reduction in the number of bulbs needed without reducing brightness. These changes have reduced the total carbon footprint of the display unit by 46%, reduced the cost per unit by 20%, and reduced in-store energy consumption by 50%. Shafik Asal, co-founder of the ECO2 Initiative, commented: “Point of sale displays are made by sub-contractors and installed on third-party premises. As part of the design process, it’s necessary to bring together a complex chain of buyers and suppliers, in which there may appear to be conflicting interests. However, by taking an intelligent approach to eco-design, it’s possible to add both economic and environmental value.” Next steps: the POS of 2020 and end-of-life strategies L’Oréal Paris is using the extremely positive results from the PEARL project and applying a similar eco-design approach to all new point-of-sale products to be developed in coming years. This approach will help L’Oréal Paris to achieve its goal of ‘Factor 4’: to reduce the carbon footprint of all POS displays by 75% by 2050. To achieve this, it is important to look at optimising material usage and electricity consumption, but equally to consider making longer-lasting POS displays which can be recovered at the end of their life, remanufactured and reused in future models.

On top of such certification, our construction and renovation projects must meet our equivalent internal standards, detailed in a comprehensive guide. These govern the choice of locations, approaches to reducing energy consumption, use of green energy or renewable energies, water harvesting, use of renewable building materials, the quality and comfort of the interior spaces, and innovation.

The previous programme has been completed by two main objectives: to improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings (including reducing waste, recycling energy and improving systems); and to ensure air quality in indoor workspaces. In 2010, 17 plants were audited (out of a total of 38). This approach will be extended to all L’Oréal-owned administrative centres and research campuses worldwide. The audit programme is helping to consolidate a map of energy consumption across all L’Oreal buildings, so that we can develop action plans to reduce energy use and maximise energy recovery.

This allows each production site to be more PACKAGING responsive and more efficient in terms of logistics and SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS transport. TRANSPORT While the cosmetics industry is not, relatively speaking, a significant emitter of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), transport still contributes to L’Oréal’s overall carbon footprint. L’Oréal’s logistics network sees over four billion products a year move from factories to distribution centres to our customers all over the world. New carbon reduction initiatives in 2010 With 58% of L’Oréal’s transport use by road, where feasible our logistics operations use ‘greener’ forms of transport that still enable us to meet required lead times and costs. In 2010, we have focused on different methods and various modes of transport with lower GHG emissions: Electric vehicles In our efforts to find a solution for making deliveries in major cities, L’Oréal’s Luxury Products division in France makes deliveries to Parisian clients in MODEC electric vehicles. This saves 12 tonnes of CO2 a year. Our work with GEFCO, a leader in logistics, combined with our experience using our first three electric lorries, have led to us using a fully electric vehicle which offers the same performance as our fuel vehicles. We are looking to increase the percentage of electric vehicle deliveries within bigger cities. We are currently running a feasibility study which will allow us to develop a long term strategy for deliveries on a more international scale. Transport between sites Following the reorganisation of our logistics network when L’Oréal acquired Yves Saint Laurent, the Luxury Products Division reorganised the distribution of goods between our sites in the north of France. L’Oréal used vehicles with the latest energy saving features such as more efficient motors and tyres, which have resulted in a 28% saving in fuel consumption. In Latin America, a greater number of road routes have been replaced with rail routes for transporting maritime containers from our factory in Mexico to the Veracruz port. Additionally, the Consumer Products division has increased its use of rail transport from their factory in Rambouillet so that rail now accounts for 20% of tonnes transported per km. Transport suppliers L’Oréal has introduced two new criteria in selecting carriers and transport suppliers: a sustainability questionnaire and a sustainability indicator in the score cards used in the selection process. Reducing airfreight miles in New Zealand L’Oreal’s distribution centre is located in Auckland, at the top of North Island, where the majority of New Zealand’s population is concentrated. It is a three hour ferry journey or 1200 km (two days by road) from the main cities of South Island. Our Professional Products Division used to air freight all products to our South Island customers to meet 24 hour or less delivery times. Analysis of our CO2 emissions showed that 71% of the total New Zealand emissions due to freight arose from delivery to customers in the South Island, which represent less than 10% of the group's New Zealand business. Wanting to balance our environmental responsibilities with customer care, we decided to seek feedback from our customers before deciding on a course of action. All the hair salons we consulted expressed their willingness for us to deliver by road (48 hours) rather than by air (24 hours), if this reduced CO2 emissions. As a result, with the co-operation of our customers, L’Oréal reduced its transport CO2 emissions by 68% in New Zealand. Measuring transport GHGs Carbon footprint measurement is complex and wide ranging, not least of all in our logistics operations. To ensure that we can calculate and report carbon emissions indicators (including Tonne/Km and CO2 /Stock Keeping Unit) associated with our distribution network, we have adopted and are piloting a reporting tool and carbon footprinting methodology validated by ADEME, the French official body overseeing sustainability, which is compliant with the GHG International Protocol and supported by the WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development). Starting from shipment characteristics (weight, volume, number of parcels), the tool maps the transport journey, including types of transport, and will help us with decision making around choices of transport and packaging reduction strategies. It measures CO2 emissions related to transport made (ie controlled and paid) by L’Oreal, including . emissions linked to vehicle manufacturing; extraction, transport and transformation for liquid fuels; and combustion. The tool is currently being refined and trialled in our logistics operations in Asia, and when fully implemented across the group, it will enable L’Oréal to determine more precisely the level of CO2 emitted from transport operations. We will then be able to more accurately calculate the total footprint of our products and seek improvements in carbon emissions and achieve greater operational and cost efficiency. In 2010, L’Oréal reports an estimated 2,239,128 Ktonnes, representing an increase of 2.6% compared to 2009. (Ktonnes = one thousand tonnes transported per km). New car fleet policy in Russia By working with Volkswagen, L’Oréal in Russia has also reduced the environmental impact of its car fleet. By changing the class of engines available, from Euro 3/Euro 4 to Euro 4/Euro 5, CO2 emissions have been reduced by 7% compared to 2009 and fuel consumption will decrease from 8 litres per km to 6 litres per km. Greener miles between France and Italy Thanks to a multi-mode transport strategy operating between L’Oréal’s factory in Rambouillet, France and Calvignasco, Italy, carbon emissions have been cut by 90% and transport costs reduced by 15%, through the combined use of rail and road.

PRODUCT ACCESSIBILITY CORPORATE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY RESPONSIBILITY L’Oréal’s growth ambition is to double our consumer base and make our products available to one billion new consumers by 2020 in markets around the world. Companies cannot meet the challenge of sustainable consumption alone. We must involve and engage our consumers, who have a major role to play. Corporate Consumer Responsibility (CCR) L’Oréal’s comprehensive CCR vision formalises our ‘contract’ with consumers, puts them at the heart of everything we do and sets out seven key commitments that reinforce trust in our brands. This trust is essential to engaging with our consumers, meeting their beauty needs through sustainable products, and encouraging positive behaviours. Garnier: a history of engaging with consumers After carrying out research which showed that only a small percentage of French consumers recycle product packaging in the bathroom, Garnier launched a practical and original solution in 2010, in partnership with sustainable packaging experts Eco-Emballages, to help spur people into action to consume responsibly. The result of Garnier’s initiative is a specially designed, recycling container for the bathroom, available free of charge. It has two compartments so that people can sort and carry items more easily from the bathroom to recycling, and avoid end-of-life packaging from going to landfill. Garnier’s campaign has raised awareness among consumers, and a significant percentage of calls to L’Oréal’s customer advisers are requests for the container. In 2010, 15,000 were distributed free to consumers and Garnier widely promotes the offer on its website. Labelling on Garnier products (including the Fructis range) reminds customers of the need to recycle and provides clear information on the product’s footprint – the result of extensive studies into environmental impacts throughout the life cycle. Luxury, new markets and sustainability There are close parallels between sustainability and luxury. Both respond to key human aspirations including the desire for genuine origins and shared social identity. Growth economies, with increasing high net worth individuals, aspire to authentic luxury and to sustainable growth. L’Oréal takes these fundamental legitimate calls into account with its own strategic objectives in new markets, recognising both the aspirations of consumers for a luxury born out of their own cultural sources rather than Western representations and also the challenges of sustainable consumption. L’Oréal is the first cosmetics company to assess its sustainability approach in a transparent way, by publishing a Sustainable Development Report specific to L’Oréal China. In our Luxury Products division, Giorgio Armani skincare and make-up are increasingly the preferred choices among Asian consumers. Anti-ageing serum Crema Nera Extrema is one of the biggest successes, helping to increase sales of the brand sales by 76.7% in China.

PRODUCT ACCESSIBILITY RESPONSIBLE PRODUCT SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS L’Oréal’s seven Corporate Consumer Responsibility commitments are the basis for engaging with our consumers, sharing a vision of responsible, sustainable consumption then acting together to achieve it. 1. Innovative products and product efficacy For L’Oréal, innovation and product efficacy go hand in hand, demonstrated through scientific and clinical proof. However, the quality of a shampoo mousse, for example, is perceived very differently by different cultures. For this reason, innovation at L’Oréal combines our research into diverse beauty customs and preferences with robust scientific knowledge and increasing use of green chemistry principles. Youth Code by L’Oréal Paris is a range of new anti-ageing products and the result of pioneering research in the science of genes. 2. Product safety Irreproachable product safety is at the heart of every L’Oréal brand. We test our products rigorously and continually explore new techniques such as predictive research methods, which exploit scientific breakthroughs. Read more about these approaches in the Innovation section. 3. Sustainable marketing According to Mintel research, consumers check whether packaging can be recycled after purchase, and that this is a motivation in future decisions to buy the same product. Our packaging and point of sale programme is a strategic priority, focused on recyclability, responsible sourcing of materials, weight and volume reductions, and use of recycled and renewable materials. More than 90% of the wood fibre sourced for our packaging comes from certified sustainable sources and 700 of our products carry the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) logo. Read more about packaging in the Production section. 4. Responsible advertising We ensure that our advertising and promotional material is based on proven performance and scientific data, and that the information we provide is readily understandable by consumers. We adopted the French Union of Advertisers’ (UDA) Charter in 2007 and once again report the actions we have taken. 5. Transparency and care We aim to provide the best advice, support and education to our consumers. L’Oréal has 357 specialist Consumer Advisers in 54 countries where we have a subsidiary. 6. Availability of our products L’Oréal aims to make its products as widely available as possible. Read more in Product accessibility. 7. Sharing best practice with industry and stakeholders We participate in industry groups and engage with consumer organisations, listening to concerns and taking action when needed.

The Body Shop Global customer research commissioned by The Body Shop among 15,000 people in 21 markets confirmed the growing demand for natural and organic products, also showing the move towards personal and collective responsibility. 2010 launches by The Body Shop included Dreams Unlimited™, a new fragrance inspired by the personality and beliefs of the brand’s founder, Dame Anita Roddick. Garnier launches Bio Active After four years of research, we launched Garnier Bio Active in 2010 – our first certified organic anti-wrinkle skincare. The products contain 95% ingredients of natural origin, and up to 20% organic ingredients, including samphire with anti-ageing properties. Garnier Bio Active is designed using an ecoresponsible approach at each stage of its development. Our production plants are ISO 14001 certified and our European factories are also Ecocert* certified to manufacture our organic products. Sound energy management at our plants has resulted in reduced water consumption, reduced energy and carbon emissions, and 99% of waste is recycled. Bio Active packaging has been developed taking into account the environmental impact throughout the life cycle, for example, the boxes contain over 90% recycled fibre and the cardboard is FSC certified. *Ecocert is an independent certification accredited by the government guaranteeing a strict traceability for natural and organic cosmetics.

MORE IN THIS REPORT... PRODUCT ACCESSIBILITY These engagements involved a wide range of stakeholders and organisations representing RESPONSIBLE PRODUCT SAFETY consumers and public authorities: COMMUNICATIONS At the European Business Summit held in June 2010, in Brussels, L’Oréal led a panel which included Commissioner John Dalli and Madame Monique Goyens, Director General of BEUC, the European Consumers Organisation. Corporate responsibility and consumer engagement were also discussed at the French industry association MEDEF, which aims to share good practices, particularly among small and medium enterprises. L’Oréal is actively engaged in projects with the French National Consumer Council (CNC), which are bringing together business, consumer associations and public authorities under the leadership of the Secretary of State for Consumer Affairs. In 2010, CNC unanimously adopted three guidelines around the management of personal customer data, the provision of information for consumers related to nanotechnology in consumer goods, and environmental information on products. L’Oréal is also actively engaged in a dialogue with consumer associations and NGOs on the topic of responsible communications. Sustainability makes brands more ‘meaningful’ for consumers In the second annual Brand Sustainable Futures report, corporate sustainability is closely linked to brand ‘meaningfulness’. The survey, which was conducted with 30,000 consumers in nine countries, indicates that the more sustainable the brand is perceived to be, the more meaningful and trusted it becomes in the mind of consumers. L'Oréal Paris was one of the most-improved companies in the survey compared to 2009, based on the survey score, which assesses the sustainable health of brands over time. The survey reveals that social issues and sustainability still rank as major concerns among consumers worldwide. Furthermore the onus for action rests firmly with companies, with a significant 80% of consumers expecting business to act responsibly. Also, an increasing majority (76%, up from 70% in 2009) place the responsibility for environmental and social issues on business rather than governments. Despite this, only 29% believe that brands are really working hard to resolve sustainability issues, and while 86% of consumers consider sustainability aspects when shopping, over half do not do so systematically or often. The survey authors believe that this gap between intent and reality can be addressed by companies and brands who adopt clear and engaging communications, offer greater product incentives (such as price), and make their products widely available and accessible, which are all cited as key barriers to responsible consumption.

Kiehl’s efforts to encourage recycling and upcycling Among the measures taken by Kiehl’s in 2010, the brand partnered with a manufacturer of ecofriendly materials to encourage customers to not only recycle their used Kiehl’s bottles but to think about the inventive ways they can upcycle waste. Leading by example, Kiehl’s iconic Lab Coat, which has been worn by Kiehl’s Customer Representatives since the brand's early days – is now to be made from Bionic® Yarn fabric, made with fibres derived from plastic bottles. Each of the new Lab Coats is constructed from 10 plastic bottles, and bottles recycled at Kiehl’s will go towards this and other new, functional items. Kiehl’s also offered its customers an excusively designed, limited edition eco-tote bag manufactured from Bionic® Yarn, and customers participating in the Recycle and Be Rewarded programme will be eligible to receive the tote bag free of charge.

We also uphold the principles in a number of other codes on a global basis in all our advertising. UDA Charter on Responsible Communication The UDA (French Union of Advertisers) Charter on Responsible Communication covers responsible communications and marketing, consumer privacy and social and environmental impacts. Since 2007, L’Oréal has been a signatory to the Charter’s five commitments and every year we report our progress against these. International Code of Advertising Practice We recognise the International Chamber of Commerce’s International Code of Advertising Practice as the principal global guidance on responsible advertising, and fully support its principles and implementation. Charter for Voluntary Engagement on Body Image L’Oréal also fully supports the French Government’s Charter for Voluntary Engagement on Body Image (Charte d’engagement volontaire sur l’image du corps). Product performance and advertising When making claims for product performance, we use a rigorous scientific approach and sophisticated measurement techniques. As protocols can vary between countries, L’Oréal must constantly ensure that local requirements are fully considered. Upholding the standards All marketing directors in two of our divisions – and nearly three-quarters of their agencies – have received training in responsible advertising principles. These are set out in our Code of Business Ethics, the UDA Charter and other international codes. Contact with our consumers In 2010, we handled well over 1.5 million post-sale contacts.

Accessible innovation L’Oréal’s strategy is to reach new consumers by making our brands as widely accessible as possible. This involves paying careful attention to positioning products at the right price, which is not a synonym for ‘at a low price’, nor does it come ‘at any price’. Our commitment to product accessibility and suitability for consumers in different parts of the world (for example, offering products in tubes rather than bottles, or in smaller-format containers and sachets) goes hand in hand with our commitment to performance, safety, and respect for people and the environment. As part of packaging eco-design, we carefully evaluate any environmental impacts of smaller formats, such as the potential increase in packaging material per volume of product. Garnier offers mini-formats and mini-pricing adapted to the needs of consumers in South East Asian markets, including Garnier Light sachets in Thailand and Fructis shampoo sachets in India. Increasing accessibility In 2010, L’Oréal brands continued to offer accessible innovation to consumers. From our Consumer Products Division, Elseve Hydra Max shampoo by L’Oréal Paris, Caffeine Anti-dark Circles 2-in-1 Eye Roll-on from Garnier, and The Volum’ Express Falsies Mascara from Maybelline New York, are all available at prices to reach the widest number of consumers. L’Oréal Triple Active and Garnier Essentials have also gone from strength to strength, especially among young Asian consumers. The Body Shop effectively doubled its brand presence in India in 2010, and now has 55 stores in 23 cities. The brand’s naturally inspired, 100% vegetarian products offered at a price that is accessible to millions of people, together with its natural and ethical beauty values, resonate with Indian customers. A hair salon for everyone An accessible hair salon in Grenoble is the first of its kind in France. L’Oréal Professional provided half of the funding needed to create a salon fully adapted to the needs of all customers. It is equipped with audio loops, information in braille, wide-opening automatic doors, a ramp, adjustable chairs and sensory and tactile features. Making products more accessible for visually impaired people Approximately 4% of the world’s population have some visual impairment.

DIVERSITY TIMELINE CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS (PDF) Diversity initiatives As part of sharing and promoting good practice, and to highlight concrete actions taken by our brands and businesses across the group, we celebrated the second year of our awards for disability initiatives (‘Initiatives pour le Handicap’) in November 2010. Our Professional Products Division was recognised with the ‘Grand Prix’ award for its partnership project with France’s National Institute for Deaf Youth, designed to assist 20 hearing impaired young people to access training and opportunities in hairdressing. The award also recognised the division’s work in creating the country’s first fully accessible hairdressing salon in Grenoble. In Saiwai, Japan, our brand new labelling plant (which opened in October 2010), has also taken up the challenge by ensuring that its facilities are accessible and by employing a majority of differently abled people. The goal is to provide opportunities to perform well in an inclusive and supportive work environment. As a founding member of the association ARPEJÉH (Assisting the Pursuit of Study Projects Undertaken by Young Disabled Pupils and Students), L’Oréal also invites young disabled students to attend discovery and immersion sessions within the business world. In 2009, we welcomed 11 disabled students for work experience. Gender diversity Committed to equal opportunities in the workplace for many years, L’Oréal seeks to guarantee gender balance in functions that are currently predominantly staffed by men or women, equality in terms of salary and training, and access for women to positions of responsibility. We signed a corporate agreement on Professional Gender Equality with all Trade Union organisations in France in 2008. At the European level, L’Oréal is co-founder of the Arborus endowment fund created in early 2010 to promote and integrate professional gender equality on a pan-European basis. The group took part in the creation of the first Gender Equality European Standard, initiated by Arborus with the support of the European Commission. At an international level, L’Oréal participated in the creation of the first international certification for gender equality, initiated by Swiss Foundation the Gender Equality Project, in partnership with the World Economic Forum. To proactively promote gender diversity, L’Oréal created the first Company Parent-Friendly Charter in 2008 in France with SOS Préma (a national parent support association) and sponsored by the Ministry of Labour. The initiative, in line with gender equality in the workplace, highlights our determination to encourage a work environment where working parents can better manage their professional and personal lives. Moreover, in 2010 several L’Oréal subsidiaries offer access to day care centres. In 2002, L’Oréal Canada launched the L’Oréal Kids Care Centre which provides 36 places for L’Oréal employees’ children. Since 2008, L’Oréal Germany’s Day Care Centre provides space for 18 kids. In France, at the end of 2010, 87 places were available in the five multi-company day care centres that have been established near to L’Oréal. In addition, by the end of 2010, a multi-company recreational centre run by Filapi, will host 17 children (from age three upwards) on Wednesdays and during school holidays. In addition, we wanted to address salary discrepancies between men and women and we have progressed significantly over the past two years. The gap is around than 3% in France.

In 2010, we produced our first Diversity Overview Report, which includes over a hundred indicators. Dedicated to our employees, partners and other key stakeholders, this report is a basis not only for managing our policy, but also for dialogue with all those concerned. Our Diversity Overview Report achieved a Grand Prix award at the 6th International Diversity Forum. For 2011, the objective is to create our first international Diversity Overview Report.

Employee feedback We place great importance on open communication with our employees. We are keen to hear their views on L’Oréal and on issues that affect them. L’Oréal has carried out a global employee opinion survey (‘Pulse’) since 2003. The last survey covered 28,000 employees in 28 countries and 150 taskforces are now turning the ideas generated into action around the business. These include time-management guidance, car-sharing schemes and individual ‘Training Passports’, along with many other initiatives. The survey will be repeated in 2011 and 2012 across the group. Fostering labour relations France: Labour relations at L’Oréal are based on mutual trust and respect. In France, there are 96 bodies representing the views and interests of our employees. These have 603 employee representatives and cover 1,183 areas of interest. Our employees have access to a wide range of forums and representation, including works councils and committees, union representatives, occupational health and safety committees, and the group committee. There are also informal forums for social dialogue (known as RIEDS in France). In France, L’Oréal has signed 25 internal agreements. (If the same agreement is signed by several different sites or legal entities in a given country, it is considered as a single agreement). Other regions: In the rest of the world, the group has 937 employee representatives in 66 subsidiaries. Dialogue at European level Through L’Oréal’s agreement with the French and European trade unions FECCIA and EMCEF, we established (in 1996) our European Works Council: Instance Européenne de Dialogue Social (IEDS/EWC). The agreement has been regularly updated, and in 2009 we introduced a new consultation procedure which applies to transnational projects involving local consultation procedures in at least two countries. This procedure allows for the possibility of an opinion from the EWC and is being implemented, according to the geographical and strategic dimension of the project, with the Liaison Secretariat and extended to include members of the countries concerned, or with the entire EWC. This revision represents an important advance which aims to reinforce social dialogue at L’Oréal while remaining a step ahead of legislation. The IEDS/EWC informs discussions and formal meetings about our current situation and future prospects with IEDS representatives. It has 30 members from the European countries that are part of the European Economic Area with more than 145 employees. The members receive regular training on economic and labour related issues. Today, the IEDS covers more than 30,000 employees and 26 countries, of which 16 are directly represented.

OTHER DIVERSITY INDICATORS Sharing knowledge, culture and values worldwide Our Learning and Development strategy reflects the many different ways of learning through a mix of formal and informal methods. While we believe in sharing knowledge and ‘learning by doing’, we have captured some of our internal knowledge or “savoir faire”, and created on the job learning cards to help employees to develop their skills on a daily basis. To share our culture with all of our employees, even in the furthest countries, we also launched two e-learning modules in 2010: ‘I-Discovery’ – an interactive module for new joiners to discover our brands, our strategy and organisation, everywhere in the world ‘Keys to L'Oreal’ – a module, available in nine languages, which explains and shares the group's specific values on matters such as decision making or innovation. Our Learning for Development teams have also developed new interactive e-learning resources that capture and share specific expertise in different departments. For example, in the Research & Innovation department, one of these resources allows people to identify the colour, shape and chemical components of hair fibres, while another helps researchers to understand all stages of product development and the role of teams at each stage. As another example, in 2010, the Consumer Products Division launched an e-programme for Category Management Certification, which allows new Category Managers to gain theoretical and practical skills. The programme includes case studies and webinars with Category Management experts sharing their experiences. It is delivered by the Category Management Knowledge Group, a global leader in Category Management training. After successfully completing the programme, the participants receive a Category Management Certificate. Engaging employees in sustainability As we seek to embed sustainability in our daily activities, we engage with our employees to increase their awareness. As well as learning, they can develop their skills by getting involved in volunteering activities in the communities where we work. Volunteers from L’Oréal USA worked at the Passaic River Park, Berkeley Heights, as part of our annual Employee Volunteer Day 2010. They removed an estimated ton of invasive plant species, repaired deer netting, picked up trash, spread wood chips and restored paths. Read more about our volunteering in Communities.

Developing leaders Our management training programmes provide us with a talent pipeline. We maintained the number of our management trainees throughout the economic crisis, because L’Oréal always takes a long-term view. Economic growth allowed us to drive forward our ‘Pépinière’ management trainee scheme, which grew by 35% in 2010, and even doubled in some regions. We are proactively building our recruitment plans for experienced candidates, to cater for our two to three year leadership needs, including the recruitment of senior proven talent to enrich and diversify our management pools. In 2010, we also created a new regional function called Talent Sourcing Director to spot potential managers and ensure the group has a strong enough pool of talent to meet our business growth ambitions.

The OTHER DIVERSITY INDICATORS compensation package is determined by the position, competencies, performance and potential of each individual. In most of the countries in which we work, the salaries we pay to our employees are considerably higher than the legal minimum wage (on a national or sector level, and taking into account collective agreements). For example in Argentina, the minimum salary paid by L’Oréal is 96% higher than the minimum salary fixed at national level. This is also the case in China, where the minimum salary paid by L’Oréal is 82% higher than the minimum salary fixed at national level. Profit sharing L’Oréal believes that all our employees should share in the success they have helped to achieve. An annual bonus rewards performance, strengthens employees’ sense of belonging and increases motivation. Employee profit-sharing totalled €185 million in 2010. Employee benefits L’Oréal offers benefits packages, which vary according to local practices and regulations, to enhance the wellbeing of employees and their families. L’Oréal has an International Benefits Steering Committee to ensure coverage is offered consistently to all our employees. It has drafted a charter for a safe and long lasting investment of the assets allocated to pension programmes, which must be applied by all subsidiaries. In 2010, we continued to review our pension programmes around the world and implemented new programmes in Chile and Pakistan. We also improved the existing programme in Poland.

REPORT OF THE L’ORÉAL We are active in areas in which we can make the greatest contribution, and which reflect our FOUNDATION purpose and values: PHILANTHROPY REPORT 2010 Promotion of scientific research, particularly through the L’Oréal-UNESCO ‘For Women in Science’ programme, a joint initiative with UNESCO, now running for 13 years, and extending to 103 countries Restoring appearance, which is a recognised factor in building self-esteem and social wellbeing. The restorative surgery programme Opération Sourire, carried out with Médecins du Monde, illustrates this, as does the donation of personal care and beauty products by group brands Education and occupational integration, particularly in the beauty professions. In 2010, L’Oréal invested €32.6 million in both large-scale international projects and hundreds of initiatives throughout the world. This represents an increase of more than 17% compared to 2009, and comprises €8.6 million from the L’Oréal Foundation (€6.1 million according to London Benchmarking Group methodology), €16.1 million in corporate donations, and €16.5 million from the group brands. Highlights of 2010 2010 saw existing programmes developed and extended internationally, as well as several new partnerships initiated. L’Oréal-UNESCO ‘For Women in Science’ expanded further with the launch of the first panArab and pan-African regional awards. These ten scholarships have been created to encourage young researchers in areas of the world where L'Oreal is not present. Following the success of the first scholarships, the intention is to double the number of scholarships awarded in 2011.

Science, solidarity, education Its key role is to strengthen and maintain the company’s commitment to social responsibility, while reflecting L’Oréal’s values of scientific research, the transmission of knowledge, diversity and respect for others. The Foundation is committed to three main goals: Promoting scientific research and the role of women in science Helping people made vulnerable because of a change in their appearance to regain their self-esteem and self-confidence Facilitating access to education and occupational integration. Philanthropy with purpose Since its inception, the Foundation has engaged in projects that reflect L’Oréal’s values. Working with partners around the world, it has developed some of the group’s major social programmes, such as L’Oréal-UNESCO ‘For Women in Science‘, and L’Oréal-UNESCO ‘Hairdressers Against AIDS’, while also continuing to support the life-changing work of Opération Sourire. In the framework of the Beauty from the Heart programme, the Foundation supports free skincare and make-up workshops for women with cancer, teenagers suffering from psychiatric troubles, and socially excluded people. The Foundation also distributes Group brand products to people suffering from exclusion, violence or poverty. Be proud, get involved, have fun To mark the group’s centenary in 2010, employees from all around the world took part in the first ever L’Oréal Citizen Day. This internal event was designed to involve as many employees as possible in the group’s many solidarity projects around the world, inviting them to take part in fundraising challenges and discovery programmes supported by the Foundation.

This recognition helps to redress the fact that only 16 of the 546 Nobel Prizes awarded for science have gone to women. Fellowships Since 2000, L’Oréal-UNESCO ‘For Women in Science’ has awarded research fellowships to support young women in the pursuit of scientific careers. Each year, 15 International Fellowships are awarded to young women whose projects have been accepted by leading research institutions outside their country of origin. Dozens of L’Oréal National Fellowships are awarded each year to young women doing research in their home country. The L’Oréal-UNESCO ‘For Women in Science’ regional programme, launched in 2010, awards Fellowships to encourage young women pursuing research careers in countries where L’Oréal does not have a presence. In 2010, Fellowships were awarded to women from countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and countries in the Pan-Arab region (United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Tunisia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia). Agora – ‘For Women in Science’ community Agora is an online platform dedicated to the exchange of ideas and is an integral part of L’OréalUNESCO ‘For Women in Science’. It has become an important meeting place where members can talk about their scientific research, the role of women in science, their education and careers, and the global development of the programme. For more information, visit the Agora For Women in Science Community website. The L’Oréal Foundation, in partnership with Science Magazine, also published two booklets focused on women pursuing successful careers in science. The 2010 booklets focused on women undertaking research in biology and the green sciences.

I am proud of the fact that the GEOGRAPHICAL REGION ‘Hairdressers Against AIDS’ programme has reached 1.3 million hairdressers. In exchanging a few important words with their clients, every hairdresser can help to prevent the spread of this disease.” EXTERNAL LINKS... Nicolas Hieronimus, Worldwide President, L’Oréal Professional Products HAIRDRESSERS AGAINST AIDS Division ‘Use Your Voice, Use Your Power’ As well as providing a professional service, a hairdresser is often a confidante too, talking to customers about how they feel, their hopes and their worries. As a trusting relationship develops, the hairdresser’s rapport with their customers, and their ability to communicate with them, becomes a highly effective way of relaying information about issues such as HIV/AIDS and its prevention. L’Oréal first recognised the power of the hairdresser’s social role when it launched the programme in 2001. Four years later, in 2005, the L’Oréal Foundation formed a partnership with UNESCO to further promote HIV/AIDS awareness among the global hairdressing community. The programme is also rooted in a general philosophy at L’Oréal of promoting health and hygiene. The educational network of the L’Oréal Professional Products Division has been the driving force behind the initiative and now more than 5,000 trainers are working on the programme. Over 1.3 million hairdressers worldwide have taken advantage of a bespoke HIV/AIDS training module, introduced as part of L’Oréal’s hairdressers’ curriculum. The module includes information about the risks of the disease and protection against it, as well as guidance for hairdressers on maintaining the highest standards of hygiene, and ensuring the comfort and safety of their clients and themselves. Hairdressers Against AIDS is a rolling programme which will be extended on a country by country basis, with particular focus on regions where the disease is most prevalent. The programme marks its tenth anniversary in 2011, with new awareness raising films, training kits and a refreshed communications campaign. New York launch Over 500 hairdressers took to the streets of New York on World AIDS Day in December 2010 to launch Hairdressers Against AIDS in the US. The goal was for the hairdressers to start 200 conversations with people, who would be asked to post videos, Tweet, Facebook and chat with at least ten friends, triggering one million conversations about AIDS. There were live feeds to giant screens in New York Times Square, which reached an estimated 1.2 million people. L’Oreal Professional Product Educators currently work with over 400,000 salon professionals a year in the US, with the HIV/ AIDS modules now part of this training process. And with each hairdresser seeing on average up to 12 clients a day, as many as 200,000,000 new people could become more aware of the issue every year. Celebrity Calendar To further extend the reach of the programme, and give hairdressers a talking point in their salons, a 2011 ‘Hairdressers against AIDS’ Celebrity Calendar has also been produced. This calendar showcases the hairstyles of 12 famous models including Diane Kruger, Vanessa Paradis, Monica Bellucci and Audrey Tautou, as captured by renowned photographer John Nollet. Communication that makes a difference “I do believe that beauty professionals can have an impact on society in a way that goes beyond aesthetics – by communicating openly about this serious disease, hairdressers can make a real difference on the lives of their clients and their communities.” John Nollet SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2010 REPORT HOME GROUP DOWNLOADS CONTACT BUSINESS INNOVATION PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION TALENT COMMUNITIES DATABANK VIEWPOINTS Communities / Helping vulnerable people INTRODUCTION THE L’ORÉAL FOUNDATION Helping vulnerable people DATABANK L’ORÉAL-UNESCO FOR WOMEN IN SCIENCE COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS BY DOMAIN L’ORÉAL-UNESCO HAIRDRESSERS AGAINST COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS BY AIDS GEOGRAPHICAL REGION HELPING VULNERABLE EXTERNAL LINKS...

Beauty is connected to self-esteem and a positive self-image, which is why L’Oréal supports programmes that help vulnerable and disadvantaged people, and those affected by illness. Beauty nurtures self-esteem Because beauty and self-confidence are so closely linked, the L’Oréal Foundation created the ‘Beauty from the Heart’ programme to help people made vulnerable by illness or negative life experiences. By using cosmetics and hygiene products, many women and young people can gradually regain their confidence and control of their self-image. In 2010, more than 150 workshops were conducted with financial support from the Foundation. Giving meaning to beauty For several years, L’Oréal has been carrying out an extensive research programme called ‘The Sense of Beauty,’ which aims to advance knowledge and research on the meaning and role of appearance. This led to the publication of the book '100,000 Years of Beauty' in 2009. Written by 300 multidisciplinary researchers from 35 countries, this is an authoritative reference work charting humankind’s quest for beauty. In 2010, the L’Oréal Foundation began to disseminate much of this knowledge about beauty and, along with the Paris Descartes University, helped to stage the exhibition ‘The Face in All its States’. At the Women's Forum, a space for meetings, discussion and debate, the Foundation organised a meeting on the theme of appearance. It featured a talk by Aimee Mullins who, despite having both legs amputated below the knee as a child, overcame her disability to become both a model and an elite athlete. In 2010, the Foundation also created a pilot course in the Anthropology of Beauty at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. The course was facilitated by many of the authors who had worked on '100,000 Years of Beauty'. Over the last three years, the L’Oréal Foundation has also funded a scholarship in ‘The art of being and appearance’ for young researchers in the humanities. In 2010, the huge number and quality of applications led the Foundation to award two scholarships: one for a student investigating skin whitening during the Renaissance period, and the second for research into the significance of physical appearance and religion. Opération Sourire For the past three years, the L’Oréal Corporate Foundation has supported Opération Sourire (Operation Smile) a programme of reconstructive surgery run by Médecins du Monde. Surgeons volunteer their expertise and time to help people who have been disfigured by disease, malnutrition or war, and help them to regain their dignity and identity, and integrate back into normal life. L’Oréal currently works with children through missions in 12 African and Asian countries, and in 2010, 834 people were supported – 62% more than in 2009. In total, more than 1,500 have now been helped by the programme. The project also helps to fund the training of local surgeons and medical students, and funds crucial post-surgical care for children. L’Oréal’s support has also helped doctors and surgeons around the world who want to use their skills to make a real difference to people in developing countries. In 2010, the funding allowed a team of Japanese doctors to carry out a mission to Dhaka, Bangladesh, while specialists from Germany have been able to strengthen existing efforts in Cambodia, working in the province Kampong Cham. A team of doctors was also able to carry out an exploratory mission to Pakistan, with a view to setting up a new operation in 2011. Supporting people affected by illness In 2001, L’Oréal was one of several major French cosmetic companies to found ‘La Vie...de plus belle’. The organisation is sponsored by the anti-cancer group ‘Ligue contre le cancer’, and is a member of the international ‘Look Good...Feel Better’ network, which is active in 21 countries. 'La Vie... de plus belle' offers free skincare and make-up workshops in hospitals to help female cancer patients to cope with the side-effects of treatment and restore their self-esteem. In France, the programme is active in 21 hospitals and in 2010 organised 222 workshops for 1,822 women. Supporting disadvantaged people In 2007, the Foundation provided funding to Samusocial de Paris, a humanitarian emergency service, to help establish ‘La Maison des Femmes’ a refuge for women in need. The 14 residents can also participate in weekly self-esteem and image workshops. In 2010, 48 workshops were organised, contributing to the stability and wellbeing of the residents. In 2010, L’Oréal also distributed more than 500,000 branded products to our charity partners, L’Agence du Don en Nature, Les Restaurants du Coeur and Samusocial de Paris, to support their work in helping disadvantaged people to rediscover a sense of wellbeing and self-esteem.

The L’Oréal Foundation supports a range of educational activities designed to support students from low-income backgrounds, international students studying in French universities and Grandes Ecoles (higher education establishments), and secondary school students in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. It also provides assistance to disabled students studying at the French university Sciences Po. Public awareness of environmental issues L’Oréal is a founding member of the Nicolas Hulot Foundation for Nature and Mankind, a non-profit organisation dedicated to educating the public about protecting the environment and the beauty of nature. L’Oréal contributes to the Foundation’s three operational programmes: Promoting nutrition and a healthy diet Preserving and restoring biodiversity Reducing energy consumption and tackling the challenges of climate change. We also actively help with the Foundation’s scientific work, support 150 field projects in 10 countries every year, raise public awareness of the need to preserve natural resources, and support the Nicolas Hulot School for environmental education. To build awareness of environmental and climate change issues among its 11,000 employees in France, L’Oréal joined the ‘Défi Pour la Terre’ (Challenge for the Earth) programme. L’Oréal supports science at school The L’Oréal Foundation actively supports a tutoring programme, facilitated by the Museum of Science and Industry in partnership with the Association of Prevention Site de la Villette (APSV). Now in its fourth year, the programme supports children in middle and high school who might otherwise fall behind in science subjects. The programme, which includes a mentoring system with highly motivated and trained science students, takes place at weekends and school holidays, and has now helped nearly 4,000 school children. Support for disabled students Together, the prestigious French university Sciences Po and L’Oréal share a strong belief that diversity is an asset, and support the idea that both educational institutions and businesses should recruit from a broad base in order to promote equal opportunity and identify talented future employees. The ‘Sciences Po Accessible’ programme, created in partnership with ARPEJEH (Accompagner la Réalisation des Projets d’Etudes de Jeunes Elèves et Etudiants Handicapés), offers disabled students the tools to succeed in their studies. Sciences Po has developed a system whereby it can adapt teaching conditions to suit students’ individual needs. They also offer a personalised student support service ensuring they have the space, access and equipment they need to reach their full potential. During 2010, seven students received grants for international mobility allowing them to go abroad as part of their studies. Supporting entrepreneurs L’Oréal is also helping people to set up their own businesses by encouraging entrepreneurship around the world, especially among young people and women starting businesses in the field of beauty. In 2010, L’Oréal, in partnership with ADIE (Association for the Right to Economic Initiative) helped 25 young entrepreneurs create their own beauty and wellness businesses. The young people were unable to access funding from mainstream banking, so L’Oréal stepped in with financial and product support. The L’Oréal Foundation has also signed a new partnership with the French micro-credit website Babyloan, helping women to develop their own beauty-based businesses. So far, 18 projects have been supported including beauty salons and boutiques selling perfume and cosmetics.

L’Oréal Mother River Protection Fund, China L’Oréal is one of the key supporters of The Mother River Protection Fund in China, which is helping to protect the environment of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and which will eventually extend to other endangered areas throughout China. The programme was initiated in 1999 by the Chinese government in order to solve some of the problems facing the rivers that were caused by population growth and increased industrial activity. As part of its continuing commitment to sustainability and environmental welfare, L’Oréal is also sponsoring The Mother River Awards and funding several youth groups involved in environmental protection that are working on projects to help improve the rivers. Hair for oil Following the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, L’Oréal brand Pureology, in partnership with eco organisations Global Green USA and A Matter of Trust, took practical action to help the efforts to limit damaging impacts. Hair has proven, effective absorption properties and Pureology encouraged hair salons all over the country to donate clean hair clippings. These were packed into recycled nylon stockings and sent to the Gulf where they were used to skim off and soak up surface oil. Chimex L’Oréal subsidiary Chimex was commended in the European Responsible Care Awards 2010 for its ‘Harmonie’ outreach project with local schools in the Parisian suburb of Le Thillay. The project allowed school children to find out more about the science behind cosmetics, take part in a scientific experiment in a professional development laboratory, and learn more about the broad principles of sustainable development. Chimex is already heavily involved in the eco-design of formulas and cosmetic ingredients, processes which are helping to minimise the company's environmental footprint. Stop Sex Trafficking Campaign, The Body Shop, Indonesia In 2010, Body Shop Indonesia won a coveted Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Award for its Stop Sex Trafficking Campaign. According to UN research, this is one of the world’s fastest growing crimes and the Body Shop’s campaign is helping to support victims, as well as sponsoring a prevention programme and helping to increase public and media awareness of the crime. This was the second consecutive year Body Shop had been awarded a MDG award, having also been honoured for its 2009 Stop Violence in The Home campaign. Emergency relief Following the earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010, the group donated almost €1 million to the disaster appeal. L’Oréal also teamed up with the non-profit organisation CARE to provide victims with 7,000 personal care kits, consisting of products such as shampoos, shower gels, toothpaste and shaving foam. This emergency assistance helped victims to cope with daily hygiene problems, which can cause the spread of many diseases. 100 Citizen Projects In 2010, as part of the company’s centenary celebrations and continued commitment to corporate responsibility, L’Oréal rolled out 100 Citizen Projects, sponsored by L’Oréal subsidiaries around the world. All the projects are based on the three central pillars of the group’s corporate philanthropy activities: education, encouraging self-esteem, and the promotion of scientific research: Brazil: – L’Oréal is supporting the creation of a school that will train disadvantaged young people and help them find careers in the beauty industry. Singapore: – the “Touching Colours” project aims to help 100 visually impaired people to become more independent in their daily lives, by teaching them about personal beauty habits and techniques. Portugal: – ‘Project Geracao – Generation Project’ aims to encourage the professional placement of under-educated young people in deprived neighbourhoods.

TALENT Our objective was to verify the validity of the EHS data supplied by the sites. In order to do this, a statistically representative sample of COMMUNITIES five manufacturing sites, three distribution warehouses and one administrative site and research centre located in France, Mexico, the USA, China and South-Africa has been audited. ASSURANCE The approach was to find the sources of the information and to interview the heads of the departments concerned on the audited sites. > ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH & SAFETY Findings > SOCIAL AFFAIRS Our review has shown that, for the sample examined, data collection and processing have provided us with information which is globally GRI precise and reliable. New indicators were added in 2010, namely the level of safety culture and the MESUR frequency rate. The data allowing the calculation of both new indicators were found to be reliable. Some inaccuracies or omissions were noted for each of the visited sites, but with no significant impact on the scale of consolidated data for the group: Two sites had not reported several first aid injuries as non loss time accidents Two sites did not count several loss working days, taken into account in the calculation of the Severity Rate A notification from the authorities, issued in December 2010, about non-compliant wastewater discharge and associated noncompliances was not reported at the time of the audit. Opinion We believe that the EHS data published in this report and presented in the text, the schedules and the graphics for 2010 give an honest, transparent and reasonable image of the EHS performance of manufacturing sites, distribution warehouses and administrative activities. The noted improvements in EHS performance appear to be representative of the actual progress made by the sites and show a great regularity in the level of reporting reliability of the L’Oréal group.

These procedures, together with the data published in the Group sustainable development report, were prepared under the responsibility of the Human Resources Executive Management in accordance with the Group’s internal reporting standards. These standards are available on the Group’s website. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the procedures for compiling the selected social data, based on our review. Nature and scope of our work We performed the work according to The Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes (CNCC) doctrine related to this review. We performed the work described below in order to obtain moderate assurance as to whether procedures used to compile the selected social data are free of material misstatement. A higher level of assurance would have required more extensive procedures. Moreover, our review is not intended to express, and we do not express, a conclusion on the accuracy of the figures published. We performed the following work: At headquarters level For each of the areas reviewed, we met with various representatives from the departments listed below responsible for organizing the reporting procedures as well as for the consolidation of social data at Group level: the Labor Relations Department, HR Information Systems Department, Corporate HR Support Services, and Corporate “Learning for Development” Department. Based on interviews with these representatives and reviews of documents (Group consolidation manuals and subsidiary reporting schedules), we obtained assurance as to the: existence of instructions concerning definitions of the data to be compiled and the related calculation methods existence of reporting and consolidation procedures consistency of the data published with the scope set for such data due and proper inclusion of the social data obtained from the reporting systems in the consolidation packages, assessed on a test basis. Our work was based on the following indicators: total cost of the retirement programmes, % of countries with pension programmes in excess of basic social security requirements, number of employees per gender, data taken from the management database of executives’ profiles and careers (nationalities, number of executives by gender, number of women amongst the management committee), number of employees and executive staff trained, amount allocated to the World Profit Sharing program (WPS), number of employees’ representatives. At subsidiary level Additional tests were carried out to ensure the understanding and correct application of Group reporting procedures by the subsidiaries. These tests were carried out at country consolidation level, on a selection of six countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Serbia and Japan) and in respect of the aforementioned indicators, except for the two specific indicators related to retirement (total cost of the retirement programmes, % of countries with pension programmes in excess of basic social security requirements) that are managed for all countries at headquarters level. Our work was based on interviews with the individuals responsible for reporting at country level as well as with other people involved in the data collection and reporting procedures. The tests involved assessing the understanding and application of Group data definitions and data collection procedures at country level the consolidation procedures at country level and exhaustiveness of the scope the existence and appropriateness of internal control procedures at country level with a view to ensuring compliance with such procedures by the subsidiaries. We were assisted in our work by Sylvain Lambert, Partner in charge of our Sustainable Development Practice. Conclusion Based on our work, no material misstatement came to our attention that would cause us to believe that the social data selected and published on the Group Sustainable Development report has not been prepared in accordance with the Group’s reporting procedures.
