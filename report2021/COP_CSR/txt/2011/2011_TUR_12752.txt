We believe that minimizing our impact on the environment is a requirement for conducting business in the best way possible. Therefore, we carefully monitor our environmental impact and target a performance that exceeds legal requirements. We place the issue of water usage, which is fundamental to our business, at the heart of our environmental policy and aim to be an exemplary company in this regard. We make energy efficiency a priority in every area of operations, measure our carbon footprint and take the necessary actions to reduce it. Reducing the consumption of resources by increasing reuse and recycling, as well as disposing of the waste generated from operations without harming the earth are important aspects of our environmental management policy. We develop environmentally-friendly manufacturing processes in our area of operations, take initiative to create the same awareness with all stakeholders in our sphere of influence, taking leadership in joint projects and initiatives.

Operational Excellence CCI business strategies are founded on efficiency, innovation and continuous improvement. Therefore, we have combined the efficiency efforts we launched in 2007 with Lean Six Sigma under the umbrella of the Operational Excellence Program. The focus of projects that are part of the Operational Excellence Program is to minimize waste output and the use of resources, particularly energy. These efforts not only enhance our environmental performance significantly, but the savings that are achieved also have a positive effect on our financial performance. CCI Turkey: Creator of Best Practices In 2009, we achieved total annual savings of USD1.8 million as a result of the 9 projects that were completed with the execution of 2nd wave operational excellence projects in Turkey. The expansion of the Operational Excellence Program in 2009 to encompass our international operations means that all of the countries where we operate now have a common language, their processes comply with those in other countries and project efficiencies have increased. We developed almost 60 performance indicators in order to create this common language.
