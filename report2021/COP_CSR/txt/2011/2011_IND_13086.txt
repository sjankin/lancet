That may seem like a long time but compromise is never an option at IHCL. True to the company ethos, every little detail is handled with utmost care and executed as per the aura of the place. Take, for instance, the inlaid furniture has been especially brought from Kashmir to create a princely ambience. For a Victorian style, artisans were asked to hand-paint the ceilings. To add a dash of grandeur, Belgian cut glass chandeliers were fitted with a timeless collection of precious gems and art pieces from around the world. That’s just one side of the story. Our hotels engage the local communities, helping them to become more self-sufficient. The help ranges from providing a platform to showcase and sell local handicrafts and art forms or setting up raw material supply networks with the help of housewives and unemployed women, to enabling school drop-outs and rural youth to develop real life skills needed for employment. Beyond The Numbers is a premise that has emerged out of many such examples that not only define us as an organization but shape our journey in reponsible tourism by influencing every life that we touch.

This report is based on the GRI G3.1 Guidelines on Sustainability Reporting and also serves as a communication on progress on the 10 principles of United Nations Global Compact. This year was marked by advancements that will boost our long-term sustainability and brand equity. Some of those include creation and implementation of safety policy and safety management manual, streamlining of the Safety Health and Environment committee at the hotel and enterprise levels and the inclusion of 72 Luxury, Vivanta by Taj and Gateway hotels under the EarthCheck certification. In addition, we enjoy continued success of the War on Waste program,the alignment of the GHG mitigation projects with Tata Climate Change policy and the inclusion of IHCL as one of the Great Brands of Tomorrow by Credit Suisse Research Institute. Finally, winning the Gallup Great Workplace Award for the second year in a row and the adoption of the Tata Corporate Sustainability Charter have been special. Over the years, many of our key stakeholders like investors, clients, associates, communities and NGOs have demonstrated a keen interest in our non-financial performance and our commitment towards continual improvement. The valuable feedback provided by these stakeholders has helped us to prioritize our focus areas. Safety and security, customer satisfaction, revenue optimization, attracting and retaining talent, environmental excellence, and building sustainable livelihoods continue to remain our key focus areas and the basis of this report. We are committed to ensuring safety and security of our people and assets. Across operations, stringent security measures have been deployed and are upgraded on a regular basis incorporating feedback from guests, associates, government and intelligence agencies. I deeply regret to report five fatalities across all operations, during the year. Such incidents including injuries are highly unacceptable to us and we have taken stringent measures to enhance the safety systems across our properties. The upgraded safety system was deployed on a pilot basis at Taj West End, Vivanta by Taj–MG Road and Gateway hotels in Bangalore and will be deployed across all hotels in the coming months. 03 15 015 4 0 2 5 2303 0 0 4 0 20 22 5 8648 0 8 03 3 6 0 2 51 1 08 3 095 0 42 5 33 91 0 1 2 5 8 2 0 4 2 0 8 9 4 5 414 7 2 4707201 2 1 6 0 0 17 02 2 5 09 64 0 8 8 320 561 91 1 1 81 32 6 1 1 28 45294 03 5 2 00 4 9052176 4 7 4 0 0 2 229 0 8 314 1 0 18 85 6 9 0 5 3 01 4 4 90 0 0 1 7 5 4 6 2 81 2 6 3 0 1 0 3 75 3 3 4 306 2 025 2 3 0 0 620 2 4 3 7 159 25 490 0 30 5 2 92 0 7 6 9 410 68532 0 3 4 8 6 4 2 2 81 7 1 4 0 0 3 16 60 1 8 0 6 5 92 6 4 0 1 93 4 6 517 6 04 8124 63 Our business growth is directly proportional to the happiness quotient of our customers. We take utmost care in ensuring their satisfaction across our brands. Each brand has well-defined service standards that are based on finesse, sophistication and consistency. This year we created Vivanta by Taj, a new brand architecture and service style designed for the ‘work-hard-play-hard’ global traveller. As of now, there are 20 hotels under this brand with plans to include seven more in the next financial year. Effectively, now we operate our portfolio of hotels under four clear and well-defined brands – Taj Luxury Hotels, Vivanta by Taj, Gateway and Ginger, each addressing opportunities at varying price points and providing to our guests custom-made products, services and experiences. In this year, our consolidated turnover aggregated to `2.915 billion as against `2.563 billion in the previous year. In the same period, the Loss after Tax considerably reduced to `872.60 million as compared to `1,368.80 million in the previous year. Our consolidated turnover increased by 14% with improved domestic tourism and corporate travel that favourably impacted average room rates. The restored Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai, the full year impact of new inventory at Taj Lands End and the recently opened Taj Falaknuma Palace, Hyderabad contributed to improved results. The average annual growth rate in tourism in India over the past five years has been nine percent. To address this high growth, we would be adding 27 new properties, with nearly 3,700 rooms in the next 24 months. Of these, 18 would be shared between the Vivanta by Taj and Gateway brands, while Ginger would add seven properties. Highly engaged employees are the major contributors to our success. Right from when a booking is made to the time the guest checks out and even beyond, key guest interactions that we refer to as moments of truth are with hotel associates. While various hotel chains offer high quality products, the differentiators are often determined by service excellence, warmth and the art of hospitality that are extended to guests by the associates. We emphasize associate engagement, development and empowerment as central to creating enhanced customer value and hence a competitive success factor. Our human resource strategies and objectives are built around attracting, retaining and developing talent and are embedded in the company’s business plans. At IHCL, environment management has always been looked upon as a strategic differentiator. EARTH Environment Awareness and Renewal at Taj Hotels program is the cornerstone from where the company-wide movement of environment management initiates. It is a co-ordinated effort from IHCL to protect, conserve and restore the natural environment. It evolves from understanding each location’s impact on the environment to adopting appropriate steps for protecting and conserving it. Across hotels, we have started several good practices and projects aimed at tapping 04 152015 4 5 1605 30 2 6 2 3 0 0 4 0 20 22 5 64 0 8 03 3 6 0 2 8 51 01 42 8 03 95 391981 5 82 2 0 0 5 4 4 5 47074 7 6 3 0 01 215 1 8 2 02 4 0 0 17 02 2 0 98 2164 0 8 32302156 1 81 6 281 91 1 45294 03 52 920 4 67 4 0 040 87 051 2 0 8 314 0 1 9 1 2 85 3 0 46 9 2 5 01 4 90 0 0 1 7 5 4 6 2 81 2 6 3 0 31 0 3 75 3 4 306 2 025 2 3 0 0 620 2 4 3 7 159 25 40 0 3 9 2 0 5 92 0 7 6 9 410 68532 0 3 48 8 6 4 2 4 2 167 1 0 6 01 0 3 1 8 0 6 5 92 6 4 0 1 6 93 4 517 6 04 814 2 63 solar and wind energy, installing water recycling plants, generating biogas from organic waste and conserving energy. These initiatives help us in bringing down consumption of natural resources and thereby reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. Many of our hotels have attained zero wastewater discharge and have sustained partnerships for responsible recycling of waste. We also ensure development of green infrastructure and processes for new builds as well as existing hotels across locations. We continue with ‘Building Sustainable Livelihoods’ as our social responsibility agenda and have aligned and integrated our efforts to forge private-public partnerships to address contemporary societal needs and challenges. Leveraging on our core strengths in hospitality, we successfully continue to work with State Systems for creating a practical and scalable model for addressing malnutrition in children. Our efforts towards providing our brand platform to indigenous artisans and helping local cultural troupes have been enhanced and consolidated further. All our community projects are focused around our key strengths in food production, kitchen management, housekeeping and spas. We reach out to our target communities through our 4‘E’s – Employment; Employability; Education and Entrepreneurship. I would like to thank all our stakeholders, including our associates, for their interest and passion to grow and run our business in a sustainable manner. I appreciate and acknowledge the tremendous effort, dedication and commitment they have shown at various instances to the benefit of IHCL. I am proud of the way we are embracing a sustainability mindset and am convinced this will serve us well, going forward. Your constructive feedback will also play an important role in helping us reshape and redefine our sustainability priorities.

You must have endured an annoying traffic jam at some point of time. But have you ever wondered what causes these jams? Well, the reasons are numerous but most often it’s the drivers’ fault. On a two-way street, to escape peak hour traffic, unruly drivers try to overtake and in the process block the traffic coming from the opposite side. As a result, both roads get blocked. The same goes for communication. Every organisation needs to engage its partners and consumers in a quality dialogue where ideas and suggestions are exchanged to ensure smooth operation and growth. Stakeholder engagement Taj’s brand image rests on our panache for building relationships.

Year of the Associate Plus (YOA+) After the success of the award winning Year of the Associate (YOA) program which resulted in enhanced levels of engagement amongst IHCL’s associates, a need to take the engagement to an even higher level was felt which resulted in the emergence of Year of Associate Plus (YOA+). The crux of YOA+ was to ensure a higher level of engagement and thus align the employees to IHCL’s larger goals. 468863 YOA+ is a set of initiatives aimed at 37001 154010 1 4 enhancing the quality of employees’ lives at work and beyond.

MiUniversity To enhance our ability to rapidly disseminate and translate knowledge into action, at IHCL we have initiated a new e-learning portal that gives associates across geographies access to a world of learning opportunities. Aptly titled MiUniversity, this portal is a powerful system that combines technology with pedagogy to provide associates with more than 300 courses ranging from operational to managerial areas from universities like Harvard and Cornell along with the American Hotel & Lodging Educational Institute. Each course has been carefully hand-picked to address certain leadership competencies and present a transformational learning experience. Currently more than 6,000 associates are a part of the active user base at MiUniversity. 57 The Green Effort 9 351093 45 65 0 19 6 961241580 401 51 5 0 0 4 5 3 406 46 0 5 5 23 2 9 2 9 351093 0 45 4 5 2 8 41651 40 8248 0 0 0 15 21 5 2201 20 5 5 2 0 0 4 3 9 9 07 406 46 69 0 5 5 23 2 9 61215 0 2 0 0414 0 9 0 4 5 5 8 4 5 2 1 4098248 0 0 210 5 21 2 5 2 5 1130 9 262 68 2 3960453 9 6 5 65 006054 2 0 5 8 30 6 1 9 43 07 0 6 0 5 3 1516 900624688 6139031583 3 2206402 5 0 5 9 02 0 41 0 4 2 6 81 1 2 4 12 18 0 8 0 53 5 61 2 9 6 03165301 60581 1 2 49 12 6 31301 4 5 90 1 82680358604 0631 5 0 9 6 3 1 8 08604 006 631 0 9 6 6 5 5 2 0 2 0 2 5 2 6 2 6 5 9 6 6 00 06 2 0 3 2835 6 6 00 6 0 3 690 48180 9 9 5451067 1 8 04 09 5 6 01 86 0 15 41 4 9 9 0 2024013 2 65 5 5 6 97 0 5 08 1 5 04 8 1 1 86 75 5 4 9 6 9 09 0 9 6 5 9 80 5 25 915 8 08 0 4 10 2691 6098 7 23 4 1601 0 8 9 18 620 0 49 9 0484966 4 18 8 8 80 0 99 95 4 9 8 1 8 2 1 9 2 0 2 42351 62260 27412 3 4 4642 631 56 4 3600 02 2 2 597 580586594 0 2 2 2 85913 8563 0 20 466427920 6350 22 2 2 1 303 1 1 6 45 24 0 2 2 2 72 0 7216495 2 27 9 5 6 47 4612 56 5 3 69 26 35 38 56742458432 82 8 3 51 1 3 4 12 1 690 48180 0 0 3 0 123 5 0 9 9 5451067 1 0 04 09 47553 6515 67 423513126 51 9 5 0 4 8 3 601 2 0 5 6 01 86 2 0 15 1 01 4 3 41 2 9 9 0 46 2024013 65 1 0 3 2 034 0 1 8 69 2 3 2 5 6 68 5 3 1 3 6 66748243355013432 2 0 2 7 0 5 1 05961 1 57 4 04 8 1 86 0 12 0 08 3 61956347 6254 6 5 63 1 2 75 4 0 3 0 123 5 0 3 0 6 9 09 5 4 2 0 6 25 3 0 9 6 4553 5 6 09 4 3 9 80 71 9 9 5 601 210 21 9 92 8 2 5 25 915 8 63 3 3 5 8 0 1 24 9 41 0 13 2 4 2 10 69 2 0 0 56 6098 7 23 58 0 4 101642004896 0 2 0 4 01 5 2568655643 3 80 138 0 8209 26 3 1601 0 2 0 26 60 2 0 89 8 9 8 0 6 2 5 9 54569 6 0 3 3 43 9 4 5 80 8 49 8 9 46 2 4 9 0 16 95 4 9 8 1 8 2 4 1 9 2 0 35 0 3 02 54 0 0 2 8 4 56 5 1 37569 2 11 0 1 7 4 1 1 35 4 7 1 0 2 4 2 341080946015821324157 9 24 0 6 7 5 8 54 0 62 052 16 2 12 3 8 408 0 0 32 8 4 6 0 47 11 9 3 5838 5 316 6 0 40540547 5 7 0 8 5 5 238 6 8 4 85 23 0 3261501 153 06 3 1 3 5 0 8 57 8 4 0 8 1 51415 1 2 3 1 3 1 3 7 62565 5016 8 4 12 346 3 2 1 8 23413 0 2 1501 1 0 6 3 4 6 56742458432 8 4 2 2 5 3 3 51 2 1 3 0 4 12 3 4 4 2 0 9 6 5 9 0 8 1 9 62 735 613 210 24 28 43036 96342 4 6 1 6 0 2 2 1 0 762 6511 5 0 4 5 0 3 1 47553 6515 20 3 123 4 1 2 3 3 2 0 0 3 1 5 65 9 5 0 8 5 0 1 9 0 4 6 6 3815 1 0 020 5 0 601 2 0 5 60 2 0 1 3 4 2 0 6 25 3 2 9 4 9 6 0 6 9 5 4 2 430 6 634 4 8 2 5 2 0 3 1 0 3 2 43 9 5 1 2 9 13 2 034 0 1 0 2 5 4 2 5 8510 5 8 69 2 67 2 03451 3 1 1 67 75 1386 0 3 0 3 6 2 0 0 6 60 2 0 0 54 0 4 2 630 3 0 4 3 43 9 5 564577 2 4 5 3 67 8 69 26 2 5 7 3 7 5 0 8 4 9 3 64 13 409540 85 0 3 7 4 19 0 3 0 6 9577 5 2 3 5 0 1 8 4 2 4 6 0 4 81 7 0 3 1 9 3 4 9 1 5 0 6 0 6 0 3 2 0 31896152 3 6 2 132 6 2 4 81 8331896152 1 0 0 10 6 0 29 4 3261501 7 4 29 1 63 5 6 3 6674824335250134632 620 2857463420665119663218 2 3 2 7 1 1 6 6 83 513 3 1 1 4 4 0 0 12 0 12 4242 432 1 6 5 6 1 0 80 6 73506 1 1 0 4 2 0 6 0 5 0 5 0 472553265031631 513865405 8035160647 25 3 3 9 4 9 3 1 0 1 3 9 5 0 1 3 0 1 2 3 0 4 2 1 42 0 4 25 09 5 09 5 2 6 60 2 0 3 0 2 1 2 0 6 3 4 58 09 2638 43 9 21 0 0 3 2 5 2 2 4 1 3 1 5 3 6 0 0 8 4 9540 851 69577 0 4 0 3 3 1 0 3 1 8 09 26 0 4 0 0 1 8 4 2 4 2 0 0 4 0 503108967 2 3 0 1 1 5 2 3 0 65 3 0 9 3 2 6 4 32 32 50 0 152 10 0 3 0 3 1 2 6 12 24 9 The Green Effort In tune with nature.

These striving hard to reduce our energy measures have yielded good results and footprint. We are addressing the challenge have helped us to reduce 38,648 of energy management through awareness, gigajoules of energy, which is equivalent optimization of energy intensive to 7,017 tons of GHG emissions. Some of equipment, investment into renewable these measures include installation of energy and installation of energy efficient capacitor banks, CFLs, T5 and T9 equipment. We use renewable and tubelights, LEDs, motion sensors; non-renewable energy from both direct optimization of pumps, chiller and indirect energy sources. Diesel, Petrol, temperatures, HVAC plants; and several Liquefied Petroleum Gas, Piped Natural training and awareness sessions on energy Gas, Fuel Oil, Light Diesel Oil and Charcoal conservation. are the main sources of non-renewable direct energy, while solar, biogas and At the Group level, Tatas have biomass are the main sources of renewable acknowledged Climate Change as one of energy. Grid electricity is the main source the biggest risks and challenges to of indirect non-renewable energy, while business. IHCL is a part of the Steering Agro power and Hydrogrid power are main Committee on Climate Change formed by sources of renewable indirect energy for Tata Quality Management Services to focus us. Overall, about 45 percent of energy on measuring and mitigating the climate requirement is met through direct energy change impact of Tata Group companies. sources while remaining 55 percent is Till last year our energy and GHG sourced from indirect energy sources. calculations were based on EarthCheckTM parameters, however as a part of the Group Climate Change policy, from this Over 3 percent of total energy year we have based our calculations on requirement is met through the Tata Group’s internal guidelines that renewable energy sources. are based on the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fundamentals.

Water management Water is another key natural resource We also encourage recycling and reuse of widely used across our hotels. We water across hotels. This year, we continually strive to conserve water and improve the efficiency of water utilization could recycle or reuse around 1.69 across hotels. Water is drawn from multiple million kilolitres of water, which sources across locations including rivers, is about 25 percent of the total lakes, sea, tankers, municipality supply, water withdrawal. This year, we harvested rain water and ground reserves. Ground water, tanker and municipality were able to reduce the effluent supply together meet about 97 percent of discharge outside hotel boundaries our total water requirement. We have to 2.40 million kilolitres a 12 installed desalination plants in hotels that percent reduction over last year. are close to coastal areas for utilizing the This year, 35 percent of our Gateway, sea water. Many of our hotels harvest and Luxury and Vivanta by Taj hotels have utilize rain water.

The scope of assurance covers data and information on economic (excluding financial), environmental and social indicators presented by IHCL in the Report for the financial year 2010-2011, in line with the requirements of GRI – G3 (2006) Guidelines on Sustainability Reporting. For verification of data and information we conducted site visits / video conferences as follows: Site visit Agra Gateway Hotel, Fatehabad Road Bhubaneshwar Ginger Bangalore Ginger; Taj West End; Gateway Hotel Residency Road; Vivanta by Taj M G Road; Vivanta by Taj Whitefield Chennai Taj Club House; Taj Coromandel; Vivanta by Taj Fisherman's Cove; Vivanta by Taj -Connemara Mumbai Corporate Office IHCL; Corporate Office Ginger; Taj Mahal Palace; Taj Lands End; TajSATS; ; Taj Wellington Mews; Vivanta by Taj – President Ginger Vivek Vihar; Taj Mahal; Taj Palace Hotel; TajSATS; New Delhi Vivanta by Taj Ambassador Video conference Malaysia Rebak Island Resort, Langkawi Maldives Vivanta by Taj – Coral Reef South Africa Taj Cape Town USA Campton Place, San Francisco Which assurance standards did we use? We conducted our work in accordance with ISAE 3000. We conducted our engagement in compliance with the requirements of the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which requires, among other requirements, that the members of the assurance team (practitioners) as well as the assurance firm (assurance provider) be independent of the assurance client, including not being involved in writing the Report. The Code also includes detailed requirements for practitioners regarding integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. KPMG has systems and processes in place to monitor compliance with the Code and to prevent conflicts regarding independence. Specific limitations to our work included the following: For the locations that were not visited, we confirmed that the data supplied by IHCL were correctly reported and aggregated at corporate office, but we did not verify the underlying reliability of this data. We have not been engaged to determine which, if any, recommendations should be implemented; act on behalf of management in reporting to the Board of Directors, or Audit Committee; Develop/ prepare source documents on transactions; Verify financial performance indicators. We have also not been engaged to provide assurance over any prior year data or information presented in the Report. 78 What are our conclusions? Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the information contained in the Report is inconsistent with the findings of our work as described below: • Safety and security, customer satisfaction, revenue optimization, attracting and retaining talent, environmental excellence, and building sustainable livelihoods have been reconfirmed and retained as IHCL’s key focus areas. • IHCL’s SHE committee has Board level representation and is responsible for all key decisions related to sustainability. • IHCL has processes in place to collect, collate and monitor sustainability performance data related to energy consumption; water consumption; community engagement; and consumption of materials including paper, cleaning products and pesticides. • The Report complies with the GRI-G3 guidelines ‘A+’ application level criteria. What did we do to reach our conclusions? We planned and performed our work to obtain all the evidence, information and explanations that we considered necessary in relation to the above scope. Our work included the following procedures using a range of evidence-gathering activities which are further explained below: • Observations of the Company’s stakeholder consultation processes and their methodology for determining the material issues; • Interviews with senior management and relevant staff at group level and selected operating companies to understand implementation of sustainability initiatives across the business; • Checking the Reports’ content to ensure consistency with the GRI application level requirements of A+; • An evaluation of the existence and operation of the systems and methods used to collect process and aggregate the selected performance data presented in the Report. We also tested the reliability of underlying data and information for the selected performance data within the scope of our assurance; • Conducting visits to domestic hotels and video conferences with international hotels; • A review of the Report draft to ensure there are no disclosures that are misrepresented or inconsistent with our findings. Other key observations We have provided IHCL’s management with an internal report outlining our findings. Without prejudice to our conclusions presented above, we present some of the key observations below: • IHCL has rolled out a hotel-wide safety management system based on custom-made protocols. The pilot version of which was deployed in Taj West End, Vivanta by Taj – MG Road and Gateway Hotel – Residency Road in Bangalore. 79 • The Report presents the six elements of IHCL’s strategy to conduct sustainable business operations. Going forward, IHCL can establish Enterprise-level and Hotel-level goals and targets specific to sustainability performance indicators in order to compare its performance over a period. • There were discrepancies in the data reported from hotels and the same were corrected during the course of verification audits. • Management and reporting of sustainability performance indicators at the hotel level is fragmented and not integrated as a part of the mainstream management information systems. • The process adopted for determining the focus areas involves engagement with IHCL’s internal stakeholders. The Company can consider revisiting the focus areas after considering views and opinions of its external stakeholders as well. Responsibilities The Management of IHCL is responsible for preparing the Report and the information and statements within it. The Board is responsible for identification of stakeholders and material issues, for defining commitments with respect to sustainability performance, and for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which reported information is derived. Our responsibility is to express our conclusions in relation to the above scope. We conducted our engagement with a multidisciplinary team including specialists in ISAE 3000, stakeholder engagement, auditing environmental, social and financial information and with experience in similar engagements in the hospitality sector. This report is made solely to IHCL in accordance with the terms of our engagement. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to IHCL those matters we have been engaged to state in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than IHCL for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.
