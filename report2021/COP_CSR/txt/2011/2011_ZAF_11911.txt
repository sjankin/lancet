PICK N PAY Global Compact: Communication on Progress Statement from the CEO Once again this year I am happy to report that sustainability continues to be a primary focus within our Company. We have made excellent progress with regards to integrated reporting in line with the requirements of King Code of Corporate Practices and Conduct (King III) and this has consolidated our efforts to further integrate sustainability thinking into our core business practice, as is evident from our many implemented initiatives during the past year. We established an Operational Steering Committee during the year to focus our sustainability work on our core operations. We believe this will enhance social and environmental as well as operational performance. Our engagement with a wide range of stakeholders on sustainability-related matters is increasing. As a major South African retailer, this means that we are responding to the interests and concerns of our employees, suppliers and millions of customers to enable a fair and sustainable society. In terms of setting targets to achieve this goal, we have committed to reducing our energy consumption by 20% by 2012; and by 2015 we aim to send zero waste to landfill and reduce our carbon footprint by 15 %. In line with our sustainability strategy, we have specific initiatives covering issues of food safety, product auditing, climate change and recycling, our two focus areas are energy and waste reduction. Thank you for your continued support.
