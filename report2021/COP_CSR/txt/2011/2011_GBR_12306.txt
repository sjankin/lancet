(common parts and shared services) by 15% across our like-for-like portfolio in 2010/11, compared to 2008/09. Across our entire managed portfolio, we reduced energy intensity per m² by 12% in our offices, 28% in our shopping centres and 22% in our retail parks. Intensity per m² increased by 21% in our Continental European properties, and we are working with our managing agents to address this. To send zero managed waste to landfill from all our We have made good progress on this target, having diverted 96% of all properties and developments by 2012. managed waste from landfill on our developments in 2010/11 (up from 93% in 2009/10) and 84% at our properties (up from 83% in 2009/10). We do not expect to achieve this challenging target by 2011/12. Across the UK, provision of waste management facilities varies considerably, and so some of our properties and developments do not have good access to high-performing materials recycling facilities or cost-effective incineration plants. We will, however, continue to focus on increasing recycling rates and diverting waste from landfill. To reduce managed water use by 20% per m² for We are on track to achieve this target, having reduced water use by 14% each property type by 2015, compared to 2009. across our like-for-like portfolio in 2010/11, compared to 2008/09. Across our entire managed portfolio, we reduced water intensity per m² by 7% in our offices, 1% in our shopping centres, 52% in our retail parks and 2% in our Continental European properties. To achieve planning consent for a zero carbon We have made some progress towards this target and believe that we will achieve commercial building by 2015. it by 2015, in advance of the Government’s aim for all new non-domestic buildings to be zero-carbon from 2019. Our developments are designed to have 30% lower carbon emissions on average than current standards. Next year, we will be exploring opportunities to achieve this target on specific projects and we will work with the Government to refine the emerging definition of zero-carbon. britishland.com/crreport2011 1. PROGRESS AGAINST targets 2 medium-term TARGETS EXCEEDING CUSTOMERS’ EXPECTATIONS Target Progress statement To achieve 80% customer satisfaction with us and our In the UK, we successfully achieved the target for satisfaction with us, as 80% of managing agents by 2013. our customers surveyed in 2011 rated us good or excellent.

Going forward, we will evaluate our performance on all major developments. As part of our efforts to tailor our approach at individual properties and developments to suit local circumstances, we have decided to set local targets rather than a 2015 target for overall satisfaction. This is based on local feedback, expert advice and internal review. We will also continue to set annual targets as appropriate.

At project level, recycled content is calculated as a proportion of the total value of materials used, by summing the total cost of each material multiplied by its % recycled content by mass. The value of re-used and reclaimed materials used in construction is quantified based on calculating 100% of the purchase cost of the equivalent newly manufactured product, which is substituted by the re-used content. britishland.com/crreport2011 2. MANAGING BUILDINGS carbon 1 EFFICIENTLY & DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS Carbon Fig. 2.34 CRC ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCHEME GRI: EC2, EN7 Indicative Cost Exposure (£) (£ million per annum) In introductory phase (based on £12 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) £0.8m Data notes Methodology →F  ollowing the changes to the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2010, British Land will be required to pay a levy on CO2 generated in respect of energy consumed in the areas of the portfolio where it is responsible for provision of power. For the financial years 2011/12 to 2013/14, this levy is fixed at £12 per tonne of CO2 and the cost to British Land is estimated to be approximately £0.8m per annum based on consumption recorded in the year to 31 March 2011. The pricing framework beyond 2013/2014 is yet to be established. We continue to work to reduce our energy consumption across the portfolio, in partnership with our occupiers, to mitigate this cost.

We will work with suppliers, local people, community groups, local authorities and other partners to implement this Charter. In 2010, we commissioned a review of our economic impacts by PwC, to improve understanding of how we affect local communities and the UK economy. British Land Economic Contributions 2011 We do not currently have a formal strategy for assessing the potential impacts on the local community when we exit that community. We will consider this as our Community Charter evolves. We actively encourage our sites to engage with local communities through our annual community targets, which state that sites with sufficient on-site resource should be engaged in at least two ongoing community initiatives. We support our sites by providing financial backing, where appropriate, through a dedicated budget. We ask them to identify charitable and community causes in their area which address local needs, and to submit proposals for funding. These are then considered by our Charity and Community Committee. When considering such proposals (whether originating at sites or from our Head Office), the Committee assesses the impact each organisation has had through their previous operations, and the impact that our investment would enable them to make going forward. This assists us when selecting appropriate initiatives to support. For major funded projects, to maximise our contribution we stipulate that there must be engagement either from management teams at our sites or, for Head Office initiatives, with British Land staff. For major funded projects (normally longer term, with commitments of up to three years), our Assistant Community Executive reports on progress to the Charity and Community Committee, normally on a six-monthly basis. Funded projects are subject to annual review, the successful completion of which results in further committed funds being released. Relationships with charitable and community groups are managed either by local property management representatives or, for Head Office initiatives, by our Community Executive, Assistant Community Executive or other appointed staff member. Through liaison with organisations supported we gather information for reporting purposes, including data on the outcomes of our investment (whether financial or other), i.e. the number of young people not in Education, Employment or Training who attended a funded training course, and those who went on to positive outcomes (see Retail Case Studies). This is in line with the London Benchmarking Group’s measurement framework, which requires members to report on outcomes of corporate community investment. britishland.com/crreport2011 7. GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE INDEX GRI 11 Social: Society Performance Indicator Description Reported Cross-reference/Direct answer Community SO1 Nature, scope, and Fully In relation to our managed portfolio, feedback on and analysis of data on our effectiveness of any community activities has informed steps toward further community engagement in programs and practices a number of ways. that assess and manage We have gained a much greater understanding of the level and value of the the impacts of operations community investment activities that were underway across our portfolio through on communities, including our first London Benchmarking Group (LBG) submission in 2008. entering, operating, and exiting. Membership of LBG also provides a view of how we are performing in comparison to other members. This, together with increased feedback through improved engagement with our sites, has contributed to: • The formation of a Charity and Community Committee • The publication of our Charitable and local community funding guidelines in August 2009 • An increase in our charity budget • Greater focus on our annual community targets, building on performance each year • The setting of annual fundraising targets since 2009/10 • The recruitment of a new Community Executive in September 2010 • The development of our forthcoming Community Charter.

Where updated or new data is available we restate figures for prior years. Where we have done this we provide details in the data notes. → Acquisitions, disposals and newly managed properties Data from properties acquired or disposed of, or which fall into our operating control during the reporting period, are reported from the date of purchase/management or until the date of sale. → Numbers may not sum due to consistent rounding. 2. Managing Buildings Efficiently Boundary This year, we were responsible for resource use in the common parts of 97 UK and 12 Continental European properties with a floor area of 2,921,821m2 (floor area excludes two properties that have recently joined the managed portfolio for which data is not currently available). This compares to 99 UK properties and 12 Continental European properties in 2009/10, with a combined floor area of 2,860,342m2. Floor area differences between these years result from the relative size of properties moving in and out of our portfolio. Scope Our managed portfolio changes significantly over time, with properties bought and sold relatively frequently. Our total resource use is affected by these changes, as well as by our efficiency improvement initiatives. We also continue to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of data gathering. 91% of our managed properties in the UK reported resource use data in 2010/11 (88 out of 97 properties), as well as 100% in Continental Europe (12 out of 12 properties). This compares to 91% of managed properties in the UK in 2009/10 (90 out of 99 properties) and 100% of managed properties in Continental Europe (12 out of 12 properties) reporting energy use data. The type of resource use reported varied, reflecting the variety of services provided in those common parts. Where we have indicated above that a property has not reported a particular resource type, we will be working over the course of the next year to obtain this data. During the 2010/11 reporting period: →2  managed properties reported resource use data for the first time →6  managed properties that reported resource use were sold or no longer managed by British Land → 5 new properties reported resource use. These comprised newly purchased/managed properties and development projects achieving practical completion. Year-on-year comparisons of our performance are not straightforward because of variations in the portfolio of properties owned and managed. britishland.com/crreport2011 10. reporting criteria 3 criteria Resource Type Property type Properties Properties not Reason reporting reporting Offices Electricity 26 0 Gas 22 4 2 No common parts gas use 2 Properties reclassified as Offices this year – we will work next year to ensure resource is reported Oil 16 10 No common parts oil use Water 24 2 2 Properties reclassified as Offices this year – we will work next year to ensure resource is reported Waste 21 5 1 Waste reported at the estate level and therefore reported under different property 2 Properties reclassified as Offices this year – waste reported at estate level 1 No managed waste 1 Data not available – waste contractor has been changed to ensure reporting is possible Retail Parks Electricity 53 6 1 Property purchased in week before year end 1 Unable to obtain data from joint venture partners 1 Property previously not reported on 3 Common parts not metered separately Gas 4 56 No common parts gas use Oil 0 60 No common parts oil use Water 12 48 No common parts water use Waste 32 28 26 No managed waste 1 Property previously not reported on 1 Property purchased in week before year end Shopping Centres Electricity 9 2 1 Unable to obtain data from joint venture partners 1 Property purchased in month before year end and unable to report Gas 9 2 1 Unable to obtain data from joint venture partners 1 Property purchased in month before year end and unable to report Oil 2 9 No common parts oil use Water 8 3 1 Unable to obtain data from joint venture partners 1 Property purchased in month before year end and unable to report 1 Property not reported resource type – we will work to include in next year’s reporting Waste 7 4 1 Property purchased in month before year end and unable to report 1 Waste managed by neighbouring site 2 No managed waste Continental Europe Electricity 12 0 Gas 1 11 No common parts gas use Oil 0 12 No common parts oil use Water 11 1 No common parts water use Waste 7 5 3 No managed waste 2 Data not available – we will work to include in next year’s reporting britishland.com/crreport2011 10. reporting criteria 4 criteria Reported resource use can therefore be affected by transactions as well as by changes in use. To meaningfully review performance we compare the performance of properties managed this year to their performance in our medium term target baseline year of 2008/9 and to last year, 2009/10. We refer to these as our ‘like-for-like’ properties. This year, there were 68 2008/9 like-for-like properties and 79 2009/10 like-for-like properties. Methodology Resource use data is collected across the managed portfolio using an online software solution – Credit 360. Managing agents at our managed sites are required to provide quarterly responses to a series of questions issued to them via ‘delegation’ forms. At our retail parks, shopping centres and Continental European properties, managing agents are required to provide meter readings for all meters associated with common parts energy use. Meter readings are automatically extrapolated to the end of the reporting period based on a kWh/day rate. Where meters are ‘mixed’ and serve both common and occupier areas, managing agents are required to provide sub-meter readings, which are then deducted from the meter total to provide common parts usage. Where this is not possible, managing agents are required to estimate the split between common and occupier usage. Where an estimate is not available, ‘mixed’ meters are reported in common parts. In our office portfolio, energy and water consumption data is collected via a ‘delegation’ form. Meter readings are taken for each managed portfolio by Broadgate Estates Ltd.; these are then reviewed and collated before being entered into Credit 360. Checks are undertaken to ensure all data has been submitted to the system before aggregation and reporting begins. Where necessary data is converted into the common reporting units; for instance, litres of oil are converted into kWh. Credit 360 has the functionality to produce a number of reports that are used to compile the figures presented below. Floor areas and energy intensities Office floor areas are based on Gross Internal Area (GIA) and are obtained from service charge budgets and insurance valuations. Where British Land occupied areas are stated, floor areas refer to the Net Lettable Area (NLA) occupied by British Land. For retail parks and Continental European properties floor areas were calculated based on the number of car park spaces (this is based on an assumption of an average car park size of 4.60m x 2.45m = 11.27m2) and the addition of 20% to that floor area to account for other areas such as management offices and covered walk way areas, to reflect the amount of common space that British Land manages, for example lighting car parks. Shopping centre floor areas were calculated by using the methodology for retail parks described above, but substituting the additional 20% for measured internal common parts areas supplied by our managing agents. The floor areas for all properties were measured/calculated consistently across reporting years. We undertake energy intensity calculations as this removes the impact of changes in our portfolio, as we buy and sell properties, and the effect of increases in the number of properties reporting data, as we improve data collection across our portfolio. It also allows us to establish energy benchmarks for offices so that we can compare the performance of individual properties to the relevant benchmarks, identifying opportunities for improvement and learning from examples of good practice. Properties are only included in intensity calculations where they provide both consumption data and floor area data. Where a property has not reported a resource use type, the corresponding floor area was removed from the floor area total used to calculate energy intensity per m² for that property type. Offices energy intensity per m² was calculated using offices gross internal areas, with the exception of British Land occupied areas, where a Net Lettable Area (NLA) was used. Common parts energy intensity per m² for the other portfolio types was calculated using the common parts floor area for that portfolio type. In our office portfolio, we also calculate energy intensity per full time equivalent (FTE) employee. FTEs are collated and reported by property managers at each managed office. Office total building energy use is divided by the total number of FTEs across the office portfolio to provide an energy use (kWh) per FTE figure. Like-for-like reporting We undertake like-for-like calculations to track the performance of a consistent set of properties across reporting years. Our like-for-like portfolio comprises those properties with robust resource use and floor area data that were in our portfolio for the whole of the reporting and the baseline year. Like–for-like calculations are only undertaken for areas where British Land has management control; for instance, they do not include energy used in occupier demises in our office portfolio. Fuel use in British Land owned/controlled vehicles is not included in like-for-like calculations. Adjustments and Restatements britishland.com/crreport2011 10. reporting criteria 5 criteria The scope of our reporting for 2009/10 has been restated due to adjustments made to the reporting of our portfolio, for example reclassifying of properties into different portfolio types. Last year we stated that 105 (now reported as 111) properties were in the managed portfolio with a floor area of 1,935,789m² (now restated as 2,860,342m²): 22 offices (now 25 – 2 properties reclassified as offices and reporting on an additional property), 63 retail parks (now 65 – 2 properties newly identified), 8 shopping centres (now 9 – data is available for additional property) and 12 Continental European (no change) properties. Where updated or new data is available we restate figures for prior years. For example we have been able to collect oil use data in our office portfolio for 2009/10 by collating invoices. Details of restatements are made in the introductory data notes to each section. 3. Developing Sustainable Buildings Boundary Approximately 50 of the 81 managed development projects are retail projects with a construction value under £1,000,000. 32 projects were active on site during the financial year; the total construction value of these 32 projects is estimated at £1,067,000,000 although we estimate that £23,660,000 of construction value was spent this financial year. Our development portfolio changes significantly over time, with development projects started, put on hold or sold relatively frequently; this is particularly true of the past few years given the global economic situation. This year a large number of developments commenced late in quarter three or during quarter four. Our resource use is affected by these changes. This year we report construction waste generated and diverted from landfill; we are working to improve our reporting and assurance of site energy and water data and plan to report that next year. Methodology Construction value is an estimate of costs to build the development excluding design, legal or finance fees or costs. It is intended to reflect the value of materials, energy and man power required to construct our projects and is a rough estimate based on available information. Our Sustainability Brief for Developments version 3 establishes the reporting standards for our development projects. Application of this Brief is the responsibility of our Sustainable Developments Executive as well as all Project Development Executives, and the Brief is regularly circulated to all external project managers. Resource use on our sites is collected across the managed development portfolio using an online software solution – Credit 360. Site managers at our managed sites are required to provide monthly responses to a series of questions issued to them via ‘delegation’ forms. These monthly responses are reviewed at least quarterly by British Land or an environmental consultant. Bi-annual full reviews are undertaken, and the results shared across our construction teams. Annually, all projects with a construction value over £5,000,000 are subject to detailed audits by internal and external auditors.

Estimated costs associated with each metric. Units: kWh, kWh per m2, GBP (£), BREEAM rating, Code for Sustainable Homes rating, Energy Performance Certificate rating. Scope – Managed Buildings → In terms of energy reporting, we differentiate between the different parts of properties where we have control. In our office portfolio we report British Land controlled common parts energy use, British Land controlled central plant (heating and cooling), oil use in British Land controlled standby plant (generators), energy use in British Land controlled and occupied Head Office and Broadgate Estates Ltd (BEL) occupied demises along with occupier controlled own demises. This enables us to form a picture of the energy consumption and characteristics of entire buildings, helping us to target energy saving action and engage in a more meaningful way with occupiers. → 2 properties that have now been reclassified as ‘office’ properties (satellite sites at one of our shopping centres) have only reported common parts energy use and occupier energy use for vacant occupier areas. We will work with the on-site team next year to ensure the reporting for these properties is in line with the rest of our office portfolio. → In our retail park, shopping centre and Continental Europe portfolios we are currently reporting the energy use in areas that we control – the common parts. britishland.com/crreport2011 10. reporting criteria 7 criteria → Across our Retail, Shopping Centre and Continental Europe portfolios, retail units can become vacant between occupiers moving in and out. During these unoccupied periods we are responsible for any energy consumption within the unit. This data is currently recorded for Carbon Reduction Commitment purposes but not in a format that we are able to provide in this Report; data for vacant retail units is not included in this Report. We will work towards amending this for next year. Where areas are vacant in our office portfolio, any associated energy use is reported as occupier demises energy use. Methodology – Managed Buildings → Energy use in Broadgate Estates Ltd and Acuity Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadgate Estates) Ltd occupied areas in buildings not owned by British Land is estimated based on billing information. → Oil used in standby plant across our managed portfolio was reported for the first time this year, for both the current reporting year and retrospectively for the 2009/10 baseline year. Oil use data is measured where possible; otherwise it is estimated based on the run time of plant. 2009/10 data was collated from a review of historic purchase orders. → Oil use is converted from litres to kWh using a Carbon Trust recommended factor of 11.84. →F  uel use for vehicles owned and/or controlled by British Land is collected on a quarterly basis from managing agents. → Fuel use for vehicles was converted from litres to kWh using Carbon Trust recommended factors. Diesel: 10.96, LPG: 6.98, Petrol: 9.61. → UK energy costs are calculated using ‘DECC and National Statistics Publication: Quarterly Energy Prices March 2010’. Electricity: 2010: £0.0842/kWh, 2009: £0.0882/kWh. Gas: 2010: £0.02117/kWh, 2009: £0.02035/kWh. Oil: 2010: £0.5414/litre, 2009: £0.44/litre. → Energy cost savings were calculated by multiplying any decrease in kWh between reporting years, and applying current year cost factors. → For Continental Europe €/kWh was used based on information provided in Europe’s Energy Portal www.energy.eu/#prices. The electricity price was applied to Continental Europe geothermal energy use as no data was available. An exchange rate of 0.8498 £:€ was applied (the average rate for 2010 sourced from www.x-rates.com). Adjustments and Restatements Energy use for 2009/10 was restated as we work continuously to improve the accuracy of our data. Specific restatements are listed below: → Office common parts have been restated due to improved accuracy of reporting and metering allowing a more transparent apportioning of energy in some of our offices. →T  he above restatement has subsequent affects in our reporting of central Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and occupier energy use. → Head Office energy use has been restated to only include British Land’s on floor general power and lighting and remove our apportionment of central HVAC. This is more consistent with our reporting of energy use across our office portfolio. → Oil use has now been reported for 2009/10. → In our retail park, shopping centre and Continental Europe portfolios, where meter readings are recorded and reviewed, we have identified inaccuracies with reporting; for instance meters recording incorrect units. → Geothermal energy reported in our Continental Europe portfolio has been restated to only report the portion used within the common parts of the property; the previously reported figure included occupier apportionment of energy used. → In our office portfolio, we use a Gross Internal Area (GIA) for all intensity and floor area calculations, with the exception of where we separately report British Land Head Office performance, where a Net Lettable Area (NLA) is used. This is so our calculations are consistent with developments in methodologies for industry standards, including Display Energy Certificates (DECs). All floor areas and intensity calculations for 2009/10 have been restated to account for this change. 5. water Metrics: Mains water use, Non-mains water. Units: m3, m3 per m2, GBP (£). Scope – managed buildings → Water use data comprises mains water and non-mains water used within our multi-let managed portfolio. Non-mains water comprises water harvested on-site and water used from boreholes. → 54 properties with a floor area of 2,454,582 m2 reported mains water use data in 2010/11, out of a total of 109 properties: 23 offices, 12 retail parks, 8 shopping centres and 11 Continental European properties. → 53 properties with a floor area of 2,455,000m2 reported water use data in 2009/10, out of a total of 111 properties: 23 offices, 12 retail parks, 7 shopping centres and 11 Continental European properties. →6  properties reported non-mains water use data in 2010/11, out of a total of 53 properties that reported water consumption: 2 offices, 1 retail park, 3 shopping centres and 0 Continental European properties. → I n 2009/10 no non-mains water data was available; subsequently data has been reported and is now included; 1 retail park and 2 shopping centres have reported such use. →A  t our offices, we report the water use as a single figure for the entire building. This is because there is rarely sufficient sub-metering to distinguish water we have management control over. → I n our retail park, shopping centre and Continental Europe portfolios, we report the water use in areas that we control – the common parts. britishland.com/crreport2011 10. reporting criteria 8 criteria Methodology – managed buildings → In the UK, water costs were calculated at £1.206 per cubic metre for 2010/11 and £1.273 per cubic metre for 2009/10. This was based on average standard volumetric charges for large and intermediate user tariffs, published by Ofwat (www.ofwat.gov.uk). → In Continental Europe, water costs are calculated using UK water costs given above. → Water financial savings were calculated on the volume of water saved multiplied by the water cost factor for 2010/11. → Total water intensity per m² was calculated using total building water use for offices and common parts water use for shopping centres, retail parks and Continental European properties, divided by gross internal floor areas for offices and common parts floor areas for shopping centres, retail parks and Continental European properties. → Total water intensity per m² only included the floor areas for properties that provided water use data. → Water intensity per full-time equivalent is only applicable to offices, as occupier data is available and also because water use in our offices is directly affected by the number of full-time equivalents, whereas it is not in our retail portfolio, which primarily uses water for landscaping and public toilets. Adjustments and Restatements Water use for 2009/10 was restated as we work continuously to improve the accuracy of our data. Specific restatements are listed below: → Improvements in the accuracy and apportionment of data in our office portfolio. → In our retail park, shopping centre and Continental Europe portfolios, where meter readings are recorded and reviewed, we have identified inaccuracies with reporting; for instance meters recording incorrect units. → We identified an issue with our online reporting system – Credit 360, whereby data was not extrapolated correctly for the initial month’s meter readings. This has now been corrected. → In our Continental Europe portfolio we have improved reporting to differentiate between occupier and common parts water use. → 3 properties were able to report non-mains water use for 2009/10. 6. waste Metrics: waste sent to Landfill, Incinerated, Composted, Recycled/re-used, sent to Materials Recycling Facilities (MRF). Units: tonnes of waste. Scope – Managed buildings →W  aste figures cover waste managed by British Land; waste managed by occupiers is not managed by British Land and is therefore excluded. →6  7 UK properties reported waste management data in 2010/11, compared to 65 properties in 2009/10. →2  Continental European properties, both located in France, were excluded from waste reporting due to incomplete data. →T  he waste streams managed at each of our sites varies across the portfolio: 33 properties reported management of common parts only waste, 20 properties reported management of common parts and some occupier waste and 15 properties reported management of all common and occupier waste. →W  e have increased the scope of our waste reporting this year to identify waste sent to Materials Recycling Facilities (MRFs) as a separate waste stream (previously reported under Recycled/Reused). → ‘Recycled or re-used’ includes: Recycled on site, sent to MRF and composting (individual breakdowns given with each relevant figure). → ‘Incineration’ includes: Incineration with and without energy recovery (individual breakdowns given with each relevant figure). Methodology Managed buildings →W  here waste was sent to Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), the performance of these facilities was requested and reported. This performance data was then applied to the total volume of waste sent to MRF and factored into waste performance numbers. For example, 100 tonnes sent to MRF, MRF performance = 50% recycling, 30% incineration and 20% landfill, therefore 50 tonnes remains as MRF recycling, 30 tonnes added to incineration figures and 20 tonnes added to landfill figures. → In 2009/10, waste to Materials Recovery Facilities was considered as 100% recycled and not recorded as a separate waste stream. →L  andfill tax costs were calculated by multiplying the volume of waste to landfill in tonnes by the relevant cost factor for landfill tax →L  andfill tax cost factors: 2010/11: £48 per tonne; 2009/10: £40 per tonne. Source: HMRC →L  andfill tax costs for Europe are based on the UK landfill tax rate and are for indicative purposes only. →L  andfill tax savings were calculated by multiplying recycled/re-used waste by the relevant landfill tax cost factor for each year.

These have a combined total construction value of approximately £7,840,00 of which 80% was spent this year. Waste not reported was predominantly from small retail projects earlier in the year; we estimate the waste not reported would constitute less than 10% of our total developments waste, by tonnage. We consider our waste figures have a fairly high accuracy rate as it is a legal requirement in the UK to document and report construction waste generated and its disposal. No pro-rating is undertaken for developments site waste information given the diversity of site activities across the developments. → 10 projects reported demolition and strip-out waste; 22 were not applicable. → 10 projects reported construction waste; 12 were not applicable; 10 did not report construction waste. → 4 projects reported both construction and demolition waste. Methodology Managed developments → Developments waste is either ‘diverted from landfill’ or ‘landfilled’; there is no further breakdown and some ‘diverted’ materials could be incinerated. → Fit-out waste arising from our developments sites is classified as ‘construction’ this year as it proved too difficult to segregate. Strip-out waste is classified as demolition. → Site waste reporting varies between tonnes and cubic metres of waste across the industry. We request that sites gather tonnage figures; where this is not possible the contractors use industry standard conversion factors and report the tonnage figures through Credit 360. → Landfill tax costs are for indicative purposes only based on the currently UK Landfill tax of £48 per tonne and applied to the volume of waste sent to landfill. → Landfill tax savings are calculated by multiplying ‘diverted from landfill’ waste by the relevant landfill tax cost factor for each year. This is for indicative purposes only as not all waste included in the ‘diverted from landfill’ waste would be subject to landfill tax costs. 7. carbon Metrics: Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N20).

Adjustments and restatements → Carbon emission figures for the prior year are adjusted and restated as follows: (i) Where primary data has been found to be incorrectly reported in the preceding year. In the spirit of transparency and accuracy this is restated regardless of the overall impact. (ii) When referenced guidelines indicate including updates to emission factors that require historical restatement. Defra/DECC guidance highlights this applies to time-series factors (electricity and water) for all previous years and for all other factors for the previous two years. In line with Defra/DECC guidance, transport carbon emissions have not been restated for 2009/10. (iii) W hen referenced guidelines provide emission factors for new emission sources not previously available, and this includes historical emission factors. Where factors for new sources are made available solely for the current reporting year, they will not be applied to ‘standard’ figures covering the current year in comparison to the prior year. We will aim to report these additional emissions separately as a single year figure to demonstrate their impact on our overall footprint. We will review their ongoing inclusion in the following year carbon footprint figures. → Where considered meaningful, previous year figures will be provided next to any restated figures. britishland.com/crreport2011 10. reporting criteria 11 criteria Conversion factors Resource type UK France Italy Portugal Spain Electricity generated Electricity Generated Scope 2 Direct GHG 0.50410 0.08214 0.45076 0.45862 0.38899 (kgCO2e/kWh) Electricity Generated Scope 3 life-cycle GHG 0.06688 0.01102 0.06047 0.06152 0.05218 (kgCO2e/kWh) Electricity losses Electricity Losses Scope 3 Direct GHG (kgCO2e/kWh) 0.04112 0.00549 0.02596 0.03824 0.04170 Electricity Losses Scope 3 life-cycle GHG 0.00497 0.00074 0.00348 0.00513 0.00560 (kgCO2e/kWh) Gas Natural Gas Scope 1 Direct GHG (kgCO2e/kWh) 0.18523 NA NA 0.332 NA (Gross Calorific Value) Natural Gas Scope 3 life-cycle GHG (kgCO2e/kWh) 0.01799 NA NA NA NA Oil Gas oil Scope 1 Direct GHG (kgCO2e/kWh) 0.27533 NA NA NA NA Gas oil Scope 3 life-cycle GHG (kgCO2e/kWh) 0.04798 NA NA NA NA Geothermal Electricity Generated Scope 2 Direct GHG NA NA 0.45076 NA NA (kgCO2e/kWh) Electricity Generated Scope 3 life-cycle GHG NA NA 0.06047 NA NA (kgCO2e/kWh) Electricity Losses Scope 3 Direct GHG (kgCO2e/kWh) NA NA 0.02596 NA NA Electricity Losses Scope 3 life-cycle GHG NA NA 0.00348 NA NA (kgCO2e/kWh) Refrigerants (2009/10) R407c (GWP/tonne) 1526 NA NA NA NA R134a (GWP/tonne) 1300 NA NA NA NA Refrigerants (2010/11) R407c (GWP/tonne) 1526 NA NA NA 1526 R134a (GWP/tonne) 1300 NA NA NA NA Fuel use Diesel Scope 1 (kg CO2e/litre) 2.672 NA NA NA NA Diesel Scope 3 (kg CO2e/litre) 0.5067 NA NA NA NA Petrol Scope 1 (kg CO2e/litre) 2.322 NA NA NA NA Petrol Scope 3 (kg CO2e/litre) 0.4109 NA NA NA NA Water Water supply 2008/09 (kg CO2e / m )3 0.3000 0.3000 0.3000 0.3000 0.3000 britishland.com/crreport2011 10. reporting criteria 12 criteria Resource type UK British Land travel Average car: GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.20825 Average car: Life-cycle GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.03754 Short-haul international average: GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.09797 Short-haul international average: Life-cycle GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.01803 Medium hybrid: GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.1202 Medium hybrid: Life-cycle GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.02127 Black cab: GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.20034 Black cab: Life-cycle GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.03563 Local London bus: GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.08912 Local London bus: Life-cycle GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.01697 National rail: GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.05651 National rail: Life-cycle GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.00859 Light rail and tram: GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.07730 Light rail and tram: Life-cycle GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.01031 Tube: GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.07462 Tube: Life-cycle GHG (kgCO2 per vehicle km) 0.00995 Developments → British Land commissioned an embodied carbon study from Davis Langdon to provide a reliable overview of the level of embodied carbon associated with the current development portfolio. The report provides an overview of the development related embodied carbon across the financial year 2010/11 and a forecast for the coming year 2011/12. The forecast has not been included in this report. → The Davis Langdon analysis was required to capture not only the embodied carbon associated with the materials and systems used in construction but also the potential wastage, on-site energy usage and transportation factors associated with development. In addition, to present these in terms of both CO2 and CO2e to allow for maximum reporting flexibility. → In order to measure the embodied carbon impact of the British Land portfolio, Davis Langdon employed a range of carbon analysis tools and data libraries developed specifically for the measurement and calculation of embodied carbon in buildings. To allow for the multi-variant nature of this study Davis Langdon developed a specific analysis model outside of their main analysis tool the Carbon Ready Reckoner such that they could present the detailed component and material levels in both CO2 and CO2e, together with the additional reporting factors. → To determine a reliable overview of the portfolio and to avoid assessing every project by ‘deep-dive’ analysis, Davis Langdon analysed in detail three of the largest and most representative projects to form a core of data and series of benchmarks; and from there, they pro-rated applicable m2 carbon benchmarks to the rest of the portfolio of projects by typology; for instance, a residential benchmark was applied to a residential project. The projects used were North East Quadrant (NEQ) residential and commercial, The Leadenhall Building vertical commercial, and Whiteley Village retail park. To analyse these projects, Davis Langdon used the detailed cost plans (the quantum’s) and procurement strategy data (how it is/would be put together) to produce the embodied carbon values on a material, component and elemental basis. To further refine the m2 carbon benchmarks Davis Langdon supplemented, where necessary, data from our own internal benchmarks, databases and project experience to ensure each one was as robust as possible. Assumptions and Data Sources The following assumptions have been made: →P  roject typology assumptions for the portfolio benchmarks: Due to the high number of small to medium sized retail unit and retail park projects in the portfolio, it was agreed to use a standard GIA (Gross Internal Area) of 500m2 per project to provide an appropriate median point and produce a more normalised view; this is a conservative estimate of typical retail development. Assumptions on build methodology for the wider portfolio/other types of projects were assumed against standard, industry accepted practices for the type. → Base material data: The models used embodied CO2e data from the Bath University ICE/BSRIA database and for most materials data. This was supplemented in some areas by the Ecoinvent inventory housed in the SimaPro software package. For timber data, we used our own data generated from a study on bio-renewable materials for the National Non-Foods Crops Centre (NNFCC) an industry benchmark study. For steel, further allowances for forming, fabrication, casting etc. have been added, based on research on energy costs for UK steel working factories. → Component data: The component data in the models used comprised ‘recipes’ of composite rates which have been assembled for hundreds of typical building components. Each composite rate model consists of volumes, densities, weights and where applicable, recycled content (such as metals) for each component. This also includes services items such as lifts. Each rate may be ‘flexed’ by factors such as thickness or concrete mix for floors, or capacity and number of levels for a lift for example. Where a library data item couldn’t be found to match the cost plan item, a similar library item was used and a percentage adjustment applied to reflect whether the cost plan item is more or less intensive than the library item. However, no such items were found. A further layer, synchronised to the embodied CO2e and CO2 data, calculates the weights for each material within each component. britishland.com/crreport2011 10. reporting criteria 13 criteria →S  ite energy: These are based on Davis Langdon estimates according to industry standard construction practices; not reported site energy information. →W  aste data: A percentage waste allowance has been applied to each material type, these figures are based on WRAP’s standard industry practise database and Davis Langdon’s internal benchmarks. →T  ransport data: As mentioned above the quantities are used to calculate the weights for each material type across all components. This, coupled with the waste allowance is used for calculating tonnages, which, in turn, is used for estimating emissions from transport. → I t is assumed that all developments embodied carbon figures are part of the Scope 3 reporting element of the British Land carbon footprint. 8.
