In the energy auction have been allocated 528 MW of wind power at an average price of 70.4 USD/ After the 2007 National Summit “Grenelle de l’Environnement”, MWh and 1,519 MW of alternative energy were awarded at an which established the French environmental policy, the “Grenelle average price of $ 76.6/MWh. The fierce competition has lowered 2” adopted on June 29, 2010, established a new framework for the average prices, worrying promoters and suppliers, given wind power, with a minimum threshold of five turbines per wind the risk of failure of some projects, especially those attributed farm and stipulating a withdrawal of 500 meters of housing. In to inexperienced promoters. In December 2010, the new Ten conjunction with legislation on Wind Development Areas, the Year Expansion Plan for Energy 2019 provided a major boost in “Grenelle 2” introduces new requirements, but also demands the renewable energy, since it is not scheduled the construction of any inclusion of wind farms on “Regional Development Areas.” Wind conventional power plants burning fossil fuels, after 2014. With this farms will still be subject to regulation ICPE (“industries classified strategy, it is estimated more than 6 GW of wind power installed in to protect the environment”) with additional requirements for 2019 (currently ~ 1.5 GW), but the industry estimates highest values. licensing. To achieve 19 GW of onshore wind power in 2020, this framework provides for the installation of 500 turbines per year, United States of America with a triennial review. Although without new federal legislation on climate issues, the Belgium Environmental Protection Agency drafted a plan to set limits on emissions of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. The Walloon region has approved new renewable production The “Tax Relief Bill”, of December 2010, develops policies for share, considerably above earlier targets: 13.50% in 2011 and 15.75% clean energy as part of a broader scheme of tax incentives to in 2012. From 2013, the regulator (CWAPE) recommended to the encourage development of renewable energy, including: a oneGovernment an increase of 2.25 percentage points per year up to year extension of the Grant Program 1603, authorizing projects 33.75% in 2020. which will receive subsidies equivalent to 30% of eligible project costs and the deductibility of 100% of the project over a year for Poland facilities starting operations in 2011 and 50% for projects starting operations operation in 2012. In 2010, twelve States have proposed According to the new legal framework for energy, of January 2010, and five have endorsed the creation or the increase of the share the grid operator shall prepare the impact assessment of the for renewable energies. In California, utilities can use renewable production facilities. The promoter that requires the connection energy credits to comply with the goal of 33%, pending regulations. must prepay the interconnection fee of 30 PLN (1 zloty = € 0.26) per kW. The grid operator is obliged to provide the grid connection (or reject it, in case of technical constraints) within 150 days of the request. Romania Strengthening support for the renewable energy sector, was extended from 2015 to 2017, the producers’ right to receive two green certificates per MWh. Moreover, the share of green certificates for 2012 rose from 8.3% to 12%, and will increase 1pp every year (except in 2019, which will only grow by 0.5 pp) up to 20% in 2020.

By the end of 2010 the total installed capacity was 9,943 MW of which 4,735 MW (48%) from hydroelectric plants and 5,208 MW from thermoelectric power plants. 2010 was characterized by very favorable inflows throughout the year, resulting in a hidraulicity well above average, with the hydrological index reaching 1,31, one of the highest values in the past years (1,33 in 2003). The Hydroelectric Ordinary Regime generation reached its greatest value ever (14,376 GWh), while the storage reservoirs level registered about 63% of their maximum capacity, despite the high production. On the other hand, thermoelectric Ordinary Regime generation stood at 10,092 GWh, the lowest in recent years. The Special Regime net generation (1,625 GWh) grew 33% over 2009, as a result of hydro generation (+69%), biomass (+57%) and cogeneration (10%). In 2010 the power requested in the network in mainland Portugal has reached a new historical record in January 11th, with 9,403 MW, about 185 MW above the previous maximum that occurred in 2009. On March 31, Barreiro power plant ceased the electric and thermal generation activity, which had 56 MW capacity. On April 1, Fisigen’s new cogeneration power plant entered into service, with two natural gas generator groups, recovery boilers and alternators, counting about 24 MW of installed capacity. Regarding the strengthening of the Hydroelectric portfolio capacity, EDP Produção continues focused on the construction of the capacity repowering of Picote (246 MW), Bemposta (191 MW), entering into service in 2011 and Alqueva (256 MW), scheduled for 2012, as well as the development work of the General construction Contract of the Baixo Sabor Hydroelectric plant (171 MW) with entry into service scheduled for mid 2014. In the same context, it should also be noted the adjudication for the equipment supplies and the start of construction of Ribeiradio/Ermida (77 MW) and Venda Nova III capacity repowering (736 MW), scheduled to enter into service in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In terms of licensing new hydropower projects, the EIS’s for the hydroelectric plants of Fridão and Alvito and the Salamonde repowering had a conditional favorable decision. Salamonde has already the civil engineering contract awarded. In what concerns to the power plants’ certification, it is important to highlight that Sines achieved the registration for Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) with the following purpose: “Central de Sines electricity generation by coal combustion and ash and plaster management” and also the registration of some more generation centers of EDP Produção (Alto Rabagão, Touvedo, Vila Nova, Frades, Régua, Vilar Tabuaço, Varosa, Caldeirão, Aguieira e Raiva). 35 annual report 2010 business / summary of activities Generation in iberia portugal Generation portfolio (MW) 9.974 9.943 9.015 9.091 2.020 1.989 1.993 2.000 Unid 2010 2009 2008 2007 2.039 1.176 1.176 2.039 1.192 1.180 1.180 1.180 Installed Capacity in Portugal * MW 14,215 13,304 12,262 12,147 EDP's Installed Capacity * MW 9,943 9,974 9,091 9,015 EDP's market share * % 69.9 75.0 74.1 74.2 4.654 4.735 4.735 4.735 Source: REN Technical data Number of Generating Groups* # 190 190 186 160 Ordinary Regime Generation # 114 116 114 114 2007 2008 2009 2010 Hydroelectric power plants # 93 93 93 93 Hydro Coal Command Centre # 1 1 1 1 CCGT Others Generating power plants # 3 3 3 3 power plants # 35 35 35 35 Thermoelectric power plants # 21 23 21 21 Coal # 4 4 4 4 Ordinary Regime Generation CCGT # 5 5 3 3 Fuel oil # 10 12 12 12 – Availability (%) Gasoil # 2 2 2 2 95,7 96,6 Special Regime Generation # 76 74 72 46 93,4 93,3 Mini-Hydroelectric power plants # 67 67 67 42 Biomass # 4 4 2 1 93,2 92,8 92,4 91,1 Cogeneration # 5 3 3 3 2007 2008 2009 2010 Installed Capacity at 31 December* Ordinary Regime Installed Capacity MW 9,619 9,675 8,812 8,824 Hydroelectric power plants MW 4,578 4,578 4,578 4,578 Hydroelectric Thermoelectric Thermoelectric power plants MW 5,040 5,096 4,234 4,246 Coal MW 1,180 1,180 1,180 1,192 CCGT MW 2,039 2,039 1,176 1,176 Special Regime Generation Fuel oil MW 1,657 1,713 1,713 1,713 Availability (%) Gasoil MW 165 165 165 165 96,3 94,8 95,7 95,6 Special Regime Installed Capacity MW 324 299 279 192 94,8 95,5 95,1 Hydroelectric power plants MW 157 157 157 76 90,4 94,9 Biomass MW 32 32 11 5 90,2 Cogeneration MW 136 111 111 111 Total Capacity MW 9,943 9,974 9,091 9,015 83,2 82,7 Net Generation* 2007 2008 2009 2010 Ordinary Regime Generation GWh 24,468 23,514 21,642 24,718 Hydroelectric power plants GWh 14,376 7,642 6,435 9,361 Mini-Hydro Biomass Cogeneration Thermoelectric power plants ** GWh 10,092 15,872 15,207 15,357 Coal GWh 4,889 8,869 6,926 8,048 CCGT** GWh 5,156 6,696 7,481 6,038 Fuel oil GWh 46 307 801 1,271 Net Generation (GWh) Gasoil GWh 1 0 0 0 Special Regime Generation GWh 1,625 1,222 869 906 25.624 26.093 Mini-Hydroelectric power plants GWh 622 368 170 134 24.736 22.511 Biomass GWh 203 129 49 28 Cogeneration GWh 800 725 650 744 11.095 16.129 16.726 Total Generation GWh 26,093 24,736 22,511 25,624 15.906 ** In 2009 includes 497 GWh generated in Lares testing period Energy Balance 14.998 9.495 6.604 8.010 Hydrological index # 1.31 0.77 0.56 0.77 EDP Group power plants 2007 2008 2009 2010 Hydroelectric output GWh 14,376 7,642 6,435 9,361 Thermal output GWh 10,092 15,872 15,207 15,357 Hydroelectric Thermoelectric generation generation Mini-hydroelectric output GWh 622 368 170 134 Wind power output (ENERNOVA) GWh 1,472 1,273 1,026 733 Biomass output GWh 203 129 49 28 Cogeneration output GWh 800 725 650 744 EDP Group Net generation GWh 27,565 26,009 23,537 26,357 Energy Balance 2010 (TWh) Direct sales to industrial costumers GWh -21 Output to grid (EDP Group) GWh 27,565 26,009 23,537 26,336 50,6 52,2 50,0 49,9 2,6 Other generators with PPA GWh 7,701 8,088 8,596 8,231 4,8 7,5 9,4 Other generators with PPA GWh 14,827 11,927 9,670 8,524 22,0 Importer/(Exporter) balance GWh 2,623 4,777 9,431 7,488 16,2 19,1 17,6 Pumped hydroelectric storage GWh -512 -929 -639 -541 00 Consumption Related to output GWh 52,204 49,872 50,595 50,038 Synchronous compensation GWh 0 -1 0 -9 26,3 23,5 27,6 26,0 Own consumption in generation GWh -5 -5 -5 -5 Energy Delivered to Distribution GWh 52,199 49,866 50,590 50,024 2007 2008 2009 2010 * Excludes wind power ** In 2009 excludes 497 GWh generated in Lares testing period EDP Group output Other generators Importation 36 Alqueva Hydroelectric Power Plant Sines Thermoelectric Power Plant 37 AnnuAl report 2010 business / summary of activities GENERATION IN IBERIA SPAIN PRESENCE OF EDP GROUP IN THE ELECTRICITY Hydroelectric power plants GENERATION ACTIVITY IN SPAIN* Cogeneration power plants Thermoelectric power plants CCGT power plants *Excludes wind power Nuclear Astúrias Viszcaya Tudela Barcelona Valladolid Guadalajara Toledo 38 2010 main events of the electricity generation in Spain In Spain, EDP Group is present in electricity generation through HC Energía under Ordinary and Special Regime Generation.

In 2010, HC Energía reached a historical record of hydroelectric generation , with a production of 1,045 GWh, exceeding the 1996’s figures. In December, Soto 5 entered into service, with an installed capacity of 428 MW. This is the second combined cycle power plant in Asturias, the fourth CCGT installed by the Group in Spain, concluded two months ahead the schedule. The total availability of coal plants was 92.3% and the unavailability due to breakdowns, only 1.4%, which confirms the excellent operation of the equipment, particularly given the extraordinary flexible operability of these groups, due to the complementary nature of coal over gas. The availability of combined cycles was 88.9% and the unavailability due to failure was 6.8%. The combined cycle also had a very flexible operation, with frequent night stops at the weekends. 39 annual report 2010 business / summary of activities Generation in Iberia spain Generation portfolio (MW) 3,875 Unid 2010 2009 2008 2007 3,401 3,427 288 282 308 Installed Capacity in Spain * MW 77,634 75,010 75,004 71,789 2,565 1,698 283 1,229 1,229 EDP's Installed Capacity * MW 3,875 3,427 3,401 2,565 393 EDP's market share * % 5.0 4.6 4.5 3.6 * Source: Informe Anual REE 1,460 1,460 1,460 1,460 Number of Generating Groups* # 38 40 38 39 Ordinary Regime Generation # 21 20 20 18 429 429 429 429 Hydroelectric power plants # 12 12 12 12 Thermoelectric power plants # 9 8 8 6 2007 2008 2009 2010 Coal # 4 4 4 4 Hydro Coal CCGT # 4 3 3 1 CCGT Others Nuclear # 1 1 1 1 Special Regime Generation # 17 20 18 21 Hydroelectric power plants** # 1 1 1 1 Thermoelectric power plants # 16 19 17 20 Ordinary Regime Generation Biomass # 1 2 2 2 Availability (%) Cogeneration # 9 11 9 12 Waste # 6 6 6 6 96.7 94.8 Installed Capacity at 31 de December* 94.1 92.3 Ordinary Regime Installed Capacity MW 3,740 3,272 3,271 2,435 90.7 92.3 91.4 Hydroelectric power plants MW 426 426 426 426 88.9 Thermoelectric power plants MW 3,314 2,846 2,845 2,009 Coal MW 1,460 1,460 1,460 1,460 2007 2008 2009 2010 CCGT*** MW 1,698 1,229 1,229 393 Nuclear MW 156 156 156 156 Coal CCGT Special Regime Installed Capacity MW 135 155 130 130 Hydroelectric power plants** MW 3 3 3 3 Thermoelectric power plants MW 132 152 127 127 Biomass MW 3 7 7 7 Special Regime Generation Cogeneration MW 46 63 38 38 Availability (%) Waste MW 83 82 82 82 Total Capaticy MW 3,875 3,427 3,401 2,565 Net Generation* 95.0 93.4 Ordinary Regime Generation GWh 10,942 11,346 12,416 13,936 91.0 88.3 Hydroelectric power plants GWh 1,038 877 812 786 91.0 86.6 87.6 Thermoelectric power plants GWh 9,904 10,469 11,604 13,151 83.6 Coal GWh 4,244 5,865 6,575 10,124 CCGT*** GWh 4,470 3,491 3,831 1,795 Nuclear GWh 1,190 1,113 1,198 1,232 0 Special Regime Generation GWh 916 896 700 553 2007 2008 2009 2010 Hydroelectric power plants** GWh 7 2 2 2 Thermoelectric power plants GWh 909 894 698 551 Cogeneration Waste Biomass Biomass GWh 0 6 6 8 Cogeneration GWh 356 369 192 90 Waste GWh 553 519 500 453 Net Generation (GWh) Total Generation GWh 11,858 12,242 13,117 14,489 14,489 Energy Balance 13,117 Hydrological index # 1.34 0.81 0.66 0.64 2,571 12,242 11,858 EDP Group power plants 2,711 1,795 2,886 3,144 Hydroelectric output GWh 1,038 877 812 786 Thermoelectric output GWh 4,244 5,865 6,575 10,124 3,831 3,491 Nuclear output GWh 1,190 1,113 1,198 1,232 4,470 10,124 CCGT output GWh 4,470 3,491 3,831 1,795 Mini-hydroelectric output GWh 7 2 2 2 6,575 5,865 4,244 Wind power output (ENERNOVA) GWh 4,355 3,275 2,632 2,056 Biomass output GWh 0 6 6 8 Cogeneration output GWh 356 369 192 90 2007 2008 2009 2010 Waste output GWh 553 519 500 453 Coal CCGT Others EDP Group Net Generation GWh 16,214 15,517 15,749 16,546 Other generators ORG GWh 178,130 181,116 207,924 209,887 Other generators SRG GWh 85,242 74,020 62,772 53,762 Importer/(Exporter) balance GWh -8,339 -8,106 -11,040 -5,750 Energy Balance 2010 (TWh) Pumped hydroelectric storage GWh -4,413 -3,763 -3,731 -4,349 258 260 257 Consumption Related to output GWh 266,834 258,784 271,673 270,095 249 17 16 16 16 Own consumption in generation GWh -6,604 -7,081 -8,338 -8,753 Own consumption in transmission grid GWh 0 0 0 0 Losses GWh -3,398 -3,090 -3,440 -3,281 Energy Delivered to Distribution GWh 256,832 248,613 259,896 258,061 247 255 241 249 * Excludes wind power ** Includes mini-hydro from EDP Renováveis *** In 2010 excludes 284 GWh generated during tests in Soto 5 -6 -11 -8 -8 2007 2008 2009 2010 Exportation EDP Group output 40 Other generators Soto Ribera – Soto 5 combined cycle gas turbine Proaza Hydroelectric Power Plant Tanes Hydroelectric Power Plant 41 annual report 2010 business / summary of activities EDP Renováveis PRESENCE OF EDP GROUP IN THE OPERATION MW Installed Capacity OF WIND FARMS IN THE WORLD MW under construction (1) Includes 239 MW from ENEOP2 France Belgium 57 MW USA 284 MW 13 MW 3.224 MW 99 MW Poland 120 MW 70 MW Portugal 838 MW(1) 58 MW Romania 90 MW Spain 138 MW 2.050 MW 201 MW Brazil 14 MW 70 MW 42 2010 MAIN EVENTS OF THE EDP RENOVÁVEIS ACTIVITY EDP Group is present in the activity of wind energy generation through EDP Renováveis (EDPR), which currently is present in 11 countries: Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, United Kingdom, Italy, United States, Canada and Brazil. In 2010, EDPR increased its capacity by 1,101 MW (19.7%), of which 501 MW (17.1%) in Europe and 600 MW (22.9%) in the U.S. By year-end 2010, EDPR held a market share of total wind energy capacity installed in Europe of 4.1% and in the U.S. of 8.0%. The average net capacity factor, in 2010, was 27% in Europe and 32% in the U.S. Operational excellence and prime location of EDPR’s wind farms allowed the reach of superior net capacity factors comparing to the industry (as the case for Spain with +2 b.p.). EDPR EUROPE (EDPR EU) EDPR EU has been a top list company in wind energy additions over the last few years, with a total wind energy capacity installed of 3.439 MW and a pipeline in various stages of development of 11.3 GW, including 480 MW under construction. In Portugal, capacity installed summed 838 MW after new capacity additions of 158 MW during the year, mainly from the entry into operation of ENEOP2’s wind farms, 58 MW were under construction at the end of 2010. In Spain, capacity installed was 2,050 MW after an increase of 189 MW versus prior year. At the end of 2010, there were 201 MW under construction. In 2010, installed capacity reached 284 MW in France, after an increase in the year of 64 MW, while in Belgium it remained at 57 MW. The Korsze wind farm in Poland, with a capacity of 70 MW, was under construction by year-end 2010. In the country, EDPR had 120 MW of capacity in operation. The year 2010 was marked by EDPR’s first wind farm operation in Romania, Pestera, with a capacity of 90 MW. The Cernavoda wind park with 138 MW was under construction at the end of 2010. In the development of offshore, a total capacity estimated at 1.3 GW was exclusively assigned in the UK to Moray Renewables, a joint-venture between EDPR EU and SeaEnergy, created for the development of offshore wind farms in the north-east of Scotland. In early 2010, EDPR EU took another important step in its strategy of expansion through the acquisition of 520 MW of projects under development in Italy. EDPR NORTH AMERICA (EDPR NA) The activity in the U.S. is operated by the North American platform EDPR NA. At the end of 2010, EDPR NA owned 17 wind farms in operation located in 10 different states, summing a total capacity of 3.224 MW, after the installation of new 600 MW during the year. EDPR NA entered Canada in 2010 to look for new growth opportunities in this attractive market, with the acquisition of several early-stage Ontario development assets. By the end of 2010, EDPR NA held a pipeline of 19,2 GW, including 99 MW already under construction. EDPR BRAZIL (EDPR SA) EDPR created a joint-venture in Brazil, in June 2008, together with EDP Energias do Brasil, named EDP Renewables Brazil (EDPR SA).

This operation, based essentially on efficiency improvements and quality of services in the distribution grids, distributed over 57TWh of energy in 2010 PORTUGAL In Portugal, EDP Distribuição has the concession of the National Distribution Grid in Medium and High Voltage Electricity and the concession of all the 278 municipal Distribution Grids in Low voltage, on the mainland. It has 220,318 km of network and 47.8TWh of electricity distributed in 2010 to a total of 6.2 million costumers. The investment policies implemented in the recent years, along with the acceleration of the investment in the grid automation and the new processes implemented in maintenance, have had excellent results in the technical service quality indicators evolution, particularly in the ICEIT (Interruption Time Equivalent to the Installed Capacity), registering in 2010 116 minutes, excluding extraordinary events, perfectly comparable with the values reported by other distributors with similar grid structure and consumption. The year 2010 was affected by three extraordinary events, including the Xynthia storm on February 27th, the strong wind and rain on October 3rd, affecting 1,200 and 300 thousand costumers respectively in the North and Center of Portugal. There was also the tornado on December 7 in Tomar and Sertã, which affected 50 thousand costumers. These exceptional events represented in ICEIT 30, 5 and 1 minutes, respectively. The new requirements in electricity supply and demand, resulting from the achievement of energy policy goals, sustain the effort to develop new abilities to manage and fit in the increasing levels of energy sources and generation distributed. Through the InovGrid Project, 20,000 Energy Boxes have been assembled in costumers facilities in the city of Évora chosen to lead the Intelligent energy grid concept (InovGrid) – and 320 DTC’s (Distribution Transformar Controller) in transforming stations, covering almost all of them. A new technology based on LEDs was also tested in the Public lighting grid. Under the electric mobility concern, there was created EDP MOP – Operador de Pontos de Carregamento de Mobilidade Eléctrica, S.A., regarding the development of the electric vehicle network supply in Portugal. A pilot grid was implemented, covering 25 Portuguese cities. Micro-generation in low voltage has a notorious increasing adhesion, with 5,235 new micro-generators connected to the grid, with an 18.6 MW capacity. 164 new Specials Regime Producers (PRE) were also connected to the distribution network with 271.2 MVA. In both cases, there is a predominance of photovoltaic and wind technologies. At the end of the year 9,202 micro-generators where connected to the grid, with a 32.6 MW installed capacity and 749 PRE with 5,079 MWA of installed power. SPAIN In Spain, HC Energía conducts the electricity distribution business in 5 Autonomous communities with approximately 22,200 KM of network and more than 9 TWh distributed power, with a 2% growth vs 2009. The investments carried out in recent years, as well as the implemented procedures, allowed a decrease of the interruption of supply to less than an hour in Asturias, the main distribution area, which concentrates more than 96% of HC costumers. HC Energía continues to lead the quality of service in the Spanish electric System. Regardless the June 16/17 floods, HC Energía registered the best quality service index ever with a value of 46 minutes (0.77 hours), which implies a 9 minute decrease facing the values registered in 2009, the previous record registered. On July 29, HC Energía sold electricity transmission assets to Rede Electrica Espanhola (REE). This operation is subject to approval by the competent authorities. 47 AnnuAl report 2010 business / summary of activities DISTRIBUTION IN IBERIA Energy distributed (TWh) 56.5 56.1 55.3 57.2 Unid 2010 2009 2008 2007 9.6 9.7 9.1 9.3 PORTUGAL Energy Input in the Distribution Grid 46.9 46.5 46.1 47.8 For the regulated market GWh 33,484 40,452 48,796 43,779 For the free market GWh 18,130 8,971 1,306 5,731 Total GWh 51,614 49,422 50,102 49,510 note: does not include VHV consumptions Outgoing Energy from the Grid 2007 2008 2009 2010 energy delivered to the distribution grid GWh 51,614 49,422 50,102 49,510 Portugal Spain Distribution losses GWh -3,778 -3,277 -3,633 -2,591 Outgoing energy from the grid GWh 47,836 46,146 46,468 46,919 Installed Capacity Equivalent Energy Sales for the Regulated Market GWh 30,581 37,626 45,289 41,546 Interruption Time in Portugal (minutes) Very high voltage GWh 1,012 1,330 1,667 1,527 High voltage GWh 2,095 3,723 6,358 6,265 31 36 Medium voltage GWh 4,795 9,128 14,052 10,290 Special low voltage GWh 2,498 3,163 3,340 2,491 low voltage GWh 18,653 18,740 18,364 19,523 111 113 121 116 Street lighting GWh 1,528 1,542 1,509 1,449 Energy output for the liberalised GWh 17,255 8,520 1,180 5,373 2007 2008 2009 2010 Market Very high voltage GWh 512 208 0 3 ICEIT Extraordinary events High voltage GWh 4,387 2,089 2 11 Medium voltage GWh 9,731 4,770 263 4,098 Special low voltage GWh 1,228 413 219 996 Operacional efficiency in Portugal low voltage GWh 1,398 1,040 695 264 iCeit Min 152 152 113 111 12.2 13.0 11.2 11.6 points of Supply m# 6,149 6,120 6,088 6,054 employees # 3,670 3,778 3,996 4,242 1,675 1,620 1,524 1,427 Grid structure indicators extension km 220,318 218,226 214,856 212,317 overhead lines km 172,181 170,931 169,321 167,486 underground lines km 48,138 47,295 45,534 44,831 Substations # 404 399 397 382 transforming stations # 63,223 62,036 61,157 59,841 2007 2008 2009 2010 EFFICIENCY INDICATORS points of Supply/employee # 1,675 1,620 1,524 1,427 Points of Supply/Employee energy/employee GWh 13.0 12.2 11.6 11.2 Energy/Employee Spain Outgoing Energy from the Grid Installed Capacity Equivalent energy delivered to the distribution grid GWh 9,704 9,519 10,029 10,008 Interruption Time in Spain (min) Distribution losses GWh 384 389 350 386 65 Outgoing energy from the grid GWh 9,320 9,131 9,679 9,622 59 55 Electricity distribution 46 High voltage GWh 5,401 5,322 5,762 5,882 Medium voltage GWh 1,273 1,215 1,284 1,204 low voltage GWh 2,646 2,594 2,633 2,536 Total GWh 9,320 9,131 9,679 9,622 total Market Spain GWh 237,892 229,899 240,797 238,974 2007 2008 2009 2010 EDP market share % 3.9 4.0 4.0 4.0 iCeit Min 46 55 65 59 Operational Eficiency in Spain points of Supply m# 651 645 628 617 employees # 386 368 366 389 24.7 26.4 24.8 24.1 Grid structure indicators extension km 22,265 21,874 21,356 20,995 1,717 1,751 1,687 overhead lines km 18,148 17,995 17,836 17,669 1,585 underground lines km 4,117 3,878 3,520 3,325 Substations # 53 53 48 48 transforming stations # 6,507 6,464 6,327 6,192 Efficiency indicators points of Supply/employee # 1,687 1,751 1,717 1,585 energy/employee GWh 24.1 24.8 26.4 24.7 2007 2008 2009 2010 Points of Supply/Employee 48 Energy/Employee Desterro Substation S.

In Spain is present in the Last Resort Market by HC Energía Last Resort and in the liberalized market through HC Energía, Naturgás energía and Energía CHC, acting in competition with other Iberian players. PORTUGAL During 2010, the overall number of customers in the Regulated Market fell by 0.9%, as a result of the outflow of nearly 100 thousand customers to the free market, partly offset by the inflow of 51 thousand new customers. Electricity sales in the regulated market decreased by about 19% in relation to the previous year, particularly in HV and MV, with reductions of nearly 44% and 48%, respectively. These huge reductions are the effect of the referred migration of customers to the liberalized market. 2010 was a year of consolidation for the electricity liberalized market, after a new build-up in 2009, namely in the B2B segment. A framework of more favorable tariff and market price conditions allowed the development of an increasing competitive market in which EDP Comercial, through a strong partnership relation kept with its Clients, remained at the leadership position. Throughout the year, EDP Comercial achieved a market share of 51% of the energy supplied and, in the end of the year, it was providing energy for 88% of the facilities in the liberalized market. Such a performance was an outcome from a sustainable action of the company business units. In 2010, and following the footsteps already given in 2009, the B2B segment was once again the one with more competitive dynamics, which reflected in new players’ entries in the market. An adjusted value proposal to the Clients needs resulted in a sales volume of nearly 7,5 TWh, during the year, and in a Client portfolio of 8,993 facilities, at the end of 2010. Regarding the B2C segment, EDP Comercial was the first choice for 305 thousand residential Clients and Small Businesses (90% of the liberalized market), at the end of the year, corresponding to a sales volume of nearly 1.3 TWh. For EDP Serviços, 2010 was a year of consolidation of the existing value proposal, sustained in three strategic vectors – Energy efficiency, Multitechnical services and Decentralized energy generation – but also for the development of custom made solutions oriented to specific needs, such as Small and Medium Enterprises and Household Clients (namely the Solar Photovoltaic Solutions for Microgeneration). SPAIN EDP Group attained approximately 651 thousand Clients which represents an increase of 23% from 2009. The B2B market segment recorded 18,214 GWh of energy sold, 41% more than the previous year. In addition, the structure of the Customer Portfolio was optimized, thus improving the margin of the Major Accounts and Companies segment. Depending on the actions performed, this type of customer’s overall satisfaction level was higher than 95%. The strategy of this segment has been focused on the analysis of portfolios, in order to attract cost-effective customers and to obtain their loyalty with a dual offering and residential level is approximately 87%. 51 annual report 2010 business / summary of activities Supply in Iberia Purchase of energy in Portugal (TWh) Unid 2010 2009 2008 2007 50 40 Last Resort Market in Portugal Number of costumers 30 Very high voltage # 21 26 53 55 High voltage # 177 193 234 213 20 Medium voltage # 12,803 17,681 22,913 20,748 10 Special low voltage # 23,985 28,246 32,170 25,687 Low voltage # 5,702,584 5,746,352 5,785,797 5,807,784 0 Street lighting # 52,113 50,299 49,260 48,308 2007 2008 2009 2010 Total # 5,791,683 5,842,797 5,890,427 5,902,795 Market* Cogeneration Wind Hydro and other PRE Electricity sales * includes purchases in auctions Very high voltage GWh 1,012 1,330 1,667 1,527 High voltage GWh 2,095 3,723 6,358 6,265 Medium voltage GWh 4,795 9,128 14,052 10,290 Energy supply in Portugal (TWh) Special low voltage GWh 2,498 3,163 3,340 2,491 Low voltage GWh 18,653 18,740 18,364 19,523 46.9 46.5 46.1 47.8 Street lighting GWh 1,528 1,542 1,509 1,449 1.2 Total GWh 30,581 37,626 45,289 41,546 5.4 8.5 17.2 41.5 45.3 37.6 Liberalised market in portugal 30.6 Number of costumers # 357,363 277,008 197,752 151,613 EDP Comercial # 313,608 259,698 197,151 148,319 B2B # 9,082 7,535 9 5,105 2007 2008 2009 2010 B2C # 304,526 252,163 197,142 143,214 Regulated Free Other suppliers # 43,755 17,310 601 3,294 Electricity sales GWh 17,248 8,520 1,180 5,372 EDP Comercial GWh 8,794 5,529 947 3,010 Number of supply costumers in Spain B2B GWh 7,510 4,565 271 2,751 (thousands of costumers) B2C GWh 1,284 963 676 259 Other suppliers GWh 8,453 2,992 233 2,363 651 531 Regulated / Last Resort Market in Spain Number of costumers 89 117 High voltage # 0 0 4 12 565 549 Medium voltage # 0 0 77 306 422 359 Low voltage # 359,145 422,252 549,317 564,773 Total # 359,145 422,252 549,398 565,091 Electricity sales High voltage GWh 0 1,559 5,064 5,629 2007 2008 2009 2010 Medium voltage GWh 0 11 133 268 Regulated Free Low voltage GWh 1,099 1,563 2,043 2,142 Total GWh 1,099 3,133 7,240 8,039 Liberalised Market in Spain Electricity Supply in Spain (TWh) Number of costumers # 5,248,118 3,028,182 2,153,754 1,697,340 HCEnergía + NG Energía # 650,860 530,778 117,175 89,410 20.3 B2B # 7,871 4,848 3,400 2,680 11.2 12.5 16.2 B2C # 642,989 525,930 113,775 86,730 Other suppliers # 4,597,258 2,497,404 2,036,579 1,607,930 8.0 7.2 Electricity sales GWh 183,589 143,298 107,174 72,961 3.1 1.1 HCEnergía + NG Energía GWh 20,342 16,234 12,507 11,236 B2B GWh 18,124 12,833 9,941 9,166 2007 2008 2009 2010 B2C GWh 2,218 3,402 2,566 2,070 Other suppliers GWh 163,247 127,063 94,666 61,725 Regulated Free Market Share Liberalised Market (%) 80.3 64.9 56.0 51.0 15.4 11.7 11.3 11.1 2007 2008 2009 2010 52 Portugal Spain Contact Center EDP Store 53 annual report 2010 business / summary of activities gas business in iberia PRESENCE OF EDP GROUP IN GAS ACTIVITY IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA Spain 9,938 KM Distribution Grid 45.6 TWh Gas Distributed 29.8 TWh Gas Supplied Portugal 824 Millions of Clients 3,827 KM Distribution Grid 6.8 TWh Gas Distributed 8.9 TWh Gas Supplied 245 Millions of Clients 54 2010 main events of the gas activity in the Iberian Peninsula EDP has a reference presence in the Iberian Peninsula natural gas market. It is present in Portugal through Portgás (acting under the brand name of EDP Gás Distribuição and EDP Serviço Universal), EDP Gás.Com (licensed trader to operate in the liberalized market) and a minority stake in Setgás. In Spain it is present in this market through Naturgas Energia. 2010, the EDP Gás Group kept increasing in points of supply (+3.7%), clients (+1.3%), natural gas distributed (+108.8%) and supplied (+57.6%). Both natural gas distributed and supplied had a accentuated increase compared with the same period of the last year in result of Gas Natural assets incorporation in December 2009 in the Autonomous Communities of Cantabria and Murcia, on one hand, and the Portuguese industrial market growth, on the other hand. The supply activity had an unfavorable economic year, specially related to competitive level of gas from long term contracts, that represents the majority of gas portfolios in Europe and, particularly, in Iberian Peninsula. Thus, in Spain, this activity had a significant contraction in margin and costumer numbers. In Portugal, and taking advantage of the current market opening, was possible to increase the captured volumes. PORTUGAL In the Distribution activity, the company continued the concession development ensuring the extension of the level of coverage, pointing out the supply of Vila Nova de Cerveira, Lousada, Valença e Paços Ferreira, and reaching an increase of more than 24,000 points of supply (+10.9% compared to 2009). The natural gas supply, since 1st of January of 2010, is totally liberalized. Despite this new market reality, EDP Gás Serviço Universal, regulated company, had decrease of the supplied volume but the number of costumers grew. On the other hand, EDP Gás Comercial solidified its position as an important player in the B2B segment, continuing focus in its strategic action in both the trading activity, trading 9.9 TWh of natural gas, and in supply activity, reaching 186 accounts and a market share of 28.4%. In 2010, EDP Comercial got the commercialization license in the natural gas and, in parallel with its role as an electricity supplier, it know operates as well in the natural gas market with a value proposal oriented to both the business Clients (B2B) and residential Clients and Small Businesses (B2C). Starting 2010, EDP Comercial was the first supplier in Portugal to present a dual offer at the B2C segment. Throughout the year, EDP Comercial supplied about 21 GWh, representing the choice of near 430 Clients, from which 340 are residential Clients and Small Businesses (B2C). SPAIN In the Transport activity, stands the conclusion of the transport pipeline Bergara-Irun phase III and the pipeline Serinya-Figueres. Also stands the pipeline Corvera-Tamon into operation and the beginning of construction of the pipeline Bilbao-Treto. In the Distribution activity, the gas distributed doubled when compared with last year because of the incorporation of high pressure assets and the two distribution company of Murcia and Cantabria. The points of supply increase about 20.000 compared to the same period of last year due to the network densification effort and in the expansion investments, like Ólvega, Berriaga Monte (La Bilbaina), Etxebarria PNN and Villarejo Salvanes (Madrid).

In addition, EDP has EMAS Moray Firth – Offshore wind farm registration in 34 facilities, corresponding to 28% of its maximum net installed capacity. EDP also has a financial stake (15.5%) in the Trillo nuclear power station in Spain. Information regarding the environmental performance of this power station is available at www.cnat.es. 9.1.1 Atmospheric emissions Apart from low-NOx burners already in place in coal power stations, it is currently being installed, at the Sines power station, a catalytic denitrification system for combustion gases , which reduces these emissions by around 70% of present levels. This project is expected to be completed at the end of 2011. This offshore wind farm project, with an installed capacity of around 1.3 GW. Trends of atmospheric emissions (kt) The Moray Firth region of the United Kingdom is home to nationally and 60.7 57.7 internationally important wildlife sites. Although the direct impact of the wind turbines is of little significance, environmental studies have been 46.1 carried out (on benthic ecology, fish, marine mammals and ornithology) 43.0 to prevent or at least minimise possible impacts. 35.2 27.6 24.8 21.7 A wide-ranging environmental management plan will include the wind 20.2 21.5 24.6 farm construction contract, in order to ensure compliance with the 13.1 11.8 conditions for the project’s approval and implementation of the best and 10.8 12.3 8.8 7.4 most up-to-date environmental practices. 8.2 6.2 3.4 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Continuous improvement in environmental management is promoted through voluntary EMAS registrations and the Portugal (SO2) Spain (SO2) maintenance of Environmental Management Systems in Portugal (NOx) Spain (NOx) accordance with the ISO 14001:2004 standard and the Corporate Environmental Management System (SIGAC), implemented and certified with referrence to the same standard, which has the “corporate management of environmental policies, strategic plans Coal-fired power stations also have desulphurisation systems, and information, as well as the environmental performance of the which have reduced the specific emissions of SO2 from thermal EDP Group’s organisations” as part of its scope. generation from 3.12 g/kWh, in 2007, to 0.42 g/kWh, in 2010. The set of these systems enables EDP to correctly frame and 9.1.2 Water strengthens its commitment to including significant environmental aspects in all planning and decision-making processes at In 2010, EDP adopted a more strategic approach to the the different levels of the organisation, with particular regard consumption and use of water in its generation activities. For the to assessment, control and minimisation of impact. The first time, the survey on Water Disclosure Project. EDP was one of management’s approaches to all of the more significant the 150 companies in the world to answer. One of the developed environmental aspects are described at actions was the generation assets analisys, based on Global Water www.edp.pt> sustainability> environment. Tool. This survey showed that EDP’s main installations are not located in areas currently considered to be under water stress. EDP, nevertheless, continues to implement efficiency measures in its use of resources, in which especially water is always taken into account. Particular examples of this are the installation of dry ashing pans in the coal-fired thermal systems and of the desulphurisation system in the Sines thermoelectric power station, which in 2010 made it possible to reuse 56% of the treated effluent. 96 For the UHE Mascarenhas power upgrading project, EDP Brasil 9.1.4 Prevention chose a more efficient technology that generated more energy from the same amount of turbined water. EDP identifies environmental accidents and near-misses, promoting its registration and analisys, and takes action with the aim of 9.1.3 Waste and By-Products immediatly correcting the circumstances in which they occurred and preventing its recurrence. Still, there were a few environmental The Sines thermoelectric power station developed a project for incidents: using a mixture of fly ash with bottom ash in order to reduce the volume of waste produced and therefore the landfill Environmental Incidents space occupied. In the distribution business, there were around 245 small oil Sines Powerstation spills from transformers, amounting to an estimated total of 200 m3 of spilled oil. In EDP Renováveis, 12 small oil spills were registered, giving originin to around 15 m3 of spilled oil. In every case they were cleaned and its resulting waste was sent to be treated, without other environmental consequences. In the generation business, a hydrochloric acid spill was registered while it was being unloaded to supply a tank. The area was washed and the resulting liquid effluent directed to the installation of wastewater treatment in Central, not having produced any waste or impact on the environment. 9.1.5 Environmental Expenditure The Sines power station is the first facility in the European In 2010, EDP incurred about EUR 98 million in environmental Economic Area to obtain a European Technical Approval (ETA) expenditure in order to prevent, repair or minimise environmental for “Modified Fly Ash SN” (a mixture of fly ash with bottom ash), damage.

Alberto João Coraceiro de Castro Based on the work developed by the Corporate and Sustainability António Sarmento Gomes Mota Committee, the General and Supervisory Board noted that, with Diogo Campos Barradas de Lacerda Machado respect to the cases it analysed and the information provided by the Executive Board of Directors regarding 2010, there was no evidence José Maria Brandão de Brito that potential conflicts of interests in the business operations had José Manuel dos Santos Fernandes been resolved in a way that was contrary to the interests of the José Maria Espírito Santo Silva Ricciardi company. Mohamed Ali Ismaeil Ali Al Fahim For further information on this matter, please see section 3.5.1 of the Ricardo José Minotti da Cruz Filipe Annual Report of the General and Supervisory Board. No significant constraints were reported that may have disturbed the performance of this Committee’s duties. The annual report of the Committee’s activities is published on the EDP website as an integrated component of the Annual Report of the General and Supervisory Board. 2.4. BUSINESS OPERATIONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE MEMBERS OF THE CORPORATE MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION BODIES WITH QUALIFYING HOLDINGS AND COMPANIES IN A GROUP OR CONTROL RELATIONSHIP WITH EDP In the current exercise of its activity, EDP performs business transactions and operations in normal market conditions for similar operations with a range of entities, in particular financial institutions. These include holders of qualifying holdings in the EDP capital and EDP group companies and subsidiaries which are not considered relevant due to their very nature or the fact that they are not significant in economic terms. Moreover, in accordance with article 246, paragraph 3, point c) of the Securities Code, it is noted that during the year 2010, EDP did not enter into the relevant transactions between related parties that have materially affected its financial position or performance. The detailed analysis of this subject matter in 2008 led to the General and Supervisory Board approving a set of objective and transparent rules for the identification, prevention and resolution of relevant corporate conflicts of interest, called the “Framework for handling conflicts of interest”. That framework was revised in late 2009. Following the deliberation taken by the General and Supervisory Board, the Executive Board of Directors approved, on May 17, 2010, the rules of identification, internal reporting and action in case of conflicts of interests applicable to all EDP Group employees who take decisions in transactions with related parties. These rules are also available on EDP’s “Website” (www.edp.pt). It is noted, in the context of the qualitative improvement of governance practices, that the General and Supervisory Board approved the “Reference Framework for the Conflicts of Interests and business conflicts between related parties of EDP”, on 29 July 2010, which is available for consultation at the EDP website (www. edp.pt). This reference framework replaces the “Framework for handling conflicts of interest”. This set of rules on the prevention, identification and resolution of potential important conflicts of interest has a wider scope of application than that corresponding to 120 CMVM Regulation no. 1/2010. 2.5.

Board. Since the external auditor has only been collaborating with EDP since December 2004, the rotation of the auditor is not, presently, a point to be considered for the purposes of guaranteeing its independence. Moreover, and considering the scope of services provided by audit firms, EDP adopts specific measures aimed at safeguarding the independence of the external auditor. The duties of the External Auditor include checking compliance with remuneration policies and systems, the effectiveness and operation of internal control mechanisms and reporting any deficiencies to the General and Supervisory Board. Indeed, on 29 January 2009, the General and Supervisory Board approved a regulation concerning the procurement of “non-audit” services to the Statutory Auditor and to the independent external auditor of the EDP Group. This regulation establishes the permitted scope of “non-audit” services to be eventually provided by an independent external auditor, from which are excluded, in particular, accounting services, development of financial information systems, evaluation as well as legal services, management of human resources and actuarial matters. These services may not be provided by the statutory auditor 122 or by the independent external auditor. 3. FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE OF EDP 3.2. CORPORATE CENTRE 3.1.

The structural indicator net debt / EBITDA went up a little and is expected to reach less than 4 in 2012. An ongoing A rating from S&P, which corresponds to a good compromise between the spread of this class on the cost of the debt and the advantage of deduction from taxes of financial costs with the expected borrowing parameters, is still a goal for the EDP Group, although Portuguese public finances are a source of considerable concern when it comes to a possible deterioration in the Group’s rating due to the country’s risk.

Financial risk: The Group’s financial risks are mainly managed by the Financial Department, which is responsible for the Group’s cash management at Iberian level, the debt portfolio and the risk of interest rate and foreign exchange instruments through financial markets. In Brazil, Energias do Brasil follows, under coordination, similar principles. Liquidity risk: The liquidity risk warranted particular attention. EDP’s strong credit profile was reconfirmed in this difficult context for Portugal. There was only one bond issue (one billion euros at five years), which was necessary for the habitual debt rollover and to finance the Group’s growth. EDP also successfully negotiated a five-year revolving credit facility of 2 billion euros to replace the previous one for 1.6 billion euros. The liquidity risk has therefore been mitigated thanks to our debt management policy, the contracting of new financing and the availability of lines of credit obtained (underwritten) but not used. Thanks to the Group’s financial management policies, there is still a low market risk and a diversified counterparty risk involving highly credible financial entities. 137 Annual Report 2010 corporate governance 4.

Excluding, obviously, in what concerns the position of the Government, transmitted directly to the Remuneration Committee, as well through the Vote Statement presented by Parpública at the referred GSM.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Therefore, taking into account the circumstances described, there was nothing new that, in any way, might have influenced the decision to be taken or justify any other measure. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is why all resolutions taken by the Remuneration Committee are valid and effective, no censorship can be appointed to them, as was confirmed by the opinion of the law experts who have been heard. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------6.

As one can easily understand, the Remuneration Committee has imposed to itself the greatest tranquillity, judgement and openness of mind in order to present to the shareholders with a Statement proposal that meets their legitimate aspirations as true owners of the company.-----Taking into account the economical and social situation, both at international and national level, it cannot be left unsaid that, on the one hand one must seek to implement a policy of compensation moderation, out of respect for the escalation of the social distress and, on the other hand, it is just as essential to advocate for a remuneration policy that has as underlying principle the criterion of fair compensation for the value of the work performed, recognizing the due personal merit and the merit of the team.
