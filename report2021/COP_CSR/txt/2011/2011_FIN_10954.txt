Due to its adjustability, hydropower is also an optimal way of generating electricity to power markets. UPM owns nine hydropower plants in Finland and has shareholdings in hydropower via Pohjolan Voima Oy and Kemijoki Oy. Most of UPM’s hydropower plants were built between the 1930s and 1950s. With the modernisation programme of its hydropower plants, UPM has improved their operational efficiency and environmental safety. UPM’s own and share-owned hydropower plants More CO2-free electricity from the same water flow In 2010, UPM completed a refurbishment project at Keltti hydropower plant by the River Kymi in Kouvola, Finland. The power plant was originally started up in 1939. The modernisation work took two years and the total cost was approximately EUR 14 million. During the project, all three generation units were completely renovated to meet the latest technical and environmental requirements fully. The work included the modernisation of the turbines, generators, automation and electrical system. As a result, the power generation capacity and efficiency of the power plant were increased and environmental safety was improved. Thus the power plant produces more renewable electricity from the same water flow.

To date UPM has built 12 modern biomass-based combined heat and power plants. Latest examples include the investments made in the UK at Caledonian and Shotton paper mills. Close co-operation In order to increase the use of forest biomass in the power plants, UPM partnered in a project of sustainable biomass harvesting in Scotland, began in 2008 and completed its first phase in 2010. The project involved experts from the UK Forestry Commission, from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), the Scottish Renewables Forum and Bangor University. The common target was to develop a sustainable stump and forest residues harvesting standard, suitable for the whole UK biomass sector. Field work in three UPM-owned forests with different site factors and soil types took nine months. The trial covered 59 hectares of forest. Research will continue for the next four years with monitoring of the original study sites. A PhD study funded by UPM and the UK Forestry Commission will be looking at the potential impact of stump harvesting on soil carbon. Initial findings showed good results UPM has significantly reduced its dependence on fossil fuels with its investments in renewable energy. As part of this development, the company has increased the range of forest biomass it can sustainably harvest from its forests. In this work UPM has worked closely with regulators, non-governmental organisations and universities. Initial findings of the sustainable biomass harvesting project have showed that stump harvesting is a part of sustainable forest management and one feasible way to generate renewable energy. contents 21 21 U P M ¬ pulp ¬ PULP Significant profit improvement was driven by pulp market recovery and integration of Uruguay operations.

The Foundation supports projects that promote education, entrepreneurship, employability, healthy living and recreational activities. Since 2006, the foundation has participated in more than 160 projects in 50 communities across Uruguay. Most of the communities have a population of less than 1,000 inhabitants. In 2010, the UPM Foundation’s activities reached more than 15,000 people located across five regions of Uruguay. Over the past few years, the Foundation’s activity has expanded from Fray Bentos to reach the communities where Forestal Oriental, UPM’s own eucalyptus plantation forestry company, operates. Examples of projects in 2010 include donating computers to schools, scholarships for chemistry and mechanics students, the integration of children with learning difficulties into mainstream IT classes, offering young students a day’s work experience and a programme for sustainable rural development. The Foundation is governed by the management board, which consists of four independent members and two representatives of UPM. The chairmanship of the board is held by independent members of the board. Sports schools for children Among the other projects in 2010, the Foundation supported football and hockey schools in 12 rural villages in Río Negro, around forestry plantations. These localities are distant from other towns and many of them have no public transport facilities. The Sports School is the only chance to engage in sports and recreation for the 400-odd children who take part in the weekly training sessions. The aim of these sports schools is to foster a healthy lifestyle through the good use of leisure time by children and youth. In addition, recreational days between the different schools were organised. The target is to enhance social interaction between communities and reinforce the values promoted by playing sports. It also increases family participation and community involvement when they support the local team. contents 27 U P M ¬ forest and timber ¬ forest and timber Profitability improved from the previous year.

In addition, the programme promotes biodiversity conference in October. biodiversity in private and state forests managed by UPM and in UPM´s wood supply chain. The programme has identified six key elements important for forest biodiversity. A target has been set for each key element and they are implemented through country-level targets and local action plans. The United Nations “The International Year of Biodiversity 2010” provided a unique opportunity to increase understanding of the vital role biological diversity plays in sustaining life on earth. UPM’s biodiversity programme was regarded as a frontrunner and was showcased at many international biodiversity events around the world in 2010. The main event was the UN COP 10 biodiversity conference in Nagoya, Japan in October. Promoting biodiversity in the wood supply chain UPM sources wood from 18 countries globally. Promoting the best sustainable forestry practices is a continuous target for the company. In 2010, UPM extended its biodiversity programme to cover the wood supply chain. The aim is to promote biodiversity in wood sourcing activities in co-operation with forest owners by carrying out supplier audits in UPM managed forests as well as including biodiversity requirements in supply contracts and operational guidelines, for example. Biodiversity in plantations Biodiversity is also one key environmental element in UPM’s plantations in Uruguay. In 2010, UPM participated in a WWF “New Generation Plantation Project”. This project aims to promote best practices for the design and management of forest plantations. Collecting examples of well-managed and well-located plantations as key features of healthy, diverse and multi-functional forest landscapes, compatible with biodiversity conservation and human needs played a key role in the project. In May, UPM invited schoolchildren and other stakeholders to plant trees as part of the company’s annual tree planting day. Native tree species play a key role in biodiversity in every forest ecosystem in the world. The tree planting events were organised in Finland, Russia, the UK, USA and Uruguay. learn more www.upm.com contents 32 Biofore in action U P M ¬ f o r e s t a n d t i m b e r ¬ C A SE W O R KING C O ND IT IO NS ¬ Safety in working environment At the beginning of 2010, UPM implemented • Aiming for zero accidents a mobile phone system where all job orders, at UPM maps, working hours and absence messages, as well as work quality data, are transmitted • Employees took part in electronically between forest workers and developing the mobile phone their managers. The system has also led to system an improvement in the workers’ occupational safety. Forest worker Anssi Jokinen knows the mobile phone system well as he In Finland, UPM has approximately 220 forest workers employed by UPM Silvesta, UPM’s participated in its development and implementation. subsidiary specialising in silviculture. Silvesta has consistently taken steps to develop the occupational health and safety of its personnel, as well as their wellbeing. All personnel gather together once a year to discuss the different aspects of occupational health and safety issues. These discussions form the basis for developing operations further. The use and development of safety gear are emphasised, and first aid training is organised regularly. Mobile phones used as safety devices in Finland The new mobile phone system sends an alarm message to the superior every four hours if a forest worker who is working alone in the forest does not send an OK message on his mobile phone. If the superior cannot reach the forest worker by phone, he will call for help from a colleague working nearby, or from a close relative or rescue team. Using the latest location transmitted by the phone, it is possible to send help quickly to the right place. During UPM Silvesta’s four years of operation, there has been one serious accident. However, as the forest worker could use his mobile phone, he quickly received help from a machine driver working nearby. UPM Tilhill in the UK awarded for occupational health and safety UPM’s subsidiary UPM Tilhill in the UK specialises in managing forests. In addition to traditional silviculture and forest work, it offers a wide range of arboricultural and landscaping services to forest and land owners. The company employs 450 people. Rigorous health and safety procedures form the basis of UPM Tilhill’s operations and performance monitoring. The guidelines take into account the company’s employees and contractors, as well as the impact on the general public and the environment. In 2009, the company implemented an “Insist On Safety” campaign. This campaign included a video that is now compulsory viewing for all new employees, and is also part of all subcontractor briefings. In 2010, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) awarded UPM Tilhill with a special recognition for achieving gold awards five years in a row. RoSPA annually honours companies that have been able to reduce the number of accidents, as well as staff absence levels caused by illness, and that consistently develop their occupational health and safety procedures. contents 33 U P M ¬ paper ¬ Paper Paper business group reported an operating loss, following a steep rise in fibre costs and lower paper prices.

As a result, UPM’s significant suppliers. Ability to meet understanding of the total lifecycle of the products is continuously enhanced, and the sustainability criteria was one part of environmental performance of the products is further improved. the evaluation. Strict supplier requirements for wood and pulp sourcing have been imposed for many years already. In recent years, guidelines and requirements have been extended to cover other relevant product groups in the supply chain. UPM has developed common requirements for all of its suppliers. According to the requirements, suppliers must comply with the principles of the UPM Code of Conduct. In addition, UPM has developed a set of supplier criteria that include requirements on social and environmental responsibility. Focus on chemicals and pigments For the past two years, UPM has particularly focused on papermaking chemicals and pigments, due to their high volume and significant importance in the papermaking process, and the special requirements necessary to protect human health and the environment. In 2010, UPM piloted a comprehensive chemicals and pigments supplier survey with all significant suppliers. One of the evaluation criteria covered in the survey was the ability to meet the required corporate responsibility and sustainability criteria. UPM will observe the results together with the suppliers, and corrective action will be taken in case of non-compliance. All discussions are complemented by questionnaires and audits during the sourcing process. In 2010, UPM started using a Restricted Substances List to ensure that it provides safe and clean products. By signing a supply contract with UPM, suppliers confirm that the chemicals they provide do not contain prohibited substances. contents 39 Biofore in action U P M ¬ paper ¬ CAS E CLI MATE ¬ Focus on energy efficiency improvements UPM strives to improve its energy efficiency • UPM’s continuous in all its operations and favours the use of target is to improve renewable and other CO2-neutral energy energy efficiency sources. • In the past two years, UPM has gained a total of EUR 55 million from all its energy savings activities and 7% reduction in CO2 emissions Tommy Lennox is making the rounds of the turbine hall of the new combined UPM’s mills use energy as electricity and heat. Most of the energy is consumed in the manufacheat and power plant at the Caledonian paper mill in the UK. turing of mechanical pulp, pumping, vacuum systems and products drying. UPM generates all the heat and one third of the electricity it needs for papermaking in combined heat and power (CHP) plants operating on paper mill sites. Energy generation is based mainly on biomass-based fuels, such as bark and forest residues. Further energy savings achieved In 2009, UPM launched a two-year campaign with the aim to reduce the consumption of electrical and thermal energy. The mills identified areas where energy could be saved and used more effectively. Building awareness, innovations, sharing ideas and best practices, and small investments were at the centre of the campaign. Many energy-saving ideas have already been implemented in UPM’s paper and pulp mills as well as in plywood mills and sawmills. New effective process and equipment modifications, as well as optimised ways of operating, have been introduced. UPM spent a total of EUR 9 million for 140 energy saving initiatives generated during the campaign. Significant savings can be achieved with relatively minor, well-targeted investments.

In addition to businesses, the network includes academic institutions, government agencies and non-governmental organisations. The water footprint method considers three different types of water: green, blue and grey. Green is the water evaporated by trees, blue water refers to water use in production and grey to cleaned process waste water assimilation in the receiving water body. According to the study, 60% of UPM Nordland Papier’s water footprint is green water, 1% is blue water and 39% grey water. Around 99% of the water footprint comes from the supply chain and the remaining 1% from the actual paper mill production processes. The direct and supply chain operations are not in water-stressed regions. Local water system has improved significantly over recent years. Water footprint conclusions The water footprint method that is currently available has an agricultural background and is not suitable for assessing forest industry products.

More than 1,300 people took part in the two-month campaign, representing approximately half of all UPM Raflatac personnel. More than 40,000 hours of exercise were carried out. The three best teams in the global competition and two best teams in each location were allowed to choose the charity to which they donated their award money. Donations were distributed in 13 countries in which UPM Raflatac has operations. The largest single donations went to two children’s cancer charities in Scarborough, England, and to help children in intensive care in Nancy, France. Points for all exercise The teams participating in the campaign had six to twelve members. Half an hour’s exercise produced one point, and each participant was able to accumulate a maximum of two points a day. An average was calculated from the team members’ points. Teams were able to follow their performance on the campaign intranet site and comment on each other’s activities on Facebook. The campaign challenge was issued by UPM Raflatac’s Management Team. All personnel were invited to take part, but participation was particularly desired from personnel who did not normally exercise much. The campaign was designed in a way that made success possible for all participants. There were no sports restrictions, which meant points were issued for all kinds of fitness and utility exercise. The Management Team also set optional extra challenges which inspired many to take part in group exercise and to raise their sports performance to a more demanding level. The participants were able to gain additional points for their teams by carrying out extra challenges such as cycling 50 kilometres and running 15 kilometres. contents 45 U P M ¬ plywood ¬ PLYWOOD Markets recovered slowly and the business area made an operating loss.

The first application of the new is a highly sustainable technology is formable plywood, which will composite for many be introduced to the market during the first end-uses half of 2011. Raija Rautiainen and Juhana Liimatainen are presenting the formable plywood and the new The core of the new technology is a special adhesive film that allows the plywood to be adhesive film that allows the formed after manufacturing. Formable plywood can be used to make bent wooden plywood to be formed after structures easily and effectively for furniture, for example. Thanks to the new adhesive manufacturing at the WISA R&D Centre in Lahti, Finland. technology, the products will also be stronger and more stable. Materials can be combined The new adhesive does not only bond wood, but also many minerals (rocks, ceramics etc.), glass, metals, textiles, paper and cardboard. Materials can also be combined to create multi-material composites. However, the unique nature of this technology is best seen when bonding together flexible materials — especially wood veneer, as in plywood. Traditionally, bonding wood is a one-time operation. The bond-line remains intact and it cannot be altered after the adhesive has set. However, UPM’s new adhesive creates a unique chemical bond with wood, which can be altered afterwards by heating. The adhesive will set again as it cools down. This characteristic enables the plywood to be formed into a desired shape in a simple three-step process of heating, forming and cooling. Renewable and recyclable Bent plywood-like furniture and other similar products have been manufactured for decades. They are made by gluing and pressing layers of veneer into a desired shape — a method commonly referred to as form pressing. UPM’s new technology allows this manufacturing process to be simplified considerably, as veneer handling and gluing can be eliminated from the workflow. The use of formable plywood in form pressing is also safer, as working with it does not involve handling hazardous chemicals. It can also be safely recycled at the end of its life, by grounding it down to produce raw material for other composites. Formable plywood is very well-suited to many end-uses, such as furniture and various industrial applications. Applying the technology to other materials will broaden its range of end uses yet further. UPM Plywood’s new composite technology is a result of years of determined scientific research and development. The goal of this ongoing work is to bring new advanced properties and features to plywood and make it a leading composite material for applications where a superior ratio between strength and weight is required. contents 49 contents 50 Success factors Competent people, good environmental performance and future-oriented R&D are crucial for the company’s long term success. contents 51 U P M ¬ responsibility ¬ RESPONSIBILITY IN ACTION Economic, social and environmental responsibility targets set the platform for UPM’s responsibility agenda.

In February Contracts, presenting the first delivery of Fibrefuel pellets. 2011 its new materials recovery facility comes on stream to further process mixed materials including plastics, cans and other household recyclables gathered in the UK’s domestic recycling system. Shotton’s system for handling recovered paper in turn produces its own process waste the wet residue known as ‘pulper rejects’, consisting mostly of paper fibres, plastics, cans and oddments. This residue can normally be combusted to produce energy, but this was not possible on the UPM Shotton site, which had to invent an alternative solution. Maximising reuse – minimising waste The target is to reduce the 20,000 tonnes of waste to less than 1,000 tonnes going to landfill by the end of 2011. The paper mill will take recovered paper into use and the other recyclable material will be recycled by other reprocessors as required. The challenge was to reprocess all of rejected material into valuable products. The project produced a unique solution for handling process waste. The result involves a new partnership with waste management experts who together created a new product, Fibrefuel, pellets created mostly from paper fibre retrieved from the wet waste. The new product will be returned to UPM Shotton to generate energy, burning cleanly and completely. Some conventional technology, screens and magnets, but also new flotation technology, UPM’S TOTAL WASTE TO LANDFILLS unique in the UK, to separate materials will be used. Plastics will be flash dried, granulated and bagged into a saleable product that can be used to make recycled plastic products, 1,000 t such as furniture and railway sleepers. 250 200 150 100 50 0 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 contents 61 U P M ¬ R&D and developing businesses ¬ contents 62 U P M ¬ R &D a n d d e v e l o p i n g b u s i n e s s e s ¬ R&D AND DEVELOPING BUSINESSES Approximately half of UPM’s R&D input was targeted towards developing new technologies and businesses.

An additional potential raw material could come from the use of industrial side-streams. All of UPM’s biofuels will be based on non-food raw materials. Jaakko Nousiainen having a close look at UPM’s advanced biofuels in Advanced biodiesel produced for transport at UPM’s biorefinery would generate over 85% the laboratory at UPM Research Centre in Finland. fewer emissions throughout the value chain compared to fossil fuels. Advanced biofuels can be blended in high proportions with fossil fuels and are well suited for current diesel motor technology and fuel distribution infrastructure. BTL-biodiesel UPM has been developing and piloting, together with Andritz/Carbona, the gasification technology to produce BTL-biodiesel (biomass-to-liquid) from energy wood. The initial testing programme has been completed. UPM is planning the first commercial-scale BTL plant. Environmental impact assessments (EIA) have been approved at UPM’s Kymi and Rauma mills in Finland, and Rauma has been selected as the possible location in Finland. An EIA is in progress at UPM’s Stracel mill in France. Locating a biorefinery adjacent to an existing UPM pulp or paper mill would create synergies and minimise the capital investments. The next step is to compete for EU grants in Finland and France. UPM has submitted applications to both countries at the beginning of 2011. No decisions are expected from the EU before the second half of 2012. Investment decision can be made only after the EU’s grant decisions are announced. Bioethanol and bio oil UPM develops concept to produce advanced bioethanol from the fibrous waste generated at pulp and paper mills or from commercial and industrial waste. The concept has been piloted at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland together with Pöyry. Bioethanol can be used as a blending component in gasoline. UPM develops bio oil technology in co-operation with Metso, Fortum and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. Bio oil is pyrolysis oil from dry-distilled energy wood. It can be used as a substitute for fossil fuel oil in heating applications. Hydrotreated biofuels An environmental impact assessment (EIA) for a liquid biorefinery producing hydrotreated biofuels at UPM’s Kaukas mill in Finland was approved in January 2011.
