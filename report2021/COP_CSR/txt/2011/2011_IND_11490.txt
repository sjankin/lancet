As a corporate entity that is consistently adding shareholder value, as an organisation that is committed to the society and as an employer that celebrates a truly unique work ethic, IndianOil has always been focused on sustainable development. This commitment permeates the entire organisation. When we sign a MoU with the Government of India committing on performance and operating parameters, we have CSR and Sustainable Development as major operational parameters. At the grassroots level, our focus has always been on ensuring that the communities who we share our lives with can aspire for a better tomorrow. Our primary concern is still energy security and how we can translate investments in energy into affordable products for our fellow citizens. We are aware that as India develops, the energy needs of the future will increase and to meet this future demand, we need to act today. We need to increasingly boost investments and step up our efforts in the international marketplace witnessing intense global competition for acquiring precious energy assets. IndianOil has been a pioneer in launching green auto fuels, energy efficiency, low emission lubricants, alternative energy options, rural retail outlets, etc. Our next step is on boosting our exploration forays in India and abroad. B.M. Bansal Clearly sustainable development is about the future, and the choices Chairman & we make today and the decisions that it would lead to, impact the Director (Planning & Business Development) next generation. And increasingly, the younger generation is even more aware of this need. Today, young professionals’ believe that business should benefit both the individual and the broader society. While they want opportunities to grow, they also want their work to be meaningful and productive to society. Nothing is more rewarding than knowing that what you do for a living positively affects the lives of those within your community, the country, or even the world. This edition of the Corporate Sustainabilit y Repor t has been compiled as per the guidelines of GRI-G3. It is only a modest effort to express our abiding commitment to build a sustainable and secure India that grows inclusively while at the same time, ensuring uninterrupted supply of fuel for its citizens at affordable prices. 3 Sustainability Report 2009-10 4 Sustainability Report 2009-10 Key Impacts, Risks & Opportunities Sr. No. Issue IndianOil Initiatives 1.

With a rising world population and economic development, increased energy use is a need to support the desire for a better quality of life. At the same time, the burden on this environment is increasing to the extent that in various parts of the world, natural resources that always have been renewable-fresh water, clean air, soil, forests and fisheries are losing their ability to replenish and sustain growing local populations. Tensions arising from economic development and environmental conservation are major contributors to social pressures and conflicts. The explosion of global electronic communication heightens public awareness to these problems calling for greater transparency and accountability of Governments as well as Business. In response to these pressures, the oil and natural gas At IndianOil, compliance with laws and regulations industry is placing greater emphasis on understanding established to promote Safety, Health & Environment the varied needs and expectations of the countries and are accorded the highest priority. Beyond compliance, communities in which they operate.

Raw Material IndianOil refineries processed 50.7 million tonnes of crude oil during the year, representing a drop of 1.4% over the previous year, due to reduced domestic demand and planned turnarounds of our refineries. However, capacity utilisation remained above 100%. Crude oil constitutes the major raw material import to our refineries. 38.3 million tonnes of imported crude oil was processed during the year. This amounted to 75.5% of the crude oil processed. At IndianOil, the optimum utilization of crude oil to improve gross refining margins (GRM) has always been monitored. Various measures including intermediate stream sharing amongst refineries, processing of higher volumes of low cost, high sulphur crude oils, upgrading residue to distillates, 17 Sustainability Report 2009-10 value addition through implementation of an integrated  Utilization of Medium Low Pressure (MLP) steam business plan and putting up new secondar y in both columns of AVUs in place of Medium processing facilities have been undertaken.
