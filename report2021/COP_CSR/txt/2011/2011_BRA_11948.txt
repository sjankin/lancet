OUR GROUP 4 2010 Annual and Sustainability Report ISO 26000 is an international standard for corporate responsibility developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Grupo Pão de Açúcar stands out as one of the first Brazilian companies to use it as a reference in preparing its Sustainability Report. 5 2010 Annual and Sustainability Report > Message from the Chief Executive Officer GRI 1.1, 1.2 The year 2010 was very positive for Grupo Pão de Açúcar, due to a series of advances and conquests, highlighted by the finalization of the association with Casas Bahia. This important transaction reaffirmed GPA’s position as the largest retailing company in Latin America, becoming one of the 10 largest companies in the world in the electronics and appliances segment. Notwithstanding this transaction, we have not changed our focus. We continue to be primarily a food distribution company, but we ensure significant balance in this mix, lead by professionals who are specialized in each of the businesses. This year was also marked by the restructuring of our management model. In less than two years, we ceased to be a multiformat company, and transformed ourselves into a multibusiness group. Accordingly, we find ourselves with the challenge of seeking synergies and integrating the businesses in light of the corporate governance, while ensuring that each keeps its specificity and expertise, to continue presenting positive results in its segment. To be able to make this change without losing the benefits of centralized management, we thoroughly reorganized our management model. Guided by the idea of having the right people in the right places, we appointed professionals dedicated to each business and strengthened the corporate teams responsible for capturing synergies and ensuring integration, while preserving the characteristics and identity of each segment. Mindful of the importance of a united and cohesive team capable of overcoming challenges and delivering the results expected of each of the businesses and activities, we created a high performance model focused on the Group’s values: humbleness; discipline; determination and grit; and emotional balance. In the retail food operations, some achievements are important for ensuring the continued growth of the Group and the increasing creation of value, particularly the process of converting the CompreBem and Sendas banners to Extra Supermercado, which strengthens our position in this important format with broad appeal to middle class consumers, which grew most in recent years, as well as the rationalization of brands and the synergy of communications. In cash-and-carry, we fomented strong organic expansion, which permitted Assaí to jump from 14 stores in 2007 to a total of 57 units at the end of 2010, and ensured robust positioning in this segment in Brazil. In our e-commerce operations, which culminated in the creation of Nova Pontocom at the beginning of 2010, we have an example of a business that brings together the best 6 2010 Annual and Sustainability Report fundamentals in its segment: experienced management, a platform integrated with the latest generation e-commerce, a broad portfolio of brands (Extra.com.br, Pontofrio.com.br and CasasBahia.com.br) and a strong connection with the bricks-and-mortar world, all supported by GPA’s large size and outstanding logistics and IT. The repercussions of this results-oriented posture have ensured the attainment of all the planned guidance. I must emphasize that the most important aspect of these numbers is the quality of the result, which is sustainable, the fruit of work begun nearly three years ago when we started the process of improving the gross margin through better cost management – and we had a direct impact on the prices charged while maintaining GPA Food’s EBITDA margin. Thus, we achieved efficiency, gained competitiveness in all formats, and cemented an image of fair prices, which translates into client traffic and increased average ticket. The good times GPA enjoys also reflect positive prospects in the national environment. Brazil is no longer just a promise. Going forward, many factors – such as the World Cup, the Olympics, the strength of the real estate sector, and even governmental programs – will heat up the consumer market, which in practice means increasing purchasing power and the arrival of more consumers in the middle class. The favorable economic context in 2010, highlighted by the social ascension of an important portion of the Brazilian consumer market, also had a direct positive impact on the Group’s performance. This climb drove consumption of higher value-added products. We have also glimpsed a more balanced competitive market, wherein full deployment of the ICMS Excise Tax Replacement program in several Brazilian states has attenuated the informal market. In 2010, we also made important strides in sustainability, having included this theme among the Group’s strategic pillars, policies and guidelines with respect to sustainable management, which represents an evolution of who we are and what we want for all our employees, clients and chain of value. Furthermore, we have kept our promise with the Global Compact, seeking in our daily endeavors to consolidate fundamental values in the areas of human rights, labor relations, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. For 2011, we continue to be confident in the Group’s growth. It will be a year of consolidating the Electronics business and capturing synergies from the integration of Ponto Frio and Casas Bahia, and continuing the expansion of GPA Food. Our outlook for good results reflects positive expectations of the performance of the Brazilian economy, and reaffirms our commitment to generate new jobs and contribute to the country’s growth, thus reinforcing our PRIDE IN BEING BRAZILIAN. Enéas Pestana Chief Executive Officer 7 2010 Annual and Sustainability Report > Corporate Profile In September 1948, Grupo Pão de Açúcar began its history as a pioneer in the retail food sector in Brazil. Today, it is the largest national distribution company, with diversified activities in several business segments: supermarkets (Pão de Açúcar and Extra Supermercado), hypermarkets (Extra Hipermercado), cash-and-carry (Assaí), proximity (Extra Fácil), electronics and appliances (Ponto Frio and Casas Bahia), e-commerce (Pontofrio.com.br, Casasbahia.com.br, Extra.com.br), drugstores and gas stations.

GRI 2.8, 2.9 Control of Grupo Pão de Açúcar is shared with the second largest retail company in France, the Casino Group, in a strategic partnership initiated in 1999 that ensures an interchange of know-how and synergies between important areas like global sourcing and exclusive brands. GPA’s shares have been listed on the Bovespa since October 1995, and its Level III ADR program has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since May 1997. GRI 2.3, 2.8 In 2010, GPA took important steps in strengthening its socioenvironmental efforts, developing and establishing sustainability policies and guidelines, which have been disseminated Company-wide. In furtherance of its efforts to promote sustainability, it inaugurated the first Green Distribution Center, in Brasília, where it was able to apply effective practices to rationalize the use of water and electricity. GRI 2.9 The Group also acts directly or through associations that represent the supermarket sector, such as the Associação Brasileira de Supermercados (Abras), the Federação do Comércio de Bens, Serviços e Turismo do Estado de São Paulo (Fecomércio) and the Associação Paulista de Supermercados (Apas).
