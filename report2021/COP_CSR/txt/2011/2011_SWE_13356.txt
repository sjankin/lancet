Nolato’s sustainability work 2010 4 /22 Goal-oriented sustainability work N olato’s Basic Principles clearly demonstrate that ‘we are responsible’, and by this we mean that our business will contribute to sustainable development, among other things. In practice, we do this by handling issues relating to the environment and working environment in a responsible manner, respecting human rights, and practising sound and ethical business methods. Environmental responsibility and social responsibility have been guiding principles for the daily work at Nolato throughout the company’s history. A basic element in our strategy for sustainable development is that issues relating to the environment, working environment and social responsibility should be a natural part of our planning, monitoring and communication – in other words, part of our business operations. We see an increasing interest from various stakeholders in how we treat our employees, what we are doing to decrease our carbon footprint, and what demands we are putting on our suppliers. Not least, this relates to Nolato’s activities in China and other developing countries. Over the past year, therefore, we have investments have been made and actions Sony Ericsson, on issues relating to social followed the criticism directed at certain taken at a number of plants.
