At the center is our business and how we conduct ourselves internally and externally. Next are the impacts directly related to our operations or “Our Footprint.” Finally, the outer ring represents our influence through our mutual funds and the ways that we are able to impact society, companies and the world. This is the area where we have the greatest opportunity to influence sustainability.

In this newly emerging market, we hope to provide liquidity and create standards for what qualifies as green. As part of this engagement, work started in 2010 to establish an internal scoring system to rate the impact of green bonds and can engage issuers to quantify and improve the structure and impacts of their projects. In May 2011, Calvert launched and fully funded its Institutional ESG/Green Fixed Income Strategy, which invests in green bonds that provide capital to projects that address global environmental challenges.

Calvert used the report to encourage other companies to adopt board oversight and had success doing that with Wal-Mart. TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE Calvert has called on companies to produce Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) based sustainability reports since 2004, and in recent years our campaign has focused on high impact sectors. In 2008, Calvert engaged the airline sector, filing resolutions with five companies. Continental, UAL, and Southwest have made significant progress each producing a corporate responsibility or sustainability report. Southwest interestingly now produces a “One Report,” combining its financial and corporate responsibility reporting, using the GRI guidelines. Jet Blue and US Airways lag their peers. In 2009, we filed with companies that provide water management solutions. Our engagement with Aqua America, Flowserve, Itron, and Valmont has helped to move each of these companies forward. Aqua America and Itron are further along, producing more substantive reports in which they recognize sustainability as a core business driver for their firms. In 2010 Calvert focused on the apparel sector companies, filing proposals with four including Ann Taylor Stores, J. Crew, and Chico’s FAS. Through dialogue we secured commitments to begin or improve upon existing reporting and while there has already been progress (Ann Taylor has made notable strides forward and Chico’s FAS is taking its first baby steps), the dialogues are ongoing. Our focus during the 2011 proxy season has been smaller oil and gas companies, Northwest Natural Gas, Southern Union Co, Southwest Gas Corp, and Energen Corporation, which face a range of challenges including climate change, resource extraction, and employee safety. As these firms grow, it is important that they manage these risks and operate in ways that meet stakeholder expectations. Since we began a sector based approach in 2008 we have filed or co-filed 34 proposals and have been able to withdraw 22 of them, after the companies agreed to begin reporting or improve existing reports. The quality and depth of reporting varies significantly from company-to-company; however, a common theme through all of these engagements is the concept of continuous improvement—moving from disclosure of policy and management systems to data and key performance indicators, setting goals and targets, and ultimately meeting GRI guidelines. This process requires that companies understand both their impacts on society and their own risks, prerequisites to more sustainable management. The shareholder proposal is often the trigger that gets this process underway.
