Building Lives Sustainability Report The Matara power plant has partnered the community in projects ranging from planting trees to cleaning water wells in schools. Subsidiaries also continue to engage in community development projects that are more short term in duration and touch lives at a personal level. We believe such initiatives enable us to begin a process of engagement which can be transformed into a mutually beneficial sustainable engagement in future. An important aspect to note is our assessment of the impact of our activities on the communities and the environment and the sustainability of our interventions before any assistance is extended. The usual practice is to conduct a need analysis that weighs the pros and cons against the negative and positive impacts to communities and the environment. Examples of this process can be found in our Gliricidia projects, which involve educating self-employed farmers and the Estate Welfare Supervisors and midwives in our plantation sector appointed to survey the needs of communities at our estates. More details of the community engagement projects will be listed in our website. The efforts of our Group companies were recognised at the Best Corporate Citizens Awards of 2010 organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce when we emerged the category winners for Community Relations.

A more long term project undertaken by the Aitken Spence Plantations is the commission of Mini Hydro Power Plants (MHPP) within estates which sell generated power to the national grid. Mini-hydro is a preferred method of power generation since the damage caused to the topography of an area is eliminated from the equation and the produced energy is cleaner than that of larger scale energy projects. The commission of a 560 kW MHPP at Sheen estate in October 2008 brought about an estimated annual income of Rs. 33 million for the first year, vis-√†-vis a total project cost of Rs. 130 million. In fact, the annual generation at Sheen in 2009/10 and 2010/11 has enabled Elpitiya Plantations PLC to edge close to Energy Neutrality. In the year 2009/10, the consumption was at 3.319 GWh and generation of energy was at 2.592 GWh. This gap was closed further in 2010/11 when the consumption was 3.529 GWh and the generated power was 3.174 GWh. Similar MHPPs are being planned for other up country plantations and four new sites have been identified for MHPPs ranging in capacities from 200 to 900 kW. Feasibility studies are presently being carried out for three of these projects totalling a capacity 1.9 MW, at an estimated investment of Rs. 360 400 million and projected revenue of approximately Rs. 100 million in the first year.

Ace Power Embilipitiya (Pvt) Ltd., a subsidiary company currently supplies power to the Ceylon Electricity Board based on a generation license validly obtained on 14th January 2004 for which payment has been received regularly. However, the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No.20 of 2009, states that for a company to be eligible to obtain a power generation license for power generation capacity of over and above 25MW, the company must be incorporated under the Companies Act No.7 of 2007, in which the government, a public corporation, a company in which the government holds more than fifty per centum of the shares or a Aitken Spence PLC .
