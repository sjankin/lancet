The basic earnings per share increased by 26.8% to 80.9 cents (2009: 63.8 cents). For the fourth quarter under review, the Group achieved an after-tax profit attributable to shareholders of $249.2 million, an increase of 41.1% as compared to $176.7 million in Q4 2009. This is backed by the significant increase in profit contribution from the rental properties segment due to gain recognised primarily from the sale of the Group’s remaining strata-units in Chinatown Point. At the pre-tax level, profit contribution from the rental properties segment had surpassed the other business segments to be the lead contributor, accounting for 75.4% and 40.9% of the Group’s profit before tax for Q4 2010 and full year 2010 respectively. During the year, the Group timely unlocked the value of some of its non-core and secondary assets which contributed significantly to the performance of the rental properties segment. In addition, some of the pre-tax gain of $25.5 million recognised in Q3 2010 on the dilution of investment in CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) also attributed to the increase to this segment for full year 2010. Despite the strong take-up rate for residential sales launched by the Group during the year, the Group was not able to recognise profit from some of its launched projects as construction had either not commenced or construction has not reached the recognition stage yet. Accordingly, the performance of the property development segment was lower in Q4 2010 and full year 2010 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2009. The Group’s balance sheets continue to be healthy. As at 31 December 2010, net gearing ratio had reduced to 29.0% (as at 31 December 2009: 40.0%).

The Board has also adopted an internal guide wherein certain key matters are specifically reserved for approval by the Board such as the setting of strategic direction or policies or financial objectives which are, or may have material impact on the profitability or performance of the Group, decisions to commence, discontinue or modify significantly any business activity or to enter or withdraw from a particular market sector, corporate or financial structuring, decisions over new borrowings or significant amendments to the terms and conditions of existing borrowings other than in the ordinary course of business, material acquisitions and disposal of assets, adoption of corporate governance policies and any other matters which require Board approval as prescribed under the relevant legislations and regulations as well as the provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association. Board Orientation and Training Every newly appointed Director receives a formal letter, setting out his general duties and obligations as a Director pursuant to the relevant legislations and regulations. The new Director will also receive an induction pack containing information and documents relating to the role and responsibilities of a director, the Company’s business, Board processes, corporate governance practices, relevant Company policies and procedures as well as a board meeting calendar for the year with a brief of the routine agenda for each meeting. As and when necessary, the Company will conduct an induction programme for newly appointed Directors and in respect of appointments of existing Directors to Committees, which seeks to familiarise Directors with the Group’s business, the Company’s board processes, accounting and governance practices. The Directors are provided with regular updates and/or briefings from time to time by professional advisers, auditors, Management and the Company Secretaries in areas such as directors’ duties and responsibilities, corporate governance practices, risk management issues and changes in financial reporting standards. The Company Secretary regularly keeps them informed of the availability of appropriate courses, conferences and seminars such as those conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors, and the Directors are encouraged to attend such training at the Company’s expense. An in-house seminar on some of the latest developments in corporate governance and the proposed amendments to the Listing Rules based on the consultation paper released by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) in early 2010 was conducted by invited external speakers in July 2010 for the Directors. Directors are also at liberty to approach Management should they require any further information or clarification concerning the Company’s operations. 26 city developments limited Corporate governance Corporate Values and Conduct of Business The Board and Senior Management are committed to conducting business with integrity and consistent with the highest standards of business ethics, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The Company has adopted an internal code of business and ethical conduct crystallising the Company’s business principles and practices with respect to matters which have ethical implications. The Code provides a communicable and understandable framework for staff to observe the Company’s principles such as honesty, integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of the organisation and in the conduct of the Company’s business, in their relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors and amongst employees, including situations where there are potential conflicts of interests. Internal Code on Dealings in Securities The Company has adopted an internal code on securities trading which provides guidance and internal regulation with regard to dealings in the Company’s securities by its Directors and officers. These guidelines prohibit dealing in the Company’s securities on short-term considerations and while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive information in relation to such securities and during the “closed period”, which is defined as two weeks before the date of announcement of results for each of the first three quarters of the Company’s financial year and one month before the date of announcement of the full-year financial results, and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant results. Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance Board Independence The Board currently comprises 8 members. All members of the Board except for the Chairman and the Managing Director are non-executive Directors. Of the 6 non-executive Directors, the Board considers 5 of them, being more than half of the Board, to be independent, thus providing for a strong and independent element on the Board capable of exercising objective judgment on corporate affairs of the Group. No individual or small group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision making. In addition to the annual review by the NC of the Directors’ independence, each independent non-executive Director also submits an annual declaration regarding his independence. The independent non-executive Directors are Messrs Chee Keng Soon, Foo See Juan, Han Vo-Ta, Tang See Chim and Yeo Liat Kok Philip. Mr Foo See Juan is a partner of a legal firm which renders professional legal services to the Group from time to time. Nevertheless, the NC and the Board (excluding Mr Foo in respect of the deliberation of his own independence) has considered Mr Foo to be independent as he is capable of maintaining his objectivity and independence at all times in the carrying out of his duties and responsibilities as an independent Director. Board Composition and Size The NC reviews the size and composition of the Board and Committees, and the skills and core competencies of the Board members annually. The Board comprises business leaders and professionals with real estate, financial, banking, legal and business management backgrounds. The members of the Board with their combined business, management and professional experience, knowledge and expertise, provide the necessary core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives on the Group’s strategic direction and growth. Taking into account the scope and nature of the operations of the Group, the Board is satisfied that the current size of the Board is an appropriate size and its current composition provides for sufficient diversity and allows for effective decision making. Non-executive Directors’ Participation Non-executive Directors of the Company are encouraged to participate actively in Board meetings in the development of the Company’s strategic direction and plans, in the review and monitoring of Management’s performance against targets. To facilitate this, they are kept informed of the Company’s business and performance through periodic reports from the Management, and have unrestricted access to the Management. They also sit on various Committees established by the Board to provide constructive input and the necessary review and monitoring of performance of the Company and Management. Principle 3: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Role of Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer The Board recognises that best practices of corporate governance advocate that the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer should in principle be separate persons to ensure an appropriate balance of power, increased accountability and greater capacity of the board for independent decision making. The Board also recognises that there may be instances where the two roles are performed by one person for valid reasons, and that such a practice is not uncommon both locally and in other developed jurisdictions. annual report 2010 27 The Chairman of the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng, is also the Executive Chairman of the Company. As Chairman of the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng bears primary responsibility for the workings of the Board, by ensuring effectiveness on all aspects of its role including setting agenda for Board meetings with input from Management, exercising control over the quality, quantity and timeliness of information flow between the Board and Management. At annual general meetings and other shareholders’ meetings, he plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, the Board and Management. As Executive Chairman, Mr Kwek Leng Beng is the most senior executive in the Company and provides overall leadership and strategic vision for the Group. The holding of the dual roles of Chairman and Executive Chairman by the same Director, together with the strengths brought to these roles by a person of Mr Kwek Leng Beng’s stature and experience, has been considered by the Board. There are internal controls in place to allow effective oversight by the Board of the Company’s business to ensure an appropriate balance of power and authority is exercisable by the Board to enable objective decision-making in the interests of the Company. In view of the management structure in place, the Board is of the view that it is currently unnecessary to effect a separation of the role of the Chairman of the Board from that of the Executive Chairman to facilitate the Group’s decision-making and implementation process. Mr Kwek Leng Beng is assisted by his brother, Mr Kwek Leng Joo, the Managing Director of the Company, in charting broad direction, strategies and policies of the Group. The Managing Director also has charge of the overall co-ordination of the Management team for the effective implementation of business strategies and policies and is supported by the Group General Manager of the Company in the management of the day to day operations of the Group. The Group General Manager, Mr Chia Ngiang Hong, who has extensive experience in the real estate sector, has been with the Group since 1981. He is not related to the Chairman or the Managing Director. With the establishment of various Committees with power and authority to perform key functions beyond the authority of, or without undue influence from, the Chairman and/or the Managing Director, and the putting in place of various internal controls to allow for effective Board oversight, the Board is of the view that there are adequate accountability safeguards to enable the Board to exercise objective decision-making and to ensure an appropriate balance of power and authority within the spirit of good corporate governance. Principle 4: Board Membership NC Composition and Role 2 out of the 3 members of the NC, including the NC chairman, are independent. Please refer to the Corporate Directory section of this Annual Report 2010 for the composition of the NC. The NC’s main role as set out in its written terms of reference approved and adopted by the Board, is to recommend all Board and Committee appointments and re-appointments and determine the independence of each Director. The NC also reviews and recommends to the Board the appointment of key executive positions, including that of chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer or other executive officers of equivalent rank. The Company Secretary maintains records of all NC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. Re-nomination of Directors The NC reviews annually the nomination of the relevant Directors for re-election and re-appointment as well as the independence of Directors. When considering the nomination of Directors for re-election and re-appointment, the NC takes into account their contribution to the effectiveness of the Board as well as their time commitment especially for Directors who have multiple board representations, and also reviews their independence. The Articles of Association of the Company provide that at least one-third of the Directors for the time being, other than the Managing Director, shall retire as Directors at each annual general meeting of the Company (“AGM”). All new Directors appointed by the Board shall hold office until the next AGM, and be eligible for re-election at the said AGM. The Managing Director is appointed by the Board for such period (except that where an appointment is for a fixed term, such term shall not exceed five years) and upon such terms as the Board thinks fit. Excluding the Directors above 70 years of age who are subject to annual re-nomination, namely Mr Kwek Leng Beng, Mr Chee Keng Soon, Mr Foo See Juan and Mr Tang See Chim, and the Managing Director, the remaining Directors of the Company will retire about once in three years. In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, Mr Kwek Leng Peck who is retiring by rotation, has offered himself for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 28 city developments limited Corporate governance Annual Review of Directors’ Independence The NC reviews the independence of Directors annually according to the criteria on independence set out in the CG Guidelines. 5 out of the current 6 non-executive Directors are considered by the NC to be independent, which is more than half of the Board, thus providing for a strong and independent element on the Board capable of exercising objective judgment on corporate affairs of the Company. When considering the independence of the Directors, the NC also reviews the Directors’ other directorships, the annual declaration by the independent non-executive Directors regarding their independence and the Directors’ disclosures of interests in transactions. Directors’ Time Commitments When considering the nomination of Directors for appointment or re-election/re-appointment, the NC also takes into account the competing time commitments faced by Directors with multiple board representations. An analysis of the directorships held by the Directors is reviewed annually by the NC. Based on the analysis and the Directors’ commitment and contributions to the Company which is also evident in their level of attendance and participation at Board and Committee meetings, the NC is satisfied that all Directors are able to carry out and have been adequately carrying out their duties as a Director of the Company. Criteria and Process for Nomination and Selection of New Directors The NC will interview the shortlisted candidates before formally considering and recommending them for appointment to the Board and where applicable, to the Committees. In reviewing and recommending to the Board any new Director appointments, the NC will consider: (a) the candidate’s independence, in the case of the appointment of a non-executive independent director; (b) the composition requirements for the Board and Committees (if the candidate is proposed to be appointed to any of the Committees) under the Company’s Internal CG Guidelines; (c) the candidate’s age, track record, experience and capabilities and such other relevant factors as may be determined by the NC; and (d) any competing time commitments if the candidate has multiple board representations. Key Information on Directors Please refer to the ‘Board of Directors’ section in the Annual Report 2010 for key information on the Directors, and the Notice of AGM for information on Directors proposed for re-election and re-appointment at the forthcoming AGM. Board Renewal As Board renewal is a continuing process, the NC reviews annually the composition of the Board and makes recommendations as and when appropriate to the Board of any new Director appointments, whether in addition to or as replacement for retiring Board members, with a view to identifying any gaps in the Board’s skills set taking into account the Company’s business operations. Principle 5: Board Performance Board Evaluation Process The Company has in place a formal assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and the contribution by each Director to the effectiveness of the Board. The NC assesses the Board’s performance as a whole annually, using objective and appropriate quantitative and qualitative criteria which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. When assessing the overall Board performance, the NC takes into consideration the feedback from individual Directors on areas relating to the Board’s competencies and effectiveness. The results of the overall evaluation of the Board by the NC including its recommendation, if any, for improvements are presented to the Board. The annual evaluation process for the individual Directors’ performance comprises three parts: (a) background information concerning the Directors including their attendance records at the Board and Committee meetings; (b) questionnaires for completion by all individual Board members; and (c) NC’s evaluation based on certain assessment parameters. The questionnaires and the assessment parameters were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. The completed questionnaires are then reviewed by the NC before the NC completes its evaluation of the individual Directors. When deliberating on the performance of a particular Director who is also a member of the NC, that member excuses himself from the discussions in order to avoid any conflict of interests. The results of the individual evaluation of the Directors are also used by the NC, in its consultation with the Chairman of the Board (who is also a member of the NC), to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the re-appointment and re-election of retiring Directors. Comments from the Directors if any concerning the Board as a whole and the general performance of the Directors are also presented to the Board. annual report 2010 29 Board Evaluation Criteria The qualitative criteria is set out in a questionnaire covering three main areas relating to board composition, roles and responsibilities, conduct of meetings and access to information. The quantitative criteria used to evaluate the overall Board performance comprises quarterly performance indicators which include a comparison of the Company’s performance (including segmental performance) for the financial period under review against the Company’s performance for the corresponding period in previous years and also vis-à-vis industry peers and industry averages, and other indicators such as the Company’s share price performance over a historical period and vis-à-vis industry peers. Individual Director Evaluation Criteria Factors taken into account in the assessment of Directors’ performance include their abilities and competencies, their objectivity and their level of participation at Board and Committee meetings including their contribution to Board processes and the business strategies and performance of the Group. Principle 6: Access to Information Complete, Adequate and Timely Information and Access to Management Prior to each meeting, members of the Board and the Committees are provided with the meeting agenda and the relevant papers submitted by the Management, containing complete, adequate and timely information to enable full deliberation on the issues to be considered at the respective meetings. Management, the Company’s auditors and professional advisers who can provide additional insight into the matters for discussion are also invited from time to time to attend such meetings. Draft agendas for Board and Committee meetings are circulated to the Chairman of the Board and the chairmen of the Committees, in advance, for them to review and suggest items for the agenda. The Board and Committees are also furnished routine reports where applicable from the Management. Each of the chairmen of the AC, NC and RC provides an annual report of the respective committees’ activities during the year under review to the Board. The minutes of meetings of the Committees are circulated to all Board members. Company Secretary The Company Secretaries, whose appointment and removal are subject to Board’s approval, attend all Board and Committee meetings and ensure that all Board procedures are followed. The Company Secretaries, together with Management, also ensure that the Company complies with all applicable statutory and regulatory rules. Together with the Management, the Company Secretaries also assist the Board Chairman, the Board and Committees to implement and strengthen corporate governance practices and processes, including facilitating orientation for newly appointed Directors and appointments to Committees and continuing training and development for the Directors. On an ongoing basis, the Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretaries. The duties and responsibilities of the Company Secretaries are set out in the Company’s Internal CG Guidelines. Independent Professional Advice The Directors, whether as a group or individually, are entitled to take independent professional advice at the expense of the Company, in furtherance of their duties and in the event that circumstances warrant the same. The Company has in place internal guidelines allowing the Directors to seek independent professional advice. REMUNERATION MATTERS Principle 7: Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies RC Composition and Role The RC comprises 3 non-executive Directors, all of whom including the chairman of the RC are independent. The RC’s principal responsibilities as set out in its written terms of reference approved and adopted by the Board are to review and recommend for the endorsement of the Board, a framework of remuneration and the specific remuneration packages for each Board member, including the Executive Chairman, the Managing Director and also for the Group General Manager (who is not a Board member), which covers Directors’ fees, salaries, bonuses, allowances and other benefits in kind. The Company has in place principles and/or guidelines concerning the Board’s remuneration. In reviewing remuneration packages, the RC also ensures that the remuneration policies are in line with the strategic objectives and corporate values of the Company. The Company Secretary maintains records of all RC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. 30 city developments limited Corporate governance Principle 8: Level and Mix of Remuneration Directors’ Remuneration In reviewing the remuneration packages, the RC, with the assistance of the human resource advisors or consultants within and outside the Group, if required, considers the level of remuneration based on the Company’s remuneration policy which comprises the following 3 distinct objectives: • To ensure that the remuneration packages are competitive in attracting and retaining employees capable of meeting the Company’s needs. • To reward employees for achieving corporate and individual performance targets in a fair and equitable way. • To ensure that the remuneration reflects duties and responsibilities. The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is set at a level appropriate to their degree of contribution, taking into account attendance and time spent, and their respective responsibilities. The RC also holds to the principle that non-executive Directors should not be over-compensated to the extent that their independence may be compromised. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration. Longer term incentive schemes are encouraged, as and when appropriate. Principle 9: Disclosure of Remuneration Disclosure of Remuneration The total compensation packages for employees including the Executive Chairman, the Managing Director and the Group General Manager comprise a fixed component (in the form of a base salary and fixed allowances) and a variable component (which includes year-end and variable bonuses, and benefits-in-kind, where applicable), taking into account amongst other factors, the individual’s performance, the performance of the Group and industry practices. Each of the Directors receives a base Director’s fee. Directors who serve on the various Committees (other than the BC and Scheme Committee) also receive additional fees in respect of each Committee that they serve on, with the chairmen of the Committees (other than the BC and Scheme Committee) also receiving a higher fee in respect of their service as chairman of the Committee. The breakdown (in percentage terms) of the Directors’ remuneration for FY 2010 is set out below.

No options were granted by the Company to subscribe for unissued shares in the Company during FY 2010. During FY 2010, both the Executive Chairman and the Managing Director each had an immediate family member who is an employee of the Company and whose personal annual remuneration falls within the remuneration band of $250,000 and below. ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT Principle 10: Accountability Accountability of the Board and Management The Board provides shareholders with quarterly and annual financial results. Results for the first 3 quarters are released to shareholders within 45 days of the end of each quarter whilst annual results are released within 60 days from the financial year end. In presenting the Company’s annual and quarterly results, the Board aims to provide shareholders with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s performance and financial position with a commentary at the date of the announcement of the significant trends and competitive conditions of the industry in which it operates. For the financial year under review, the Chief Financial Officer provided assurance to the AC on the integrity of the quarterly financial statements and the Board in turn provided a negative assurance confirmation to the shareholders in accordance with the regulatory requirements. The Management provides all Directors with a monthly financial summary of the Group’s performance. The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility to ensure accurate financial reporting for the Group and for the Group’s system of internal controls. The Board confirms that, with the assistance of the AC, it reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting and internal controls system, which is monitored through a programme of internal and external audits, and is satisfied with the adequacy of such internal controls system. Principle 11: Audit Committee Composition of the AC The AC comprises 4 non-executive Directors, all of whom including the chairman of the AC are independent. The AC has sufficient financial management expertise and experience amongst its members to discharge its functions within its written terms of reference approved and adopted by the Board. Powers and Duties of the AC The AC is authorised by the Board to investigate any matters it deems appropriate within its terms of reference and has full access to and co-operation of Management. It may invite any Director, officer or employee of the Company to attend its meetings and is also authorised to seek external professional advice to enable it to discharge its functions. The principal responsibility of the AC is to assist the Board in maintaining a high standard of corporate governance, particularly by providing an independent review of the effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting process and material internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and risk management controls. Other duties within its written terms of reference include: • to review with Management and, where appropriate, with the external auditors the quarterly and full year financial statements to be issued by the Group before their submission to the Board to ensure their completeness, accuracy and fairness; • to review, on an annual basis, the scope and results of the external audit and its cost-effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, and also the nature and extent of any non-audit services provided by the external auditors to the Group; • to review the effectiveness of the internal audit (“IA”) function; • to review annually with Management, the internal and external auditors the results of their review on the Company’s material internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, and risk management policies and systems; • to make recommendations to the Board on the nomination for the appointment, re-appointment and removal of external auditors, and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors; • to approve the appointment, resignation or dismissal of the Head of IA; and • to review interested person transactions. 32 city developments limited Corporate governance The AC held 7 meetings during the year and carried out its duties as set out within its terms of reference. The Company Secretary maintains records of all AC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. The AC meets with the internal and external auditors, each separately without the presence of Management, annually. In performing its duties, the AC also took guidance from the Guidebook for Audit Committees in Singapore issued by the Audit Committee Guidance Committee in October 2008 (“ACGC Guidebook”). For the financial year under review, the AC conducted a self-assessment of its effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities. To facilitate the assessment process, the AC adopted a self-assessment checklist (“AC Self-Assessment Checklist”) based on the guidance from the ACGC Guidebook. The AC Self-Assessment Checklist covered the AC terms of reference, memberships and appointments, meetings, training and resources, financial reporting, internal financial controls and risk management systems, internal and external audit processes, whistle-blowing, relationships with the Board, communication with shareholders and contribution of AC members to the AC deliberations and decisions. Based on the self-assessment, the AC agreed that continuing development and improvement of the AC processes is an ongoing process and that the AC has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference. External Auditors The AC also noted and reviewed the nature and extent of the non-audit services provided to the Group by the external auditors for FY 2010, and is of the opinion that the provision of such non-audit services did not affect the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. Accordingly, the AC has recommended to the Board the nomination of KPMG LLP for re-appointment as external auditors. Whistle-blowing Policy CDL has in place a whistle-blowing procedure where staff of the Company can raise in confidence, whether anonymously or otherwise, concerns on possible improprieties relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls and auditing matters, without fear of reprisals in any form. The AC has the responsibility of overseeing this policy which is administered with the assistance of the Head of IA. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow up action to be taken. The Company is committed to maintaining procedures for the confidential and anonymous submission of reports and the anonymity of the staff concerned will be maintained where so requested by the staff who lodged the report. Investigations of such reports will be handled on a confidential basis to the extent permissible or deemed appropriate under the circumstances, and involve persons who need to be involved in order to properly carry out the investigation and will, on a best efforts basis, be carried out in a timely manner. Interested person transactions On 29 May 2003, the Company obtained shareholders’ approval for the Company, its subsidiaries and its associated companies not listed on the SGX-ST or an approved exchange, over which the Company, its subsidiaries and/or interested persons have control, to enter into transactions within the categories of Interested Person Transactions set out in the Company’s circular to shareholders dated 28 April 2003, with such persons within the class or classes of Interested Persons as described in the said circular, provided that such transactions are entered into in accordance with the review procedures set out in the said circular (the “IPT Mandate”). The IPT Mandate was last renewed by the shareholders on 28 April 2010 and given that such Interested Person Transactions are expected to occur with some degree of frequency and may arise at any time, and to allow the Group to undertake such transactions in an expeditious manner, shareholders’ approval will be sought at the coming Annual General Meeting of the Company for the renewal of the IPT Mandate. The AC has confirmed that an independent financial adviser’s opinion is not required for the renewal of the IPT Mandate as the methods and procedures for determining the transaction prices of the Interested Person Transactions conducted under the IPT Mandate have not changed since the IPT Mandate was obtained on 29 May 2003, and such methods and procedures continue to be sufficient to ensure that these Interested Person Transactions will be carried out on normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders. annual report 2010 33 Particulars of interested person transactions required to be disclosed under Rule 907 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST are as follows: Interested Persons Aggregate value of all interested person Aggregate value of all interested person transactions transactions in FY 2010 (excluding transactions less conducted in FY 2010 under the IPT Mandate than $100,000 and transactions conducted under pursuant to Rule 920 (excluding transactions less the IPT Mandate pursuant to Rule 920) than $100,000) Hong Leong $ 17,741,532.77* Property-related $19,286,578.44 Investment (a) provision to interested persons of Holdings Pte.

The above interested person transactions were carried out on normal commercial terms and were not prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders. Principle 12: Internal Controls Internal Controls The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility to ensure accurate financial reporting for the Group and for the Group’s system of internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management policies and systems. The AC reviewed the adequacy of internal controls annually with the assistance of the internal and external auditors and the Management. While no system can provide absolute assurance against material loss or financial misstatement, the Group’s internal financial controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that proper accounting records are maintained, and that financial information used within the business and for publication is reliable. In reviewing these controls, the Directors have had regard to the risks to which the business is exposed, the likelihood of such risks occurring and the costs of protecting against them. Based on the work performed by the internal auditors as well as the statutory audit by the external auditors, the Board, through the AC, is satisfied that the operational and compliance controls, and risk management systems, are adequate to meet the needs of the Group in its current business environment. 34 city developments limited Corporate governance Principle 13: Internal Audit Reporting Line and Qualification The IA function is independent of the activities it audits. The Head of IA’s primary reporting line is to the chairman of the AC with an administrative line of reporting to the Managing Director of the Company. The appointment, resignation and dismissal of the Head of IA is reviewed and approved by the AC. The AC also provides input on the annual performance appraisal of the Head of IA. The AC meets the Head of IA at least once annually without the presence of Management. The Head of IA has unfettered access to the AC, the Board and Management. IA operates within the framework stated in its Internal Audit Charter which is approved by the AC. The standards of the Internal Audit Charter are consistent with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by the Institute of Internal Auditors. Role and Activities of IA The primary role of IA is to assist the Board to evaluate the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management processes of the Company, reviewing the internal controls of the Company to ensure prompt and accurate recording of transactions and proper safeguarding of assets and reviewing that the Company complies with the relevant laws, regulations and policies established by the Company. The AC approves all IA plans and all IA reports are given to the AC, the Chairman of the Board, the Managing Director, Group General Manager, Chief Financial Officer, Company Secretary and the heads of the relevant departments. Processes are in place such that recommendations raised in IA reports are dealt with in a timely manner, with outstanding exceptions or recommendations being closely monitored and reported back to the AC. Adequacy of IA Function The Company has a well-established IA function with adequate resources and standing. Processes are in place to ensure that the professional competence of the IA staff is maintained or upgraded through training programmes. The AC reviews the adequacy of the IA function through a review of the IA activities on a quarterly basis and is satisfied that the IA function has adequate resources and appropriate standing within the Group to perform its functions properly. COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS Principle 14: Communication with Shareholders The Company announces its quarterly and full-year results within the mandatory period. Material and price-sensitive information is publicly released via SGXNET on a timely basis. All shareholders of the Company receive the annual report of the Company and the notice of the Annual General Meeting, which notice is also advertised in the press and released via SGXNET. Shareholders and investors can access information on the Company at its website at www.cdl.com.sg which provides, inter alia, corporate announcements, press releases and the latest financial results as disclosed by the Company on SGXNET. From time to time, the Company’s senior management holds briefings with analysts and the media to coincide with the release of the Group’s half-year and full-year results.

On behalf of the Board of Directors Kwek Leng Beng Executive Chairman Kwek Leng Joo Managing Director Singapore 9 March 2011 84 city developments limited Independent auditors’ report Members of the Company City Developments Limited Report on the financial statements We have audited the financial statements of City Developments Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2010, the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows of the Group for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, as set out on pages 85 to 183. Management’s responsibility for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the Act) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair profit and loss accounts and balance sheets and to maintain accountability of assets. Auditors’ responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2010 and the results, changes in equity and cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiaries incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes: Note 2.2 Assessment of ability to control or exert significant influence over partly-owned investments Note 2.18 Measurement of profit attributable to properties under development Note 2.21 Estimation of provisions for current and deferred taxation Note 3 and 4 Measurement of recoverable amounts of property, plant and equipment and investment properties Note 5 Measurement of recoverable amounts of investments in and balances with subsidiaries Note 8 Impairment of available-for-sale equity investments Note 10 Measurement of realisable amounts of development properties Note 23 Valuation of defined benefit employee obligations Note 37 Valuation of financial instruments that are not actively traded 96 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Changes in accounting policies (i) Accounting for business combinations From 1 January 2010, the Group has applied FRS 103 Business Combinations (2009) in accounting for business combinations. Business combinations are now accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date (see note 2.2). Previously, business combinations were accounted for under the purchase method. The cost of an acquisition was measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. The excess of the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition was credited to income statement in the period of the acquisition. For business acquisitions that were achieved in stages, any existing equity interests in the acquiree were not re-measured to their fair value. Contingent consideration was recognised as an adjustment to the cost of acquisition only when it was probable and can be measured reliably. The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively to new business combinations occurring on or after 1 January 2010 and has no material impact on earnings per share. (ii) Accounting for acquisitions of non-controlling interests From 1 January 2010, the Group has applied FRS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (2009) in accounting for acquisitions of non-controlling interests. See note 2.2 for the new accounting policy. Previously, goodwill was recognised on the acquisition of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary, which represented the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the interest in the net assets acquired at the date of the transaction. The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively and has no impact on earnings per share. T he accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities, except as explained above. 2.2 Basis of Consolidation Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in income statement. Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in income statement. When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future service. annual report 2010 97 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. Upon the loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset depending on the level of influence retained. Associates and jointly-controlled entities Associates are companies in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over their financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Jointly-controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. Associates and jointly-controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The cost of the investments includes transaction cost. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of associates and jointly-controlled entities, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate or a jointly-controlled entity, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate or jointly-controlled entity) is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. Jointly-controlled assets Joint venture arrangements which involve the use of the assets that are jointly-controlled (whether or not owned jointly), without the establishment of a separate entity, are referred to as jointly-controlled assets. The Group recognises its interests in jointly-controlled assets using proportionate consolidation. The Group combines its share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint venture with the similar items, line by line, in its consolidated financial statements. Consistent accounting policies are applied for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. The joint venture is proportionately consolidated until the date on which the Group ceases to have joint control over the jointly-controlled assets. Acquisitions of non-controlling interests Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly-controlled entities are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 98 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Accounting for subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities by the Company Investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities are stated in the Company’s statement of financial position at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 2.3 Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at the date on which their fair values were determined. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, except for differences arising on the translation of monetary items that in substance form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign operation (see below), available-for-sale equity instruments, a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation (see below) or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2005, the exchange rates at the date of acquisition were used. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. However, if the operation is a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to income statement. Net investment in a foreign operation When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income, and are presented within equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. When the foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative amount in foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to income statement as part of profit or loss on disposal. Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation Foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the Group’s net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income, to the extent that the hedge is effective, and are presented within equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognised in the income statement. When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to the income statement as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal. annual report 2010 99 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.4 Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the cost of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located, and capitalised borrowing costs. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net in the income statement. Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure is recognised in the carrying amount of the asset if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the expenditure will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. All other subsequent expenditure are recognised in the income statement when incurred. Depreciation No depreciation is provided on freehold and 999-year leasehold land. For freehold and leasehold properties under development and renovation-in-progress, no depreciation is provided until these items have been completed. Depreciation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (or lease term, if shorter) of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows: Freehold and leasehold land and buildings • Core component of hotel buildings 50 years, or lease term if shorter • Surface finishes and services of hotel buildings 30 years, or lease term if shorter • Leasehold land (other than 999-year leasehold land) Lease term Furniture, fittings, plant and equipment and improvements 3 to 20 years Residual values ascribed to the core component of hotel buildings depend on the nature, location and tenure of each hotel property. No residual values are ascribed to surface finishes and services of hotel buildings. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date. 2.5 Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill and negative goodwill arise on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities. Acquisitions prior to 1 January 2001 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Goodwill and negative goodwill on acquisitions were written off against reserves in the year of acquisition. Goodwill and negative goodwill that had previously been taken to reserves are not taken to the income statement when (a) the business is disposed of or (b) the goodwill is impaired. 100 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Acquisitions occurring between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2005 There was no goodwill arising from acquisition of subsidiaries occurring between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2005. Acquisitions occurring between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2009 Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in intangible assets. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and jointly-controlled entities is presented together with investments in associates and jointly-controlled entities. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, and tested for impairment (Note 2.12). Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement. Acquisition on or after 1 January 2010 Goodwill represents the excess of: • the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus • the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus • if, the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in income statement. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets are amortised in the income statement on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives of 15 years, from the date on which they are available for use. 2.6 Investment properties Investment properties are properties held either to earn rental income or capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, or used in the production nor those used for the supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes. Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation No depreciation is provided on freehold and 999-year leasehold land included in the investment properties. Depreciation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (or lease terms, if shorter) of each component of the investment properties. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold and leasehold properties 50 years, or lease term if shorter Leasehold land (other than 999-year leasehold land) Lease term ranging from 85 to 97 years Furniture, fittings, plant and equipment and improvements 3 to 20 years Depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date. annual report 2010 101 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Transfers Transfers to, or from, investment properties are made where there is a change in use, evidenced by: • commencement of owner-occupation, for a transfer from investment properties to property, plant and equipment; • commencement of development with a view to sell, for a transfer from investment properties to development properties; and • end of owner-occupation, for a transfer from property, plant and equipment to investment properties. 2.7 Leased assets Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Other leases are operating leases, and except for investment properties and lease premium prepayment, the leased assets are not recognised in the statement of financial position. Lease premium prepayment relates to upfront premium paid in respect of long leasehold land where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership is not anticipated to pass to the Group. It is classified appropriately between current and non-current assets and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 2.8 Financial instruments Non-derivative financial assets The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other financial assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has the following categories of non-derivative financial assets: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss if the Group manages such investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy. Upon initial recognition, attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in the income statement. 102 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables excluding prepayments, and other non-current assets excluding deferred tax assets and intangible assets. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. The Group’s investments in certain equity securities and certain debt securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses (see note 2.12) and foreign currency differences on available-forsale monetary items (see note 2.3), are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the fair value reserve. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement. Where an investment in equity securities classified as available for sale does not have a quoted market price in an active market and other methods of determining fair value do not result in a reasonable estimate, the investment is measured at cost less impairment losses. Non-derivative financial liabilities The Group initially recognises all financial liabilities on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has the following categories of non-derivative financial liabilities: borrowings, other liabilities and trade and other payables excluding deferred income. Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Derivative financial instruments, including hedging activities The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below. annual report 2010 103 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Cash flow hedges Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity remains there until the forecast transaction affects the income statement. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is recognised. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the balance in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the income statement. In other cases the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement in the same period that the hedged item affects the income statement. Separable embedded derivatives Changes in the fair value of separable embedded derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement. Other non-trading derivatives When a derivative financial instrument is not designated in a hedge relationship that qualifies for hedge accounting, all changes in its fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement. 2.9 Interest-free intercompany loans Loans to subsidiaries Intercompany loans to subsidiaries for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and are, in substance, a part of the Company’s net investment in those subsidiaries, are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Such balances are eliminated in full in the consolidated financial statements. 2.10 Development properties Development properties are those properties which are held with the intention of development and sale in the ordinary course of business. They are stated at the lower of cost plus, where appropriate, a portion of attributable profit, and estimated net realisable value, net of progress billings. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in selling the property. The cost of properties under development comprise specifically identified costs, including acquisition costs, development expenditure, borrowing costs and other related expenditure. Borrowing costs payable on loans funding a development property are also capitalised, on a specific identification basis, as part of the cost of the development property until the completion of development. 2.11 Consumable stocks Consumable stocks comprise principally food and beverage and other hotel related consumable stocks. Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first-in first-out principle. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. 104 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.12 Impairment Impairment of financial assets A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more loss events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement. Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial asset are recognised by transferring the cumulative loss that has been recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the fair value reserve in equity, to the income statement. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost and available-for-sale debt securities, the reversal is recognised in the income statement. For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, an impairment loss once recognised in the income statement is not reversed through the income statement. Any subsequent increase in fair value of such assets is recognised in other comprehensive income. Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than development properties, consumable stocks and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets’ recoverable amounts are estimated. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date, and as and when indicators of impairment are identified. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value-in-use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that largely are independent from other assets and groups. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. annual report 2010 105 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.13 Non-current assets classified as held for sale Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Thereafter generally the assets, or disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to consumable stocks, financial assets, deferred tax assets and investment properties, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss. 2.14 Share capital Ordinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. Preference shares Preference shares are classified as equity if they are non-redeemable, or are redeemable only at the option of the Company and dividend payments are discretionary. Dividends thereon are recognised as distributions within equity. Dividends on non-redeemable preference shares are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared. 2.15 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Group. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement. The Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income and all expenses related to defined benefit plans in the income statement. 106 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Other long-term employee benefits The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits, other than pension plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Share-based payment transactions The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its equity instruments of the Group entities are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group. Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employees as measured at the date of modification. Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally. 2.16 Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. annual report 2010 107 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Capital expenditure A provision for capital expenditure is recognised for the Group’s contractual obligation to incur capital expenditure under the terms of the hotel operating agreements. Rental guarantee A provision for rental guarantee is recognised for the Group’s contractual obligation to compensate the buyer for any shortfall in net rental income under the sale and purchase agreement for the sales of the Group’s investment properties. 2.17 Financial guarantee contracts Financial guarantees are financial instruments issued by the Group that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for the loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to meet payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are accounted for as insurance contracts. A provision is recognised based on the Company’s estimate of the ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the reporting date. The provision is assessed by reviewing individual claims and tested for adequacy by comparing the amount recognised and the amount that would be required to settle the guarantee contract. 2.18 Revenue recognition Development properties for sale The Group recognises income on property development projects when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. In cases where the Group is obliged to perform any significant acts after the transfer of legal title or an equitable interest, revenue is recognised as the acts are performed based on the percentage of completion method under Recommended Accounting Practice (RAP) 11 Pre-completion Contracts for the Sale of Development Property issued by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore in October 2005. Under RAP 11, when (a) construction is beyond a preliminary stage, (b) the minimum down payment criterion is met, (c) sale prices are collectible, and (d) aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated, the percentage of completion method is an allowed alternative. If any of the above criteria are not met, pre-completion proceeds received are accounted for as deposits until such criteria are met. Under the percentage of completion method, the percentage of completion is measured by reference to the work performed, based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs for each contract. Profits are recognised only in respect of finalised sales agreements to the extent that such profits relate to the progress of the construction work. The Group’s current policy of recognising revenue using the percentage of completion method on its development projects in Singapore is an allowed alternative under RAP 11. The impact on the financial statements, had revenue on the Singapore projects been recognised using the completion of construction method, is as follows: Group 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 Decrease in revenue 214,996 613,299 (Increase)/Decrease in profit for the year (15,207) 198,267 Decrease in opening accumulated profits 682,316 484,049 Decrease in development properties as at 1 January 701,737 422,313 Decrease in development properties as at 31 December 861,958 701,737 Decrease in investments in jointly-controlled entities as at 1 January 83,927 133,009 (Increase)/Decrease in investments in jointly-controlled entities as at 31 December (77,812) 83,927 108 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) Rental and car park income Rental income (net of any lease incentives) is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals, which include gross turnover rental, are recognised as income in the accounting period on a receipt basis. Car park income is recognised on an accrual basis. Hotel income Revenue from hotel operations is recognised on an accrual basis, upon rendering of the relevant services. Dividends Dividend income is recognised in the income statement when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established. 2.19 Operating leases Where the Group has the use of assets under operating leases, payments made under the leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease payments made. Contingent rentals are charged to the income statement in the accounting period in which they are incurred. 2.20 Finance income and costs Finance income comprises mainly interest income on funds invested and mark-to-market gain on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and gain on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise mainly interest expense on borrowings, amortisation of transactions costs capitalised, mark-to-market loss on financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss and loss on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement. All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method, except to the extent that they are capitalised as being directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset which necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended use or sale. 2.21 Income tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivables on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly-controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. annual report 2010 109 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d) 2.21 Income tax (cont’d) A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 2.22 Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares and unquoted convertible notes issued by a jointly-controlled entity. 2.23 Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the board of directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. 110 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 3 Property, plant and equipment Freehold Furniture, and fittings, leasehold plant and Freehold Leasehold properties equipment land and land and under and Renovationbuildings buildings development improvements in-progress Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Group Cost At 1 January 2009 3,049,211 723,734 651,629 985,797 3,200 5,413,571 Transfers to investment properties on the adoption of Amendments to FRS 40 – (10,299) (564,573) – – (574,872) Additions 3,020 436 36,689 14,818 3,190 58,153 Disposals (485) (144) – (40,239) – (40,868) Written off during the year (38) – – (2,787) – (2,825) Reclassifications and transfers 6,967 (203) (1,298) (965) (4,501) – Translation differences on consolidation 20,389 33,600 (48) 21,418 132 75,491 At 31 December 2009 3,079,064 747,124 122,399 978,042 2,021 4,928,650 Acquisition through business combination (Note 35) – 93,079 – 35,575 – 128,654 Additions 1,089 13,492 36,890 26,583 8,917 86,971 Disposals (13) – (378) (26,154) – (26,545) Written off during the year – (8) – (2,548) – (2,556) Reclassifications and transfers 434 21,510 (40,326) 22,585 (4,203) – Translation differences on consolidation (270,762) (59,801) (822) (56,058) (222) (387,665) At 31 December 2010 2,809,812 815,396 117,763 978,025 6,513 4,727,509 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses At 1 January 2009 388,098 152,108 15,868 695,970 – 1,252,044 Transfers to investment properties on the adoption of Amendments to FRS 40 – (596) (11,901) – – (12,497) Charge for the year 18,654 6,613 – 53,626 – 78,893 Disposals (138) – – (39,450) – (39,588) Written off during the year – – – (2,560) – (2,560) Impairment losses 2,124 – – – – 2,124 Reclassifications 1,483 (79) – (1,404) – – Translation differences on consolidation 11,918 83 (106) 21,571 – 33,466 At 31 December 2009 422,139 158,129 3,861 727,753 – 1,311,882 Charge for the year 19,637 7,513 – 51,779 – 78,929 Disposals – (6) – (25,954) – (25,960) Written off during the year – (8) – (2,409) – (2,417) Impairment losses 30,414 426 – – – 30,840 Translation differences on consolidation (21,675) 3,957 (314) (58,181) – (76,213) At 31 December 2010 450,515 170,011 3,547 692,988 – 1,317,061 Carrying amount At 1 January 2009 2,661,113 571,626 635,761 289,827 3,200 4,161,527 At 31 December 2009 2,656,925 588,995 118,538 250,289 2,021 3,616,768 At 31 December 2010 2,359,297 645,385 114,216 285,037 6,513 3,410,448 annual report 2010 111 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 3 Property, plant and equipment (cont’d) Freehold Freehold properties Furniture, land and under fittings and buildings development equipments Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Company Cost At 1 January 2009 2,570 159,373 23,517 185,460 Transfers to investment properties on the adoption of Amendments to FRS 40 – (158,149) – (158,149) Additions – – 1,422 1,422 Disposals – – (259) (259) Written off during the year – – (292) (292) Reclassification 1,224 (1,224) – – At 31 December 2009 3,794 – 24,388 28,182 Additions – – 2,827 2,827 Disposals – – (1,431) (1,431) Written off during the year – – (659) (659) At 31 December 2010 3,794 – 25,125 28,919 Accumulated depreciation At 1 January 2009 – – 18,515 18,515 Charge for the year – – 2,025 2,025 Disposals – – (259) (259) Written off during the year – – (109) (109) At 31 December 2009 – – 20,172 20,172 Charge for the year – – 2,142 2,142 Disposals – – (1,431) (1,431) Written off during the year – – (659) (659) At 31 December 2010 – – 20,224 20,224 Carrying amount At 1 January 2009 2,570 159,373 5,002 166,945 At 31 December 2009 3,794 – 4,216 8,010 At 31 December 2010 3,794 – 4,901 8,695 Property, plant and equipment with the following carrying values were acquired under finance lease arrangements: Group Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Furniture, fittings and equipment – 4 – 3 In 2010, upon the Group assessing the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment for indications of impairment, the carrying amounts of certain property, plant and equipment were written down by $30,840,000 (2009: $2,124,000). The impairment losses were included in “other operating expenses”. The impairment losses of $30,840,000 were recognised in respect of six hotels each in United States of America and United Kingdom, held by a subsidiary. The estimates of recoverable amounts were based on the value-in-use of the said properties determined by either professional valuers or management of the subsidiary using discount rates ranging from 10.25% to 14.00%. In 2009, an impairment loss of $2,124,000 was recognised on a piece of freehold land located in India held by a subsidiary. The estimate of the recoverable amount was based on the prevailing market value of the land determined by a professional valuer. Included in property, plant and equipment are certain hotel properties of the Group with carrying value totalling $286,950,000 (2009: $523,836,000) which are mortgaged to certain financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to Notes 20 and 21 for more details of the facilities). 112 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 4 Investment properties Group Company $’000 $’000 Cost At 1 January 2009 2,978,407 337,563 Transfers from property, plant and equipment on adoption of Amendments to FRS 40 574,872 158,149 Additions 272,657 111,856 Transfers to assets classified as held for sale (16,348) – Written off during the year (436) (7) Translation differences on consolidation (6,613) – At 31 December 2009 3,802,539 607,561 Additions 13,733 972 Disposals (183,257) – Transfers to assets classified as held for sale (86,808) – Written off during the year (470) (195) Translation differences on consolidation (5,899) – At 31 December 2010 3,539,838 608,338 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses At 1 January 2009 665,732 60,448 Transfers from property, plant and equipment on adoption of Amendments to FRS 40 12,497 – Charge for the year 55,457 6,908 Transfers to assets classified as held for sale (1,566) – Written off during the year (223) (7) Impairment losses 8,346 – Translation differences on consolidation (1,470) – At 31 December 2009 738,773 67,349 Charge for the year 61,725 10,150 Disposals (63,527) – Transfers to assets classified as held for sale (4,836) – Written off during the year (323) (69) Impairment losses 23,863 – Translation differences on consolidation (744) – At 31 December 2010 754,931 77,430 Carrying amount At 1 January 2009 2,312,675 277,115 At 31 December 2009 3,063,766 540,212 At 31 December 2010 2,784,907 530,908 Fair value At 31 December 2009 6,651,673 1,096,013 At 31 December 2010 6,213,907 1,104,553 annual report 2010 113 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 4 Investment properties (cont’d) Investment properties comprise commercial, residential and industrial properties that are leased to external customers. Generally, each of the leases is fixed for a period of 2 to 3 years or more, and subsequent renewals are negotiated at prevailing market rates and terms. The fair values of investment properties located in Singapore are based on in-house valuations conducted by a licensed appraiser who is also an officer of the Company. The licensed appraiser has appropriate recognised professional qualifications and has recent experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued. The fair value is based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction. The valuation is based on the income method which takes into consideration the estimated net rent (using the current and projected average rental rates and occupancy), and a capitalisation rate applicable to the nature and type of asset in question. As a check, a comparison is made against relevant market transactions. The fair value of investment properties located overseas is determined by independent licensed appraisers who have appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued. Fair values are determined having regard to recent market transactions for similar properties in the same locations. In 2010, upon the Group and the Company identifying indications of impairment and thereafter assessing the carrying values of their investment properties, the Group recognised impairment losses of $23,863,000 on three properties located overseas. Impairment losses of $10,964,000 (2009: $Nil) were recognised in respect of two properties in United States of America. The estimate of recoverable amount of one of them was based on value-in-use of the property which comprised two blocks of office buildings, determined by professional appraiser using discount rate of 8.5% to 9.5% per annum. For the other property, which is a freehold land, its estimate of recoverable amount was based on direct comparison to recent land sales of similar locations. The remaining impairment loss of $12,899,000 (2009: $8,346,000) was in relation to a property in Japan. The estimate of recoverable amount of the said property was based on its fair value as determined by an independent licensed appraiser. Investment properties of the Group with a total carrying amount of $336,081,000 (2009: $1,186,859,000) are mortgaged to certain financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to Notes 20 and 21 for more details of the facilities). 114 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 5 Investments in and balances with subsidiaries Company Note 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 Investments in subsidiaries Unquoted shares, at cost 2,262,257 2,259,512 Discount implicit in non-current inter-company balances 7,095 7,095 Impairment losses (6,546) (7,408) 2,262,806 2,259,199 Balances with subsidiaries Amounts owing by subsidiaries trade, interest-free 3,300 2,703 non-trade, interest-free 1,191,145 1,015,436 non-trade, interest-bearing 2,555,600 1,813,122 3,750,045 2,831,261 Impairment losses (55,647) (44,363) 3,694,398 2,786,898 Receivable within 1 year 12 3,278,527 2,148,638 Receivable after 1 year 9 415,871 638,260 3,694,398 2,786,898 Amounts owing to subsidiaries trade, interest-free 1,353 637 non-trade, interest-free 993,742 391,876 non-trade, interest-bearing 150,304 229,454 1,145,399 621,967 Repayable within 1 year 27 995,399 560,843 Repayable after 1 year 24 150,000 61,124 1,145,399 621,967 During the year, the Company assessed the carrying amount of its investment in subsidiaries for indications of impairment. Based on this assessment, the Company reversed impairment loss of $862,000 (2009: $Nil) on its investment in a subsidiary which had disposed off a strata-unit in Chinatown Point and recognised a profit from the sale. Accordingly, the impairment loss previously provided on the investment in this subsidiary, now deemed not necessary, was reversed fully. The non-trade amounts owing by and to subsidiaries are unsecured. In respect of interest-bearing amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, interest was charged at 0.51% to 13.00% (2009: 0.61% to 13.00%) and at 1.34% to 3.57% (2009: 0.35% to 3.57%) per annum respectively. The balances with subsidiaries that are presented as receivable or repayable within one year are receivable or repayable on demand. Included in amounts owing by subsidiaries receivable after one year are loans to subsidiaries with carrying amounts of $397,167,000 (2009: $607,819,000) for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. As the amounts are in substance a part of the Company’s net investment in subsidiaries, they are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The remaining non-current receivables from subsidiaries are not expected to be repaid within the next one year.

The change in impairment losses in respect of balances with jointly-controlled entities is as follows: Group Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 At 1 January 71,610 65,765 46,797 50,001 Charge/(Write-back) of impairment losses 1,188 3,016 (31,060) (3,189) Reversal of impairment losses against investments in jointly-controlled entities (31,060) – – – Impairment losses utilised (4,349) – – – Translation differences on consolidation (1,649) 2,829 (563) (15) At 31 December 35,740 71,610 15,174 46,797 annual report 2010 117 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 7 Investments in and balances with jointly-controlled entities (cont’d) In total, the Group’s share of the jointly-controlled entities’ results, assets, liabilities and commitments is as follows: 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 Results Revenue and other operating income 217,765 287,187 Cost of sales and other expenses (145,676) (221,360) Profit before income tax 72,089 65,827 Income tax expense (8,728) (14,952) Non-controlling interests (7,925) (5,397) Profit for the year 55,436 45,478 Assets and liabilities Non-current assets 390,394 587,185 Current assets 1,614,098 1,719,912 Total assets 2,004,492 2,307,097 Current liabilities (544,246) (423,233) Non-current liabilities (923,136) (1,208,162) Total liabilities (1,467,382) (1,631,395) Commitments Development expenditure contracted but not provided for in the financial statements 116,363 60,388 Capital expenditure contracted but not provided for in the financial statements 317 2,965 Non-cancellable operating lease payables 29,817 7,613 Non-cancellable operating lease receivables 14,546 12,608 Further details regarding jointly-controlled entities are set out in Note 40. 118 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 8 Financial assets Group Company 2010 2009 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Non-current financial assets Unquoted equity investments available for sale fellow subsidiaries 3,363 3,365 3,290 3,290 non-related companies 114,760 140,873 1,340 1,340 Impairment losses (3,366) (5,204) – – 114,757 139,034 4,630 4,630 Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss unquoted convertible notes of a jointlycontrolled entity 211,379 198,697 – – 326,136 337,731 4,630 4,630 Quoted equity investments available for sale fellow subsidiaries 32,970 34,385 27,723 28,913 non-related companies 20,794 21,544 – – 53,764 55,929 27,723 28,913 Total 379,900 393,660 32,353 33,543 Group 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 Current financial assets Equity investments held for trading quoted 33,872 26,003 unquoted 2,013 6,668 35,885 32,671 Included in quoted equity investments held for trading are investments in shares of listed subsidiaries with a total carrying value of $13,516,000 (2009: $9,603,000) which are held by the Group for trading purposes. Included in unquoted investments available for sale are investments with a total carrying amount of $105,616,000 (2009: $129,192,000) which are measured at cost less impairment losses as the fair values cannot be determined reliably. As a result, the variability in the range of reasonable fair value estimates derived from valuation techniques is expected to be significant. The Group does not intend to dispose of these investments in the foreseeable future. Impairment losses on available-for-sale equity investments are recognised when there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of such investments below their cost. The Group has not reclassified any investments between various categories during the year.

The impact on the financial statements, had revenue on the Singapore development projects been recognised using the completion of construction method, is set out in Note 2.18. The allowance for foreseeable losses is estimated taking into account estimated selling prices and estimated total construction costs. The estimated selling prices are based on recent selling prices for the development project or comparable projects and prevailing property market conditions. The estimated total construction costs are based on contracted amounts and, in respect of amounts not contracted for, management’s estimates of the amounts to be incurred taking into consideration historical trends of the amounts incurred. Development properties of the Group and the Company with a carrying amount of $1,110,039,000 (2009: $923,051,000) and $315,867,000 (2009: $134,905,000) are mortgaged to financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to Note 20). 11 Non-current assets classified as held for sale During the year, the Group entered into sale and purchase contracts to sell two of its investment properties and a strataunit of an investment property. The transactions for one of the investment properties and the strata-unit were completed subsequent to the reporting date. The transaction for the other investment property is expected to be completed within 6 months from the reporting date. The investment properties relate to the rental properties segment. At 31 December 2010, the assets and liabilities associated with the above investment properties of the Group have been presented in the statement of financial position as “Assets classified as held for sale” and “Liabilities classified as held for sale”. In 2009, the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale relate to the sale transactions of two investment properties that were completed in year 2010.

Due to this factor, management believes that no additional credit risks beyond amount provided for collection losses is inherent in the Group’s trade and other receivables. Trade receivables that were not past due relate to a wide range of customers for whom there has not been a significant change in the credit quality. 13 Accrued receivables Accrued receivables represent mainly the remaining balances of sales consideration for development properties to be billed. In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, income is recognised on the sale of development properties based on the progress of the construction work. Upon receipt of the Temporary Occupation Permit, the balance of sales consideration to be billed is included as accrued receivables. annual report 2010 123 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 14 Amounts owing by and to fellow subsidiaries Group Company Note 2010 2009 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Amounts owing by fellow subsidiaries: trade, interest-free 12 69 86 12 9 Amounts owing to fellow subsidiaries: trade, interest-free 7 13 19 13 non-trade, interest-free 177 177 – – non-trade, interest-bearing 28,359 24,242 – – 27 28,543 24,432 19 13 Fellow subsidiaries are subsidiaries of the immediate holding company which are subject to common control.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. For this purpose, the Group defines “capital” as including all components of equity, including non-controlling interests. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders or issue new shares or other financial instruments. The Group monitors capital using a net debt equity ratio, which is defined as net borrowings divided by total capital employed.

There are two parts of the M&C 2003 Scheme, namely the “Approved” part for which approval from the United Kingdom Inland Revenue has been obtained, and the “Unapproved” part which is not designed for the United Kingdom Inland Revenue approval and which is used primarily where employees have more than £30,000 worth of outstanding approved options or are not based in the United Kingdom. Except to the extent required to obtain the United Kingdom Inland Revenue approval, the Approved and Unapproved parts of the M&C 2003 Scheme are in all material aspects identical. (b) Under the terms of the M&C 2003 Scheme, (i) All employees of M&C, its subsidiaries and joint ventures (including directors who are required to devote substantially the whole of their working time to the business of the M&C Group who are not within six months of contractual retirement ages) will be eligible to participate in the M&C 2003 Scheme. (ii) No option may be granted to an individual if it would cause the aggregate exercise price of options granted to him in any year under the M&C 2003 Scheme to exceed 200% of his basic salary, other than in exceptional circumstances (where the limit is 400% of basic salary). (iii) No payment will be required for the grant of an option. Acquisition price upon the exercise of an option will not be less than the higher of: the average of the middle-market quotations of a share on the London Stock Exchange on the three dealing days immediately prior to grant date, provided that no such dealing day may fall prior to the date on which M&C last announced its results for any period; and the nominal value of a share (unless the option is expressed to relate only to existing shares). (c) No options may be granted which would cause the number of shares issued or issuable pursuant to options granted in the previous ten years under the M&C 2003 Scheme or under any other share option scheme, or issued in that period under any employee share scheme (other than an option scheme) to exceed 10% of M&C’s issued ordinary share capital from time to time. Not more than 5% of M&C’s issued ordinary share capital from time to time may relate to discretionary share schemes. (ii) Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Schemes 1996 and 2006 (a) The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Schemes 1996 and 2006 (M&C Sharesave Schemes) are the United Kingdom Inland Revenue approved schemes under which the executive directors of M&C and the M&C Group employees are eligible to participate. (b) Under the terms of the M&C Sharesave Schemes, M&C Group employees were to enter into a three-year or five-year savings contract, with an option to purchase shares at a pre-determined exercise price on maturity of the savings contract. The first such scheme was introduced in 1996 with a life of ten years. A replacement scheme was approved by the shareholders at M&C’s Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2006. (c) No payment is required for the grant of an option. (d) The options may be exercised upon maturity provided that the monies agreed under the savings contract are fully paid and the participant continues to hold office or employment with M&C.

Under the terms of the LTIP, M&C is permitted to make both Performance Share Awards and Deferred Share Bonus Awards to an employee (including an executive director) of M&C or its subsidiaries. The level of awards made under the terms of the LTIP are determined by M&C’s Remuneration Committee. Vesting of Performance Share Awards is subject to the achievement of stretch performance targets. Consistent with the performance measures for M&C’s executive share options schemes, earnings per share (EPS) targets have been chosen so that participants are incentivised to deliver significant earnings growth which, in turn, should return substantial shareholder value. The performance condition applying to Performance Share Awards require M&C’s EPS to grow, in real terms, over a period of three consecutive financial years after the award. Performance Share Awards will vest on the third anniversary of the award being made, subject to the EPS growth targets being met. Awards are not subject to re-testing.

the date of exercise is £4.65 (2009: £3.46). Options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. The options outstanding as at 31 December 2010 had an exercise price in the range of £1.54 to £5.20 and a weighted average contractual life of 1.82 years (2009: 3 years). The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a stochastic model. The share option pricing model involves six variables, namely the exercise price, share price at grant date, expected life of option, expected volatility of share price, risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield. The variables used in estimating the fair value of options and awards granted under the M&C option schemes, presented in Sterling Pound, are as follows: Share price Awards/ prevailing Expected Expected Risk free Date of options on date Exercise Fair term Expected dividend interest grant granted of grant price value (years) volatility yield rate £ £ £ 2009 LTIP (directors) 30.03.2009 653,120 1.70 – 1.52 3.00 – 3.69% – LTIP (non-directors) 30.03.2009 950,607 1.70 – 1.52 3.00 – 3.69% – Sharesave Scheme (3 year) 01.04.2009 210,168 1.81 1.54 0.55 3.25 43.3% 3.45% 1.73% Sharesave Scheme (5 year) 01.04.2009 61,575 1.81 1.54 0.54 5.25 36.0% 3.45% 2.34% 2010 LTIP (directors) 16.09.2010 56,936 5.25 – 5.07 3.00 – 1.19% – LTIP (non-directors) 16.09.2010 643,276 5.25 – 5.07 3.00 – 1.19% – Sharesave Scheme (3 year) 01.04.2010 47,025 4.90 3.30 2.24 3.25 48.0% 1.27% 1.91% Sharesave Scheme (5 year) 01.04.2010 18,088 4.90 3.30 2.33 5.25 39.8% 1.27% 2.76% annual report 2010 133 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 19 Interest-bearing borrowings Group Company Note 2010 2009 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Term loans 20 2,105,129 2,489,926 1,403,901 1,468,984 Finance lease creditors – 4 – 3 Bonds and notes 21 2,031,553 1,524,846 1,096,745 529,261 Bank loans 22 67,767 – 47,536 – Bank overdrafts 15 852 1,352 – – 4,205,301 4,016,128 2,548,182 1,998,248 Repayable: Within 1 year 780,002 818,312 277,404 244,962 After 1 year but within 5 years 3,325,965 3,197,816 2,270,778 1,753,286 After 5 years 99,334 – – – 4,205,301 4,016,128 2,548,182 1,998,248 20 Term loans Group Company Note 2010 2009 2010 2009 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Secured 727,977 880,794 232,535 92,155 Unsecured 1,377,152 1,609,132 1,171,366 1,376,829 19 2,105,129 2,489,926 1,403,901 1,468,984 Repayable: Within 1 year 392,642 298,891 229,868 84,969 After 1 year but within 5 years 1,613,153 2,191,035 1,174,033 1,384,015 After 5 years 99,334 – – – 2,105,129 2,489,926 1,403,901 1,468,984 The term loans are obtained from banks and financial institutions.

The most significant funds are described below: United Kingdom (UK) The Group makes contributions to a pension scheme (the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan) for its UK employees, which was set up in 1993. The scheme is a funded defined benefit arrangement with different categories of membership. The Trustees of the Plan have appointed Newton Investment Management Limited, Legal and General Investment Management Limited and Ignis Asset Management Limited as the investment managers of the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan. The assets of the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan are held separately from those of the Group. The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method. The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 6 April 2008 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2010. The contributions of the Group during the year were 21.6% (2009: 21.6%) of pensionable salary, plus enhanced contributions of $3.2 million (£1.4 million) per annum to remove the Plan’s deficit. As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to mortality, the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions. Korea The Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Korea. The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2010. The contributions of the Group were 9.9% (2009: 5.2%) of the employees’ earnings. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries. Taiwan The Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan. The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2010. The contributions of the Group were 6% (2009: 6%) of the employees’ earnings. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries. The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 UK Korea Taiwan UK Korea Taiwan Inflation rate 3.60% – – 3.70% – – Discount rate* 5.40% 5.00% 1.75% 5.70% 6.00% 2.25% Rate of salary increase 4.10% 4.00% 2.50% 4.20% 4.00% 2.50% Rate of pension increase 3.60% – – 3.70% – – Annual expected return on plan assets 6.40% 5.00% 1.75% 6.70% 5.00% 2.25% * The discount rate used in respect of the UK pension scheme of 5.4% (2009: 5.7%) was based on the yield of the Merrill Lynch over-15 year AA rated corporate bond index. annual report 2010 139 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 23 Employee benefits (cont’d) The life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan, based on retirement age of 65, are as follows: 2010 2009 Years Years Males 25 25 Females 28 28 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not be necessarily borne out in practice. The present values of the schemes’ liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain. The expected annual return on UK plan assets for 2010 of 6.4% (2009: 6.7%) has been calculated using a 6.8% (2009: 7.1%) return on equity representing 72.0% (2009: 73.0%) of plan assets and a 5.4% (2009: 5.7%) return on bonds representing 28.0% (2009: 27.0%) of plan assets.

(Beijing Fortune) which owns and operates the Grand Millennium Hotel Beijing became a 70% owned subsidiary following the Group’s 54% owned subsidiary, Millennium & Copthorne Hotel plc (M&C) exercising an option to buy an additional 40% interest from Beijing Xiangjiang Xinli Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. for a consideration of RMB 189,257,000. Beijing Fortune was previously a jointly-controlled entity which M&C held a 30% interest. From 15 November 2010 to 31 December 2010, Beijing Fortune contributed revenue of $4,236,000 and a net loss of $1,406,000 to the consolidated profit for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2010, management estimates the Group’s revenue and profit for the year would have been $3,159,905,000 and $819,389,000 respectively. (b) On 31 December 2010, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in its jointly-controlled entity, Glengary Pte. Ltd. for a consideration of $9,039,000. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2010, management estimates the Group’s profit for the year would have been $830,163,000. There is however, no effect on the Group’s revenue. The following summarises the major classes of consideration transferred, and the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition dates: Preacquisition Finalised Fair carrying fair value value on amount adjustment acquisition $’000 $’000 $’000 Property, plant and equipment 128,031 623 128,654 Lease premium prepayment non-current 57,502 30,198 87,700 Lease premium prepayment current 1,622 860 2,482 Consumable stocks 387 – 387 Trade and other receivables 2,528 – 2,528 Cash at bank 36,952 – 36,952 Trade and other payables (40,299) 4,499 (35,800) Interest-bearing borrowings (32,276) – (32,276) Non-current term loan (93,071) – (93,071) Deferred taxation – (7,921) (7,921) 61,376 28,259 89,635 Non-controlling interests (based on share of net assets) (15,689) (7,128) (22,817) Net assets acquired 45,687 21,131 66,818 Amount previously accounted for as jointly-controlled entities (4,539) Goodwill (*) 17,042 Gain arising in respect of step up acquisition (**) (17,662) Fair value of the tax indemnity to former shareholders (***) (15,578) Cash consideration paid, satisfied in cash 46,081 Cash acquired (36,952) Net cash outflow 9,129 154 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 35 Acquisition of subsidiaries (cont’d) The transaction costs incurred for the above acquisitions amounted to $417,000. * This arose from acquisition of Beijing Fortune. In 2006 when the initial 30% interest in Beijing Fortune was acquired and in 2007 when the option price for the additional 40% interest and the subsequent tax indemnity (refer***) was agreed, the ultimate value of M&C’s interest in the hotel was expected to be considerably in excess of its cost. However, after the opening of hotel in April 2008 and the difficult economic conditions and over supplied hotel situation in Beijing post 2008 Olympics, the trading and value of the hotel fell. Although the value of hotel increased subsequently, as reflected in the gain on step acquisition (refer**), it has not yet attained the level originally anticipated. Upon completion of the acquisition, management of M&C conducted an impairment review on the goodwill which is allocated to hotel. It was determined that the recoverable value of the acquired business should be based on the aggregate of the fair value Beijing Fortune’s identifiable assets and liabilities as shown on the above table which supported their carrying value. The goodwill reflects the strategic development opportunities in this region and is not supported by the recoverable value of Beijing Fortune. The goodwill had accordingly been written-off to the income statement. ** This was derived by applying 30% to the fair value of the net assets acquired, adjusted to exclude a control premium, less the carrying cost of the original investment. This amount has been credited to the income statement under “other operating income”. *** This represents the fair value of a liability for additional costs of securing the land on which Grand Millennium Hotel Beijing is sited. The transfer of land attracts land appreciation tax and foreign enterprise income not originally factored into the land sale price. A definitive framework agreement to purchase the original 30% interest and then take up an option to purchase an additional 40% interest was later supplemented in September 2007 with a deed of indemnity to remedy the tax issue. Under the terms of that indemnity, it is only applicable in the event that M&C’s interest steps up to 70% and this represents 70% of the total tax liability. On 22 September 2009, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in its jointly-controlled entity, K-EL Sun Investments Pte. Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively “K-EL Sun”), for a consideration of $35,145,000. From 22 September 2009 to 31 December 2009, K-EL Sun contributed a net loss of $36,000 to the consolidated net profit for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2009, management estimates that the Group’s net profit for the year would have been $670,546,000. There is, however, no effect on the Group’s revenue. The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities on acquisition date: Preacquisition Finalised carrying fair value Fair value on amount adjustment acquisition $’000 $’000 $’000 Development property 316,761 (6,162) 310,599 Other current assets 139 – 139 Cash at bank 102 – 102 Trade and other payables (1,975) – (1,975) Amount owing to shareholder (41,411) – (41,411) Non-current term loan (secured) (232,413) – (232,413) Net assets acquired 41,203 (6,162) 35,041 Amount previously accounted for as jointly-controlled entities 104 Cash consideration paid, satisfied in cash 35,145 Cash acquired (102) Net cash outflow 35,043 annual report 2010 155 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 36 Financial instruments by category Set out below is an analysis of the Group’s financial instruments: Financial Availableassets at Loans for-sale fair value Fair value Liabilities at and financial through hedging amortised Note receivables assets profit or loss instruments cost Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2010 Assets Financial assets – 168,521 247,264 – – 415,785 Other non-current assets excluding deferred tax assets and intangible assets 111,894 – – – – 111,894 Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 833,203 – – – – 833,203 Cash and cash equivalents 15 1,873,826 – – – – 1,873,826 2,818,923 168,521 247,264 – – 3,234,708 Liabilities Interest-bearing borrowings 19 – – – – 4,205,301 4,205,301 Trade and other payables excluding deferred income 27 – – – 2,685 853,390 856,075 Other liabilities 24 – – – – 77,015 77,015 – – – 2,685 5,135,706 5,138,391 Financial Availableassets at Loans for-sale fair value Liabilities at and financial through amortised Note receivables assets profit or loss cost Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2009 Assets Financial assets – 194,963 231,368 – 426,331 Other non-current assets excluding deferred tax assets and intangible assets 56,373 – – – 56,373 Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 718,810 – – – 718,810 Cash and cash equivalents 15 981,486 – – – 981,486 1,756,669 194,963 231,368 – 2,183,000 Liabilities Interest-bearing borrowings 19 – – – 4,016,128 4,016,128 Trade and other payables excluding deferred income 27 – – – 744,812 744,812 Other liabilities 24 – – – 89,376 89,376 – – – 4,850,316 4,850,316 156 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 36 Financial instruments by category (cont’d) AvailableLoans for-sale Liabilities at and financial amortised Note receivables assets cost Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Company 2010 Assets Financial assets – 32,353 – 32,353 Other non-current assets 18,704 – – 18,704 Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 3,574,271 – – 3,574,271 Cash and cash equivalents 15 981,090 – – 981,090 4,574,065 32,353 – 4,606,418 Liabilities Interest-bearing borrowings 19 – – 2,548,182 2,548,182 Trade and other payables excluding deferred income 27 – – 1,241,169 1,241,169 Other liabilities 24 – – 171,203 171,203 – – 3,960,554 3,960,554 AvailableLoans for-sale Liabilities at and financial amortised Note receivables assets cost Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Company 2009 Assets Financial assets – 33,543 – 33,543 Other non-current assets 30,441 – – 30,441 Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 2,592,022 – – 2,592,022 Cash and cash equivalents 15 407,571 – – 407,571 3,030,034 33,543 – 3,063,577 Liabilities Interest-bearing borrowings 19 – – 1,998,248 1,998,248 Trade and other payables excluding deferred income 27 – – 777,938 777,938 Other liabilities 24 – – 92,542 92,542 – – 2,868,728 2,868,728 annual report 2010 157 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group is exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The key financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, such as interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and equity price risk. The Group has a system of controls in place to maintain an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks. The management continually monitors the Group’s risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Audit Committee provides independent oversight of the effectiveness of the financial risk management process. It is, and has been throughout the current and previous financial year, the Group’s policy that no derivatives shall be undertaken for speculative purposes except for its use as hedging instruments where appropriate and cost efficient. Credit risk The Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Group does not require collateral in respect of these financial assets. Transactions involving financial instruments are entered into only with counterparties that are of acceptable credit quality. Cash and fixed deposits are placed with banks and financial institutions which are regulated. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of the specific loss component in respect of trade and other receivables. The allowance account in respect of trade receivables and other receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible. At that point, the financial asset is considered irrecoverable and the amount charged to the allowance account is written off against the carrying amount of the impaired financial asset. At the reporting date, there is no significant concentration of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset at the reporting date. 158 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Liquidity risk The Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and credit facilities deemed adequate by management to finance the Group’s operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.

Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. 160 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Liquidity risk (cont’d) Interest rate risk The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its interest-bearing financial assets and debt obligations. The Group adopts a policy of managing its interest rate exposure by maintaining a debt portfolio with both fixed and floating interest rates. Where appropriate, the Group uses interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate exposure for specific underlying debt obligations. Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the benefit from the flexibility of variable rate borrowings, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives. Where used, interest rate derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value within the Group’s statement of financial position. Further details of interest rate derivatives in place at 31 December 2010 (2009: Nil) are provided below: Cash flow hedges During the year, a subsidiary of the Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps to fix the interest relating to the payment of quarterly interest charges arising on floating rate unsecured bonds totalling US$50 million, and designated it as a cash flow hedge. The risk being hedged is the variability of cash flows arising from movements in interest rates. The hedge is in place until the loans mature in March 2013. The fair value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2010 was a £0.4 million (approximately $845,000) liability (2009: $Nil). The cash flows occur on a quarterly basis until the loan balance matures in March 2013 and the hedge is designated as a cash flow hedge, which is considered to be highly effective. The carrying value of the hedging instruments is restated to its fair value at each reporting date, with the effective portion of changes in fair value since inception being taken to the hedging reserve. The loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of the change in fair value of these hedging instruments was £0.4 million (approximately $845,000) (2009: $Nil). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arose from this cash flow hedge. annual report 2010 161 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Interest rate risk (cont’d) Interest rates analysis In respect of interest-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, their nominal interest rates at the reporting date and carrying amounts are illustrated as below: Interest rates per annum Carrying amount Note Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate Total % % $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2010 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents – 0.01 to 6.00 – 1,645,671 1,645,671 Amounts owing by jointly-controlled entities* – 0.75 to 4.75 – 426,457 426,457 Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss – 15.00 – 211,379 211,379 – 2,283,507 2,283,507 Financial liabilities Bank overdrafts 15 3.54 – (852) – (852) Term loans 20 secured 0.68 to 7.17 – (727,977) – (727,977) unsecured 0.62 to 5.75 – (1,377,152) – (1,377,152) Bank loans 22 secured 5.95 to 6.65 – (20,231) – (20,231) unsecured 0.52 to 0.81 – (47,536) – (47,536) Bonds and notes 21 secured – 3.01 to 3.88 – (299,784) (299,784) unsecured 0.96 to 1.25 1.34 to 4.85 (367,143) (1,364,626) (1,731,769) Amounts owing to a fellow subsidiary – 2.50 – (28,359) (28,359) (2,540,891) (1,692,769) (4,233,660) Total (2,540,891) 590,738 (1,950,153) * Carrying amount is net of impairment losses. 162 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Interest rate risk (cont’d) Interest rates per annum Carrying amount Note Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate Total % % $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2009 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents – 0.01 to 4.08 – 841,549 841,549 Amounts owing by jointly-controlled entities* – 0.75 to 4.75 – 466,280 466,280 Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss – 15.00 – 198,697 198,697 – 1,506,526 1,506,526 Financial liabilities Bank overdrafts 15 3.12 – (1,352) – (1,352) Term loans 20 secured 0.90 to 6.21 – (880,794) – (880,794) unsecured 0.71 to 5.62 – (1,609,132) – (1,609,132) Finance lease creditors 19 – 3.33 to 6.51 – (4) (4) Bonds and notes 21 secured 3.34 to 3.39 2.95 to 3.88 (58,313) (349,841) (408,154) unsecured 0.94 to 1.51 3.07 to 5.50 (388,717) (727,975) (1,116,692) Amounts owing to a fellow subsidiary – 2.50 – (24,242) (24,242) (2,938,308) (1,102,062) (4,040,370) Total (2,938,308) 404,464 (2,533,844) * Carrying amount is net of impairment losses. annual report 2010 163 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Interest rate risk (cont’d) Interest rates per annum Carrying amount Note Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate Total % % $’000 $’000 $’000 Company 2010 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents – 0.03 to 0.50 – 971,731 971,731 Amounts owing by: subsidiaries* 0.51 to 2.40 1.00 to 13.00 822,720 1,699,199 2,521,919 jointly-controlled entities* – 1.50 – 164,321 164,321 822,720 2,835,251 3,657,971 Financial liabilities Amounts owing to a subsidiary 5 – 1.34 to 3.57 – (150,304) (150,304) Term loans 20 secured 0.68 to 1.43 – (232,535) – (232,535) unsecured 0.62 to 1.71 – (1,171,366) – (1,171,366) Bonds and notes (unsecured) 21 – 2.48 to 4.85 – (1,096,745) (1,096,745) Bank loans 22 0.6 to 0.61 – (47,536) – (47,536) (1,451,437) (1,247,049) (2,698,486) Total (628,717) 1,588,202 959,485 * Carrying amount is net of impairment losses. 164 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Interest rate risk (cont’d) Interest rates per annum Carrying amount Note Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate Total % % $’000 $’000 $’000 Company 2009 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents – 0.02 to 0.43 – 390,867 390,867 Amounts owing by: subsidiaries* 0.64 to 3.57 1.00 to 13.00 726,308 1,066,174 1,792,482 jointly-controlled entities* – 1.50 to 2.50 – 250,727 250,727 726,308 1,707,768 2,434,076 Financial liabilities Amounts owing to subsidiaries 5 3.02 to 3.57 – (229,454) – (229,454) Term loans 20 secured 0.95 to 1.05 – (92,155) – (92,155) unsecured 0.86 to 2.71 – (1,376,829) – (1,376,829) Finance lease creditors – 6.51 – (3) (3) Bonds and notes (unsecured) 21 – 3.10 to 5.50 – (529,261) (529,261) (1,698,438) (529,264) (2,227,702) Total (972,130) 1,178,504 206,374 * Carrying amount is net of impairment losses. Sensitivity analysis For the variable rate financial assets and liabilities, a 100 basis points (bp) increase at the reporting date would have the impact as shown below. A decrease in 100 bp in interest rate would have an equal but opposite effect. This analysis, which is based on reporting date of each interest-bearing financial asset and liability, assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and does not take into account the effect of qualifying borrowing costs allowed for capitalisation.

The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen, Sterling Pound, Thai Baht and United States Dollar. The Group has a decentralised approach to the management of foreign exchange risk. The Group manages its foreign exchange exposure by adopting a policy of matching receipts and payments, and asset purchases and borrowings, in the currency of the relevant entity, where possible. Entities in the Group may have different approaches to the identification and management of this risk. Entities in the Group may borrow in currencies other than their functional currencies to fund investments that are denominated in their borrowing currencies. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used purely as a hedging tool, where an active market for the relevant currency exists, to minimise the Group’s exposure to movements in exchange rates on firm commitments and specific transactions. Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or shortterm forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined. Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge specific transaction exposure where appropriate. Further details of foreign exchange derivatives in place at 31 December 2010 (2009: Nil) are provided below: Cash flow hedges During the year, a number of forward cross currency swaps were executed by a subsidiary of the Group to hedge the foreign currency risk in respect of the repayment in February 2013 of a US$30 million loan using Korean Won. This loan was extended to a subsidiary in Korea, whose functional currency is Korean Won. The proceeds of the US dollar loan were converted into Korean Won on inception, and the risk being hedged is the variability of the cash flow associated with the repayment of the US$30 million loan principal on its maturity date in February 2013, arising from movement of Korean Won against the US dollar over that 3-year period. The hedge is designated as a cash flow hedge, which is considered to be highly effective. The carrying value of the hedging instruments is restated to its fair value at each reporting date, with the effective portion of changes in fair value since inception being taken to a cash flow hedge reserve. The loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of the change in fair value of these hedging instruments was £0.4 million (approximately $845,000) (2009: $Nil). 166 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Foreign currency risk (cont’d) The Group’s and Company’s exposure to foreign currencies are as follows: Singapore United States Sterling Dollar Dollar Pound Thai Baht Others $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2010 Financial assets – 3,348 15,548 – 370 Trade and other receivables** 236 707 – 1,307 1,527 Cash and cash equivalents 77,213 66,009 27,355 – 2,957 Amount owing (to)/by subsidiaries (net) (343,561) 99,036 4,902 111,071 52,061 Interest-bearing borrowings (216,000) (458,601) – – (47,536) Trade and other payables*** (2,868) (1,010) (2) – (508) (484,980) (290,511) 47,803 112,378 8,871 Singapore United States Japanese Dollar Dollar Yen Thai Baht Others $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2009 Financial assets – – – – 12,629 Other non-current assets* – 5,340 – – – Trade and other receivables** 28 230 – – 4 Cash and cash equivalents 16,531 44,396 – – 35,157 Amount owing (to)/by subsidiaries (net) (420,074) (275,662) 71,474 109,620 22,293 Interest-bearing borrowings (219,000) (483,669) – – – Trade and other payables*** (5,678) (994) (67) – (789) (628,193) (710,359) 71,407 109,620 69,294 * Excluding deferred tax assets and intangible assets ** Excluding prepayments *** Excluding deferred income annual report 2010 167 Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Foreign currency risk (cont’d) United States Hong Kong Japanese Dollar Dollar Yen Others $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Company 2010 Trade and other receivables* 84 – – 2 Cash and cash equivalents 3,546 72 – 15 Amount owing (to)/by subsidiaries (net) (21,952) (11,472) 61,509 (6) Interest-bearing borrowings (46,134) – (47,536) – Trade and other payables (125) – (72) (5) (64,581) (11,400) 13,901 6 2009 Trade and other receivables* 84 – – 4 Cash and cash equivalents 238 85 – 20 Amount owing (to)/by subsidiaries (net) (23,888) (12,219) 71,474 (6) Interest-bearing borrowings (119,256) – – – Trade and other payables (502) – (67) (5) (143,324) (12,134) 71,407 13 * Excluding prepayments Sensitivity analysis A 10% strengthening of the following major currencies against the functional currency of each of the Group’s entities at the reporting date held by the Group and Company would increase/(decrease) profit, and accumulated profits, and other components of equity before any tax effect by the amounts shown below.

When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability. Investments in equity and convertible notes The fair values of quoted investments that are classified as available for sale and held for trading are their quoted bid prices at the reporting date. The fair values of unquoted equity investments held for trading are estimated using the applicable price to earnings ratios for similar listed companies adjusted for the specific circumstances of the issuer. The fair values of unquoted equity investments available for sale (except as described below) are estimated using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by prices from observable current market transactions. Instead, they are based on unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions about the way assets would be priced. The fair values of certain unquoted equity investments available for sale have not been determined as the fair value cannot be determined reliably. As a result, the variability in the range of recoverable fair value estimates derived from valuation techniques is expected to be significant. The fair value of convertible notes is determined using the Black-Scholes model. Measurement inputs include the fair value of the convertible notes issuer’s shares on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatilty (based on weighted average historic volatility of publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the instrument (based on general noteholder behaviour), expected dividends and the risk-free interest rate. 170 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 37 Financial risk management (cont’d) Fair values (cont’d) Amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities The fair values of amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, associates and jointly-controlled entities are estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates. Non-derivative financial assets and liabilities The fair values of borrowings which reprice after six months and other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities, determined for disclosure purposes, are calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar agreements. The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year (including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and interest-bearing borrowings) or those which reprice within six months are assumed to approximate their fair values because of the short period to maturity or repricing. All other financial assets and liabilities are discounted to determine their fair values. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate. For interest rate swaps, bank valuations are used. Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows: • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and • Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair value of these financial instruments are measured using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions that are not evidenced by prices from observable current market transactions. Instead, they are based on ‘unobservable’ inputs reflecting management’s ‘own assumptions’ about the way assets would be priced. Although the Group believes that its estimate of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value. For fair value measurements in Level 3, changing one or more of the assumptions used to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would have the following effects: Effect on fair value Favourable Unfavourable Fair value changes changes $’000 $’000 $’000 Group 2010 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 211,379 5,893 (7,377) 2009 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 198,697 7,290 (7,983) The favourable and unfavourable effects of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been calculated by recalibrating the model values. The most significant unobservable input in relation to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss relates to risk-adjusted discount rate. The discount rate was increased/decreased by 1% from the discount rate as at reporting date to arrive at the possible favourable/unfavourable effects. 172 city developments limited Notes to the Financial Statements Year ended 31 December 2010 38 Operating segments Information reported to the Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performances is specifically focused on the functionality of services provided. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments: • Property development – develops and purchases residential properties for sale • Hotel operations – owns and manages hotels • Rental properties – develops and purchases investment properties for lease • Others – comprises club operator and owner, investment in shares, property management, project management and consultancy services and provider of information technology and procurement services. None of these segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2010 and 2009. Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before income tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
