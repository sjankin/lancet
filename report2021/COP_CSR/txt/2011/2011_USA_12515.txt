Corporate Vision Promega Corporation is built on a vision where • Innovative research tools accelerate scientific discovery • Life science research can lead to the cure and prevention of many diseases • The work environment nurtures creativity • The corporation appreciates and values the contributions of each employee Promega Corporate responsibility Report 2010 7 Supply Chain Management To date, Promega’s Corporate Responsibility program has focused on the part of the supply chain over which we have direct control. As this report demonstrates, we are measuring and reporting on our people, planet and community impacts. However, while we recognize the value and importance of further developing our Corporate Responsibility through engagement of our suppliers, our program has not yet expanded into that arena. We realize that there is still much room for improvement throughout our global supply chain. In 2011, we plan to tackle this further by reaching out to suppliers to learn about their commitments to sustainability. Once we better understand their efforts and commitments, we can collaborate and achieve even greater success. Leadership Creative Approach Innovation Paradigm Shift Although meticulous and rational, scientists must also maintain imagination in their work if they are to discover the mysteries of the unknown. In response to the needs of such individualists, we have a long and creative tradition of doing what is best versus what is expected. That independent spirit and determination has led to a number Integration Throughout business processes of firsts that continue for Promega in each of its multiple roles as a business, a member of the community and an employer. Today, Promega is the largest privately held life science company in the world, an Continuous Improvement What you measure will improve accomplishment of which we are very proud. In an environment where acquisition is the norm, we have maintained independence and instead, forged selective, global partnerships. As an example, we work with proteomics experts at the Kazusa Institute Compliance Meeting requirements in Chiba, Japan (the sister state to Wisconsin) as well as with thought leaders in life science research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Promega embraces the values of corporate responsibility through all aspects of operations and supply chain and strives toward leadership. Promega Corporate responsibility Report 2010 8 Product Offerings A production scientist manufactures a pre-amplification component for the Promega PowerPlex® systems. Product reach Overview Promega’s investment in research and development for more than 30 years has led to an offering of over 2,000 products used to answer a variety of scientific questions. This commitment to innovation has proven valuable to customers as evidenced by thousands of scientific publications referencing the use of Promega reagents and instruments. Promega products play a vital role in supporting scientific advances made in the following areas: Promega Corporate responsibility Report 2010 9 Molecular Diagnostics The HaloTag® Mammalian Protein Purification System overcomes problems scientists Medical technicians and clinical pathologists prepare DNA samples before performexperience while purifying genetically engiing diagnostic tests for organ transplants, infectious diseases and genetic screening. neered fusion proteins. Researchers improve the recovery of difficult-to-express proteins, resulting in a tag-free protein ready for mass spectrometry analysis. Drug Discovery Biotechnology and pharmaceutical labs need tools to screen tens of thousands of compounds only to identify a handful of potential new drug candidates. These industrial researchers look for tools to shorten their product development cycles and reduce costs by weeding out undesirable drug characteristics (e.g. toxicity) sooner. The ApoTox-Glo™ Triplex Assay measures multiple biomarkers to study the mechanism of cell death. The assay helps researchers assess a drug candidate’s toxic effects, making it a valuable, predictive and cost-effective tool for drug discovery. Forensics and Paternity Testing The PowerPlex® ESX and PowerPlex® ESI Systems address the needs of the next-generation European STR genotyping systems. DNA analysts create genetic profiles (DNA typing) to identify both victims and suspects during a criminal investigation. These same tools are applied in determining paBasic Research ternity and other familial relationships needed to identify victims of natural disasters.

Promega Corporate responsibility Report 2010 10 Promega in the Real World Bionic Ear The bionic ear is an implant that allows the combination of mechanical and natural. The implant is inserted into the inner ear and allows deaf people to hear by transmitting sound signals to the auditory nerve. Its performance is far from perfect but it allows a person who is deaf to hear speech. Today scientists are working on ways to improve the performance. In deafness, the auditory nerve begins to die over time. One lab in Australia is concentrating on ways to keep the auditory nerve healthy enough long term to work with the mechanical implant. To do that, scientists have created a “mini drug factory” of sorts that is part of the mechanical implant. But the question is how long can the drug factory work? To help them answer that, scientists are using Cell Titer Glo to help test the viability of the cells in the mini drug factory. So far, tests look good. If the strong performance continues, scientists may be close to a more robust bionic ear that can help maintain the health of the auditory nerve, allowing someone to continue to hear the words of others over time. Dr. Mark Zanin working in his lab at The Bionic Ear Institute. Searching for Better Treatment for Breast Cancer At a university cancer research lab, a scientific team studies estrogen – a hormone that can influence both breast health and the growth of breast cancer compounds. Researchers examine how the estrogen receptor is regulated. Specifically they examine behavior of an estrogen receptor cofactor, which contributes to the regulation of estrogen actions. To advance their understanding, they work with a new mass spec, “top-down” protocol which requires a greater volume of sample. Working with Promega HaloTag technology, scientists were able to produce the larger amounts of protein with high purity. Today, scientists are able to take a “snap-shot” of the cofactor in action. With the ability to precisely examine this estrogen regulator, researchers are hopeful they can further the understanding to the development of a better therapeutic tool for breast cancer.

These efforts will be completed in 2011. • In 2010, Promega Biosystems in Sunnyvale, California, started working towards certification from Santa Clara County as a “Green Business” and expects to achieve this certification in early 2011. In energy efficiency alone, the Sunnyvale branch switched to more energy efficient lighting throughout their building, changed vending machines to motion sensor activation, added motion sensors in their lunch room, and installed new thermostats for improved energy control. Beyond energy reduction, in 2010, Promega made significant investments to generate and purchase renewable energy. Using renewable energy eliminates greenhouse gas emissions that otherwise would have been emitted during energy production. • Over 250 photovoltaic panels were installed on the Aviations Operation building in Madison, Wisconsin. This is the largest solar array in Dane County, Wisconsin. These photovoltaic panels are rated to produce 72,700 kilowatt hours annually – equivalent to the usage of at least seven households annually. To see the current production of this system, please visit this live dashboard. • Additionally, Promega will purchase 100% renewable energy for energy not provided by the solar panels at our Aviation Operations building. Some of the renewable energy generated by the solar array will go back to the local grid as part of the Madison Gas and Electric’s Green Power Partners Program.

Promega Helix To reduce further emissions from distribution, Promega offers a state-of-the-art, onsite inventory management system called Helix. Helix consolidates orders into one weekly shipment allowing more products to be sent with less shipping and materials. The system makes storing and shipping inventory easier on the business and the planet. In 2010, Promega purchased carbon credits to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from energy use of all Helix units. In addition, emissions from initial unit shipment and product distribution through this channel are also offset. In 2010, Helix offset over 450 emissions worldwide by supporting renewable energy projects.

Promega Corporate responsibility Report 2010 21 Packaging In 2010, several locations that handle product distribution looked at opportunities to reduce environmental impacts. In June, Promega Pte Ltd. in Singapore was the first location to “Go-Brown” or switch to unbleached shipping boxes in order to avoid the harmful environmental impacts of bleaching corrugate. Bleached corrugate uses more virgin wood, more energy, and produces more waste and air emissions than unbleached corrugate. The Promega Euro Hub in Mannheim, Germany also made a commitment to make this change and expects to be transitioning to unbleached boxes in the first quarter of 2011. In 2010, a team of individuals at our Corporate Headquarters made the same commitment but went beyond just the box bleaching to find additional ways to reduce impacts. In addition to switching to unbleached corrugate, a new coating is being tested for use on boxes that require coating instead of wax. This coating will allow shipping boxes, which were not previously recyclable due to wax coating, to be recycled. These boxes are expected to be transitioned mid 2011. This switch at our Corporate Headquarters alone has the potential to reduce wood usage by 21 tons, energy usage by 144 million BTUs, water by 300,000 gallons, and greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 6 tons each year. Efforts to use more environmentally friendly shipping boxes follow a long history of efforts to reduce the impacts of packaging such as: Packaging Breakdown by Spend • Continuing a program that Promega initiated over twenty years ago to minimize Paperboard Styrofoam® waste in landfills, customers returned and Promega reused over 16,000 2% 5% 8% 8% Corrugated Styrofoam® boxes from product packaging in 2010. 7% Plascs • For many years, Promega AG has been using special blue hard plastic boxes with Styrofoam inserts for shipping products to our customers.

There needs to be a balance between the need to adequately protect products and minimize use of packaging and shipping. An initial cost analysis indicated that plastic encompasses about half of the packaging purchases yet corrugate for shipping, as well as paperboard used in product packaging, represent our best opportunity for reducing environmental impact. Following implementation of a new ERP platform in 2011, there will be richer data allowing for quantification of the amount of materials used, providing the ability to develop a comprehensive packaging impact baseline.

Promega Corporate responsibility Report 2010 30 Report Parameters Our sustainability progress is calculated on a calendar-year basis, with information in this report covering January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009. This is the second Corporate Sustainability Report following our initial report released in July 2009. This process of reporting will continue on an annual basis. Our report focuses on the environmental and social impacts of Promega operations worldwide using the foundations established by the Global Reporting Initiative’s G3 Guidlelines. We have seen an increase in the scope, materiality and comprehensiveness in this report but recognize that we have significant room for growth. By establishing a process for gathering data worldwide we have seen improved accuracy and transparency. Information has been gathered from Promega branches and subsidiaries worldwide with the exception of Promega Sunnyvale (formerly Turner Biosystems) due to its recent acquisition. Additional and more accurate information has been gathered, causing some variations from reported indicators in 2008, and these have been noted where appropriate. Estimations using revenue as a factor for the previous year’s indicators have been made where information was unavailable. Areas that have not been measured in this report due to lack of current information are: • Packaging — We are in process of understanding gross packaging material usage by type and the impacts from these activities. • Staff Commute • Effluents to Water • Supply Chain Analysis Carbon footprint calculations were made using the emission factors provided by the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol on energy and business travel. The reported emissions from distribution were calculated with the conversion factors provided by Defra’s 2008 Greenhouse Gas Conversion Factors. Finally, the Environmental Defense Fund Paper Calculator was used for calculating the life cycle impacts due to paper usage. Current and previous year’s carbon footprints were calculated using the most updated information and current emission factors listed above.
