The consolidated net debt ended the year in R$ 18.711 billion, representing a reduction of R$ 3.178 billion over the previous year, and a ratio Net Debt / EBITDA of 1.8 x. The reduction on the company’s indebtedness is aligned with the strategy of deleveraging in 2010, previously announced by the company to the market. The appreciation of the real against other currencies and good liquidity in the international emissions market enabled the company to manage its liabilities by fundraising at more attractive rates and pre-paying shorter expensive debts. This strategy has allowed that the middle term of the debt could be lengthened as well as reducing the effective cost of 105.6% of DI for the year 2010 against 107% in 2009. At the end of the year, 26.2% of the total debt was contracted in foreign currency. However, due to hedging operations (hedge), only the equivalent of R$ 625 million (U.S. $ 375 million, 2.1% of total) represented, in fact, some exposure to currency fluctuations for the company. Additionally, it is important to mention that the payments flow on these debts until August 2017 is covered by hedge contracts, as well as by financial investments held in dollars and euro.
