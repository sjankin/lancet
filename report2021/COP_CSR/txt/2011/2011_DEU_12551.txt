SERVICE MIT SYSTEM CSR report / 6 Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year In 2010 LAROSÉ was a major contributor to issue Global Compact Principles within the textile association. To support and make progress on the issue of human rights and child labour, especially within the textile industry, it is of tremendous importance to work on a broader base and get support from other companies in the industry. The amount of power determines the amount of change in this regard. However, the textile leasing industry is to a large amount dealing with work wear;meaning very specialised and technical textiles; which need to be available on a short notice for several years. Therefore, most of LAROSÉ`s work wear is produced in Europe under direct supervision of our suppliers. This year LAROSÉ wants to foster the ten principles along its supply chain, starting with ist main suppliers and will continue to integrate Global Compact Principles into our contracts with our suppliers. Another crucial field of development will be a Purchase Code of Conduct. Measurable Results or Outcomes INTEX, as the industry`s association, became a member of the UN Global Compact, after working for several months on Code of Conduct for the industry.

Many stakeholders along the supply chain are already changing processes and engaging with our project. We give as much stewardship as possible to multiply the savings effect for the environment and the company. Logistics Logistic is of great importance in our industry. It determines the level of service and customer satisfaction. Therefore another major project is now starting off with technologically supported logistics improvements.
