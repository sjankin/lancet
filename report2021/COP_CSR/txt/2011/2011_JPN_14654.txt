Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2011 31 Overview of the Year Ended March 31, 2011 Machinery Division In the year ended March 31, 2011, we achieved profitability one year earlier than originally planned with recovery in overall performance. This was primarily due to progress in restructuring our automotive business, which recorded a considerable loss in the previous fiscal year. We worked to reduce inventory and use assets more efficiently in the Russia and NIS automotive business, which was in a slump in the previous fiscal year. At the same time, we established a mechanism to comprehensively gauge and manage risk exposure, as well as a system for managing currency fluctuations and other risks. We successfully expanded earnings by focusing on the fast-growing regions of Asia and Central and South America. In the Venezuela automotive business, we addressed labor problems through labor-management agreements and are returning to stable production. The infrastructure business picked up significantly. We received orders for three large IPP projects in Saudi Arabia and Oman, and concluded an agreement for a large-scale fertilizer plant in the Republic of Tatarstan in Russia. Having steadily accumulated a backlog of orders in the year ended March 31, 2011, we expect stable earnings in the future.

Therefore, in addition to conducting audits in accordance with auditing plans, I attend regular meetings and create other opportunities to exchange information with Company officers, employees, and Group company auditors in Japan and overseas in order to determine whether management is satisfactory. Through this ongoing dialogue, I sense that the quality of governance at Sojitz is improving every year. Only eight years have passed since the merger that created Sojitz, but I believe the level of governance already exceeds that of other companies. Transparency is of prime importance in corporate management. I hope to make Company management clearly visible to shareholders and other stakeholders by enhancing audit functions. This will also help people overseas better understand the general trading company form of business, which is unique to Japan.

The Sojitz Group Code of Conduct and Ethics Establishing a Compliance Mindset Looking at the results of the yearly comprehensive compliance inspections and Sojitz’s many training programs, I see a steady decline in the number of reports pointing out a need for improvement. This tells me that initiatives to establish compliance are paying off. In the year ended March 31, 2011, I visited 22 major subsidiaries to conduct issues awareness interviews and share views about compliance. I confirmed that the level of management at Group companies is steadily improving. However, establishing compliance is an endless process. Simply obeying rules and mechanisms is not enough. Our efforts won’t lead to sustained growth unless every employee is infused with a compliance mindset and working with integrity is constantly promoted. Eliminating noncompliance requires steady, repeated efforts, so we will continue advancing initiatives step by step throughout the Group.

Without consciously knowing it, these initiatives are the main ingredients of what we call CSR. We all have a responsibility to each other and the world around us.

Social Responsibility Lithium-ion batteries using the nonwoven fabric Silicon metal refinement in China separator supplied by Sojitz Initiatives in Biodiversity Sojitz Marine & Engineering Corporation (SOMEC) is a dealer in Japan for ballast water treatment systems for ships manufactured by Ecochlor, Inc. of the United States. Used to stabilize vessels at sea, ballast water is taken on in ports where cargo is unloaded and discharged in ports where new loading occurs. However, this raises a concern that marine creatures (alien species) in the ballast water from one port will invade native species at the next port where the water is discharged, resulting in damage to the ecosystem. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted the International Convention for the Ballast water treatment system Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments in 2004. The convention is expected to go into force in 2012, after which all ships in the world will be required to have a ballast water treatment system after a phase-in period. The system sold by SOMEC is compliant with United States Coast Guard standards, which are stricter than the IMO standard, and with the standards of individual U.S. states. A ship owned by Sojitz scheduled for completion at the end of 2011 will be the first in Japan to be equipped with this system.

The first – which isn’t limited to child care leave – is that relationships of trust with people inside and outside the Company and mutual understanding are built through daily efforts. In addition, it’s important for coworkers to respect each other and each other’s way of life.

Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve may be used to eliminate or reduce a deficit, if any, or be capitalized by resolution at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. All additional paid-in capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends. Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve are included in capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively. (c) The Companies Act of Japan does not have a definition about the classification of paid-in capital between common stock and preferred stock. Accordingly, the Company states its capital in the total amount paid by issuing common stock and preferred stock. The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with Japanese laws and regulations. The Company paid interim cash dividends amounting to ¥1,877 million (U.S.$22,614 thousand) in accordance with the resolution at the Board of Directors Meeting held on October 29, 2010.

In order to carry out these businesses, the Group has set up a target of long-term debt ratio and raises funds, not only through indirect financing from financial institutions, but also through direct financing by securitization as well as issuance of bonds and commercial papers. In this manner, the Group aims at maintaining and improving the stability of its funding structure. Furthermore, the Group is exposed to market risks, including foreign exchange risk associated with transactions denominated in foreign currencies in connection with international trade or business investments; interest rate risk associated with debt financing and portfolio investment; commodity price risk associated with purchase and sales agreements and commodity inventories incidental to sales activities; and market price risk associated with ownership of listed securities and other such assets. To hedge and minimize these risks, the Group utilizes derivatives such as forward exchange contracts, commodity futures, forward commodity contracts, and interest rate swaps.

Investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates without fair market value amounting to ¥192,527 million are not included. 4. Doubtful receivables are included in long-term loans, receivables and other on the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of long-term loans, receivables and other excluding doubtful receivables amounting to ¥25,047 million is not presented above. 5. Derivatives are stated in net of assets and liabilities. The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of instruments. Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term loans receivable (excluding current portion of long-term loans receivable): The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term loans receivable (excluding current portion of long-term loans receivable) approximate their book value due to the relatively short maturities of these instruments. Trade notes and trade accounts receivable and long-term loans (including current portion): The fair values of trade notes and trade accounts receivable and long-term loans (including current portion) are measured at the amount discounted at the assumed corporate discount rate separately set for each classification of assets. Forward exchange contracted amounts which are assigned to associated assets are reflected on those presented in the balance sheet, and therefore, fair values of forward exchange contracts are included in the fair value of the receivables. Short-term investments and investment securities: The fair values of short-term investments and investment securities are measured at quoted market prices. Investment securities without fair market value are not included in above. These are presented in Note 3. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates: The fair values of investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are estimated using quoted market prices. Doubtful receivables: The allowance for doubtful receivables is stated in an amount sufficient to cover probable losses on collection of receivables outstanding based on estimates of individually collectible amounts through collaterals and guarantees. Therefore, the fair value of doubtful receivables approximates the balance of doubtful receivables, net of allowance for doubtful receivables, in the balance sheet as of the fiscal year end. Short-term debt (principally unsecured), commercial paper and income taxes payable: The estimated fair value of short-term debt (principally unsecured), commercial paper and income taxes payable approximate their book value due to the relatively short maturities of these instruments. Payables: The fair values of payables are measured at the amount to be paid at maturity discounted at the assumed corporate discount rate separately set for each classification of liabilities. Forward exchange contracted amounts assigned to associated liabilities are reflected on those presented in the balance sheet, and therefore, fair values of forward exchange contracts are included in the fair value of the payables. 118 Sojitz Corporation Annual Report 2011 Long-term debt (including current portion): The fair values of bonds issued by the Company are based on the market price. The fair values of other long-term debt (including current portion) are estimated by discounted cash flow analysis, using rates currently available for similar types of borrowings with similar terms and remaining maturities. As to long-term debt with variable interest rates, interest rate swaps which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not remeasured at market value and the fair value of such interest rate swaps is included in that of long-term debt. Hence, fair value of such debts is measured at the amount discounted by the rates available for similar types of borrowings with similar terms. Derivative instruments: The fair values of derivative instruments are estimated using the valuation methodology set forth in Note 13. Planned redemption amounts for monetary assets and short-term investment and investment securities with maturity dates at March 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: Millions of yen Due after one year Due after Due in one year through five five years through Due after ten March 31, 2011 or less years ten years years Cash and cash equivalents ................................................................... ¥415,261 ¥ — ¥ — ¥ — Time deposits ....................................................................................... 4,728 — — — Trade notes and trade accounts (*1, 2) .................................................... 472,050 2,238 — — Short-term loans receivable (excluding current portion of long-term loans receivable ) (*1) ............ 1,795 — — — Short-term investments and investment securities Available-for-sale securities with maturity dates ................................. 552 523 466 0 Long-term loans receivable (including current portion) (*1, 2) .................. 5,670 4,928 5,153 2,513 Doubtful receivables (*1, 2)..................................................................... 3,381 892 385 259 Total ................................................................................................. ¥903,437 ¥8,581 ¥6,004 ¥2,772 Thousands of U.S. dollars Due after one year Due after Due in one year through five five years through Due after ten March 31, 2011 or less years ten years years Cash and cash equivalents ................................................................... $ 5,003,145 $ — $ — $ — Time deposits ....................................................................................... 56,964 — — — Trade notes and trade accounts (*1, 2) .................................................... 5,687,349 26,964 — — Short-term loans receivable (excluding current portion of long-term loans receivable ) (*1) ............ 21,626 — — — Short-term investments and investment securities Available-for-sale securities with maturity dates ................................. 6,651 6,301 5,614 0 Long-term loans receivable (including current portion) (*1, 2) .................. 68,313 59,374 62,084 30,277 Doubtful receivables (*1, 2)..................................................................... 40,735 10,747 4,639 3,120 Total ................................................................................................. $10,884,783 $103,386 $72,337 $33,397 *1.

Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components of an entity about which separate financial information is available and such information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Generally, segment information is required to be reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments. This accounting standard and the guidance are applicable to segment information disclosures for the fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2010. The segment information for the year ended March 31, 2010 under the revised accounting standard is also disclosed hereunder as required. 1. Description of reportable segments Reportable segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Board of Directors Meeting in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
