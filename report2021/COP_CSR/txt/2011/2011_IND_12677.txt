Synergize the supplier master with relevant referential data besides keeping the master data. Business Transaction with Local Suppliers At ACC, we encourage local suppliers to be engaged in our business transactions. We define Local suppliers as all suppliers located within the Indian Territory. Total spend on suppliers during 2010 is Rs. 6112 Crores out of which spend on national suppliers (Local) is Rs. 5869 Crores. Share of Spend on Local suppliers to Total is 96%. The total spend on Suppliers excludes an amount of Rs.148 Crores transacted across group and associated Companies. 14 ACC Sustainable Development Report 2010 Web Update 2.4 Eco-efficient Products With the support of our strong R&D Team located at Thane, ACC continues to be a pioneer and trend setter in the manufacture of Eco-Efficient Cements such as Portland Slag Cement (PSC) and Portland Pozzolano Cement (PPC) which are called Blended Cements. These type of Cement consume less natural resources like limestone and utilize industrial waste materials like slag & fly-ash generated from other industries and thus become lower carbon intensity Cements. They replace a proportionate part of clinker which is produced from limestone and hence reduces the intensity of mining thus conserving the national mineral resources. ACC is one of the highest producers of blended cement in the industry. In the year 2010 ACC utilized 3.879 Million Tonnes of Fly ash, 2.286 Million Tonnes of slag, 0.273 Million Tonnes of alternative materials consisting of marble slurry, chemical gypsum, lime sludge, chemical sludge etc. which replaced natural resources like gypsum and limestones. Materials used by weight Raw Material Unit 2010 2009 Limestone Million Tonnes 18.729 19.166 Gypsum Million Tonnes 1.075 1.113 Coal (Kiln) Million Tonnes 2.11 2.24 Raw Material (Recycled waste material) Alternative Raw Materials Million Tonnes 0.273 0.257 Slag Million Tonnes 2.286 2.06 Fly ash Million Tonnes 3.879 4.456 Additives Additives Million Tonnes 1.652 2.096 Associated materials Lubricating Oil Tonnes 921 1102 Grease Tonnes 208 209 Packaging Materials Weight of Bags Consumed Tonnes 29131 29094 Percentage of products sold and their packaging materials that are reclaimed by category. ACC has been promoting usage of cement in bulk, as it eliminates packaging and is more convenient for large buyers. In 2010 ACC handled 1,028,000 tonnes of bulk cement across all its manufacturing units. Further, the company initiated on trial basis in some markets using paper bags for packing cement during the year 2010. 1,217,465 paper bags were used during the year. Currently, more than 85% of the cement in the country is sold in PP bags. ACC is in the process of instituting a pilot study to analyze current & potential practices of empty PP cement bags reuse / safe disposal. 15 ACC Sustainable Development Report 2010 Web Update 2.5 Sustainable Construction ACC continued to demonstrate active concern for sustainability in the construction sector through the use of environment-friendly practices and building materials. Holcim Global Awards for Sustainable Construction The company took the lead in promoting the third cycle of the prestigious Holcim Global Awards for Sustainable Construction in the country which opened for entries on July 1, 2010 and closed at the end of March this year. The competition sought to identify projects demonstrating a balance of environmental, social and economic performance – while exemplifying architectural excellence and easy transferability. Not limited to structures, the contest was widely inclusive and open to concepts related to urban design, infrastructure, landscaping, materials, products and construction technologies. ACC's team of customer services personnel – mainly civil engineers – promoted the competition with gusto among professionals, students and academicians alike. Their effort was instrumental in widening the understanding of the basic concept of Sustainable Construction while helping the company build relationships among the target groups. The company was successful in garnering the largest number of entries from India as compared to the rest of the world. Green Buildings Following its success with the innovatory makeover of Cement House into the country's first old structure to receive LEED Gold certification, ACC added two more green buildings to its fold in 2010. The first called La Residency at Thane, is a 45 year old former residential apartment block now redesigned and converted into a modern hostelry for participants of the ACC Academy, our learning centre. La Residency received Platinum pre-certification under the IGBC Green Homes Rating of the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) in March 2010. Later in the year, the Chandrapur Central Control Room was completed as an essential part of the new Chanda cement project. This is the first green building which is functionally part of a manufacturing establishment. This structure received LEED INDIA New Construction PLATINUM 2011 certification. Promoting Concrete Roads Since 2009, the company has undertaken a campaign through seminars and workshops to advocate the use of concrete roads in terms of its significant sustainable benefits to the economy lower long term costs and lower impact on environment. Four seminars were conducted during the year, one on National Highways in New Delhi and others in state capitals for State Highways and City Roads in Lucknow, Bengaluru and Bhopal. Large numbers of senior government officials from PWD, Municipal Corporations, NHAI, Planning commission, contractors and consultants attended the seminars. These seminars generated considerable interest leading to follow-up interactions and exercises with road building authorities. The seminars have been effective in highlighting the fact that concrete has proved to be a more effective and environment-friendly road building material as compared to bitumen which is the most widely used material for Indian roads. Mass Communication of Environmental Benefits of Blended Cements ACC continued to propagate the advantages of blended cements at different forums. The company remains the country's largest manufacturer of blended cement. As part of a communication plan targeted at decision makers and influencers in commercial and infrastructure sectors the company has produced a short film and supporting literature to promote the usage of Blended cements as a superior environment-friendly alternative to ordinary cements. The film is well received. Research on Sustainable Construction for Indian Habitats In a significant step, ACC signed a memorandum of understanding with IIT Bombay in February 2011 to examine and recommend innovative approaches to sustainable construction, technology and design for affordable habitats. As part of this collaboration, IITB will undertake an actionable research on sustainable habitats that incorporate regional adaptations and promote interdisciplinary approaches to sustainable construction in India.

Some of the initiatives to reduce dust emissions are given below: Stack & Fugitive Emission Control • Chanda and Wadi Expansion Projects were provided with state-of-the-art air pollution control systems (Electrostatic precipitators, Bag houses with membrane technology for Kiln application) for controlling the dust emissions from all sources. • Installation of Fugutive emission control systems (dust extraction and dust suppression systems) at Jamul, Kymore and Gagal Cement works at various material handling/storage locations in the Plants & Mines . • Wagon unloading systems with state-of-the-art Pollution Control systems were commissioned at our new Grinding units at Kudithini and Thondebavi. • Installation of state-of-the-art clinker unloading system into trucks along with the dust extraction system at Gagal Cement works. All these equipment have been successfully commissioned and are maintaining the emissions below statutory limits. 18 ACC Sustainable Development Report 2010 Web Update 3.2 Energy ACC continues its efforts to achieve Energy Efficiency across its plants. The trend of reducing the electrical energy consumption continued across most of the ACC plants. During the year the Cement Industry faced many adverse conditions like shortage of fly ash and slag supply, non remunerative price for the power exported from the Captive Power plants. Due to constraints of export the captive power plants operated at a lower PLF and resulting higher self consumption of electrical energy. ACC expanded the capacities in Chanda and Wadi which necessitated long stoppages of the Kiln and stabilization of operations after commissioning of the plants. This resulted increase in Specific electrical energy at Wadi. Inspite of all the above factors, out of 16 Plants of ACC, 11 plants reduced the Specific Energy consumption as compared to year 2009. Individually, Lakheri achieved 7.24% reduction and Bargarh achieved 6.06% reduction over the baseline of 2009 specific electrical energy consumption. Kymore and Chaibasa plants of ACC won the prestigious national award by Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) of Ministry of Power for Energy Conservation for Cement Sector. Lakheri and New Wadi plants of ACC won the CII National awards on energy efficiency for Cement Sector.

Waste Management The company generated approx. 1129 tonnes of Hazardous waste during the year 2010. The major hazardous wastes generated are Spent Oils & Lubricants, Grease. Hazardous waste is handled and disposed off as per The Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Transboundry Movement) Rules, 2010. The method for disposal of these wastes is either Co processing in cement kilns or it is sold to authorized recyclers. 22 ACC Sustainable Development Report 2010 Web Update 3.5 Alternative Fuels and Raw Materials (AFR) This was the landmark year for AFR Business because of several novel initiatives. Co-processing in cement kilns has been recognized by the regulatory authority and Central Pollution Control Board came out with the “Guidelines on Co-processing in Cement kilns” in February 2010. ACC increased its portfolio of waste streams to 43 nos. ACC has undertaken co processing trials of 23 different waste streams till Dec., 2010. Co-processing trials of liquid wastes as Spent Wash and Acid Tar Sludge were conducted for the first time at Wadi and Jamul respectively. The initiative at Wadi for Spent Wash co-processing was telecasted by Door Darshan (DD) nationwide on 30th December, 2010. Our support has been extended to the various municipal bodies for disposal of waste plastics from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). These waste plastics are co processed in the cement kilns at very high temperature. First time in India it was started at ACC, Kymore, in 2010 it is extended at ACC Gagal (H.P.) and ACC Wadi (Karnataka). AFR Policy was rolled out across all ACC plants for stakeholder awareness generation with the theme of “Because tomorrow matters”, in the first fortnight of August 2010. Key initiatives and achievements: • Guide lines on Co-processing of Waste issued by CPCB in Feb.2010. • AFR Policy Roll out across ACC in Aug., 2010. • Signing of PAN India level contract with 3 major industries for co-processing of waste is generated at their units. • ACC has increased its portfolio of waste streams to 43 nos. in 2010. • ACC has undertaken co processing trials of 23 different waste streams. • ACert* Kick-off at Kymore and Wadi • Liquid streams introduced this year in our portfolio of waste and co processing implemented with an innovative approach at Jamul and Wadi. • Savings increased by 15% from Rs. 40.77 Crores (2009) to Rs. 46.9 crores (2010). • Tonnage contribution of Industrial waste jumped, in 2010, by more than 50% than 2009. *ACert – AFR Certification, designed by HOLCIM. Zero Fuel Cost (ZFC) Project at Madukkarai The vision of achieving zero fuel cost at ACC Madukkarai is progressing at a reasonable pace with introduction of newer waste streams with increased volumes for co-processing. Recycled input materials By way of co-processing of waste material as AFRs, ACC has saved Rs. 47 Crores in 2010 which is 15% higher than what was achieved in 2009. This year, ACC has co-processed 198,773 T of alternative raw materials and 22,092 T of alternative fuel in kilns. The tonnages contribution of industrial wastes from several industrial sectors in 2010 has increased by more than 50% than that of 2009. In addition to this, 60% more alternative resources have been utilized in CPPs and Slag Dryers than previous year. ACC used 2.3 MT of slag and 3.9 MT of fly-ash. At ACC, Coprocessing of waste is a regular and sustainable practice with long term agreement with waste generating companies. These measures mitigate the environmental impacts of products and services. 23 ACC Sustainable Development Report 2010 Web Update 4.

We hire and promote individuals on merit for each position compatible with the job requirement and treat the country as local. All Permanent workmen are governed by the National Wage Settlement and their wage level is higher than the local minimum wage. All contract workers undertaking jobs which are of a temporary nature are paid as per the government notification on wages. We have a well laid down recruitment and selection process. None of our workplace has forced/compulsory labor and we do not have any forced/ compulsory labor. We ensure that none of our operation, processes, and units has an involvement of Child Labor. All our contract/ agreement with the contractors/ third parties clearly mention that all employees associated with ACC should be greater than 18 years of age. In order to ensure that all the employees/ workers entering our premise are adults we have security guards present at all our entry points and they ensure that workforce entering the factory is more than 18 years of age. 26 ACC Sustainable Development Report 2010 Web Update 4.2 Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) At ACC, we always believe that we are accountable for the well being of everyone who works at our facilities, including contractor personnel. We have our OH&S vision of “NO HARM ANYWHERE TO ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH ACC” where “ANYONE” is defined to include “Employees” & “Contractors personnel” at ACC sites. Many significant initiatives are being undertaken to improve safety of employees and contractors and to make our organization a safe place to work. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) workshops were started in 2007 with an objective to develop anticipation capability amongst the line managers to address the rootcause of incidents by observing the hazards present on-site. The HIRA workshop aims directly at the base of the accident pyramid by reducing the number of hazards present on site. These workshops have encouraged line managers in transforming OH&S Culture through Visible Leadership by changing their perception towards managing hazards at work. HIRA workshops are conducted twice a year in each plant. An innovative concept of Safety Observation Tours (SOT) is being practiced at ACC to encourage people with safe behaviors and to identify unsafe acts and unsafe conditions associated with any activity. All management staff conducts SOT and record observations in a standard format. The unsafe acts identified during SOT are corrected on the spot. The barriers to correct unsafe conditions are discussed and communicated to concerned site manager for taking necessary corrective actions. Every management staff in the plant have to conduct SOT at least once a week. Tool Box talks are conducted daily at the beginning of each shift in every department to discuss and communicate the work place hazards and risks involved in a process or operations where the persons are employed. Safety gate meetings are held on first of every month which is attended by all the top officials, employees and contractor workers. During the gate meeting safety skits called “Nukkad” are performed by the employees on specific themes. Safety quiz competitions are also conducted and on the spot prizes are given to the winners. Plant top management also gives rewards to the safe workers of the previous month. Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is being conducted before start of all non-routine jobs at plants. JSA is conducted by dividing the job into a number of smaller activities and then for each activity, hazards are identified and corrective measures taken accordingly. All ACC units have formulated emergency response plans for managing disasters like fire, earthquake, floods, etc. duly approved by the concerned inspectorate of factories. Emergency response groups have been set up and mock drills are conducted periodically to evaluate the response of the system. A system of Safety Alerts is being followed at ACC for communicating serious accidents and injuries within the organization at all levels. The learning from the incidents is circulated amongst all to avoid reoccurrence of similar incident at any sites. Health and Safety Topics Health and safety are part of the standing orders signed by the unions. Topics like issue of personal protective equipment and adherence to the established procedures have been made mandatory. Union also participates in periodic inspections, audits and incident investigations. Safety Committee Each plant has a site safety committee comprising of the management representatives as well as workers representatives. The committee is headed by the plant head and meets every month to discuss the safety issues as well as to draw future course of action. During the meeting the workers directly interact with the plant head on safety issues and their suggestions are taken into consideration for developing action plans. The committee takes a round of a section of plant to understand the safety issues which are then discussed and included in the action plan. 27 ACC Sustainable Development Report 2010 Web Update Contractor Safety Management The Contractor Safety Management (CSM) project called “Suraksha Bandhan” was launched in November 2009. In its first phase during November 2009, M/s DuPont team assessed the current practices of contractor safety management at three of our sites. In the Phase II during 2010, the business processes and procedures for contractor safety management have been set up and training and coaching of 80% ACC contract supervisors have been completed. LTIFR With our consistent efforts in making our workplaces safer, we have been able to maintain the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) below our long term target of 2. However, we are pained to report that we had eight fatalities during 2010. Analysis showed that fatalities mostly involved our contractor workers. Evaluation of these accidents indicates that we do not need fundamentally new systems, but have to raise the awareness and skill levels of the contractor workforce to that of our own employees and bring about a change in the operational behaviour. To drive this change within this high risk group, a special project “Suraksha Bandhan” had been launched in November 2009. This project will help us in addressing the challenge of managing our large contractor workforce, which also has a very high turnover. The project aims to find ways to improve safety with emphasis on behavior modification rather than rules and policing. As we aim at providing safe place to work to everyone who works with us, we continuously strive to improve our safety culture. Safety Champion In order to bring a strong sense of accountability and to give a structured focus to Safety each of the high performing Line Managers / Engineers / Officers are given specific assignment on safety at Sister Works. We call them Safety Champions. This helps build a critical mass of safety conscious line executives. They are experienced employees and are given assignment for 6-8 weeks at sister works. Following assignments are undertaken to improve the general safety standards of the Plant: v Housekeeping > or equal to 4 star rating v Job Safety assessment v Cardinal Rules v Completion of points identified under ; o HIRA (Hazard identification and Risk Analysis) o SOT (Safety Observation Tool) o Fatality Prevention element o Near Miss Accidents High performing employees are identified and given training before inducting as safety champions to the sister works. After completion of the assignment, de-briefing meeting is organized at the visited plants. Safety Champions submit a report about the various initiatives/ actions taken by them. These reports are reviewed and evaluated. Such kind of initiative brings in discipline & commitment for improving safety standards in Work place. Successful completion of such a dedicated safety project brings a positive impact on the career progression of the individual. 28 ACC Sustainable Development Report 2010 Web Update 4.3 Community Engagement ACC Plants meet requisite due diligence and compliance requirements of Government of India's clearance procedure. This includes detailed Environmental Impact Assessment and Social Impact Assessment of the project. ACC's focuses the interventions for : 1. Providing Education for Society's Future 2. Supporting Sustainable Community Development 3. Building Infrastructure for Livable Communities 4. Community health ACC delivered the programs through partnerships with 16 NGOs, local banks and government departments. The synergy of Community engagement is maintained through the Community Advisory Panels (CAP) meetings. Community Advisory panels (CAP) formed at each plant site, is to ensure community involvement and ownership of the project and maintain transparency. In some locations, village development committees have been formed for the planning, execution and monitoring of projects of their respective villages in addition to CAP. In the CAP forum different segments of local community, NGOs, Government and others discuss, plan and implement development projects. The impacts and effectiveness of the programmes are measured through the Social impact Tracking Auditing and Reporting (STAR) . STAR facilitates monthly tracking of the progress of initiatives. Annual social audits i.e. Social Engagement Score Card (SES) wherein the local stakeholders inclusive of the beneficiaries share their feedback. Written feedback from the stakeholders is also solicited during SES. In 2010, SES were conducted at all units during 2010. ACC's CSR initiatives, in nearly 100 villages, support the access to health and education to a population of nearly 250,000. Education for Society's Future School Education Most of the schools are run in collaboration with DAV or with the best institution available locally, serving community and employee's children. ACC schools and colleges maintain high standards of education and are often the best in the district. Nearly 10,000 students receive education each academic year through these schools Support to local Government schools: ACC also supports nearly 65 Government schools, in some of the most backward districts, across India. This intervention aims at ensuring all children enrolling themselves in schools and reducing dropout in the schools. To improve the quality of education, a pilot has been initiated of teaching aid tool created by Hole in the Wall, in ACCLakheri site schools.

ACC Training Institutes: ACC Sumant Moolgaokar Technical Institute (SMTI) at Kymore, reopened in 2008, trains young men in specialized trades to become artisans, foreman and first line supervisors who can meet the current market needs. In 2010, ACC Cement Technology Institute (ACTI), Jamul, a batch of 50 Cement plant Technicians successfully completed the course. ACC Support to adopted ITI's The company also signed a Memorandum of Agreement under the Ministry of Labor and Employment, Government of India Public Private Partnership Scheme, on up-gradation of Industrial Training Institutes (ITI). In 2010, 7 Government ITI has been adopted and upgraded. Upgradation includes both infrastructure development, inclusion of new courses, training of teaches, management of institute etc. Sustainable Community Development ACC's sustainable community initiatives focus on multiple aspects covering governance, livelihoods, and water-environmental initiatives. Governance The capacity building of Panchayat Raj Institution representatives i.e. sarpanch and members was done either through trainings at Bargarh and Chaibasa plant, and through programme initiatives through CAP in other locations. Women empowerment ACC with the support of local NGO Partners reactivated and formed 289 Self Help Groups (SHG) of women, thereby benefitting nearly 2898 women. From 289 SHGs nearly 138 have opened Saving Bank accounts with the local banks; of these 60 SHGs have been graded by the banks. This procedure linked these women group to a financial institution which will in return help them avail funds for enterprise development and other related government schemes. ACC AHEAD (Association for Health, Education And Development), is the volunteering wing of the Ladies Clubs at our plants and corporate level. Launched in January 2008 it continued to actively support the company's social volunteering and community development programmes with special emphasis on women empowerment. The ACC AHEAD organized various programmes & activities for community in 2010. Some of the programmes are as below: Vocational Trainings in-Tailoring, Food Processing, Bakery, Cooking Health activities such as General Health Camp, Sun Stroke Health Camp, Immunization Support Programme, Pediatric Health Camp, Anemia Health Camp for women, Deworming camp for school children, eye check camp.

ACC AHEAD, along with MMC has taken various initiatives such as female literacy sessions for construction workers in Thane, health camp for children, visit to Nehru Science Centre for children, plantation drive and mentoring the children to get admission in Municipal Schools. ACC AHEAD organized collection drive of unused household material, stationery, utensils, news papers and footwear from employees's homes for donating to needy community through GOONJ, an NGO supporting villages. Livelihood ACC provided livelihood support pertaining to four major categories: Mason training, Agriculture Development initiatives, Service Sector training, and waterenvironmental initiatives. ACC has chosen Mason Training as Nation Building theme. ACC trained 600 masons on-site through tri sector partnership between Government's SGSRY program, NGO and ACC. ACC is applying its evolving understanding to scale up mason training program through a variety of off-site training delivery mechanisms. Masons Training Program for Livelihoods and Affordable Housing ACC launched Mason Training Initiative with NGO Drishtee and linked it with Govt of India's Self Employment Program (Swarnajayanti Gram Rojgar Yojna (SGSY) -2010) Mason Training initiative is ACC's one of Nation Building Themes–Signature Project. This program builds trisector partnership between Corporate-Government and NGO Sector. The partnership targets at creating competent workforce for construction industry. The quality training to the masons is likely to lead to efficient construction practices, through more optimal use of materials by minimizing wastages. It will enable beneficiaries for enhanced livelihood and complements affordable housing. ACC runs mason training programs by contributing 25% of the cost of training and training delivery mechanism. ACC has partnered with NGO-Drishtee for grass-root level delivery of training, inducing enrollment, and tracking a database of the skilled masons. Govt of India supports this initiative through 75% program cost. ACC played a role in linking with the Govt and leveraging government support. 600 candidates have now been trained through this initiative. ACC targets to achieve 5000 trained masons by 2013. ACC has developed Good Construction Practices Handbooks in four languages for assisting the mason for more efficient construction.Some key learning in the initial phases of training programs include: a) In Indian society, masonry work is considered a lower order menial work and does not enjoy a 'social status', b) only the persons associated with construction site or those where masonry is a traditional family profession chooses to engage in masonry work, c) the trainees cannot afford to take up full time, off-site training owing to loss of wages (however small) which they would otherwise earn. ACC therefore, adopted onsite training model. ACC provided support for agricultural development, by linking the farmers to agriculture experts, banks and government schemes to facilitate better farming practices and through motivation to sustain farming activities. About 2800 farmers were impacted through various programs. In the service sector, about 1500 people were trained in employability skills. Farm & Non farm initiatives Kisan Credit Card – a financial instrument developed by Reserve Bank of India Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme aims at providing adequate and timely credit support from the banking system to the farmers for their cultivation needs including purchase of inputs in a 31 ACC Sustainable Development Report 2010 Web Update flexible, hassle free and cost effective manner. KCC is an instrument, which allows farmers to purchase agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and also withdraw some cash for meeting their production related requirements. 106 farmers from ACC's CSR intervention villages received provisional sanction for loans.
