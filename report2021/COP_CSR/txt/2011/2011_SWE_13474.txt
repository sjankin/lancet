Social Responsibility 2011 Maxibit Worldwide AB 1 Maxibit Worldwide AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se A responsible and profitable business is based on ethical considerations as well as financial. Christian Ahlberg CEO, Maxibit 2 Maxibit Worldwide AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se True to the original core values An interesting fact about Maxibit is that the original concept has never changed. In the 70s Erik Ahlberg started the company with the idea to provide a set of quality marketing tools to the leading premium brand companies. He created a lightweight, portable, and reusable solution that was more environmentally friendly than the booths built by craftsmen. By pioneering the portable marketing industry with great innovations Maxibit created a new world standard – a standard that today is taken for granted. Maxibit Core Values  Optimize the customer experience  Swedish designed portable premium brand stands  User centric innovations  Environmental sustainability 3 Maxibit Worldwide AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se Table of content A summary of 2011...........................................................................................5 Maxibit 2010.............................................................................................................. 5 Project 1 – Collecting product specifications.....................................................5 Project 2 – Recycling .........................................................................................5 Office recycling............................................................................................................ 6 Limit paper waste........................................................................................................ 6 Toner cartridges........................................................................................................... 6 Project 3 – Energy efficiency.............................................................................6 Education, Seminars, CSR Reference Group, Conscious Consumption.............7 The importance of environmental education...................................................................7 Maxibit Sustainability Policy Education........................................................................7 Social Responsibility Day..............................................................................................7 Reference group for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)............................................7 Maxibit 1 % Back Programme............................................................................7 Contributions 2009......................................................................................................7 Maxibit – a member of UN Global Compact ......................................................8 Maxibit and the UN Global Compact 10 Principles 2009...............................................8 Code of Conduct................................................................................................9 The Code of Conduct includes requirements concerning.................................................10 Workers.................................................................................................................... 10 Environmental requirements for suppliers....................................................................12 4 Maxibit Worldwide AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se A summary of 2010 Financial markets around the world continued to struggle. In particular the USA and EU, who are now working hard to prevent a deepening recession. Rescue packages were issued for Ireland and Greece but the crisis didsn't seem to be so easy to stop. As icing on the cake, the Icelandic government and banking system collapse was topped off with the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, which damaged the already crippled situation in the USA and EU even further. Other major events during 2010 included the Haiti Earthquake, the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Mexican Gulf, the Neanderthal genome was revealed, Wikileaks published over 100 000 American diplomatic documents marked as “confidential” and WHO declared H1N1 to be a pandemic. People in developing countries continue to suffer from poverty and starvation and are hit hard by flooding, typhoons and earthquakes. Greenhouse gas emissions keep rising and the melting of the ice shelves have only accelerated. Maxibit 2010 A major project for Maxibit has been to finalise the movement of production to fulfil the demands and goals connected with the 10 principles of UNGC. More and more parts of our products are made, either completely or partly, by recycled material. All parts are made to be recycled. UNGC-related demands on the supply chain has naturally increased as an effect hereof. The 10 UNGC participles continues to take a more central role in R&D and stake holder communication. The CEO has promoted these issues especially threw his blog, threw his participation in the Swedish Government's group for CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) and also threw his work as a Board Member of “Medveten Konsumtion” (“Conscious Consumption”). Project 1 – Collecting product specifications In a joint effort with our suppliers, Maxibit started a project to collect material specifications for all Maxibit products. The list of products now include all major products, components and parts. The work continues. By collecting product specifications, Maxibit will be able to look at, in details, each product and thus be able to see if there are parts that need to be changed in order to make a more environmentally sound product. One of Maxibit’s goals is to be able to offer customers a carbon footprint of each product. This work continues and during 2010 “Sustainable Analytics” was implemented into the standard CAD & R&D process. Project 2 – Recycling It is very important that we, in the business community, take responsibility to reduce the amount of waste we produce. Waste has an extremely negative effect on our planet. Through recycling we can reduce pollution caused by waste, we can reduce the need for new raw materials and help preserve natural resources. Maxibit works with one of the largest recycling facilities in Sweden, to minimize waste and maximize recycling in both the office and the warehouse. This work continues. Maxibit's staff are being continuously updated on new technological advances in the recycle industry. This cooperation is ongoing. 5 Maxibit Worldwide AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se Improved office recycling Recycling of all office material is mandatory and continuously improved. In the lunch room recycle bins are used, waste generating food is advised against, energy efficient washing is mandatory, soda machines are replaced by tap water. Sales car fleet In the keeping with Maxibit's environmental commitment, Maxibit keeps a fleet of ethanolpowered cars to help reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide. As a fuel source, the pro's and con's of ethanol has been discussed quite a lot in media due to the manufacturing process and the effect it has on people in areas where ethanol is produced. Maxibit is aware of this discussion but believes that ethanol is a better choice than fossil fuels at this time. There are a lot of consumers that are pushing for sustainable ethanol and Maxibit hopes to see verified sustainable ethanol in the very near future. The CEO, Christian Ahlberg's invitation to the european car manufactorers, to let Maxibit become an early adopter of the first hydrogyn-cars introduced or tested in Europe, has unfortunately been turned down by the car industry. But who needs a car anyway? Maxibit promotes all staff to bikes or walk when possible. In fact, the CEO walks the talk and bikes 20 km every day in sun, rain, hail or snow. Limit paper waste Already in 2008 Maxibit stopped the printing of brochures, price lists and product sheets. With printing orders of 20 000 A4 brochures, 8 000 A5 price lists biannually, and around 1 000 product sheets annually, we calculate a saving of roughly 3 500 kilos of paper every two years. This policy is still adopted. All Maxibit brochures and product sheets are available to download as PDF’s on the Maxibit website, and the price lists, also PDF’s, are sent digitally per request to customers. Instead of printing inspirational images for customer meetings, Maxibit show these images via phones connected to the Internet or on laptops brought to the meeting. During 2010, Maxibit encouraged all suppliers to stop sending paper invoices to Maxibit and promoted them to send digital invoices instead. At the same time, the use of digital invoices to customers (as oppose to paper) also became policy. Toner cartridges Maxibit continues to recycle used toner cartridges. Project 3 – Energy efficiency Light fixture, computers and computer monitors are shut down as soon as the office hours are finished to save energy. In the office we use fluorescent ceiling lights that are more energy efficient than traditional light bulbs. A shift towards even more efficient light sources are continuously explored. For instance the shift to LED came closer during 2009, and during 2010 Maxibit participated in development and testing of a new branch of standard floodlights. 6 Maxibit Worldwide AB. www.maxibit.com, info@maxibit.se Education, Seminars, CSR Reference Group The importance of environmental education It is widely agreed that education is the most effective way to get people to understand how we interact with and are dependent on natural ecosystems. To save the ecosystems for the next generation we have to learn how we should work and live to protect them. Most of us want to do the right thing but do not always have the know-how. Through education, workshops and seminars Maxibit are striving to give its employees a greater understanding of how each and every one of us can make a difference. Maxibit Sustainability Policy Education In the beginning of 2009 the annual seminar ‘Maxibit Sustainability Policy’ was held for the employees of Maxibit HQ. Every aspect of the policy was discussed and explained to the further understanding as to why Maxibit has chosen to work with these issues. The employees got an opportunity to add their comments and a unanimous decision was made to give World Wildlife Found and The Childrens Villages a contribution in 2009. Reference group for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) The participation in the Swedish Governments Group for CSR in ongoing. On one of the meetings during 2010 the Maxibit CEO, Christian Ahlberg was asked to give a report from the 2010 UN Global Compact Leaders Summit in New York. Outside the CSR-forum, Mr Ahlberg blogged about the UNGC Summit and present at the Summit he was very active proposing several acts to encourage a faster move toward “the tipping point” specifically promoting the importance of SME in the UNGC community. Maxibit 1 % Back Programme As of October 2007, Maxibit started the Maxibit 1 % Percent Back Programme.

Maxibit was also a sponsor of the sustainable focused event “Innovations Days”. At this event Maxibit specifically promoted the UN Global Compact initiative. Maxibit – a member of UN Global Compact “The UN Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.” [Source: http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/index.html, 20090112] Maxibit got its membership, as the first company in the portable marketing industry, approved by the UN Global Compact (GC) in 2007. Believing in the value of the GC’s 10 principles, Maxibit has made an effort to promote the UN Global Compact to the business community in a variety of ways. On the Maxibit website there is information about the UN Global Compact and an abbreviated version of its 10 Principles, http://www.maxibit.com/about/csr/. Maxibit also made a decision to print the UN Global Compact web address on all Maxibit product sheets and brochures that are sent to customers in the premium market segment. Maxibit has also produced a short film about the importance of ethical business and the environment and the values of the UN Global Compact program – “The Greener Choice”. This film is available at http://www.youtube.com/maxibitab. In addition to this, the CEO of Maxibit Worldwide, Christian Ahlberg, has continued his blog as a continuous source of updates regarding Maxibit’s progress.
