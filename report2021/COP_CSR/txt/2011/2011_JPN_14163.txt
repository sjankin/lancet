Comment T Targeting a Doubling of Sales I Want to Grow Sales of Fuji Electric Products I am mainly in charge of sales through sales distributors geared toward expanding the sales of Fuji Electric products in the Chinese market. In contrast with Japan, there are some cases in China in which the sales distributor itself conducts the business, and each sales distributor is characterized by having strengths in particular markets. Therefore, I try to understand the issues faced by each distributor and each major customer, to see what products they require and to get a detailed understanding of their needs. In addition, I try to offer solutions to their needs by using Fuji Electric products. As a result of these efforts, I have been able to broadly expand the number Gong Xiaozhou of sales distributors and end users in just a single year, increasing sales. Commercial Sales Department My next target is to double sales of Fuji Electric products in the Chinese market.

Capacity: 500kVA Voltage: 415+/-10% R&D Manager We Seek the Right Balance of Size and Cost Regarding Power CSR Report Opinion Conversion Efficiency We emphasize efficiency more than any other factor so as to activate the special characteristics of the new IGBT, which enables high power conversion efficiency. Nonetheless, even if we achieve high efficiency it will not be of value if the unit is too large. Therefore, we are uncompromising in our development efforts as we seek to achieve the right balance of efficiency, size, and cost. We conduct repeated detailed trials during development to keep loss low, for example when we fine-tune the internal composition of the IGBT module. As a result of newly developing the entire Management Structure system, we have achieved the world’s highest level of power conversion efficiency at 97%, while also realizing compact size.

I am currently getting ready for my posting there, and am studying the Indian market and business strategies. The Work I Want To Do Survey puts wind in the sails of people with ambition. Normally it is not easy to say that one wants to try another job. I myself have been employed at a workplace with a good atmosphere in which my superiors and colleagues have been very helpful, so I can’t say I didn’t feel at all reticent. My future goal is to fulfill the role of an Asia business professional. I feel that by finding energy conservation demand in the growing Indian market and obtaining results I will be able to repay a debt of gratitude to Fuji Electric for providing this opportunity, and I will do my best to make that happen.

Therefore, we have been looking into ways to reduce the power used to drive air conditioners (especially that used in air conveyance), which makes up about half of the power used at Internet data centers. To that end we proposed a new air conditioning system by which a separate spot cooling unit (in-room unit) is placed within the server room. In this system, the spot cooling unit is designed to hang from the server rack, which is unused server room space. The unit provides an energy-conserving way to eliminate local heat accumulation.

This data covers the production bases and offices of all domestic consolidated subsidiaries. Opinion of an Energy Conservation Coordinator Working to Uncover “Hidden” Energy Conservation Items The Matsumoto factory is engaged in semiconductor production, and as such we consume a lot of energy. Therefore, we have been engaged in serious energy conservation activities since FY2007. In addition to improving the efficiency of the power supply we derive from cogeneration, we have also been able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water usage broadly by uncovering energy demand side issues, such as those involving our clean room air conditioning. We would like to provide this kind of know-how to other Japanese and overseas bases as well so that bases worldwide can develop their programs at a level parallel to ours and proceed with measures to reduce energy and resource use as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Facility investment has become tight due to the changes in the economic environment since the Lehman Mamoru Oyama shock, so continuous investment even in energy conservation measures, which provide good ROI, has been Environment and Facility Department Manager, Matsumoto Factory difficult.
