Smart Social Responsibility www.rayessgroup.com www.haraier.com ! To our stakeholders: June, 2006 was a perfect date for Rayess Kingdom Group companies to mutually join the Global Compact and to share the world leading organizations’ and corporations’ vision towards the Ten Principles and towards the real need for high standards of Corporate Social Responsibility. Our participation at the Global Compact Leaders Summit on July (2007) was our biggest delight as we could see, feel, and touch the global interest reflected in the Global Compact that would eventually result in a better future for mankind. Being the first Syrian participant in the Global Compact we take it on our shoulder to spread the word locally and to support the UNDP in developing her local network in Syria. We understand our responsibility towards our community and we are working towards spreading the word through various publications to increase corporations’ and individuals’ awareness and to help them understand their key role too. Rayess Kingdom Group, a Group for Life, heavily believe in its main competitive advantage and core of success “Humans.” We do our best to sustainably develop our strategy and performance to meet the ongoing development and changes in the world markets to ensure the best possible atmosphere in relation to the ten principles: Human Rights, Labor Rights, Environment and Anti Corruption. A copy of this report will be available on our website as soon as possible to help spreading the word and to help our employees, partners and customers to better understand the role we are playing for a better future so they can set theirs too.

To pay Mother-Nature Back, we launched two programs: Packaging: We pay more to develop and improve our product packaging so we can decrease environmental damages even if we pay more. When we started in 2009, we had 0% nylon and plastic bags, now 80% of our bags are recyclable and more environment friendly. We succeeded to attract our customers to use our bags consequently for their other daily purposes. Waste-Management: haraier production experts are known for their daily efforts to make efficient uses of wasted material from our production line, saving many kilo-grams of waste monthly and increasing efficiency and profit. !S We give equal attention to Human Rights and Labor Standards as any break to any would eventually break the whole. We strongly believe and follow the 10 Global Compact principles and we do our utmost to reflect this in our daily performance and to say out the word in any opportunity. We do not in any way support or work in any environment where humans’ rights are abused or misused. We support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Our ethical policies are built against child labor; our community would grow on the shoulders of the coming leaders who are “the children.” We cannot expect better future unless we give better educational chances for the children of Syria and eventually the children of the world. #T We do not discriminate against any human, regardless of race, sex, color or religion and therefore we do our utmost to protect the equal employment opportunity that we offer at our offices. Our HR department has been doing good job in increasing job flexibility rescheduling all of our employees’ working-time and hours so it better meets their social and family needs, reduce work pressure, and still give the needed performance to boom our company’s position in the local and international markets. Committed to being an equal opportunities organization. Rayess Group does not accept to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Our partners, agents, and customers will be expected to abide by the policy locally and internationally. We strongly believe that Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. #! Encouraging employees to take decisions, to know, to share knowledge and to do the first move is always a key role in any organization success.
