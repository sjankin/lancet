In 2011, we renewed our management philosophy, the vision and core values of the company in order to establish a new foundation on which to base our sustainable growth into the future. I firmly believe that the new management philosophy and vision will guide us to stronger sustainable management. As an automobile manufacturer, HMC is pursuing the development of a wide range of green vehicles from hybrid electric vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles in order to realize safer and greener mobility solutions. We have already successfully launched the Avante LPi Hybrid in the Korean market and launched our second hybrid model, the Sonata Hybrid in both the Korean and North American markets. HMC is also actively pursuing EV technology. In 2010, we completed development of the BlueOn EV, which is operated in a demonstration program in Korea. Our fuel cell electric vehicles are also being tested in demonstration programs in both Korean and overseas locations strengthening the foundation for commercialization in the future. In today’s society, a company can only grow sustainably with mutual support from its stakeholders. Likewise, the fruits of sustainable management can only be gathered when companies are trusted by its stakeholders. All members of HMC recognize the importance of stakeholders and, therefore, will continue to strengthen our activities for promoting stakeholder value. We will strive to provide vehicles and services of the highest quality to our customers. Moreover, we will create new value beyond customer expectations and deliver that value to the customers. We will also strive to be a more responsible business partner and go beyond our past goal of promoting mutual cooperation to realize shared growth in conjunction with our suppliers. Our efforts in core CSR areas will also increase to ensure implementation of programs in traffic safety, environmental protection, social welfare improvement, education support and more in all local communities in which we operate. Overall, our goal is to become a beloved member of the local community. HMC will continue its growth by creating new sustainable value from our business activities and sharing them with our stakeholders. It’s a pledge from all members of the HMC including myself. Lastly, I would like to ask for your continued support and interest as both are essential for guiding HMC to a sustainable future. July, 2011 Mong-koo Chung Chairman and CEO 06 Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report We have been communicating our achievements in sustainability management by publishing an annual Sustainability Report since 2003.

The 2010 sales was the highest ever at 36,769 billion KRW. Operating and net profits for 2010 were also record-breaking at 3,227 billion KRW and 5,267 billion KRW, respectively. A total of 1,881,805 vehicles were produced in overseas manufacturing plants, which was an increase of 25.9% from 2009. Exploring sustainable mobility solutions from hybrid electric vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles HMC launched the Sonata Hybrid both in North America and Korea in early 2011. It is the second hybrid-electric vehicle by HMC after the launch of the Avante LPi Hybrid in 2009. In 2010, HMC also introduced ‘BlueOn’ the first highway-capable electric vehicle developed in Korea, which is currently being tested in a demonstration program in Korea. The Tucson ix FCEV, a third-generation fuel cell electric vehicle with significantly improved fuel efficiency and performance was also completed in 2010. The Tucson ix FCEV is operated in a demonstration program in both Korea and overseas locations as a stepping stone to early commercialization of the technology. Shared growth beyond mutually-beneficial cooperation HMC has identified ‘global competitiveness building’, ‘strengthening of a sustained growth foundation’, and ‘the establishment of a shared growth system’ as three core strategies for realizing shared growth with suppliers and launched programs for technical assistance for quality improvement, as well as overseas business expansion support. Various programs were also launched to foster corporate culture that embrace the concept of shared growth. 09 sustainability management The corporate philosophy of HMC was redefined in 2011. The new corporate philosophy embraces the core spirit that guided its past forty years of successful growth and set a foundation for new growth. HMC will continue to embrace its core values and strive toward its goals in order to become a company that contributes to the sustainability of mankind and creates a brighter future where our dreams are realized. Management Philosophy “Realize the dream of mankind by creating a new future through ingenious thinking and continuously challenging new frontiers.” A company's management philosophy is the answer to why it exists and is a tenet that should be deeply embedded in both the minds and actions of employees. Using Hyundai’s traditional values and spirit as a basis, the essence of our management philosophy is summarized in three key ideas: ‘unlimited sense of responsibility’, ‘realization of possibilities’, and ‘respect for mankind’. The three keywords were used as the basis for the new management philosophy, ‘realize the dream of mankind by creating a new future through ingenious thinking and continuously challenging new frontiers’. The ‘unlimited sense of responsibility’ signifies pursuit of sustainable growth through an unyielding sense of responsibility for our stakeholders. The ‘realization of possibilities’ signifies our pioneer spirit that has driven HMC to new business frontiers. The ‘respect for mankind’ represents our will to contribute to improvement to the living conditions of humanity. Using the new management philosophy as guideline, HMC will continue its growth as a respected company that is making a positive contribution to humanity. Core concepts embedded in management philosophy •Pursue sustained growth in order to provide for not just HMC employees and their family Unlimited sense of members but those of our suppliers responsibility •Pursue best quality in products to ensure safety and satisfaction of customers that lasts a lifetime •Foster DNA that strives for never-ending growth and advancement Realization of •Nurture an entrepreneurial spirit which enables us to break out of our comfort zone and possibilities takes risks in light of greater success •Create authentic values by turning small possibilities into real achievements •Contribute to improving general conditions of living by providing products and services of Respect for the highest quality for the greatest number of people mankind •Proactively tackle environmental issues and make contributions to local communities worldwide 10 Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report Core ideas embedded Vision in the vision Lifetime partner in automobiles and beyond Partner through life “To become a trusted lifetime partner of our customers, we will bring a We will provide brands, products and new perspective to automobiles through innovative mobility solutions services that are tailored to the needs based on human-centric, eco-friendly technologies and services.” of customers from childhood to postretirement life.

Recognizing importance of CSR management, HMC created a CSR committee to strengthen implementation of its CSR activities. CSR Management With shared understanding of the need for strengthened CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) management, we established a CSR Committee in 2008 for more effective promotion of CSR activities. The CSR committee is responsible for activities in three core areas including environmental management, trust-based management and social contribution. With guidance of CSR committee, HMC joined the UN Global Compact and declared its commitment to fulfill its social responsibilities its business practices. The UN Global Compact is a voluntary initiative launched by the UN that seeks to align business operations and strategies everywhere using ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. We renewed our CSR charter in collaboration with the UN Global Compact in April 2009. A Hyundai Motor Group-wide CSR taskforce was established for establishment of long-term CSR strategy for a period extending to 2020. Environmental Management HMC publicly declared its environmental management philosophy and its global environmental management policy in 2003, and has since continued to strengthen its environmental management. Rather than focusing on regulation compliance, we are focusing our efforts on more proactive environmental management such as creating new market opportunities by improving energy efficiency and reducing costs of operation. With such a goal in mind, we have established and implemented a comprehensive environmental strategy throughout the entire lifecycle of our products, in addition to across the entire value chain of the automotive industry. Reducing environmental impact during the automobile use stage is a top priority goal. HMC has established ‘Blue Drive’, a strategy that focuses on fuel efficiency • Environmental Management Philosophy : For the harmony of humankind, the environment and society, HMC respects human value and fulfills corporate social responsibility through environmental preservation. • Global Environmental Management Policy : As a responsible corporate citizen that aims to create a prosperous and sustainable society while respecting human values, we established the following global environmental management policies to help preserve the environment. 1. Recognize the environment as a core element of business success and create corporate values through proactively pursuing environmental management. 2. Uphold our social responsibilities by developing and supplying environmentally friendly vehicles. 3. Dedicate to reducing pollutants and to preserving resources and energy for sustainable use at all stages of our products’ lifecycle, from development to production, sales, use and disposal. 4. Endeavor to provide all employees with environmental training programs and support suppliers in their environmental management activities and contribute to public welfare. 5. Comply with all domestic and international environmental regulations and relevant agreements. Strive to improve environmental management and communicate the results to internal and external stakeholders. 12 Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report improvement of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines as a near-term solution, and seeks to supply zero emission vehicles in the future. Aiming to strengthen its capacity to respond to global environmental issues and regulations, HMC identified climate change, recycling, air quality and hazardous materials as core issues and established an environmental management structure accordingly. Currently, climate change has been identified as the top priority issue among the four, and therefore, we are concentrating our effort on reducing CO2 emissions of both automobiles and our operation sites. Trust-based Management Companies can grow only through the support of various stakeholders. HMC has been pursuing shared growth by establishing trust-based relationships with stakeholders including customers, employees, investors, suppliers, and local communities. Mutual respect, as well as transparent and ethical business operations are the key principles in earning trust of stakeholders. HMC is communicating the value of trust-based management to stakeholders including employees, suppliers and local communities while making continuous effort to further improve transparency and ethical standards in our business conduct. • Sustainable mobility HYUNDAI cUstomer • Great product quality • Improved vehicle safety • Increased customer satisfaction • Increased employee satisfaction employee • Human resource development • Respect for human rights • Increased health and safety • Mutually beneficial cooperation Supplier • Fair trade • Long-term relationship • Increased corporate value shareholder • Protection of shareholders’ rights /investor • Stable growth • Transparent business management • Contribution to the local economy community • Job creation TRUST • Social contribution activities Social Contribution As a responsible corporate citizen, HMC is devoting significant resource to fulfill its social contribution. Our social contribution activity slogan of ‘Moving the World Together’ is a statement of our commitment to create a better society for all members of the global community in collaboration with our stakeholders. ‘Moving the World Together’ social contribution projects are our flagship social welfare programs tailored for people in need. We are also conducting various social contribution activities that fall into categories including ‘Easy Move’, ‘Safe Move’, ‘Green Move’ and ‘Happy Move’ depending on the nature of the project. We are also conducting social contribution activities in areas including social welfare, education and academics, art and culture, and also sports. In 2003, we established a long term social contribution activity roadmap to ensure that our activities are carried out in an efficient and structured manner that lead to tangible changes. Our sustained effort in social contribution has led to the establishment of a global social contribution promotion structure with effective programs and a large number of volunteer corps. We will continue to improve our implementation structure to fulfill our rightful role as a respected corporate citizen of the global community. 13 sustainability management We are promoting ethical management practices as an important means of enhancing stakeholder value. HMC’s improved ethical management practices will allow HMC employees to make more responsible management decisions and to take the appropriate actions that will contribute in building trust with stakeholders and enhancing the transparency in its business conduct. In 2001, HMC established the HMC Ethics Charter, the Employee Code of Conduct, and the Guidelines for Ethical Business Conduct to promote ethical business practices. In 2008, we joined the UN Global Compact which provides principles for all our employees to comply with all relevant laws, regulations and also to respect accepted social norms in our business conduct. HMC is also conducting trainings on fair trade and anti-corruption to foster a corporate culture where employees can make ethically correct decisions when faced with difficult situations that may lead to ethical dilemmas. In order to improve transparency in the management decision making process, the company also established an Ethics Committee in 2007, which is composed of external directors. We adopted International Financial Reporting Standards in 2011 in order to increase transparency in accounting practices. We have been making a considerable effort in supplier-relations. In 2002, we adopted a voluntary fair trade compliance program. HMC also signed a formal fair trade agreement with a record number of suppliers in 2010, as a part of our on-going effort to become a fair and transparent business partner. Compliance Policy Complying with all laws and regulations, as well as respecting internationally accepted norms in business conduct in all its business practices is a key business principle within HMC. With that principle as a basis, HMC also strives to promote the voluntary compliance of all regulations, and has created a fair trade compliance program for the prevention of unfair business conduct. We are also providing training on ethical business conduct for employees to promote good business practices and have established a Cyber Audit Office to monitor compliance status. Fair Trade Agreement with Suppliers We made continued to efforts to uphold the fair trade agreement made between HMC and our suppliers since we signed our first fair trade agreement with them in 2008. In 2009, we created the Mutually Beneficial Cooperation Fund for supporting first and second-tier suppliers and executed loans of 130 billion KRW to our suppliers. The Fair Trade Commission awarded HMC with the ‘Best’ rating, which is the highest rating a company can receive, in ‘Implementation of Fair Trade Agreements with Suppliers’ category in recognition of our good work in fair trade compliance. In 2010, HMC signed fair trade contract with over 2,700 suppliers. The contract sets out three key fair trade guidelines including full compliance with laws on subcontracting and the fair trade principles as well as promotion of mutual cooperation between large companies and SMEs. The contract also contains clauses on HMC’s commitment to increased support scheme for second and third tier suppliers. 14 Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report Board of Directors Ethical Business HMC’s Board of Directors (BOD) has two subcommittees including the Audit Management Committee and Recommendation Committee on Candidates for Outside Directors Promotion Activities directed by relevant Korean law on board of director composition.

The transition from an internal combustion engine to an electric powertrain is inevitable faced with the unavoidable depletion of oil and the global environmental problem of climate change. However, expansion of green vehicle market is highly dependent on the change in oil price, improvement in battery technologies and the establishment of necessary infrastructure for green vehicles. Japanese auto makers have already secured the dominant position in the hybrid electric vehicle market, and U.S. and European companies are entering the market. Most of the hybrid electric vehicles are midsized to compact sized models now. But I expect to see increased competition of hybrid vehicles in larger vehicle segments over time. The mass production of electric vehicles is on the rise with the support of many governments notably the U.S. and Chinese governments. I think a niche EV market can be established for urban commuter use. Despite increasing interest in EV, I believe hybrid electric vehicles, which has been already mass produced for many years and do not require supporting infrastructure, will lead the green vehicle market for a significant period of time in the future. This is not to say there won’t be other green cars in the market. In fact, I believe there will be many green vehicles in the market with different market share. Please tell us about HMC’s green vehicle development plan? We see competitive fuel efficiency, performance and price as key priorities for the development of green vehicles. Development of green vehicles that meet the demand of the local market is also very important. Therefore, we see development of advanced motors, inverters and batteries to enable production at an affordable price as a key factor to success as they are the core components required in all future green vehicles. We plan to concentrate on improving fuel efficiency and performance of our hybrid drive system and also develop a plug-in hybrid system for future models. We will produce a small number of BlueOn EVs for a demonstration program in 2011. We will use the demonstration program results for commercialization of EVs in the nearest possible future. We will make a concentrated effort to develop the next-generation battery system since battery performance is directly related to EV performance and cruise range per charge. HMC’s R&D on development of the FCEV will be increased as well to further improve our ability to produce core FCEV components including fuel cell stacks and other core components. We plan to produce a small number of FCEVs for demonstration in 2012 with target of full commercialization in 2015. Much investment will be made to expand the R&D team to accelerate the development and commercialization of green vehicles and relevant technologies. 35 Reducing Carbon Footprint CO2 Carbon Footprint Fuel Efficiency 204g/km 21km/L Since 2009, HMC has been calculating the carbon footprint of new models over the complete product life 186g/km cycle including production, use and disposal of vehicles. The calculation results is expressed in amount of 5% 26.2ton CO2 in tons, and the data collected reduction for calculation is used as a basis 111g/km 24.9ton 13.6km/L for reducing the carbon footprint of vehicles. 29% As of the end of 2010, we have reduction 11.5km/L calculated the carbon footprint of seven new models including the 17.6ton Equus, Tucson and Sonata. The carbon footprint of the three models was certified for the standard developed by the Ministry of Environment. Significant carbon footprint reduction has been achieved in new generation models compared to the old generation models. For instance, the carbon footprint of new generation Avante (Elantra) was 19.7 tons-CO2 which is 10.9% lower than the previous generation. Carbon Sonata footprint of the Verna (Accent) was Hybrid (2011) 18.8 tons which is 14.2% lower than the previous generation. Greater reductions were made in some models. For example, the carbon footprint of the Sonata Hybrid, Sixth released in 2011, is 29% lower than its generation gasoline engine-only counterpart and Sonata (2009) 32.8% lower compared to the previous generation Sonata. We worked with TUV Nord, an internationally recognized certification agency, for carbon footprint assessment of the Tucson ix, which was given the Fifth generation Environmental Certification. The Sonata Tucson ix also won the Design for (2004) Environment certificate from TUV.

How is HMMR responding to this new Mischenkina trend? Environmental Affairs Manager, Hyundai Motor Improving energy efficiency has become a matter of foremost importance with rise of Manufacturing Russia international oil prices and the increasing awareness of climate change. We were well aware of such trends and therefore have employed a number of facilities designed for maximum energy efficiency. Energy efficiency of heating facilities is especially important because they consume large amounts of energy. At our Russia plant, all of our flow boilers are equipped with condensing functions for a minimum energy efficiency of 95%. We are also using direct heat ovens which can utilize 100% of heat generated from fuel and does not produce any emissions. We also installed inverter type motors which run motors at variable speed depending on the workload. Improvement in indoor heating of the plant is another area on which we are focused. Our indoor temperature control system adjusts the amount of fuel burned for heating by monitoring changes in indoor temperature, instead of burning set amount of fuel. The electronic heating control system helps maintain the temperature within two degrees of the target temperature and prevents overuse of fuel. Energy consumption at the Russia plant is expected to increase significantly in 2011 as we enter full production. We will make an increased effort to improve the energy efficiency of the plant. 40 02.2 Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report environment The dwindling natural resource base presents a serious threat to our operations and the sustainability of the human race.

We recently simplified a three-rank R&D staff promotion system that consists of researcher, senior researcher, and chief researcher positions to a two-rank system that consists of researcher and head researcher positions. The new promotion system reduced pressure of promotion and allowed each to concentrate on long-term R&D achievements. Also, the promotion criteria were changed from the existing seniority-based system, which favored researchers with more experience, to an achievement-based system that favors staff with significant achievements. Improving Employee Satisfaction HMC has been assessing employee satisfaction using a customized employment satisfaction index, the ESI (Employee Satisfaction Index) developed in 2008. The employee satisfaction assessment was conducted on 25% of all employees with a total of 82 questions in 13 areas including job satisfaction, performance evaluation, compensation, and work environment.

Understanding the customer’s perspective is the most essential prerequisite for producing services and products of the highest quality. HMC will continue to uphold customerfirst management as a core principle and listen to customer opinions. Quality First Management Quality is the most important characteristic of an automobile because it directly affects customer safety. HMC recognizes that the production of vehicles with superior quality and reliability is our fundamental duty to our customers, as well as a key in raising customer satisfaction. Therefore, a strong effort in quality improvement has been made ever since the launch of the quality improvement initiative in 1999. In 2002, the quality management teams at HMC and KMC were merged into the Hyundai-Kia Quality Management Division under the direct supervision of the HMC chairman himself. In 2003, we created two new quality management units for ensuring the quality of cars exported to the North American market. The quality management and maintenance teams were also merged to ensure more effective operations. In 2004, the Global Quality Management Office was established for the purpose of responding to various quality problems reported any day of the year, 24-hours a day. Our CEO’s strong will to instill quality-first management was essential in deeply rooting the importance of quality management within the corporate culture. Currently, top executives meet twice a month to discuss quality management issues. Frequently, meetings by top executives foster a sense of shared responsibility, and have made quality a high-priority issue for all divisions within HMC including R&D, production, purchasing, financial administration and sales. In 2009, HMC launched the ‘Global Quality 3·3·5·5’ campaign aimed for ensuring our vehicles to be ranked within in top three in terms of product quality in three years and ranked within top five emotional quality in five years. The new initiative has created strong momentum for HMC’s quality improvement effort. In 2010, we also strengthened our qualityfocused marketing effort with a goal of positioning HMC as a ‘Best Buy Brand’. In addition to improving product quality from a manufacturer’s perspective, we are also improving vehicle characteristics that affect the emotional quality of our vehicles. 60 03.2 Hyundai motor company 2011 Sustainability Report Society 61 03.2 Employees Customers Suppliers Society Local Communities Improving Customer Satisfaction of the key references for consumers making and resolve identified issues. on Quality a purchasing decision on new vehicles.

As a car company, HMC is endeavoring to improve traffic safety and driving culture in order to protect children from traffic accidents. More than 80% of children involved in traffic accidents are preschool children. HMC has been operating the ‘Happy Way Drive Campaign’ since 2008, which is a traffic safety promotion program designed for preschool children by distributing angel wing-shaped ‘boarding/ unloading stickers’ on nursery and kindergarten buses to remind drivers to take extra caution around the bus and contribute to the reduction of traffic accidents. By March 2011, a total of 4,235 safety stickers (also known as the ’Angel Wings’) have been attached to preschool commuting buses. HMC also visits these nurseries to provide traffic safety education. We also appointed popular animation character ‘Poli’ as honorary ambassador of traffic safety, and it is now used on children’s safety equipment and traffic safety promotion DVDs that help children learn about traffic safety. In addition, HMC has operated a variety of Through the ‘Happy Way Drive Campaign‘, HMC distributes Angel Wingtraffic safety program for children. For example. there are the ‘Zero shaped ‘boarding/unboarding stickers‘ to nurseries and kindergartens.

It truly has become a national problem. As a car maker, Hyundai Motor India (HMI) feels obliged to take action. In 2006, HMI established the ‘Hyundai Student Traffic Volunteers Scholarship Scheme‘ to alleviate traffic situations. The volunteer corps consists of college students, and they work with local police to help manage traffic, after receiving training. The program is also designed to help bright students experiencing financial difficulties as they receive scholarships for their college tuition. The 5th Student Traffic Volunteers A college student member of Hyundai Student Traffic Volunteers Scholarship Scheme, operated by Hyundai Motors India, is controlling traffic in a busy street of Deli.

The popularity of football soared after Seung-suk Yang, President & CEO Hyundai Motor Company the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. It is a 76 HMA’s success has been extraordinary since the U.S. financial crisis. interview What do you consider the most important aspects leading to this success even in these difficult times? President & CEO John Krafcik We’ve been focused on a simple operating philosophy at HMA since 2008 that frames all of our business decisions. We call it “ABC,” which stands for ‘Assurance’, ‘Blue Drive’, and Hyunai Motor America (HMA) ‘Connection’. ‘Assurance’ represents all that we do to build trust with consumers. It’s the first step in establishing a relationship with prospective owners. We’ve expanded the idea of Assurance from our successful job-loss vehicle return program, to an umbrella program that also includes ‘America’s Best Warranty‘, our industry-leading ‘Roadside Assistance Program‘, and our strong safety and quality record. ‘Blue Drive’ represents the bold commitment we’ve made as a company to be the global eco-leader, and to lead the industry in fuel economy. This provides benefits to society and consumers alike, and has been a strong focus of our marketing and PR efforts. ‘Connection’ speaks to the efforts we’re making as a company to deliver products and services that consumers truly desire, in keeping with our ‘Modern Premium‘ positioning. HMA announced its 2025 average fuel efficiency target of 50 mpg in 2010. What would be the key measures for achieving the target? With the support of HMC senior management, HMA has set a target of at least 50 mpg by 2025. While that seems like an extraordinary goal, it is our culture at Hyundai to set ’stretch’ targets goal that we do not know specifically how to achieve, but that by their very boldness will drive us to innovative solutions that get us there. For our 50 mpg target, it helps to keep in mind how far we have already come, thanks to the engineering ABC Pyramid excellence and dedication of Hyundai’s R&D Team. Our new Elantra already achieves a corporate average fuel economy contribution of 44.4 mpg. When we consider that Elantra has an EPA mid-size car classification, and thus represents a likely mid-point of the U.S. car market in 2025, it seems well within our capabilities to take our average fuel efficiency level over 50 mpg in the next 14 years. While hybrids and electric vehicles will have some role in our lineup in the years ahead, we believe that at least 80% of our sales volume in 2025 will be powered by the internal combustion engine, but with significant enhancements. Our engineers are hard at work on improvements that will wring more efficiency out of our vehicles, that will ensure Hyundai remains the global eco-leader in fuel efficiency and GHG reduction through 2025 and beyond. Lastly, it is also important to maintain a positive relationship within the community to sustain continuous growth. How are the current HMA CSR activities in the U.S.? At HMA, we believe good things happen to companies that do good things. We’ve had a strong CSR component in our business approach for many years, but in 2010 we dramatically enhanced our efforts here with an integrated CSR, PR, and Marketing initiative related to our philanthropic focus, pediatric cancer. We call this initiative ‘Hyundai Hope on Wheels’, and it’s history stretches all the way back to 1998, when it was started by Boston-area dealer Tom O’Brien. Since then, HMA and its dealers have donated over 23 million dollars to the cause of pediatric cancer, including a record-breaking 9 million dollars in 2010 alone. September is pediatric cancer awareness month, and we dedicated over half of our media weight to a unique 30-second spot raising awareness of this terrible disease. Hyundai Hope on Wheels shows the power of working together on a cause that is bigger than our business objectives alone. By tying our dealers, our employees, and other key stakeholders together around this valued cause, we see the astonishing power of our vision and our actions. This helps make us a stronger team in all that we do. 77 Independent Assurance Independent Assurance Statement to Hyundai Motor Company Management We have reviewed environmental and social aspects of the Hyundai Motor Company 2011 Sustainability Report (hereinafter, ‘the Report’). The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of the Company. Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on emerging best practices and standards for independent assurance on sustainability reporting, including the international standard ISAE 3000 “Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the Company and included those subject matters on which we have concluded below. Assurance Procedure Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have performed interviews with management responsible for environmental, health & safety and social responsibility at corporate level, as well as at the three domestic manufacturing plants. We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to conclude with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than would be the case had an audit-level engagement been performed. Conclusions In conclusion, in all material respects, nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that: 1. Hyundai Motor Company has applied detailed and systematic methodologies and processes for the preparation of the Report, as described in the section ‘Report Profile’, in order to achieve its reporting objective. 2. Hyundai Motor Company at Headquarters level has applied detailed procedures to identify, collect, compile and validate data for 2010. Data for 2010 on Environmental Management (page 26-47), Industrial Safety and Health (pages 58-59) and Social Responsibility (pages 48-76) is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately reflected the Report. 3. Data for 2010 for Hyundai Motor Company domestic production plants has reported according to the procedures noted in item 2 above and is consistent with source documentation presented to us. Commentary Without affecting our conclusions presented above, we discussed with the management the following: • Hyundai Motor Company needs to align and coordinate its sustainability strategy and initiatives to its corporate strategy to further enhance stakeholder value. • Current sustainability performance management system needs to be updated to measure and manage sustainability initiatives.
