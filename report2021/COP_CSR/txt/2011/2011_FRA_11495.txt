The statutory auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the group’s management report. This report should be read in conjunction with and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your annual general meetings, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2010, on:  the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Groupe Steria S.C.A;  the justification of our assessments;  the specific verification required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by management. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial 6 statements based on our audit. I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31,2010 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Steria Registration document 2010 151 6 Review of financial position and results Consolidated and company financial statements II. Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:  Your group applies the “Percentage of completion” accounting method in the recognition of its revenue and profit from fixed price contracts, as set out in note 1.16 to the financial statements. We made sure of the proper application of this method by reviewing existing procedures within your group and implementing reviews, on sample basis, of contracts together with financial and operational managers.  Impairment tests on goodwill are performed using mainly future discounted cash-flows based on estimates and forecasts, as described in notes 1.4 and 1.5 to the financial statements. As part of the justification of our assessments, we made sure, based on information available, of the reasonableness of these estimates and forecasts and the resulting valuation of goodwill.  A deferred tax asset is recorded for a M€ 14.1 amount in the consolidated balance sheet based upon estimates, as set out in note 1.12 to the financial statement. As part of the justification of your assessments, we made sure, based on information available as of today, of the reasonableness of these estimates, of the overall consistency and the resulting valuation of deferred tax assets.  The group allocates a provision for its retirement benefit commitments towards its employees based on the projected credit unit method, as indicated in note 1.17 to the consolidated financial statements. As part of the justification of our assessments, we have examined the data used, assessed the actuarial assumptions retained, verified the overall consistency of these assumptions and the resulting measurements, as well as the appropriateness of the information provided in the aforesaid note. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III. Specific verification As required by law we have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

The statutory auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the management report and in the documents addressed to the shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your annual general meetings, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2010, on:  the audit of the accompanying financial statements of Groupe Steria S.C.A;  the justification of our assessments;  the specific verifications and information required by law. These financial statements have been approved by management. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. I. Opinion on the financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31,2010 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. 178 Steria Registration document 2010 www.steria.com Review of financial position and results Parent Company Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2010 6 II. Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: Your company applies the “Equity method valuation”, provided for in article L. 232-5 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) to assess its equity interest, as set out in note 1.4 to the financial statements. Valuation of its equity interests is performed using the consolidation accounting policies and methods used to establish the consolidated financial statements. To review the valuation, we relied on results of our consolidation testing performed on the group consolidated accounts as of December 31, 2010. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III. Specific verifications and information We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law. We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management’s report and in the documents addressed to the shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article L. 225-102-1 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with 6 the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from companies controlling your company or controlled by it. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.
