August 25, 2011 CEO STATEMENT As Managing Director of Iver C. Weilbach & Co. A/S, I would like to express the company’s continued support and commitment to the UN Global Compact. As a small company our ability to influence global society is limited, but by joining with other companies in this initiative we feel that a significant impact can be achieved. By renewing our commitment to the UN Global Compact we pledge to incorporate the ten principles within the areas of Human Rights, Labour, the Environment and Anti-­‐corruption into our business practices. In addition, we will collaborate with our customers, suppliers, business partners, subcontractors and other stakeholders to promote the UN Global Compact, and address potential issues in our sphere of influence. Sincerely Mr. Torben Frerks Managing Director UN Global Compact Communication on Progress In 2011, we held an internal Weilbach workshop to address the UN Global Compact’s ten principles. Amongst other things we: • Mapped and prioritized company critical issues across the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, both internally and in the value chain • Developed a strategy and determined the actions to be taken for the prioritized areas (policy, targets, performance indicators, outcomes) During this workshop it was decided that although we would address all of the ten principles, our main focus initially would be on two areas: Labour (principles 3,4,5, and 6) and the Environment (principles 7,8 and 9). These principles were deemed to be the most relevant for our company and areas where we could make the greatest impact. The UN Global Compact Management Tool and the Global Reporting Initiative have been used for guidance. PRINCIPLE 1 BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE 2 MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES Weilbach has developed a policy addressing Human Rights, which is in line with the UN Global Compact. Initially we have focused on three areas: Health and Safety, Wages and Working Hours. Our own operations are covered by Danish legislation for the Human Rights area. In addition to following legislation, we have voluntarily set up a safety team to deal internally with Health and Safety issues and provide health insurance to all our employees. We intend to inform our business partners about our policy, as well as conduct an assessment of the human rights risks within our sphere of influence. PRINCIPLE 3 BUSINESS SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PRINCIPLE 4 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY LABOUR PRINCIPLE 5 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR PRINCIPLE 6 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION Weilbach has developed a policy based on the UN Global Compact’s principles addressing Freedom of Association, the Elimination of all forms of Forced or Compulsory Labour, the Abolition of Child Labour and the Elimination of Discrimination in respect to employment and occupation. As almost all Weilbach employees are located in Denmark, they are covered by the Danish government’s legislation and requirements securing the rights of workers in regards to the above-­‐mentioned principles. In 2011, we intend to inform our business partners, suppliers and subcontractors of our policy and expectations in regards to labour issues. In addition, we will assess the risks in our sphere of influence and incorporate labour issues in our contracts and in our audit procedures. PRINCIPLE 7 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES PRINCIPLE 8 BUSINESSES SHOULD UNDERTAKE INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE 9 BUSINESSES SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPEMNT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES Weilbach has developed a policy based on the UN Global Compact principles for the environment. In 2011, we intend to inform our business partners, suppliers and subcontractors of our policy. We will also assess the risks in our sphere of influence, as well as incorporate environmental issues into our contracts and audit procedures. Weilbach’s environmental impact is limited, as we do not have production facilities. However, we are focusing on promoting environmental responsibility by reducing our energy usage in our offices, thereby reducing our environmental impact. In 2011 we decided to reduce our environmental impact internally and use: 1. New low energy lights 2. Motion sensor lights which automatically switch off lights when a room is empty 3. “Standby power” switch offs 4. Solar heat reduction film on windows (to reduce the use of air conditioning) 5. An energy consultant for assistance in better insulation of our offices We will also establish a “green team” in 2011 consisting of a group of employees working to promote internal sustainable practices at the workplace. As our environmental initiatives were put in place in 2011, we will first be able to benchmark against 2010 performance at the end of 2011. However, in the month of February 2011, we did see a reduction in our daily electricity usage by almost 5 % compared to the same month in the previous year. PRINCIPLE 10 BUSINESSES SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND BRIBERY We have developed a policy stating that we are against corruption, bribery and all forms of fraudulent behaviour. We intend to inform our business partners about our policy, as well as conduct an assessment of potential risks within our sphere of influence.
