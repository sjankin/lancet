It should be underlined the fact that the enterprise did not rise its emissions limit, but Environmental fees of VKG Oil AS Maintain cost of semi-coke deposit site taxes and fees have increased. VKG Oil AS`s constantly increasing environmental load per the price of ton of oil is illustrated with the following figure. Raw oil is considered as shale oil Environmental costs in shale oil production cost, EUR/ton which output was 270 000 tons in 2010. 30 Since 2005 the amount of environmental taxes per oil ton has increased more than two and half times, from 20 10 euros in 2005 up to 25 euros in 2011.
