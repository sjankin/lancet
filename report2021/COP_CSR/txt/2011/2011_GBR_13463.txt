1 Our Communication on Progress to the United Nations Global Compact October 2011 maplecroft risk responsibility reputation 1 About us About us As the global landscape evolves, it is imperative to navigate, manage and monitor the political, economic, social and environmental risks that affect new growth opportunities for business, especially in emerging markets. Maplecroft’s Global Risks Portfolio and services combine rigorous research with technological innovation to offer risk screens, monitoring tools and invaluable insights into the most challenging political, economic, social and environmental risks and responsibilities facing global business today. Our products and services are used extensively by leading global corporations across all sectors, governments, UN agencies and international non-governmental organisations. For example, banks use our indices and in-depth reports to screen and manage risk, corporations use our research to understand investment risk and supply chain managers use our tools for due diligence monitoring. In particular, we focus on human rights and labour standards and we are into year 5 of monitoring the human rights and labour rights landscape across all countries for: human security, labour protections, civil and political rights, and access to remedy.

Under these efforts, we have also implemented a number of new procedures aimed at further safeguarding the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees. In 2011, such initiatives included: • A confidential health survey to identify health risks affecting our employees and inform key mitigating actions around those issues. As a result of this survey, for example, we identified a number of employees had allergies to wasp and insect stings and put appropriate plans in place in case any of them suffer allergic reactions • Ongoing health screening, including workplace assessments and provision of free specialist ergonomic equipment to employees with joint or back complaints • Distribution of regular reminders to take screen breaks to promote employees’ visual health • Displaying clear safety signs throughout company offices to raise employee awareness of key safety hazards. In addition, road safety signs have also been displayed in close proximity to company property to instil safe driving practices amongst employees for their own safety and the safety of surrounding communities • A comprehensive review of fire equipment and implementation of contractual service agreements to ensure effective maintenance • Regular fire drills to formalise correct fire safety procedures throughout the organisation, as well as the carrying out of regular fire and carbon monoxide alarm testing • The designation of two qualified first aiders and the identification to all employees of first aid equipment to aid rapid and efficient medical responses in the event of an accident or emergency All of the above initiatives are subject to regular and ongoing assessment and will be updated as required.

The conference was hosted by the British Institute of International and Comparative Law and held in London at the Canary Warf offices of global law firm Clifford Chance. It aimed to “bring together experts from academia, business, government, international organisations, private legal practice and the non-profit sector, to discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with implementation of the UN Guiding Principles”. Participants at the conference, which was attended by a range of lawyers, policy makers, NGOs and academics, included: • Graham Baxter, International Business Leaders’ Forum • Susan Bird, European Commission • Ambassador Luis Gallegos, Government of Ecuador • Marie-France Houde, OECD • Benedetta Lacey, Amnesty International • Andie Lambe, Global Witness • Larrissa Loy, International Financial Corporation • Dame Meg Taylor, World Bank Group Attendance by Maplecroft was considered important for ensuring that we stay at the cutting-edge of business and human rights research and analysis. The conference was especially relevant to our work as our methodology for the Human Rights Risk Atlas is, in part, based on the UN ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ Framework and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In addition, the advice we provide to responsible business in our dilemma papers builds on the UN Guiding Principles. The conference provided expert insight into how these Principles can be implemented across different sectors, including through the actions of responsible companies (private and state-owned), which will further strengthen the work of our human rights’ team.

The GCC is aimed at promoting health and fitness within the workplace. In particular, it is aimed at tackling the health impacts of “longer workdays, sedentary occupations and little or no exercise”. Maplecroft’s participation in the 2011 GCC built on the successes of last year, when two teams of 14 employees took part in the initiative for the first time. Through the GCC, participants (organised into teams of seven) are provided with pedometers with which they record their daily step count for a total of 16 weeks (as well as swimming and bicycling activity). Participants then enter this information into a website, which adds together each individual’s step counts and converts this into a kilometre/mile distance. It then plots the team’s progression on a virtual tour of the world. This year was the most successful GCC to date, with 130,000 individuals from 1,000 organisations in 83 countries participating. During their participation in the challenge, the four teams walked 37 million steps – the equivalent of 15,821 miles. The average number of steps per day was 13,117 – the equivalent of 5.2 miles per day. This compares to the 3,500 steps that the GCC says is walked by the average worker, and the 10,000 steps a day recommended by the World Health Organisation. Amongst the Maplecroft participants: • 100% reported an increase in overall health • 58% reported an increase in energy • 58% reported an increase in their ability to handle stress • 72% reported an increase in quality of sleep • 29% reported a loss in weight (with an average weight loss of 5.9kg) In addition, the challenge has had a positive impact on staff morale, with 84% of participants reporting an increase in morale in the office following completion of the GCC.
