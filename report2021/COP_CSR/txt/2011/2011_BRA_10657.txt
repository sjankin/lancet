United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2010 Message from the Chief Executive Officer Promon is a Brazilian company whose principal characteristics include the fact that it is entirely owned by its staff. Its vigorous and authentic organizational culture is the result of the experience garnered by generations of professionals in surmounting challenges during its 50-year history. Values such as integrity, trust, respect and equity are central to its corporate culture and character. Its history evidences an incessant pursuit of innovative ways to harmonize business goals with human needs, capital with labour, value creation for clients with effective contributions to social development, competitiveness with the professional and human fulfilment of its people. We therefore believe that in addressing issues related to human rights, industrial relations, environmental management and the fight against corruption organizations can and should go beyond the indispensable adoption of policies and practices aligned with the principles of corporate social responsibility, by including the requirements of sustainability among the fundamental elements that define their culture and inserting these requirements into their goals and strategies. By continuing to support the Global Compact we publicly reaffirm our belief that companies are active agents in the process of development of society and environmental conservation, and that as such they have a role to play in the construction of a more prosperous and just society, both by example and by action.
