Reporting in accordance with GRI and progress in implementing UN Global Compact Principles The Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, first published in 2000 and most recently updated in 2011 (G3.1), provide a framework for reporting on an organisation’s economic, social and environmental performance. The Guidelines consist of Principles for defining report content and ensuring the quality of reported information together with information relating to Performance Indicators and other disclosure items, as well as guidance on specific technical topics in reporting. The following pages detail how our 2011 sustainability reporting – which can be found in our 2011 Sustainable Development Report, Annual Report and Accounts, supporting documents and website pages – is aligned to the reporting elements and the 84 indicators (of which 55 are core indicators and the remainder additional indicators) of GRI. To be in accordance with GRI, a reporter does not have to report on additional indicators. However, in the interests of transparency and comparability, SABMiller has provided a fuller account of its performance – or nonreporting – against all 84 indicators. Where our reporting is not fully in accordance with certain elements and indicators, an explanation is provided. The disclosures that we make and the performance data reported meet the requirement of the Global Reporting Initiative’s ‘B+’ application level. The grid below provides the context for this rating. To score B+, an organisation must comply with all elements of the level B grading (see table below), plus have its report assured by a third party verifier. More detail on application levels and a full description of the GRI, its aims, objectives and structure, together with the Guidelines themselves are available at www.globalreporting.org . SABMiller is committed to the ten principles of UN Global Compact (UNGC). Issue Areas UNGC Definition Principles Human Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Rights Principle 2 Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labour Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4 Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5 Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. Principle 6 Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Environment Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8 Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9 Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. AntiPrinciple 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Corruption A requirement of participation in the UNGC is that a company must publish an annual Communication on Progress (COP) to stakeholders, which sets out the progress made in implementing the principles in its business activities and, where appropriate, in supporting broader UN goals through partnerships. The COP should contain: A statement of continued support for the UNGC A description of practical actions to implement the UNGC principles Measurement of outcomes using, as much as possible, standard indicators or metrics In 2006, the GRI and the Global Compact produced guidance on how the GRI guidelines could be used assist in the preparation of the COP. The relationship between GRI and the UNGC was further strengthened in 2010 when the two organisations signed an agreement whereby the former will develop guidance regarding the Global Compact’s ten principles and issue areas to integrate centrally in the next iteration of its Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (G4). The GRI/UNGC Matrix below includes, where appropriate and in a manner recommended by GRI and the UN Global Compact, details of how particular GRI indicators and other disclosures align with the relevant UN Global Compact principles.
