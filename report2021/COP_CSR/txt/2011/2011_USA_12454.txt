In order to monitor and evaluate each dedicated staff member of TeamPeople, executive management performs performance reviews at the anniversary date of hire for individual staff members. Every employee is given the opportunity to meet with their managers annually in a formal performance review meeting to discuss their performance over the past year. During the review the employee is urged to speak with the manager about their position as well as their place within TeamPeople. TeamPeople works hard to build an environment which fosters open communication between employees and managers. The performance appraisal process is one important step in ensuring the communication gates stay open and that all employees are aware of their status here at TeamPeople. The process is also a time for the employee to ensure that their personal goals, TeamPeople mission and job duties align. Our employee’s performance review dates normally occur within 30 days of their anniversary dates but can happen at other times. Quality Assurance and Quality Control programs are of primary and paramount importance at all TeamPeople business efforts. Ultimately, the quality of the product we put forth each day is what defines us as a service provider. Quality Assurance & Control ensure that any and all concerns from clients, vendors, employees or outside parties are addressed in an organized fashion.

Industry sources such as Infocomm provide global salary surveys 3. With the assistance of our benefit brokers, AEG/TeamPeople is able to determine if our medical package is in line with the marketplace. 4.
