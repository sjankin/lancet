We first became a signatory in 2009 and did so out of the belief that the Global Compact’s ten principles truly reflect Fluor’s operating philosophies, standards and processes. We furthermore remain fully committed to sustainability in its broadest context and operate day to day on the basis that we have a responsibility to balance economic interests with those of the environment as well as with those representing the needs and interests of the communities in which we operate and serve. Our commitment to transparency is outlined each year in Fluor’s sustainability report where we utilize the Global Reporting Initiative criteria as the basis of describing our year-to-year progress. Fluor’s most recent sustainability report can be found at www.fluor.com/sustainability. David Seaton Chief Executive Officer Fluor Corporation
