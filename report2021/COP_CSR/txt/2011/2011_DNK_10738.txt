As global warming gathers pace and fossil fuel resources dwindle, the need for renewable energy has never been greater. Vestas is committed to capturing every possible wind movement and converting it in the most effective way possible to drive down the cost per kilowatt hour produced. Only by pursuing this strategy can Vestas achieve its goal of putting wind power on a par with oil and gas, as well as with other renewable energy sources. 011 Doing the maths – lowering the Cost of Energy 013 Wind power and sustainable wind turbines 014 Carbon footprint 017 Recyclability Vestas Article Doing the maths – lowering the Cost of Energy What does a wind power plant cost to the most efficient turbines at the right everything carefully, because foundabuild, run and maintain over its more price.

As a company, it aims to decrease its overall use of energy, increase its use of renewable energy, and use less carbon-intensive energy forms. Renewable energy and electricity Vestas aims to lead by example, showing other corporations how businesses can reduce their impact on the environment and spearhead the drive for a low carbon society. In 2010, it set a target for 55% of the total energy it used to come from renewable sources. For the electricity portion of its total energy consumption, the target was for 90% to be renewable electricity. In 2010 it was still not possible for Vestas to source enough ­renewable energy to meet its needs in parts of the United States, China and India. Consequently, compensation from a wind power plant established by Vestas in India is included in the figure. Renewable Electricity Certificates from the electricity produced are kept by Vestas.

In 2009, Vestas launched an updated version of its code of conduct, clearly setting out the ethical standards all its employees and representatives must adhere to. It sets the framework for the company’s work with the UN Global Compact, the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation's conventions.

Vestas customers expect Business Case Certainty. They expect power generation that will deliver as forecast, on time and to the budget they have agreed. When delivering Business Case Certainty to customers, there are a number of key issues to bear in mind: 1. Finding the right locations for wind turbines. Vestas has more than 30 years’ experience in mapping and analysing weather and site data to find the best possible turbine locations and it knows the value of engaging key stakeholders early in the process. This includes communities, wildlife organisations and local government. 2. Technology that benefits both the environment and customers. Vestas’ latest V112-3.0 MW turbine is specifically designed for low wind speed areas and can generate power at a wind speed of just three metres per second. In the future, innovations like the Smart Grid will represent a leap from disconnected power suppliers to connected national networks. A hugely more efficient way to distribute and diversify power sources. 3. The fuel – wind – is abundant and free. Wind power is competitive, predictable, independent, fast and clean. Vital characteristics that support the goal of delivering Business Case Certainty. 037 From Nimby to Yimby – Advocating the potential of wind power 039 Wildlife and Vestas 040 Wind power and public policy 041 Increasing the share of wind power Vestas Article From Nimby to Yimby – advocating the potential of wind power Surveys show that people are gener“When Vestas engages in a project, ally very positive towards wind power. we are the face of the wind industry.
