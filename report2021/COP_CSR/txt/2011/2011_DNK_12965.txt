The carpets are dyed (dyes and chemicals including acid). We also use various materials for operation, cleaning and maintenance (oil, chemicals) and packaging (cardboard and plastic carpet tubes, wrapping foil and cardboard). Herning Gram Pile: 2,909,741 kg 973,457 kg Dyeing: 101,975 kg 167,444 kg Backing: 6,900,286 kg 4,408,254 kg Operation, cleaning, maintenance: 45,155 kg 5,125 kg Packaging: 317,872 kg 203,371 kg Total: 10,275,029 kg 5,757,651 kg In Vejle, we produce yarns (carded yarns, BCF yarns, chemicals). Here we consume materials for operation, cleaning and maintenance (various chemicals and oil) and packaging (cardboard, wrapping foil and disposable pallets). Vejle Yarn: 2,781,436 kg Operation, cleaning, maintenance: 18,435 kg Packaging: 13,828 kg Total: 2,813,699 kg EN3 – Direct energy consumption Our direct energy consumption comprises natural gas and LPG at all three factories, and natural gas used to produce electricity at the combined heat and power plant in Herning. Herning Gram Vejle Natural gas: 60,297 GJ 47,508 GJ 13,348 GJ LPG: 427,756 GJ 140 GJ 28 GJ Natural gas for electricity production: 7,747 GJ Total: 495,800 GJ 47,648 GJ 13,376 GJ 24 EN3 – Direkte energy consumption EN4 – Indirect energy consumption EN8 – Water consumption Herning: 19.6 MJ per m2 of carpet Herning: 5.8 MJ per m2 of carpet Herning: 19.3 litres of water consumption Gram: 21.9 MJ per m2 of carpet Gram: 4.1 MJ per m2 of carpet per m2 of carpet Vejle: 3.6 MJ per kg of yarn Vejle: 4.0 MJ per kg of yarn Gram: 17.7 litres of water consumption per m2 of carpet Vejle: 3.7 litres of water consumption per kg of yarn EN4 – Indirect energy consumption As egetæpper does not use district heating, our indirect energy consumption only includes electricity consumption for buildings and production. Herning: 16,898 GJ Gram: 8,581 GJ Vejle: 14,967 GJ Total: 40,445 GJ EN5 – Energy savings Energy saving, projects have been undertaken in Herning and Vejle on the establishment of frequency converters and timers in the production plant, and the establishment of heat recycling and new process management in production. The savings total 1,142 GJ. EN7 – Initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption egetæpper’s indirect energy consumption consists of air travel and leased vehicles. We have not introduced initiatives to reduce indirect energy consumption. EN8 – Water consumption We use large quantities of water during production. In Herning and Gram the water comes from the municipal water supplies. In Vejle, the water comes from our own well. There is no shortage of water in any of these areas. Herning: 59,368 m3 Gram: 38,288 m3 Vejle: 10,943 m3 Total: 108,599 m3 EN10 – Water recycling In Vejle we have recycled 5,851 m3 of the water consumed, which represents 53.5% of water consumption in Vejle. This is almost 20% less than stated for the previous year, but the difference is due to a more precise measurement method. For the last financial year the measurement thus included both actual recycled water, and evaporation of the water that passes into the drying furnace with the yarn. This year, the last two factors have been deducted, so that the figure solely covers the actual recycled water volume in the last recycling station. In Herning, a smaller proportion of the water consumption was recycled, estimated at approximately 3,000 m3. This corresponds to 5% of Herning’s water consumption. In Gram, 166 m3 of the water was recycled, corresponding to 0.4% of Gram’s water consumption. This is an increase by 0.3%. This means that the ege Group has recycled 8.3% of the total water consumption at the three factories. 25 EN16 – Greenhouse gas emissions egetæpper’s direct emissions of greenhouse gases come from natural gas used in production and buildings, and to produce electricity. In addition, fuel oil is used in buildings, LPG in production, and diesel and petrol in the vehicles owned by the company. Total direct greenhouse gas emissions in 2010/2011 were 8,046 tonnes of CO2. In addition, we emitted 9,048 tonnes of CO2 as indirect greenhouse gas emissions from electricity for production and buildings, and district heating. In total, therefore, we have emitted 17,094 tonnes of CO2. The greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which has been developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute. Besides egetæpper’s three Danish factories, the CO2 emissions include data from our subsidiaries and Bentzon Carpets. EN18 – Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions Energy savings projects have been undertaken in Herning and Vejle on the establishment of frequency converters and timers in the production plant, and the establishment of heat recovery and new process management in production. The total savings achieved represent a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 73.8 tonnes of CO2. EN21 – Water discharge All process water from our factories is piped into the local water purification plant, while sanitary water is piped into the sewers. The three factories calculate water discharge slightly differently. In Herning, it is measured in m3, in Gram, it is calculated at 83% of water consumption in production, and in Vejle, it is calculated as total water consumption less dampening. Herning: 46,198 m3 Gram: 31,684 m3 Vejle: 9,073 m3 Total: 88,955 m3 26 EN22 – Weight of waste and methods of disposal We dispose of our waste using recovery, thermal recycling, deposit in land fills and destruction. Details of the material we dispose of and how we dispose of them are given in our Environmental Report. The statements from Vejle include recycled yarns received from Herning, Gram and Røjle. Herning Gram Vejle Recovery: 68,021 kg 42,002 kg 201,685 kg Thermal recycling: 931,400 kg 420,780 kg 53,000 kg Deposit as land fill: 39,740 kg 44,740 kg 0 kg Destruction: 1,420 kg 5,292 kg 0 kg Chart showing percentage distribution: 100 90 Herning 80 70 Gram 60 50 40 Vejle 30 20 10 0 Recovery Thermal recycling Refuse deposition Destruction EN24 – Weight of transported hazardous waste All our hazardous waste is transported for destruction. The term ’hazardous waste’ covers solid waste containing oil, waste oil, organic solvents, dye and paint containers, liquid latex, light sources containing mercury, accumulators and spray cans. A total of 5,292 kg of hazardous waste was transported for destruction from Gram, and 1,420 kg from Herning. There was no hazardous waste in Vejle during this period. A total of 6,712 kg of hazardous waste was transported for destruction. EN26 – Limiting environmental impacts In our Ecoline series, which consists of two carpet tile collections, 90% of the carpet fibres are recycled. For the yarn manufacturer, this means there is a 50% reduction in energy used, compared to producing new fibres. In 2010/2011, we have used a total of 13,402 kg of recycled fibres. Our ”NONO No Noise Runners” carpet collection comprises carpet runners especially developed for wooden floors where the carpet’s noise-reducing properties are important. The noise-reducing effect is due to acoustic absorption and dampening of the sound of footsteps. We recommend that our customers use the ChemDry® method to care for our carpet products. This method cleans using warm, carbonised water with no added chemicals or soap. The method uses less water than other cleaning methods in the market. Moreover, the method requires a shorter drying period, so the carpets can be used sooner after cleaning. We cooperate with EPEA and Cradle to Cradle Denmark on the introduction of Cradle to Cradle certification of selected carpet tile products. The original plan was to introduce certification during the 2010/2011 financial year, but this has proved to be a difficult process that is taking longer than expected. We are thus still awaiting feedback from a number of suppliers before we can complete the final product certification of the first carpet tile product. At the beginning of the new financial year, in cooperation with EPEA and Cradle to Cradle Denmark, we will draw up a ”roadmap” for egetæpper’s future business model for Cradle to Cradle certification. 27 Finance EC1 – Direct financial value We have reported on this indicator in the egetæpper Annual Report 2010/2011. Employee conditions LA1 – The workforce In Herning, we employ 206 people, of whom 100 are monthly-paid and 106 are hourly-paid workers. In Gram, there is a total of 61 employees, of whom 11 are monthly-paid and 50 are hourly-paid workers. In Vejle, we employ 75 people, of whom 6 are monthly-paid and 69 are hourly-paid workers. In addition, there are 11 monthly-paid workers in ege contract. This represents a total of 128 monthly-paid staff and 225 hourly-paid workers at the three factories. The overall total is 353 employees. The number of employees at the end of 2010/2011 is thus exactly the same as in the preceding financial year. All hourly-paid workers are employed full-time. Some of the monthly-paid staff are employed part-time. There are 15 part-time employees in Herning, 1 in Gram, and 1 in ege contract. LA2 – Staff turnover The staff turnover rate has more than halved over the past financial year compared to the year before, when the financial crisis forced egetæpper to make a large number of employees redundant. This year, 32 employees have left a position with egetæpper. The distribution by gender and age group is presented below.

LA3 – Employee benefits egetæpper complies with the collective bargaining agreements between the Confederation of Danish Employers (DA) and the following trade unions respectively: 3F (United Federation of Danish Workers), Dansk Metal (Danish Metalworkers’ Union), HK privat (commercial and clerical workers’ union) og Teknisk Landsforbund (the Danish Association of Professional Technicians). We offer all employee groups a 12% labour-market pension scheme, where egetæpper pays a premium corresponding to 8% of the employee’s salary and the employee pays 4%. There are also a number of employee benefits, of which the most important are a monthly bonus to all permanent employees, and healthcare insurance. We also allow employees to visit their doctor during working hours, and offer physiotherapy and staff associations, etc. 28 LA6 – Employee involvement in the health and safety committee (previously called the safety organisation) At egetæpper we have both Safety Groups and a Health and Safety Committee. The Health and Safety Committee is the decision-making body, determining guidelines for health and safety issues, while the Safety Groups work with day-to-day health and safety issues in the area they represent. Often the same people are elected to both bodies. Health and Safety Committee Safety Groups Total number % of total workforce Herning: 6 people 12 people 13 people 6.3% Gram: 7 people 7 people 9 people 14.8% Vejle: 5 people 6 people 6 people 8.0% LA7 – Industrial injuries, accidents at work, absenteeism During the past year, there have been 5 registered industrial accidents in Herning, 1 in Gram and 2 in Vejle. These have resulted in 36 sick days. or 263 hours of time lost. This is almost one third of the number of sick days and hours of time lost compared to the previous year. Sick days are registered from the first sick day. None of these accidents has resulted in permanent injury or death. In addition, there have been 9 other accidents in Herning, 1 in Gram and 1 in Vejle, which did not result in sick days. The total percentage of time lost relative to the total number of hours worked by the workforce is 0.04%. No industrial injuries have been registered during the past year. Product liability PR1 – Product assessment egetæpper is working to resolve health and safety issues throughout our products’ life cycles. In each of the following stages in a product’s life cycle we therefore evaluate the extent to which the product’s impact on health and safety can be improved. Development We assess the environmental aspects when we select raw materials and suppliers. On establishing a contractual agreement, suppliers are required to sign a document to ensure that quality and environmental specifications are fulfilled. Manufacturing We work according to DS/OHSAS 18001, which ensures employees’ health and safety throughout the manufacturing process. Marketing and sales promotion activities In our marketing, we actively use the different environmental labels carried by our products. Our marketing activities include press releases, newsletters, the company’s website and product catalogues. We also have an exhibition stand which all our subsidiaries and agents may use. The exhibition stand is designed to send a strong signal about environmental awareness at egetæpper. Storage, distribution and delivery At egetæpper we use forklift trucks to lift and move rolls of carpet. There are no obvious health and safety risks related to the storage of rolls of carpet. The distribution and delivery of rolls of carpet to carpet retailers entail certain ergonomic issues for both carpet retailers and carpet fitters. It is therefore important that the correct lifting and handling equipment is used to move the heavy rolls of carpet. egetæpper’s carpet tiles are easier to lift, transport and fit. 29 30 Use and service Our products are delivered with instructions for their fitting and care. These instructions also focus on environmental and safety issues. We recommend, for example, the use of specific types of flooring adhesive with specially low degasification into the indoor climate; EMICODE 1 in the lowest degasification class. We also recommend the Chem-Dry® cleaning method, which uses warm carbonic acid as a cleaning agent (no surfactants). This method uses less water than conventional cleaning methods. Disposal, recycling or recovery Used carpets are disposed of in different ways in different countries. In Denmark, carpets are disposed of by thermal recycling. In egetæpper’s Ecoline series, consisting of two carpet tile collections, 90% of the carpet fibres are recycled. PR3 – Product information All our products carry the CE mark, which means that they meet all relevant European legislative requirements, the objectives of which are to protect health, safety and the environment. In addition, our products are also certified according to a long series of voluntary labelling schemes, the objective of which is to protect health, safety and/or the environment. These are BRE, LEED, BASTA, the Danish Indoor Climate Label, INSTA 800, BVD3, BVB and IMO. For details, see the health and safety section. Dansk Fashion & Textile Code of Conduct Principle 11 – Animal welfare We are certain that we do not use wool from sheep that are subjected to mulesing. In New Zealand, from where we import most of our wool, sheep breeders operate according to the regulations of ”Best management practise Applicable to New Zealand Wool” (BMP), which sets out the New Zealand wool industry’s best practice and standards for wool production. According to BMP, 90% of the sheep breeders are part of a nationwide programme to safeguard quality in a large number of areas, including animal welfare, feed and water, stock keeping and the environment. However, BMP cannot be considered to be direct documentation that our wool suppliers adhere to these principles. In summer 2011 we will therefore send Danish Fashion & Textile’s Code of Conduct, principle 11 concerning animal welfare to our supplier of wool from New Zealand with an enquiry concerning how they will document that the sheep are fed, treated and culled with dignity and respect. This will be the first step in the development of a procedure and practice to ensure animal welfare in the future. Principle 12 Charity Via the ”Ege Foundation the Vibeke og Mads Eg Damgaard Foundation” annual donations to deserving causes are made from the yields on egetæpper shares. The funds are primarily donated for non-profit making activities in the local community. We have also launched a major charity and exercise project whereby egetæpper donates DKK 1 for every km that employees and their closest family members exercise in the course of the project. All of the funds go to the KidsAid Foundation, which supports sick and underprivileged children in Denmark. KidsAid transfers the funds raised by egetæpper directly to the children’s ward at Herning Regional Hospital The project’s initial target was to cover the distance around the world of 42,000 km, and this target was reached in the first quarter of the project. The project has therefore now been expanded to cover the distance twice round the world. Principle 13 Monitoring egetæpper is not subject to an external audit in connection with the management and control of compliance with the Code of Conduct, nor have we developed any practice to monitor suppliers’ compliance with the Code of Conduct. In time we will inform all our suppliers and cooperation partners that we have endorsed the Code of Conduct and we will establish a method for managing and monitoring these parties. 31 CSR in the future In the past year we have upgraded our activities in a Central Denmark Region and KompetenceMIDT, whose number of areas, as stated in the results section. But objective is to raise the level of education and prepare we will not stop here, since in a company as big as employees for future labour-market requirements. ours there is always potential for additional measures and initiatives.
